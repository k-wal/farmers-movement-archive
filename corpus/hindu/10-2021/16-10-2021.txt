16 October 2021||GURUGRAM/NEW DELHI,||Tension as man’s body found at farmers’ protest site at Singhu||Tension gripped the farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border in Haryana’s Sonipat on Friday after a man, in his early 30s, was found brutally murdered. Sarabjit, a Nihang Sikh, surrendered late in the evening, taking responsibility for the murder. Virender Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Law and Order, Sonipat, told The Hindu that his claims were being verified. “He will be formally arrested if his involvement in the murder is established,” said Mr. Singh. Earlier, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the front of farmer organisations jointly fighting against the Centre’s farm laws, distanced itself from the incident saying both the parties to the matter — the Nihang group and the deceased person, Lakhbir Singh — had no relations with it. Though the police refused to comment on the possible motive for the murder, one of the videos of the incident on social media platforms featured a group of Nihang Sikhs standing over the victim writhing in pain and the people around talking about an alleged desecration of a Sikh holy book. Lakhbir, a resident of Punjab’s Tarn Taran, was found dead, tied to the barricade with his left wrist and a foot partially severed, when a local police team reached the spot around 5 a.m. on Friday. The Kundli police station had received information that “the Nihangs had tied a person to a barricade,” said a Haryana police spokesperson. The large number of Nihang Sikhs present at the spot did not initially allow the police to remove the body, said the FIR. The body was later shifted to the Civil Hospital for post-mortem. Inspector General of Police, Rohtak Range, Sandeep Khirwar, said  there were several claims and counterclaims with regard to the involvement of a religious group but he could not confirm anything now. “The matter is under investigation,” he said. The victim sustained injuries inflicted with a sharp-edged weapon, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tension-as-mans-body-found-at-farmers-protest-site-at-singhu/article37015238.ece
16 October 2021||MANGALURU,||Book says arecanut is found to arrest growth of cancer cells||A book titled Arecanut, edited by the former Director of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) P. Chowdappa, has said that arecoline hydrobromide, a major active principle of arecanut, is found to arrest the growth of cancer cells. The book has quoted this from a recent study at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, the U.S. “In a recent study at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, USA, arecoline hydrobromide is found to arrest the growth of cancer cells. It was reported that arecoline hydrobromide inhibited the activity of the enzyme ACAT1 (acetyl-C0A acetyltransferase) which leads to attenuation of cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth in mice (Fan et al., 2016). 9.5.,” a chapter on “Biochemical constituents of arecanut and their effects on human health” in the book, said. The chapter has been written by farm scientists M. Arivalagan, Senthil Amudhan M. and K.B. Hebbar. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai released the book early this month. The chapter said: “The antioxidant activity of arecanut might play an active role in repairing DNA damage in cancer cells. While investigating the effect of aqueous and various organic extracts from different parts of Areca catechu on oxidative DNA damage in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, it was noticed that the methanol extract of eight-month-old arecanut husk showed a dose dependent inhibition of comet formation while other solvent extracts did not (Phaechamud et al., 2009).” The same chapter concluded: “Arecanut in its pure form is not dangerous but has got a plethora of medicinal properties, including curing ulcers, wounds and even cancer. Most of its folklore medicinal properties are now validated by scientific evidences. Detailed studies on the nature of active principle(s) responsible for all these properties and clinical trials on them are warranted to utilise such plant products effectively and profitably as these palms are available in plenty in most of the South and Southeast Asian countries.” Mr. Chowdappa, who is now the Vice-Chancellor, BEST Innovation University, Anantapur, told The Hindu that the book has come out at the right time when arecanut has been allegedly associated with ill-effects of human health. The book highlights the rich history of medicinal properties and scientific evidences supporting the health benefits. He said that apart from ancient Indian systems of medicine, arecanut has been widely used in clinical practices in China and other Southeast Asian countries. Hence, there is a need to conduct proper scientific research before labelling arecanut as carcinogenic. Mr. Chowdappa, who is heading the technical committee of the Arecanut Taskforce, said that rather than unnecessarily blaming arecanut as carcinogenic, let researches be done in different institutes in the country. “Let them (who are blaming it as carcinogenic) prove it with studies,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/book-says-arecanut-is-found-to-arrest-growth-of-cancer-cells/article37015551.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||TB deaths up in pandemic: WHO||The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed years of global progress in tackling tuberculosis and for the first time in over a decade, TB deaths have increased, according to the 2021 Global TB report released recently by the World Health Organization (WHO). Worse, India (41%) was on the list of countries that topped those which contributed most to the global reduction in TB notifications between 2019 and 2020. India, along with Indonesia (14%), the Philippines (12%), China (8%) and 12 other countries, accounted for 93% of the total global drop in notifications. The WHO estimated that some 4.1 million people currently suffer from TB but had not been diagnosed with it or had not officially reported to the national authorities. This figure is up from 2.9 million in 2019. There was also a reduction in the provision of TB preventive treatment. “Some 2.8 million people accessed this in 2020, a 21% reduction since 2019. In addition, the number of people treated for drug-resistant TB fell by 15%, from 1,77,000 in 2019 to 1,50,000 in 2020, equivalent to only about 1 in 3 of those in need,’’ it pointed out. In 2020, more people died of TB, with far fewer people being diagnosed and treated or provided with preventive treatment compared with 2019, and overall spending on essential TB services falling, it noted. It explained that the first challenge was disruption in access to TB services and a reduction in resources. In many countries, human, financial and other resources had been reallocated from tackling TB to COVID-19, limiting the availability of essential services. The second was that people struggled to seek care during lockdowns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tb-deaths-up-in-pandemic-who/article37015235.ece

16 October 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,||Mudumalai tiger captured after 22-day operation||After a 22-day-long operation, a tiger — nicknamed MDT23 — believed to have been responsible for the death of two herders in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and Gudalur, was tranquillised by the Forest Department on Friday afternoon. The tiger was seen along Masinagudi-Theppakadu Road on Thursday night and tracked to Masinagudi and the surrounding Singara area on Friday morning. Chief Wildlife Warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj said a single dart, fired from atop a ‘kumki’ elephant, hit the animal and subdued it around 2.30 p.m. Supriya Sahu, Principal Secretary, Department of Environment and Forests, said the tiger’s health parameters were checked by veterinarians who were part of the rescue operation. Drugs administered Medication and drugs were administered to the animal to stabilise its condition. “It is extremely weak owing to the injuries,” Mr. Niraj said. Its age apart, the tiger has suffered injuries, possibly in a territorial fight with another tiger. The tiger will be taken to a rescue and rehabilitation centre in Mysuru for further treatment. Officials said once it recovers, a decision would be taken as to whether it would be kept in captivity at Mysore Zoo or at Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai. Forest Minister K. Ramachandran lauded the efforts to capture the tiger. He said, “All three problem tigers in the Nilgiris in the last decade were shot dead. This is the first such animal that has been captured alive.” Journalists stage protest Meanwhile, media personnel staged a protest and blocked Masinagudi-Theppakadu Road after some members of the public, including children, were taken to the area of operation, while journalists were stopped on the main Masinagudi Road. The protest went on for 45 minutes, and traffic came to a standstill. After Ms. Sahu and Mr. Niraj urged journalists to call off their protest to ensure timely treatment of the tiger, it was discontinued. Ms. Sahu assured them that an investigation would be initiated into how people who were not from the Forest Department were given permission to enter the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tiger-caught-after-22-days-in-tn/article37015257.ece

His death was an irreparable loss to the party, noted a statement issued in the name of Central Committee spokesperson Abhay.

16 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Adani Group takes over airport||The Adani Group has formally taken charge of the operations and management of the Thiruvananthapuram international airport. Senior officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Ahmedabad-based Adani Group were present at the brief function held at the airport in the early hours of Thursday. Adani Thiruvananthapuram International Airport Ltd (ATIAL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd., will now operate, manage and develop the airport for a period of 50 years under a concession agreement signed with the AAI. The Adani Group, which is constructing the Rs. 7,525-crore Vizhinjam international seaport in Thiruvananthapuram district, had won the competitive bidding process for the 89-year-old airport held in February 2019. The State-run Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) and the GMR Group were the unsuccessful bidders.  The group had won the competitive bidding process in February 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/adani-group-takes-over-airport/article37015697.ece
16 October 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Centre planning to lease out Calicut airport to private sector||After successfully handing over the operation, management and development of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to Adani Enterprise Limited, the Ministry of Civil Aviation is planning to lease out the Calicut International Airport, another airport managed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), in a phased manner. Sources said the Calicut airport, which was plagued by multiple issues including land acquisition, would have to wait for the third phase of disinvestments in the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) mode till 2023. The next phase involves the leasing out of Tiruchirappalli, Indore, Bhubaneswar, Varanasi, Amritsar, and Raipur airports and clubbing each of these airports with nearby smaller airports. The pairing of smaller or non-profitable airports with profitable airports, as a package to the bidder, is to ensure integrated development of smaller and non-profitable airports with profitable airports. Previously, the Calicut airport, which is in Malappuram district, was on the list of five airports for expansion in the PPP mode. However, it was left out in the second phase of leasing out. In fact, the new rules would be based on the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament. Adani Enterprise Limited had earlier emerged as the successful bidder for all the six airports - Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, and Thiruvananthapuram for operations, management, and development for a period of 50 years. Passenger traffic AAI sources said that the Calicut airport had a commendable volume of passenger traffic but it had not mustered the leverage for commercial exploitation. Bidders usually look for lucrative non-profitable traffic operations, including maintenance and repair of flights and running hotels and malls. Calicut is not lucrative in terms of commercial space exploration since the airport handled mainly blue collar workers as well as Haj and Umrah pilgrims. The profit-making was confined to the huge expatriate population in Gulf countries. Even then, privatisation of the airport would attract foreign investment and spur development, sources said. The Calicut airport handled a total of 32.29 lakh passengers, including 27 lakh international travellers, during 2019-20 and 33.60 lakh passengers, including 27.48 lakh international passengers, in 2018-19. The average of 70 flights a day dipped owing to curtailed operations during the COVID-19 lockdown. The annual passenger traffic at Calicut would be stagnant at 35 lakh in future, sources said. Unlike the Kannur and Kochi airports, the Calicut airport did not receive the required support from the State government. In the case of the Thiruvananthapuram airport, the Adani Group has high stakes as the State capital was a catchment area with businessmen, bureaucrats, and politicians. Moreover, the group is developing the Vizhinjam International Transshipment Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-planning-to-lease-out-calicut-airport/article37014902.ece
16 October 2021||MANGALURU,||City police book kidnapping case after newborn’s parents say it is not theirs||After a complaint by parents accusing the Government Lady Goschen Hospital staff of interchanging their child, the Mangaluru North Police on Friday registered a case of kidnapping under Section 363 of Indian Penal Code. In the complaint, Mustafa Hamza, the father, said that his wife Amreen was admitted to Government Lady Goschen Hospital on September 27 and at around midnight, she gave birth to a child. As per records, it was a female child. After birth, the child was immediately taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU), he said. On October 14, when they were set to go home after the child was discharged, the hospital staff handed over to them a male child. The child handed over to them did not seem to be the one born to Amreen, he said. Mr. Hamza has asked the police to investigate the matter. Denying the charge that the child had been exchanged, Superintendent of the hospital Durgaprasad M.R. said that the health condition of Amreen was serious and the doctors decided to opt for premature Caesrean section. The child weighing 1.4 kg had breathing problems and hence, was immediately shifted to the NICU, he said. “There was an error in entering in the records the sex of child as girl instead of boy, which was born to Amreen. We deeply regret this error,” he said. Dr. Durgaprasad said that the hospital took good care of the woman and her child during their stay in the hospital. “The child given to Amreen and her husband is the one that was born to them,” he said and added that there was no question of exchange of children in the hospital, which has set high standards in women and child care in the region. He said that the child was discharged from the hospital against advice on Thursday morning. It was again brought back to the NICU unit in the evening following health complications. The test reports of the child clearly reveals that the child is a boy, he said. The police said that they will initiate a process to conduct a DNA test and check the veracity of the charge made by Mr. Hamza.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/city-police-book-kidnapping-case-after-newborns-parents-say-it-is-not-theirs/article37015555.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hasina promises action on pandal attacks||Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said her Government will deliver justice in the violence of Comilla district on October 13 that was marked by mobs targeting Durga puja pandals. The disturbances quickly snowballed into the largest communal violence in the recent history of Bangladesh and dented the spirit of Durga puja. At least 4 persons died in police firing, and several were arrested in a countrywide crackdown. “A thorough investigation is under way in the incidents in Comilla. Nobody will be spared. We are getting a lot of information about the incident. It doesn’t matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished,” Ms. Hasina said at a virtual event on Thursday during which she interacted with worshippers at the historic Dhakeshwari temple in Dhaka on the occasion of the puja celebrations. Sacrilege rumours According to the World Hindu Federation Bangladesh Chapter, the disturbances began on Wednesday when social media images depicting desecration of an Islamic holy book went viral. Soon thereafter, a mob targeted some of the prominent puja pandals in the town. On Wednesday alone, approximately 80 locations in Comilla were attacked. The worst violence took place in Hajiganj of Chittagong where the police had to open fire on a mob that had attacked a temple. Four persons died in the firing and many were injured. The incidents created a bigger law and order challenge after a minority-run organisation called to suspend immersion of Durga idols as a mark of protest on Friday. However, immersion took place peacefully across the country after the administration requested the pandals to stick to the puja traditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hasina-vows-action-on-pandal-attacks-during-durga-puja/article37015204.ece

16 October 2021||Bengaluru,||16 districts receive ‘large excess’ rainfall||In what is turning out to be a very wet October, Karnataka is seeing yet another prolonged monsoon season with over half the State receiving excess rainfall so far this month. According to data from KSNDMC, between October 1 and 13, as many as 16 districts had rainfall in ‘large excess’, which means 60% and above rainfall. Many recorded over 100% more rainfall than normal. These included Chickballapur, which had a departure from normal of a whopping 191%, Davangere (184%), Tumakuru (165%), Chitradurga (157%), Bengaluru Rural (147%), Kolar (119%), Chikkamagaluru (118%), Dakshina Kannada (115%), and Kodagu (103%). The remaining: Udupi, Shivamogga, Bengaluru Urban, Mandya, Haveri, Mysuru and Ramanagara had departures of 92% to 70%. Five districts had excess rainfall: Uttara Kannada, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Belagavi, and Vijayanagar, while six had normal rainfall. Four districts, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Bidar and Ballari, had deficient rainfall. Looking at the actual southwest monsoon period — July to September — all regions had normal rainfall, though Malnad had a –18% departure from normal, Coastal Karnataka had a –13% departure, and the State overall had –8% departure; +19% or –19% departure is considered to be normal.  Compare this with the 13-day data for October, and almost all regions — South Interior Karnataka (SIK), Malnad and Coastal — recorded large excess. While SIK has seen the largest departure: 124%, Malnad has seen a 90% departure and Coastal 85%. North Interior Karnataka is the only region which has had normal rainfall with no departure from normal whatsoever. Karnataka on the whole has recorded large excess rainfall with a 62% departure from normal. KSNDMC officials attributed the current rains to two troughs in the Bay of Bengal as well the Arabian Sea, contributing to rain since last week. “Last year too, we saw a similar prolonged monsoon,” a senior official said. In 2019 too, the monsoon had a late withdrawal in October. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had recently said that in October alone, as many as 21 people had lost their lives in rain-related incidents in October, and since June, loss of crop over 4.71 lakh hectares has been estimated. A low pressure area over the Lakshadweep area and southeast Arabian sea, and also an east-west trough is expected to result in isolated heavy rainfall over Coastal, South Interior Karnataka and Malnad districts over the next two days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/16-districts-receive-large-excess-rainfall/article37015230.ece

16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Aim is to make India a military power on its own strength: PM||Under the initiative of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the goal is to make India a military power globally on its own strength and also develop a modern indigenous defence industry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. Formally launching seven new Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSU), incorporated after the dissolution of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), he stated, “As India enters 75 years of Independence, we are completing projects that were stuck for a long time. The decision to revamp 41 Ordnance Factories, the launch of seven new companies, is a part of that journey. This decision was pending for the last 15-20 years. I am confident that these seven companies will become a major base of India’s military strength in the times to come.” Today, there was more transparency, trust, and technology-driven approach in the defence sector than ever before, the Prime Minister said. Defence exports have increased by 325% in the last five years. “While competitive cost is our strength, quality and reliability should be our identity,” he asserted. On June 16, the Union Cabinet approved a long-waited reform to corporatise the OFB, following which effective October 1, all its assets, employees and management were transferred to the incorporated DPSUs. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has converted all pending orders with the 41 factories of the OFB into deemed contracts worth over Rs. 65,000 crore for the new companies. It has also decided that 60% of the annual price of the indents would be paid by the Services to the new DPSUs as mobilisation advance against the targets of FY 2021-22 amounting to Rs. 7,100 crore. The over 70,000 employees of the OFB (Group A, B & C) belonging to the production units and also the identified non-production units have been transferred en masse to the new DPSUs on terms of foreign service without any deputation allowance initially for a period of two years. ‘Strategic asset’ Speaking at the event, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh observed that the infrastructure and skilled manpower of the OFB were an important and strategic asset of the country, but in the last few decades, “concerns have been raised regarding high costs, inconsistent quality and delay in supply of OFB products by the armed forces”. “The new structure will help overcome these various shortcomings in the existing system of OFB and encourage these companies to become competitive and explore new opportunities in the market including exports,” he noted. The seven new companies are Munitions India Limited, Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited, Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, Troop Comforts Limited, Yantra India Limited, India Optel Limited, and Gliders India Limited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aim-is-to-make-india-a-military-power-on-its-own-strength-pm/article37014845.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. slams ‘methodology’ after India’s position tanks in Global Hunger Index||The Government on Friday challenged India’s poor ranking in the the Global Hunger Index 2021 and the methodology used calling it “devoid of ground reality and facts”. The Index launched on Thursday ranked India at 101 position of 116 countries. India is also among the 31 countries where hunger has been identified as serious. India ranked 94 among 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) released last year. ‘Unscientific method’ “The publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report, Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe have not done their due diligence before releasing the report. The methodology used by FAO is unscientific. They have based their assessment on the results of a ‘four question’ opinion poll, which was conducted telephonically by Gallup,” the Ministry of Women and Child Development said in a statement. According to the Index, only 15 countries fare worse than India. They are Papua New Guinea (102), Afghanistan and Nigeria (103), Congo (105), Mozambique and Sierra Leone (106), Timor-Leste (108), Haiti (109), Liberia (110), Madagascar (111), Democratic Republic of Congo (112), Chad (113), Central African Republic (114), Yemen (115) and Somalia (116). India was also behind most of the neighbouring countries. Pakistan was placed at 92, Nepal and Bangladesh at 76 and Sri Lanka at 65. The Government has contested the performance of these neighbouring countries on the Index. “It is noted with surprise, from the FAO report ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021’, that other four countries of this region — Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka — have not been affected at all by COVID-19 pandemic induced loss of job/business and reduction in income levels, rather they have been able to improve their position on the indicator ‘proportion of undernourished population’ by 4.3%, 3.3%, 1.3% and 0.8% points respectively during the period 2018-20 over 2017-19," the statement adds. The GHI scores are based on the values of four component indicators — undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and child mortality. Each country’s GHI score is classified by severity, from low to extremely alarming. Undernourishment data are provided by the Food and Agriculture Organisation and child mortality data are sourced from the U.N. Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Child wasting and stunting data are drawn from the joint database of UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the World Bank, among others. It is the FAO report used for assessing undernourishment that the Government has questioned. This is also the only indicator in the report that has shown deterioration in India, the other three either show an improvement or have remained unchanged. Figures on the rise The Government has questioned the poll-based assessment that “has increased the value of ‘proportion of population undernourished’ from 14.0% for the previous period 2017-19 to 15.3% for the latest period 2018-20,” according to an official. According to the FAO report, prevalence of undernourishment in a population is calculated in a very scientific manner that includes habitual dietary energy intake levels, information on the population structure and median height in each sex and age.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-slams-methodology-after-indias-position-tanks-in-global-hunger-index/article37014856.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fall in stubble burning incidents in Punjab & Haryana, says panel||There is a 70% reduction so far in instances of stubble burning in Punjab and 18% in Haryana from last year, according to a report on Friday by the Commission for Air Quality Management. Last year in Punjab, there were 4,216 instances of stubble burning from September 15 to October 14. This dropped to 1,286 in the corresponding period this year. There were 487 incidents this year compared with 596 last year, a press statement by the commission claimed. In eight districts of Uttar Pradesh, there were 22 instances of burning this year compared with 42 last year. This, however, is a preliminary analysis as harvesting is still under way and the day-to-day variation in the number of fires is extremely high. Ravinder Khaiwal, who closely tracks pollution trends and its impact on health at PGIMER, Chandigarh, and monitors data from a NASA satellite that can detect thermal radiation, told The Hindu that when comparing data till October 15 in Haryana, there’s an increase in fires by 24% and till October 13 — a 30% decrease in fires. Similarly, in Punjab, a comparison till October 15 shows a reduction by 5%, whereas till October 13 it was a reduction of 67%. “Because we are far from the peak of harvesting there will be a significant variation every day and we will have to wait for a few weeks to know if there are fewer fires this year than in previous years,” he told The Hindu . Dr. Khaiwal added that he was optimistic there would be a decrease in fires this year because of a decrease in the area allotted to paddy sowing this year. “There are several initiatives taken such as the increased use of happy seeder [harvesting equipment] and the use of bio-decomposers but this will take time for results to show. Also, it is important to underline that meteorological conditions play a significant role in worsening pollution.” The CAQM made a similar observation last week reporting that a 7% decrease in the area allotted to paddy and moving crops away from the popular variety PUSA 44 (that leaves behind more stubble in its wake) along with measures by the governments of Punjab and Haryana were likely to reduce fire count instances. Over the years it has been observed that fire counts increase when there is too little time between the paddy being ready for harvesting and the right time to sow wheat. This year, excessive moisture in northern India due to an overhanging monsoon and a delay in the markets opening for trading, may further squeeze the time available for farmers to harvest and sow, further forcing them to set their fields alight. This year the major districts in Punjab that reported instances of burning were Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Patiala and Ludhiana that accounted for 72% of burning events. In Haryana, Kaithal, Karnal and Kurukshetra accounted for 80% of the instances. Of the total 1,795 sites where burning had been reported, 663 fields had been inspected by officials and fines, or “environmental compensation” as they are called, were imposed on 252.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fall-in-stubble-burning-incidents-in-punjab-haryana-says-panel/article37014873.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Former CECs flag security concerns over e-voting||Former Chief Election Commissioners (CEC) have raised a range of concerns, from maintaining secrecy of ballots to bringing political parties on board, around the idea of online voting and remote voting, at a time the Telangana State Election Commission (SEC) is set to carry out an e-voting experiment and the Election Commission of India (EC), too, is exploring remote voting. The Telangana SEC would be carrying out a smartphone app-based online voting experiment on October 20, the State Government had announced last week. The EC, on the other hand, had said last year that it was looking at the option of remote voting for those electors unable to reach the polling stations they are registered at. However, this could entail voting from another location set up by the authorities and not Internet-based voting from home. Former CEC S.Y. Quraishi said he wished the Telangana team the best, but “developing an app is child’s play”. He said the ECI had ruled out the option. “Even the simplest technology, the Electronic Voting Machine [EVM] that is based on the 17th Century calculator, is a matter of legal disputes… The technology is simple, credibility and trust in the technology is the issue,” he said. He asked if EVMs were still being challenged, how could an Internet-based system of voting be acceptable. O.P. Rawat, who was the CEC in 2018, agreed with Mr. Quraishi’s argument that if the security of EVMs that are standalone devices was questioned from time to time, then Internet-based voting would have even more critics. “It is a dicey proposition because elections are conducted with the total trust of voters, political parties, candidates and the public at large. One has to see to it that during voting, the voter ID, the environment [that is if there is any coercion], and the security of ballots cast till the time of counting are maintained,” Mr. Rawat said. He said that based on what was known about the e-voting plan publicly so far, it was not clear how verification of voter identification, maintaining a free voting environment and secrecy of ballots would be maintained. “It is near impossible,” he said. ‘Long journey’ Former CEC N. Gopalaswami was of the view that “security issues can be overcome”, but it would be “political hurdles” that would be difficult to cross. He said the EVM itself had had a long journey. “It took 10 years for the required law to be passed,” he said. On the proposal of remote voting, Mr. Gopalaswami gave the hypothetical example of a State election, say the Bihar Assembly polls, where 50,000 to 1 lakh registered voters from there live in Tamil Nadu. The voters would be registered across the 243 constituencies of Bihar and it would be impossible for the ECI to keep 243 EVMs in each of the remote voting locations, so an electronic solution would be needed, he explained. Then the issue of campaigning for outstation voters would also crop up, he said. Ultimately, it would be the political parties that would have to find it acceptable, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-cecs-flag-security-concerns-over-e-voting/article37014837.ece
16 October 2021||New Delhi,||CWC meet likely to see heated debate||A meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday may see an intense debate between the reformists and the loyalists of the Gandhi family over a range of issues, including the party’s performance in recent Assembly polls, number of desertions and the question of having a full-time party chief. The meeting comes barely a fortnight after Kapil Sibal, one of reformists or the group of 23 (G-23) leaders who had written to party president Sonia Gandhi last year to seek internal reforms, openly questioned the decision-making process in the organisation as well as the high rate of attrition. “In our party, at the moment, we don’t have a president. So, we don’t know who’s taking these decisions,” Mr. Sibal said at a press conference on September 29. This triggered a backlash. Youth Congress workers protested in front of Mr. Sibal’s private residence with messages that read “Get Well Soon”. While several G-23 leaders rallied around Mr. Sibal and condemned the protest, loyalists, including Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, former Union Minister Salman Khurshid came out in support of the Gandhis. Senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had also written to Ms. Gandhi asking for a CWC meet to discuss the state of affairs in the party, including the exodus. Though Ms. Gandhi quickly announced a CWC meet to quell the Congress versus Congress story, the debate is likely to continue in the party’s highest decision making forum. Apart from the leadership issue and desertions, some of the G-23 leaders are also wondering if the CWC would discuss the reports on why the party fared poorly in the last round of Assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Puducherry. After these polls, Ms. Gandhi, in May, constituted a five-member committee under former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan to examine the reasons. Though the panel submitted its reports in June, they have neither been discussed in any party fora nor made public. “Are these reports also going to go the A.K. Antony report way? So far, we have been great at brushing everything under the carpet,”a senior party member had told The Hindu , referring to the report authored by Mr. Antony, who probed the reasons for the party’s 2014 Lok Sabha debacle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cwc-meet-likely-to-see-heated-debate/article37014847.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bhutan, China sign MoU for 3-step process to expedite boundary talks||In a step towards resolving their boundary disputes, Bhutan and China signed an agreement on a three-step roadmap to help speed up talks, at a meeting of Foreign Ministers held via videoconference on Thursday, a development that New Delhi said it has ‘noted’. The roadmap “for Expediting the Bhutan-China Boundary Negotiations”, is expected to kickstart the progress on the boundary talks process that has been delayed for five years, first due to the Doklam standoff in 2017 and then by the pandemic. The timing of the agreement is particularly significant for New Delhi, given the border talks on their 17-month old standoff at the Line of Actual Control appear to have hit an impasse this week. “The [Bhutan-China] Memorandum of Understanding on the three-step roadmap will provide a fresh impetus to the boundary talks. It is expected that the implementation of this roadmap in a spirit of goodwill, understanding and accommodation will bring the boundary negotiations to a successful conclusion that is acceptable to both sides,” said a press release issued by Bhutan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Bhutanese Embassy in Delhi declined to comment on the details of the three steps and sources said information on the process of negotiations is ‘sensitive’ and could not be shared at this stage. According to the MFA statement, the roadmap had been finalised during the 10th expert group meeting in Kunming in April 2021, and presented for approval to their Governments in Thimphu and Beijing respectively. The Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to a question from The Hindu about whether India was informed about the details of the MoU in advance, and whether a possible ‘exchange’ of disputed territories involving the Doklam trijunction area was a particular concern for India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhutan-china-sign-mou-for-3-step-process-to-expedite-boundary-talks/article37014865.ece
16 October 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Himachal bypolls: BJP and Congress in a direct fight||Himachal Pradesh is all set to see a direct fight between the ruling BJP and the Congress party in the bypolls to one parliamentary and three Assembly seats, slated to be held on October 30. In the hill State, the bypolls are being seen as a “critical test” to ascertain the BJP government’s performance and popularity and the Congress’s preparedness to pose a challenge to the ruling party ahead of the Assembly polls, due next year. The battle for the Mandi Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant after BJP MP Ram Swaroop’s death, is being keenly watched as Mandi happens to be the home turf of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and the BJP has a challenge to retain the seat. The Congress has fielded former MP Pratibha Singh, wife of former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, from Mandi and is seeking sympathy votes in the name of the late politician. The BJP has named Brigadier Kushal Chand Thakur (retired), a recipient of Yudh Seva medal, as its candidate. Ambika Shyam of the Rashtriya Lokniti Party, Munshi Ram Thakur of the Himachal Jankranti Party and Independent candidates — Anil Kumar and Subhash Mohan Snehi — are also in the fray. Development issues As the electioneering is gradually picking up, the Congress party led by state president Kuldeep Singh Rathore has been attacking the BJP on “rampant corruption, inflation, unemployment, lack of development” among other issues. The BJP on the other hand is banking on its “credible performance” during the past four years of its governance. The Chief Minister, who has been leading the BJP’s campaign, asserts that the State has witnessed an uninterrupted pace of overall development. The three Assembly constituencies are Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai. Arki in Solan district and Fatehpur in Kangra district were won by the Congress party and Jubbal-Kotkhai in Shimla district was won by the BJP in the 2017 polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/himachal-bypolls-bjp-and-congress-in-a-direct-fight/article37014841.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Compassion cannot be forever, says SC||Compassion cannot continue in perpetuity, the Supreme Court said in an order holding that Kashmiri migrants who retired as government officers cannot stay in official accommodation indefinitely. The order was passed by a Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and A.S. Bopanna in applications filed by retired officers occupying government accommodation in Delhi and Gurgaon. Some of these officers had been victims of terrorism and served in critical intelligence offices. “Applicants are occupying the government accommodation at the cost of other government servants. The compassion shown to Kashmiri migrants has to be balanced with the expectations of the serving officers to discharge their duties effectively,” the recent order said. The court struck down as arbitrary an office memorandum allowing government accommodation to retired employees who were Kashmiri migrants. It said post retirement, the government employees, including Kashmiri migrants, were granted pensionary benefits including monthly pension. The classification made in favour of government employees who were Kashmiri migrants stood on the same footing as that of other government employees or public figures. Reasonable clause The court said statements like these employees would return to the Valley when the situation improved was “open-ended statement capable of being interpreted in different ways”. However, the court found it reasonable that Kashmiri migrants were allowed government accommodation for a period of three years from the date of retirement so as to make alternative arrangements within such period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/compassion-cannot-be-forever-says-sc/article37014858.ece
16 October 2021||Srinagar,||Prayers disallowed at Srinagar mosque||The Anjuman Auqaf, a caretaker body of historic Jama Masjid, on Friday said the police locked up the mosque and dissuaded worshippers from offering the congregational noon prayers, days after the J&K administration allowed a major congregational prayer at the Khawaja Naqshband shrine in the city. “The authorities did not allow congregational Friday prayers at the Jama Masjid, as heavy deployment of forces was carried out since morning. When the Auqaf employees opened up the gates of the mosque, the police personnel forced them to close all the gates and no ‘namazis’ were allowed inside,” a spokesman of the body said. A number of worshippers, including women and children, had gathered outside the mosque after the Auqaf announced they would re-open it. “Earlier, the pretext of pandemic was employed to prevent Muslims from offering Friday prayers at Jama Masjid. It stands completely exposed today,” it said. The chief cleric of the mosque is Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who also heads a faction of the Hurriyat. Mr. Farooq has been under house arrest since August 2019 and disallowed to lead any prayers at the mosque.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prayers-disallowed-at-srinagar-mosque/article37014861.ece
16 October 2021||New Delhi,||All issues sorted out, says Sidhu||Punjab Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday claimed that “all the issues have been sorted out” after a meeting with former party chief Rahul Gandhi at the latter’s residence. All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) Punjab in-charge, Harish Rawat, who was also present in the meeting, claimed that Mr. Sidhu has assured Mr. Gandhi about withdrawing his resignation as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief. “He [Mr. Sidhu] shared his concerns with Rahul Gandhi. We have told him that his concerns will be taken care of. He assured Rahul Gandhi that he has withdrawn his resignation and he will resume his duties as the PCC president,” Mr. Rawat told reporters. Mr. Sidhu, though, somewhat remained ambivalent. “Whatever concerns I had, I have shared with Rahul ji and everything is sorted out,” Mr. Sidhu told reporters after his meeting. Asked if he would continue in his post as PCC chief, he said, “Whatever I am doing is in front of you.” Subsequently, he tweeted, “I have shared my concerns with @RahulGandhi Ji, was assured they will be sorted out.” This was the first meeting between Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Sidhu after the Punjab Congress chief sprang a surprise on September 28 by posting his resignation on Twitter to protest against certain government appointments by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi. On Thursday, Mr. Rawat, Mr. Sidhu and Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal, had an hour-long meeting, following which Mr. Sidhu had said he had full faith in the leadership of the Gandhis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-issues-sorted-out-says-sidhu/article37014863.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||India opens to foreign tourists; too late, says travel industry||The government’s decision to issue fresh tourist visas for those arriving on charter planes from Friday has received a tepid response from the travel industry, which says the move has come too late to help reap any benefit during the travel season. “Unfortunately, charter operations in Europe are planned six to eight months in advance and we are already booked for destinations like Dominican Republic, Mexico, Maldives and Kenya. India is very late in opening itself to foreign tourists, and it is unlikely that at this stage there will be a sudden influx of foreign tourists,” J.J. Singh, president, Indo-Polish Chamber of Commerce and Industries, and president of IATA Travel agents in Poland, told The Hindu from Warsaw. According to a DGCA official, by Friday they had only received a few queries on charter operations but there were no formal applications for chartered flights. He said they were waiting for detailed guidelines to seek greater clarity on important issues such as RT-PCR tests for arriving passengers. While the government has said that from November 15, foreign tourists entering into India by flights other than chartered aircraft will be issued fresh visas, travel and tour operators have been left flummoxed. “The government has provided us with bullets, but there is no gun to use them. How will tourists come into India if the government doesn’t restart scheduled international flights,” Subhash Goyal, chairman, Stic Travels, said. India allows international travel only with 28 countries with which it has signed air bubble agreements. “The decision shows that the government is not opening up with confidence. Without opening international flights, the government will fail in encashing the tourism season and helping the industry to revive,” said Jyoti Mayal, president, Travel Agents Association of India. Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism, Arvind Singh, told The Hindu that in the beginning the government planned to issue visas only to those who arrive from one of the 28 countries with which India had air bubble agreements. Sources also said that the Ministry of Civil Aviation could hold consultations to expand air bubbles to more countries as well as increase the number of flights with those it already had bubble tie-ups depending on the travel demand. “We welcome the decision announced by the government. However, it should be accompanied with opening up of commercial international flights as well as back-end work for e-visa documentation so that people don’t face bottlenecks,” said Ashish Gupta of The Federation of Associations of Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-opens-to-foreign-tourists-too-late-says-travel-industry/article37014875.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Bhagwat calls for more vigilance along borders||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Friday stressed the need for the country to remain militarily vigilant at all times against the backdrop of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. It was imperative to shore up security along the country’s borders and the nation needed to be careful and “prepared for all possibilities”, he stated. “We know what their [Taliban’s] past character is. Sometimes they say they have changed; at other times they say they are still the same. This is a clear signal for us to be very careful. And while the Taliban may have changed, has Pakistan changed? Has China changed its intentions towards India? Even considering the possibility of a change in heart, and of dialogues meant to resolve issues, we still need to be prepared and remain ever vigilant,” he said. The RSS Sarsanghchalak’s made these remarks during his annual Vijayadasami speech at the Sangh headquarters in Nagpur. He contended that while the people of Jammu and Kashmir were reaping the benefits of the scrapping of Article 370, there was a pressing need for Kashmir’s public to be “emotionally integrated” with the rest of the country. Terrorism in J&K “After Article 370 was done away with, the fear or terrorists had been banished form people’s minds. However, terrorists have again begun ‘targeted killings’ of citizens, especially those in among the Hindu community, in a bid to destroy their morale and re-establish the reign of terror in the Valley. The administration needs to expedite its efforts for finishing off terrorist activities,” he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhagwat-calls-for-more-vigilance-along-borders/article37014850.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Hasina promises action against pandal attacks||According to the World Hindu Federation Bangladesh Chapter, the disturbances began on Wednesday when social media images depicting desecration of an Islamic holy book went viral. Soon thereafter, a mob targeted some of the prominent puja pandals in the town. The police department has faced criticism for not acting on receiving first complaints. Fuelled by social media, the violence spread fast to other parts of Bangladesh. On Wednesday alone, approximately 80 locations in Comilla were attacked. The worst violence took place in Hajiganj of Chittagong where the police had to open fire on a mob that had attacked a temple. Four persons died in the firing and many were injured. The incidents created a bigger law and order challenge after a minority-run organisation called for a pause in the immersion of Durga idols as a mark of protest on Friday. However, immersion took place peacefully across the country after the administration requested the pandals to stick to the puja traditions. Dhaka, which organised Durga puja in 238 pandals, also witnessed some anxious moments on Friday when a large crowd gathered outside the Baitul Mukarram mosque and began protesting against the reported incident of sacrilege. However, the police dealt with the crowd and arrested at least five persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hasina-promises-action-against-pandal-attacks/article37014851.ece

Condemning the murder, the SKM said it was against the sacrilege of any religious text or symbol, but no one had the right to take the law into their own hands. It demanded that the culprits be punished in accordance with the law. Although Nihang warriors have frequently been seen around the Singhu main stage area, farm leaders said they had no official role and had never been a part of the meetings or decision-making of the movement. “You must understand that this is not a kisan group. The Nihangs are a religious group, not a farmers’ union. They have a separate camp, and the incident has happened within their own camp,” said All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah. He also warned against attempts to link the murder to the SKM, calling it a “conspiracy”. Farmers and Nihangs at the protest site expressed shock, but there was also a sense of anger over the alleged act of sacrilege committed by the victim. Bhagwant Singh, a Nihang, claimed it was not possible to identify who killed the man as everyone was angry and he was killed in the heat of the moment. Probe sought Former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal demanded a fair and impartial probe into all angles of the “heinous crime, including the brutal murder and allegations of sacrilege of the holy Sikh scripture.” “Allegations that the entire sequence of events is a part of a deep-rooted conspiracy to sabotage the peaceful struggle of the farmers against the three black laws also need a fair probe,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tension-grips-protest-site-after-body-found/article37014852.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||TB deaths up in pandemic: WHO||In 2020, more people died of TB, with far fewer people being diagnosed and treated or provided with preventive treatment compared with 2019, and overall spending on essential TB services falling, it noted. It explained that the first challenge was disruption in access to TB services and a reduction in resources. In many countries, human, financial and other resources had been reallocated from tackling TB to COVID-19. The second was that people struggled to seek care during lockdowns. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus observed in a release, “This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis. This is an alarming news that must serve as a global wake-up call to the urgent need for investments and innovation to close the gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for the millions of people affected by this ancient but preventable and treatable disease.” TB services are among many others disrupted by COVID-19 in 2020, but the pandemic’s impact on TB has been particularly severe. Approximately 1.5 million people died from TB in 2020 (including 2,14,000 among HIV positive people). Huge burden The increase in the number of TB deaths occurred mainly in the 30 countries with the highest burden of the disease. WHO modelling projections suggest that the number of people developing TB and dying from the disease could be much higher in 2021 and 2022. “Challenges with providing and accessing essential TB services have meant that many people with TB were not diagnosed in 2020. The number of people newly diagnosed with TB and those reported to national governments fell from 7.1 million in 2019 to 5.8 million in 2020,” the WHO disclosed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tb-deaths-up-in-pandemic-who/article37014853.ece

16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mridul Agarwal tops IIT entrance examination||Mridul Agarwal from Jaipur has scored 96.6% to become the common rank list topper in the JEE Advanced examination, which is the entrance test for the Indian Institutes of Technology. Kavya Chopra of Delhi was the only girl in the top 100, scoring 79.4% and achieving the 98th spot on the common rank list. Almost 30% of the 1.4 lakh candidates who attempted the exam qualified this year. However, only 15% of the 41,862 students who qualified were girls. This year’s students had a rocky road to the JEE examination, with their education over the last year and a half having been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic which forced school closures, exam delays and even cancellations. However, Mr. Agarwal said the lockdown was “an unexpected blessing” for him, even though it led to schools being closed. “Since there was no need for a commute, there was time saved as I did not have to travel for school or coaching classes as both were online. I actually found there was less pressure, and it gave me time to develop sharper skills,” he said. Mr. Agarwal plans to study Computer Science in IIT and then travel abroad for further studies, but his long term ambition is to contribute to building India’s own education sector, so that Indian students don’t have to leave the country. Ms. Chopra also intends to specialise in Computer Science, preferably at IIT Delhi, and hopes that campus life will resume as quickly as possible in the post-COVID era. From her own observations of her classmates, she offered a perspective on why fewer girls succeed in entering the IITs. “I have seen this repeatedly in my coaching class, that often when girls make a mistake, they get anxious, associating it with their self-worth. Many of them think, ‘I am a failure, I can’t do anything.’ But most of the boys just think they have made a mistake and look how they can correct it and learn from it,” she said. Although girls do well in the CBSE board exams, she felt that the better quality of questions in the JEE, as well as the focus on science and maths alone amplified the anxiety often experienced by girl students. Only 19% of female candidates qualified this year, in comparison with 30% of the boys.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mridul-agarwal-tops-iit-entrance-examination/article37014877.ece
16 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||BJP, ally go one up in byelections in northeast||A regional party has opened the byelection account for a forum fronted by the BJP in the northeast by winning an Assembly seat uncontested in the Opposition-less Nagaland. Byelections to nine Assembly seats in the northeastern region will be held on October 30. Five of these are in Assam, three in Meghalaya and one in Mizoram. Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) candidate S. Keoshu Yimchunger was declared elected to the Shamator-Chessore constituency unopposed on October 13. The NDPP rules Nagaland in alliance with the BJP and the Naga People’s Front (NPF), which joined the government after three years in the Opposition. The NDPP now has 21 MLAs in the 60-member House, while the NPF has 25 and the BJP 12. There are two Independents, also a part of the government. In Meghalaya, the United Democratic Party (UDP), another regional ally of the BJP, has pinned hopes on the “scoring skills” of footballer Eugeneson Lyngdoh to deliver the Mawphlang seat. Mr. Lyngdoh, a midfielder who played for India and last appeared for the Kolkata-based East Bengal club in the Indian Super League, is the son of Syntar Kas Sunn, the UDP legislator whose death necessitated the byelection for Mawphlang. His main rival is expected to be Kennedy C. Khyriem of the Congress. The National People’s Party (NPP), which heads the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance government as the single largest party, has lent support to Mr. Lyngdoh. It is contesting the other two seats — Mawryngkneng and Rajabala — where its main rival is the Congress.   K. Laldinthara, the BJP spokesperson in Mizoram and a former student leader, is the poorest of the four candidates in the fray for theTuirial Assembly seat. According to his affidavit, he has Rs. 5.5 lakh in movable assets and has no immovable property. All of his three rivals — Chalrosanga Ralte of the Congress, K. Laldawngliana of the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) and K. Laldinthara of the Zoram People’s Movement (ZPM) — are millionaires.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-ally-go-one-up-in-byelections-in-northeast/article37014885.ece

The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) accused the Centre of impugning the rights of Punjab and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) termed it a direct attack on the federal structure of the country. ‘BJP, Cong. conspiracy’ SAD leaders and workers on Thursday staged a protest near the Governor House against the decision. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that the BJP and the Congress have both colluded to hatch the anti-Punjab conspiracy. Mr. Badal said this was the second time that the Centre had impinged on the rights of the State. “The Centre has discriminated against the farmers of the State by bringing in the three farm laws. Now it is effectively taking control over law and order over half of the State by extending the jurisdiction of the BSF,” he said. He termed the move an attack on the federal structure. “The SAD will fight to right this wrong as we stand for a genuine federal structure.” He charged Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi with selling off the interests of the State and the government of not mounting an effective opposition to the new measure, which was condemnable. Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema of AAP stressed that Mr. Channi should convene an all-party meeting and call for a delegation to meet the representatives of the Central government. ‘Roll back decision’ He demanded a special session of the Assembly to condemn and pass a resolution seeking a rollback of the decision. An unannounced emergency like situation has been created. “Earlier also, the Union government had enacted agriculture laws without the consent of the States, thus robbing them of their rights,” Mr. Cheema added in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sad-aap-slam-enhancement-of-bsfs-range/article37014868.ece

At the meeting, officials discussed the roles to be played by various agencies, equipment required for preventive measures, other resources to be deployed and the structure of the unit. CSG ADGP Sandeep Mittal told The Hindu , “Marina beach is actually not fit for water fun. The profile of the beach is very steep. Because of the peculiar topography, the currents can be very dangerous, and even the best of swimmers cannot survive at times.” “On an average, every year, 100 people drown and most of them are aged between 21 and 24. Most of them enter the sea due to peer pressure. We have requested the Director of the National Institute of Ocean Technology to conduct a feasibility study of the beach and identify such dangerous areas,” he said. Collaborative effort The lifeguard unit, to be headed by an Inspector of the Coast Guard, will consist of personnel from the Coastal Security Group (CSG) and Fire and Rescue Services. A dozen fishermen will also be part of the unit on a contract basis. Five watchtowers will be erected on the beach, and caution boards will be set up at several places. Two 108 ambulance vans will be stationed with the unit. As many as 50 police constables of the Armed Reserve unit will be deployed additionally after training on life-saving skills and swimming.

16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin writes to 4 CMs against ban on crackers||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday wrote to his counterparts in Delhi, Haryana, Odisha and Rajasthan, urging them to reconsider the blanket ban on the sale of firecrackers in their respective States. He also requested them to permit the sale of firecrackers that fell within the norms set by the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal. The firecracker industry is concentrated around Sivakasi in southern Tamil Nadu, and about eight lakh workers are involved in it for their livelihood. Stating that it was the largest in the country, the Chief Minister referred to reports that the four governments had imposed a ban on the sale of firecrackers during the festival. “I understand that you have taken this decision based on concerns regarding air pollution. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Supreme Court has already banned certain categories of polluting firecrackers, and now, green crackers, with significantly less emissions, are being manufactured. Therefore, a blanket ban on firecrackers is not reasonable. Such a ban is not prevalent in other countries,” Mr. Stalin said. Moreover, such a ban, if imposed by other States, will lead to the closure of the entire industry, jeopardising the livelihoods of around eight lakh people, Mr. Stalin said, adding that the bursting of firecrackers was an integral part of Indian festivals, especially Deepavali. “A balanced approach that gives due regard to the environment, livelihood and public health is possible and necessary,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the COVID-19 pandemic had a crippling effect on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector in the country, and the impact on Tamil Nadu’s economy, which is largely dependent on the MSME sector for growth and employment, had been severe. “My government is now in the process of reviving the sector through focused interventions,” he added.

16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Man who burgled corporate offices arrested||The police recently arrested a 57-year-old burglar, who targeted only corporate offices in the city. Last week, the habitual offender, who had more than 20 cases against him, broke into an office of a lead manufacturing firm on Harrington Road, Chetpet, and decamped with Rs. 72 lakh in cash. The Kilpauk police began investigating, following a complaint from a representative of the manufacturing firm on Sunday. An unidentified person entered the premises through the main door and took away the cash kept in a steel bureau, using a key that was left in a file. A special team of police personnel, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Kilpauk, K. Ramesh, analysed CCTV camera footage from various places in Nungambakkam, Chetpet and Egmore. After intensive investigation for three days, the team caught V. Pandurangan, of Kovilpatti, at a star hotel in T. Nagar in the early hours of Thursday. The accused was a school drop-out and was first arrested three decades ago. In prison, he got himself acquainted with a habitual offender, Kumar, and on his guidance, learned to burgle, targeting only swanky corporate offices in the city. Since then, he burgled 21 places and was convicted in 14 cases besides being detained under Goondas Act. The police said Pandurangan stayed at a lodge in Triplicane and reconned the corporate offices. He entered the premises by opening the main door using a screwdriver. Mr. Ramesh said, “We zeroed in on his whereabouts after analysing the CCTV camera footage. He had moved from the lodge to the star hotel after he got the booty. We apprehended him at gunpoint at the hotel.” The police recovered Rs. 60.70 lakh from him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-who-burgled-corporate-offices-held-rs-60-lakh-recovered/article37015325.ece
16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vegetable prices skyrocket in Koyambedu this festive season||The cost of some of the staple vegetables, particularly tomatoes and onions, have skyrocketed at the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex this festive season. Incessant rains in major vegetables producing States and shortage in supply has led to the towering prices for the past few days, traders noted. On Friday, a kilogram of tomatoes was priced Rs. 60-Rs. 65. Similarly, the price of onions had jumped to Rs. 45 a kg. Wholesale traders noted that the dip in arrivals from neighbouring States, such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, had sent the price of tomato spiralling for the past few days. The market, which is a hub for perishable goods, received only 60-70% of its usual supply. Stocks diverted Moreover, the available stock of tomatoes was also being diverted to Kolkata during the festive season. Wholesalers expect the price to drop by Rs. 10-20 a kg next week. G.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Associations of Koyambedu Periyar Market, said the market received nearly 3,500-4,000 tonnes of vegetables, which was about 1,000 tonnes short of the usual supply. Sales at the wholesale market was dull on Friday as there were less takers due to the holidays. “We must have more cold storage facilities in the city and peripheral areas for local produce in order to control prices during periods of shortage,” he said. The supply of onions was also lacking as only 50% of the trucks with onions from Maharashtra arrived at the market. P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association, said: “We are managing with onion stock from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Similarly, prices of some vegetables like carrots, beans and small onions have also shot up close to Rs. 50 a kg. It may take a few more days for the cost of vegetables to stabilise.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vegetable-prices-skyrocket-in-koyambedu-this-festive-season/article37015293.ece
16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IMD predicts rain on weekend||Many places may get rain over the weekend with the India Meteorological Department predicting an increase in rainfall due to prevailing weather systems and convective activity. A low-pressure area lay over west-central Bay of Bengal and northwest Bay of Bengal, off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coast. Though this may not have direct impact over the State, an associated east-west trough running across south peninsular region would bring fairly widespread rain till Monday, officials said. On Friday, places such as Santhome and Adyar in Chennai received rain. N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, said another low-pressure area over southeast Arabian sea, off the Kerala coast, is expected to move inland on Saturday. This would result in rain over Western Ghats. While one or two places in the Nilgiris district are likely to receive very heavy rain on Saturday, thunderstorms with isolated heavy rain is possible over nine districts, including Theni, Salem, Cuddalore and Erode. Many other places in north Tamil Nadu would experience thunderstorms with moderate rain. On Sunday, one or two places in districts such as Madurai, Tiruchi and Pudukottai and delta region may get heavy rain. There would be a dip in rain from October 18, he said. With the interaction of southeasterlies from the sea and northwesterlies and with day temperature staying slightly above normal at around 34-35 degree Celsius, some localities in Chennai may receive light to moderate rain due to convective activity, the officials said. During 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. Friday, Uthiramerur in Kancheepuram district, Vembakkam in Tiruvannamalai district and K.M. Koil in Cuddalore district received 8 cm rain, which is the day’s highest rainfall in the State. With the low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal likely to bring rain over some States, southwest monsoon may take another week to retreat from the country completely, officials added. Water released Meanwhile, water released from Poondi reservoir into Kosasthalaiyar river reached Tamaraipakkam check dam, which is 15 km downstream of the reservoir, on Friday. About 580 cusecs of water is being released from Poondi reservoir that has nearly 87% of its storage capacity. Built in 1868, the structure in Tamaraipakkam plays a crucial role in storing and diverting surplus water to Cholavaram reservoir for drinking water supply to Chennai city. About 220 cusecs of water flowed into Cholavaram lake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/imd-predicts-rainfall-over-weekend/article37015321.ece

16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I relish participatory film-making, says Leena||Film-maker Leena Manimekalai’s Maadathy: an Unfairy tale , a story about sexual assault suffered by a young Puthirai Vannar girl from men from another Dalit caste more dominant, said that she relishes “participatory film-making,” at an online screening of her much-talked about film organised by the Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies unit of the University of Minnesota on Friday. Speaking about her film, Ms. Manimekalai said she wanted to be a medium to tell stories of people she empathises with. “When I see (films from) mainstream industry, I see nothing about my people. So since 2002, I took a small digital camera, cheap microphones and pirated editing tools and went to villages, spoke to people and told the truth that I found to the rest of the world. In 2003, I made my first short documentary, Mathamma . In my first feature Sengadal , I told the story of refugees… refugees played refugees, the fisherfolk played the fisherfolk and I played the documentary film-maker. I started to relish participatory film-making. I was trying to erase myself and be a medium to tell stories of people I empathised with,” Ms. Manimekalai said. She went around 40 villages in Tirunelveli and met men, women and elders to understand their stories. She adapted Anavan Kudiyiruppu near Papanasam to set the film. “Murthy ayya, the first generation graduate Puthirai Vannar who also retired as a government employee, gave me access to the community. I interviewed them, wrote several drafts but told them that I cannot tell stories without you. Puthirai Vannars are Dalits within the Dalit community. They are unseeables. While for the main characters, we had to bring in actors, for other characters, the people from the village played them. They were giving creative inputs, ran the production, took care of us and carrying the film equipment. They protected us,” she said. The film’s co-producer, Bhavana Goparaju, said she was compelled to tell stories that are not being told in the mainstream film industry. “It has been challenging. As a writer in the Indian film industry I have been experiencing a few challenges, which led me to get into production. I believe in telling stories that are unheard yet. I have been an activist and I feel that I have the privilege to have opportunities and pursue it. I wanted to break the glass ceiling,” she also said. The discussion was moderated by Roja Suganthy-Singh of St. John Fisher College, who also runs the Dalit Solidarity Network in the U.S.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-relish-participatory-film-making-says-leena/article37015319.ece

16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Janaki Ramachandran gifted AIADMK headquarters land||The property, housing the AIADMK’s headquarters on Lloyds Road or Avvai Shamugam Salai at Royapettah, was gifted by Janaki Ramachandran, former Chief Minister and wife of party founder M.G. Ramachandran, during the 1980s. Measuring 10 grounds, the property was donated by Janaki Ramachandran to her husband in mid-1987 before she accompanied him to the U.S. for treatment, says Kumar Rajendran, advocate and grandson of P. Narayanan, brother of Janaki. Eventually, the land and the building were given over to the party. Shifted to T. Nagar She had purchased the property in the 1950s. It was used briefly to accommodate the office of the South Indian Artistes Association, popularly called Nadigar Sangam, before the Sangam’s office moved to T. Nagar, recalls Mr. Rajendran, who has authored the publication, Janaki MGR: Naadanda Mudhal Nayaki . Challenging the order of the Additional District Magistrate and the Chennai Collector’s Personal Assistant (General) to assign the property to Jayalalithaa’s group, Janaki Ramachandran submitted in the Madras High Court in 1988-89 that she was entitled to its possession as she purchased the property in 1957 and gifted it to the party in July 1987. Mr. Rajendran says his grandfather had even converted the property into a marriage hall, which was named after the mother of MGR, Sathya. It was from 1973 that the property came to be used as the AIADMK headquarters, he adds. Sealed after the split For a brief period in 1988, the property was sealed when the AIADMK split. Though Janaki Ramachandran secured a favourable order on the property in late January 1989, the groups led by her and Jayalalithaa came together in a couple of weeks. The property came under the full control of Jayalalithaa. In 1997, the front elevation underwent a change at the initiative of Jayalalithaa, says K. Mahalingam, who worked as an aide to MGR during 1972-87. In recent months, J.C.D. Prabhakar, a member of the party’s steering committee and two-time Villivakkam MLA, including once during 1980-84 when MGR was the Chief Minister, had demanded that the headquarters be named after the party’s founder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/janaki-ramachandran-gifted-aiadmk-headquarters-land/article37015296.ece

16 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Special module planned for ageing HIV patients||The ongoing fifth phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) will have a special module to focus on ageing people living with HIV (PLHIV), said Alok Saxena, Director-General of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Delivering a lecture as part of the Suniti Solomon memorial symposium organised virtually by Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (Y.R.G. CARE) on Thursday, Dr. Saxena said that India had a sizeable cohort of people living with HIV aged 50 years and above, due to the success of the antiretroviral therapy (ART) that was making them live longer. He said it was important to devise programmes to help this ageing population as they became prone to non-communicable diseases and other age-related illnesses. Mr. Saxena said that NACP planned to commence teleconsultation for those affected with HIV based on the learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Saxena said that though he never had an opportunity to directly work with late Dr. Solomon, many of the models used by NACP were based on the pioneering work done by her and her team in Chennai. Vaccine for HIV Penny Moore, South African Research Chair of Virus-Host Dynamics, University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, said that there were several promising developments towards producing a vaccine for HIV. She said that lessons from the development of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of the speed, collaboration, data sharing and international commitment from funders and scientists must be taken to make a vaccine for HIV, a reality in the near future. Judith S. Currier, Professor of Medicine, Division Chief, Infectious Diseases, University of California, said while ART was a major advancement that saved and enhanced the lives of many, new drugs with different mechanisms of action, less frequent dosing and potentially less long-term complications were being developed. She stressed on the need for lifestyle modification in addition to the ART to prevent chronic diseases. Rajesh T. Gandhi, Professor of Medicine, Co-Director, Harvard University Centre for AIDS Research, who spoke on therapy for COVID-19, said there were many lessons that could be learnt from the approach of Dr. Suniti Solomon towards AIDS. These included randomised trials, iterative process, tempering of pressure to deploy interventions by providing importance to finding out whether it worked or not and most importantly in ensuring equity in access to care. ‘Science must guide’ Linda-Gail Bekker, Director, Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, University of Cape Town, South Africa, said that while pandemics were political and politicised, science must guide all interventions and policies. Highlighting Dr. Suniti Solomon’s commitment towards inclusion and stretching the health system to reach people who were hardly reached, Dr. Bekker said that innovations were of limited benefit if they could not be scaled. Sunil Suhas Solomon, Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and chairman and managing director of Y.R.G. CARE, said that integrity, humility and passion were the values most cherished by his mother Dr. Suniti Solomon. He said that the best way to honour her legacy was through such symposiums that enabled sharing of knowledge.

The Corporation Commissioner’s letter of October 3 comes in the wake of a September 22, 2021 order of Madras High Court, which was hearing a contempt petition filed by Peelamedu Consumer Voice and writ petition filed by Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, Chennai – both in connection with the scheme road. Contempt petition The Peelamedu Consumer Voice had filed the contempt petition for punishing the Coimbatore Corporation and others for not complying with the order for laying the 40-foot wide scheme road for 237 m linking Avinashi Road with Ellai Thottam Road through the Quarters and a few layouts. And, the Regional PF Commissioner’s writ petition challenged a Coimbatore Corporation Council resolution for building the scheme road through the Quarters. In his letter, the Corporation Commissioner had said the civic body was not in a position to give an alternative land in lieu of the land to be used for laying the scheme road through the Quarters as none was available. Land acquisition To comply with the Court’s latest direction, as the district administration had initiated land acquisition process for the scheme road, it was imperative in public interest at the Employees Provident Fund Organisation gave enter-upon permission to the Corporation to lay the scheme road. And, the Central Provident Fund Commissioner would do well to issue instructions or orders to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, Chennai, to give the enter-upon permission to allow the civic body to develop the scheme road as a portion of the land required fell within the Quarters. Alternative road The letter marks the latest development in the issue, which the Peelamedu Consumer Voice took up more than a decade ago to have a road as an alternative to the narrow PKD Nagar 1st Street to reach Ellai Thottam in the north or Avinashi Road in the south. Consumer organisation’s secretary P.V. Gopal said the Corporation developing the scheme road would provide the ideal alternative road for road users to reach Ganapathy Managar, Ganapathy, Sathyamangalam Road or areas north thereof. And, in the south, it provided road users easy access to G.V. Residency, Sowripalayam, Singanallur or areas off Tiruchi Road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-asks-pf-commissioner-to-give-permission-to-lay-road/article37015350.ece

16 October 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Tangedco should disconnect service connections that violate building rules’||The Coimbatore Consumer Cause has demanded the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to disconnect all connections given after March 18, 2021 that do not comply with the Tamil Nadu Combined Building Development Rules, 2019. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of the consumer organisation, said all electricity connections released in violation of the Tamil Nadu Combined Building Development Rules 2019 after March 18, 2021 were illegal. The High Court had directed Tangedco to comply strictly with the rules. However, Tangedco issued its instructions on April 16, 2021 releasing new connections to all buildings upto 12 metres height, irrespective of size and usage. This was a contempt of court and the Coimbatore Consumer Cause filed a petition with the court again. The court admitted the petition and stayed implementation of Tangedco’s April order. The Chief Engineer, Tangedco Coimbatore, had issued instructions to follow the court order. Yet, Tangedco had again failed to implement even the stay order by court and released new connections in violation of the Rules and the court order. According to a RTI reply, nearly 4,900 connections were released after the stay order from August 20 to September 1 across the State. It was alleged that in some places officials continued to release connections. Disrespecting the court order was another contempt of court action, he said. Hence, Tangedco should take action against all the officials who released connections in violation of the building rules and the court order. It should disconnect all such connection since they were provided illegally and ensure that no new connections were released in violation of the building rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-should-disconnect-service-connections-that-violate-building-rules/article37015352.ece

Temporary shops selling banana stems, mango leaves, ash gourd, coconuts and sugarcane have come up along the roads in many areas in the city and also in the outskirts. Traders leave the unsold stems and mango leaves along the road leading to piling of garbage. Also, ash gourds are broken on the road as part of the celebrations. Shopkeepers, commercial establishments and residents clean their premises for puja and dump the garbage in bins and on the roads. About 250 tonnes of solid waste is generated in the 60 wards in the city everyday that were cleared by the conservancy workers. However, after the puja, over 100 tonnes of additional waste were dumped on the road which the workers had to remove. Since workers did not work on Thursday, clearing of garbage began on Friday and is expected to be completed by Saturday. Officials said that more than half of the banana stems and mango leaves that were brought for sale remained unsold and were dumped on the road by the traders. “They simply leave it along the road”, said an official. Since the Corporation is engaged in door-to-door collection of solid waste, and in the absence of bins, most of the waste was dumped along the roads in the city. “Removing the waste from the roads in residential areas is a great challenge”, said the official.

But then, the CM himself came on line,” says Mr. Ravirajan. Mr. Stalin asked Mr. Ravirajan to put his daughter on line. “Schools will reopen on November 1. Go to school and study hard,” was the counsel from the Chief Minister, says Ms. Prachana, replaying the brief call, in which Mr. Stalin is heard saying he saw her note and asking her where she is studying. “It will soon be two years since we met our teachers and friends. We are eager to go back to school,” says Ms. Prachana, who wrote the letter, co-signed by her younger sibling, when asked about her reasons for writing the card.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cms-call-leaves-10-year-old-girl-thrilled/article37015316.ece
16 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TAMIL NADU||When RK made a dramatic appearance for talks||It may be a coincidence of sorts that Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna alias RK, the top Maoist leader who died due to prolonged illness in Chhattisgarh on Thursday, accompanied by gun totting personal guards and fellow comrades, drove out from the high security Manjeera Guest House in Greenlands on October 15, 17 years ago, after holding talks with the then Congress Government, headed by late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. After a dramatic appearance from the dense Nallamala forests on October 11, 2004, at Chinna Arutla village in Prakasam district, RK, then CPI(ML) People’s War Group’s AP State Committee Secretary, carrying an AK-47 slung across his shoulder arrived to a rousing welcome. In a strange quirk of fate, the police and the naxals were face to face at the guest house and the former had to provide security to the latter. Over the next two days, there were hectic parleys among the government machinery and the Maoists leaders. N. Venugopal, Editor of Veekshanam magazine told The Hindu that RK, who was the leader of the delegation, conducted the proceedings. Mr. Venugopal recalled how RK was considerate and accommodative. He would take even exact opposite view points with a smile. With no breakthrough achieved, the naxal leaders led by RK went back to Chinna Arutla and were never to be seen again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/when-rk-made-a-dramatic-appearance-for-talks/article37014890.ece

The ADGP informed that Royal Enfield had sponsored the vehicles and other assistances required for the rally. The stronger unified India, which was created by Sardar Vallabhai Patel by uniting more than 550 princely states across the country, was testimony to the tireless work of the ‘Iron Man of India’ and the rally being taken out by the policemen from Kanniyakumari to Gujarat would remind every citizen of the contribution of Sardar Patel after the country’s Independence, said Mr. Aravind. Superintendent of Police (in-charge) Maheshwaran, ADSP Eswaran, Tamil Nadu Special Police Commandant Antony Johnson Jayapaul, DSP, Kanniyakumari, Raja and college students participated in the function.

16 October 2021||KASARAGOD,TAMIL NADU||‘Return endosulfan to company for disposal’||Disposal of endosulfan stocks faces a new hurdle, with a popular movement taking out a protest march to Plantation Corporation of Kerala (PCK) godowns in Kasaragod district. The protesters have called for the pesticide stocks to be returned to the company for safe disposal. Inaugurating a protest march at the Periya Plantation Corporation godown, Rajmohan Unnithan, Congress leader and MP, said he and his party would stand with the affected people against the decision to dispose of and deactivate endosulfan at their current storage. Mr. Unnithan said such a decision had been taken by authorities when the affected people had not yet been compensated as ordered by the Supreme Court. Dinesh Kartha, State general secretary of the Kerala Congress, said the endosulfan stored in the PCK godowns at various places in Kasaragod district posed a threat to public safety. About 1,438 litres of endosulfan have been stored in PCK godowns for over 20 years. The endosulfan solution is stored in 914.55 litres in Periya, 73.75 litres in Cheemeni and 450 litres in Rajapuram. 2012 action In 2012, when there was threat of endosulfan leaks from old godowns, they were transferred to new godowns through a scheme called Operation Blossom Spring. Authorities at the time announced that endosulfan in the reservoirs would be deactivated soon, but no action was taken, said Mr. Kartha. The process of deactivation at Kasaragod itself is of great concern to the people of the district. Mr. Kartha said Kasaragod, which had suffered the most from endosulfan, should not be turned into a chemical laboratory again. He said the decision to deactivate endosulfan in Kasaragod district should be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/return-endosulfan-to-company-for-disposal/article37014893.ece

16 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Devotees back in large numbers||Temples in the city opened the doors for devotees on Vijayadasami, on Friday, following the State government’s decision to allow all places of worship to be opened on all days. The earlier order on closure of the places of worship on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays was lifted. A large number of devotees visited temples across the city.

B. Udhaya Kumar here on Friday. Addressing a party workers’ preparatory meeting at Tirumangalam in Madurai district to celebrate the golden jubilee of the AIADMK on October 17, he said that the ruling party had rigged the recent rural local body elections. “When we (AIADMK) conducted Assembly polls on a single day, what prompted the State Election Commission to hold the rural local body elections in two phases for nine districts,” he questioned. Alleging that the DMK forced the authorities to hold the elections in two phases so that it could manipulate polling, he charged that despite giving a long list of names to be deleted in the voter list in Tirumangalam, the authorities had neglected it. “Names of many deceased persons were not deleted. DMK workers exercised the franchise of those who were away serving far away in armed forces,” he claimed. “But party workers need not get demoralised as people are always with the AIADMK. When we lost in 1996, the DMK written us off. But we bounced back in 2001,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-will-bounce-back-in-next-polls-mla/article37015535.ece

16 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC directs man to pay compensation to his child||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed a man from Ramanathapuram district to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to his child born out of wedlock. He maintained a relationship with a woman for over a year and the man had promised to marry her. But after she got pregnant, he refused to marry her. The woman lodged a complaint and a case was booked against him. In 2015, the trial court in Ramanathapuram sentenced and convicted the man to undergo 10-year rigorous imprisonment for sexual assault and one-year imprisonment for cheating the woman. The man, M. Malaisamy, preferred an appeal against the verdict. Justice R. Pongiappan observed that it was a consensual relationship. The accused need not be convicted for sexual assault. But his act definitely came within the purview of cheating as he never intended to marry her. He is liable to be convicted for cheating. The DNA test and evidence given by experts confirmed that he was the biological father. The real victim was the child born out of wedlock. So the child must be compensated, the judge said and directed the man to deposit Rs. 5 lakh as compensation to the child. The woman was allowed to withdraw the interest accrued once in three months from the bank to utilise the money for the child’s welfare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-man-to-pay-compensation-to-his-child/article37015310.ece

16 October 2021||PERAMBALUR,TAMIL NADU||Sathanur Petrified Tree Educational Centre opened||An educational centre, including a museum and a children’s park, was inaugurated at the National Fossil Wood Park at Sathanur in the district on Friday. Christened, Sathanur Petrified Tree Educational Centre, the centre would provide information and also raise awareness among visitors on the importance of the fossil tree at the site and the region as well. The over-100 million years old fossil tree is a protected monument of the Geological Survey of India. The petrified tree trunk, measuring over 18 metres in length, was first reported by M.S.Krishnan of the Geological Survey of India in 1940. Thousands of years ago, the sea (which lies about 100 km east of Sathanur today) had ingressed and egressed in the region. Geological studies have indicated that the sea had transgressed more than 120,000,000 years ago. During this period, geologically known as the Cretaceous, the sea abounded in a variety of marine animals. Animals and trees along the shore were buried after being carried by flooded streams of seawater and were petrified in course of time. This had made the region a geologists’ paradise and the Sathanur ‘Kal Maram’ forms an important part of it. Museum A few years ago the Department of Tourism had sanctioned Rs. 50.50 lakh for setting up a museum and necessary infrastructure was created at the complex. The Education Centre has been established at the building constructed as part of the project and includes four halls with illustrations on the solar system, origin of earth, big bang theory, origin of life and evolution and the petrified tree. Fossils collected in the region have been displayed in a museum. Besides, a children’s park has also been established. The centre was inaugurated by S.S. Sivasankar, Minister for Backward Classes Welfare, in the presence of J. Jeyaranjan, Vice-Chairperson, State Development Policy Council, P. Sri Venkada Priya, Collector, and other officials. The centre is mainly intended to explain the importance of the fossil tree at Sathanur to the general public and students. Mr.Sivasankar said and added that steps were being taken to introduce an audio visual presentation at the centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-inaugurates-sathanur-petrified-tree-educational-centre/article37015401.ece

The firm assigned to clear the waste, Erode-based Zigma Global Environment Solutions Private Limited, has commenced the work to rid the 23-acre yard of waste piled up over the years. The dump, which was being used over years by the municipalities of Pondicherry, Oulgaret and commune panchayats of Ariyankuppam and Villianur to deposit waste, has been a major irritant for the residents in the area due to burning of waste and foul smell. The presence of legacy waste had so far hampered the administration’s efforts to use the yard to implement an integrated solid waste management programme, including end-processing of the collected household garbage, for the town. E. Vallavan, Secretary, LAD, told The Hindu that the firm had commenced work in August. “As on July, this year, the yard has about 7.42 lakh cubic metre of waste. We have given them 12 months to clear the waste and handover the land free of any waste. Once, the land has been reclaimed we will start a programme, including segregation of waste and recycling,” he said. The firm selected for bio-mining has got the expertise in splitting the waste into components. Various valuable materials including metals, stone, glass and those which could be used for cement manufacturing will be retrieved from the waste, he said adding the LAD would pay the firm Rs. 770 per tonne for the reclamation of the land. “The reclamation of the land will help us in implementing the solid waste management rules,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bio-mining-to-clear-legacy-waste-from-kurumbapet-dump-begins/article37015685.ece

Inquiries reveal that the channel bund breached on Tuesday due to heavy flow in the water course in view of the incessant rain that lashed this region a few days ago. The breach was plugged by stacking of sand bags by Public Works Department. Around 35 acres of agriculture land got inundated and the water level later receded as the stagnated water got drained through the drain channels, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/breach-in-bund-plugged/article37015396.ece

16 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Centre asks Kerala to increase generation at hydel stations||Given the severity of the coal shortage crisis, the Union Ministry of Power has asked Kerala to provide support by increasing generation at storage-based hydroelectric stations, such as the 780 MW Idukki power project, especially during off-peak hours. In an October 14 letter, the Power Ministry asked Chief Secretary V.P. Joy to issue the necessary directions for providing the support till October 31. By then, “the demand on thermal generating stations is likely to be normalised,” it said. There is scope for increasing generation at storage-based hydel stations in the State, such as the Idukki power project, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., the daytime off-peak hours, in addition to the peak hours, the Ministry noted. Quantum not specified With the coal situation likely to take time to stabilise, the Ministry is reportedly looking to meet the demand with “higher generation support” from other sources such as hydropower. However, the Ministry has not specified the quantum of electricity required for the Central pool or terms, State Power Department officials said. The State is likely to respond to the letter by Saturday. It is understood that the Power Department and the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) are, in general, amenable to the request. However, in return, the State is looking for support from the Ministry for meeting the soaring daily peak-hour demand. “We are looking at, say, 100 MW, for meeting the peak-hour demand. Moreover, the Centre has not specified the terms or price for the supply of power to the Central pool,” a senior official of the State Power Department said. Peak-hour shortage Due to the coal crisis, Kerala has been faced with a shortage of approximately 300 MW during the evening peak hours (6 p.m. to 11 p.m.) in Central supply. Consequently, the State is spending an additional Rs. 2 crore daily on power purchase from the open market to make up for the shortfall, Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty noted earlier this week. There is a strong feeling in the State’s power sector circles that the Centre should be capping prices in the power markets, given the seriousness of the coal crisis. Per unit prices in the power exchange had shot up to Rs. 20 at one point, noted a KSEB official. Earlier this week, Mr. Krishnankutty had ruled out load-shedding and power cuts in the State till October 19, when the power situation is set to undergo a review. Following the dip in Central supply, the KSEB has already increased hydel generation. In recent days, internal hydel generation accounted for over 40% of the daily consumption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-asks-kerala-to-increase-generation-at-hydel-stations/article37014895.ece

This is the second ‘encounter’ in the State this week. A thief from Jharkhand, who robbed a woman of her chain at gunpoint, was gunned down in Kancheepuram last Monday. In self-defence Police sources said that when a team tried to nab V. Durai Murugan, 39, of Thirumalaipuram near Koottaampuli in the district around 3.30 p.m. in connection with the recent murder of a youth from Sivagamipuram in Tenkasi district, he attacked the team members, who then opened fire in self-defence.  M. Jegadeesh, 23, of Sivagamipuram under the Paavoorchathram police station limits, was allegedly murdered by Durai Murugan and his associates. They buried the body in Tuckerammalpuram on the outskirts of Palayamkottai. A person from Tuckermmalpuram, Joel, under the influence of alcohol, told his friends that he and his associates had murdered Jegadeesh and buried the body near his native place. He was picked up by the police. During interrogation, Joel disclosed the role of Durai Murugan in the murder. The body was exhumed last Monday. Tip-off on hideout Even as a team, led by sub-inspector Raja Prabhu, was on the look-out for Durai Murugan, the police received information that he and his associates were hiding in a secluded place, amid thorny bushes, near Kovalam under the Muththaiahpuram police station limits. As the team, which included three constables, arrived at the spot, Durai Murugan tried to attack it with a machete, even as two of his associates ran away. The police then gunned him down. Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar; Deputy Superintendent of Police Ganesh; and Muththaiahpuram Inspector Jayaseelan visited the spot and sent the body to the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital for post-mortem. Policemen have been deployed at Thirumalaipuram and Muththaiahpuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-gun-down-criminal-in-encounter-in-thoothukudi/article37015327.ece
16 October 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Steps taken to purchase 2,500 MW of power||Minister for Electricity V. Senthilbalaji has said that steps are being taken to purchase 2,500 MW power to bridge the existing gap between the demand and availability of power generated by government-owned units. Speaking to reporters on Friday after inspecting the Tuticorin Thermal Power Station (TTPS), along with Rajesh Lakhoni, chairman and managing director, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, he said the Electricity Department was being revamped as it was in shambles owing to 10 years of corruption and mismanagement. Since most power projects announced by the AIADMK regime in the last 10 years remained only on paper, the gap between the demand and availability of power had increased to 2,500 MW. This would be bridged by purchasing it from the market, he said. While 1,000 MW of power will be purchased at a cost of Rs. 2.6 a unit, another 1,500 MW will be bought at a cost of Rs. 3.26 a unit. Steps are also being taken to improve the generation capacity of State-owned power generation units, he said. Saying that 4.52 lakh farmers had registered for power connections, Mr. Senthilbalaji said 1 lakh power connections would be given during the current fiscal. He said steps were being taken to generate 4,000 MW of solar power, and start power generation projects that were announced by the DMK between 2006 and 2011, but had been shelved by the successive AIADMK government. While asserting that complaints pertaining to ‘inflated power charges’ were wrong, the Minister said 98% of these complaints had been attended to the satisfaction of the consumers. Minister for Social Welfare P. Geetha Jeevan was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/steps-taken-to-purchase-2500-mw-of-power/article37015306.ece

16 October 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Capture of MDT23 - a humane operation centered around scientific principles||The massive 22-day-long effort to safely tranquillise and capture tiger MDT23 from Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), began in another forest division entirely in Gudalur. On September 24, a 56-year-old man who was grazing cattle in Devan Estate, bordering the tiger reserve was mauled to death by the tiger. A search operation quickly ensued to tranquillise the animal, with teams of forest staff and veterinarians deployed. Despite the attempts of the Forest Department, the tiger crossed into another estate and then doubled back towards its core territory in MTR. During it’s crossing back into the tiger reserve, on October 1st, another grazer, 82-year-old M. Basuvan, was mauled by the tiger and killed. Unlike in the last instance, the tiger had eaten parts of Basuvan after he had been killed, causing alarm among the public and the forest officials. Residents staged a protest calling for the animal to be shot dead. Chief Wildlife Warden of Tamil Nadu, Shekhar Kumar Niraj, issued a “hunting” order for MDT23, which authorised the Forest Department to tranquillise and capture the animal, and as a last resort, to shoot it down. Right from the outset of the operation, forest officials made it clear that they were focused on capturing the animal alive. More than 100 forest staff, kumki elephants, sniffer dogs and drones were deployed to track the tiger. The assistance of the staff from Kerala and Karnataka forest divisions was also welcomed by the State Forest Department. The tiger’s entry into MTR complicated efforts to capture it, as the undulating hillocks of tea estates in Gudalur – where spotting the tiger was relatively easy, was made all the more difficult in the jungles of MTR. The tiger managed to evade its would-be captors for over two weeks, and was not spotted on a myriad of camera traps set inside the operation area to locate him for a five-day period. After being spotted on Wednesday, forest officials had a clear sight of the animal on late Thursday night. However, they said that they avoided darting the tiger due to concerns over the safety of the tiger as well as field staff. Visibly weakened by the relentless pursuit, MDT23 made one final attempt to lift the head of a cattle on Friday morning near Masinagudi village. Local residents quickly notified the department who zeroed in on the animal’s location and with a single dart, managed to bring the saga of MDT23 to a successful end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/relentless-efforts-to-tranquillise-and-capture-tiger-in-mudumalai-pay-off/article37015361.ece

16 October 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||British era post office honours oldest customer||Half a century ago when Kantha Ganesan moved to Vellore after her husband shifted to a local cooperative society where he earned his livelihood, she seldom stepped out of Sankaranpalayam, a posh neighbourhood where she resided, except once a week on Fridays. She walked from her house with a small hand-held cloth bag that mainly contained coins to be deposited at the post office near the Fort in the town. Her weekly savings hardly exceeded Rs. 2 but she did that ritual week after week, covering a distance of three km. Now 69 years old, Kantha wonders how she was able to make it all these years and still does it, though travelling by bus now. She was honoured by the officials, led by P. Komal Kumar, Superintendent of Post Offices (SPO) at the Head Post Office (HPO), Vellore Division, a few days ago for being the oldest savings account holder with the post office since 1972, to mark the World Postal Week, celebrated from October 11. “My weekly visit was not only to deposit our savings at the post office. I was fascinated to see the huge building that was built for the post office near the Fort," said Kantha, a mother of three. Interestingly, the new building for Vellore HPO was built in April 1971 after being relocated from its rented accommodation in Abdullapuram on the Bengaluru Highway. The Mangalore tiled rented post office in Abdullapuram served North and South Arcot regions including Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupatur, Krishnagiri, Thiruvannamalai and Cuddalore since 1930 when M.E. Nigel Jones, the then Postmaster General, Madras GPO, made a lease with the local resident, N. Margasahayam, to run the post office in his house. Prior to it, the post office was functioning from a dilapidated house of the village headman in the town since its formation on October 9, 1874. At present, the Vellore HPO has 46 sub post offices and 106 branch post offices. As part of the week-long celebrations, the Vellore HPO also honoured its field staff including branch post masters in Vannanthangal, Veerakollaimedu, Puduvasur, Velangadu and Appukkal for taking postal services to the remote villages in the district. The HPO honoured 64-year-old A. Kaheer Ahmed for his 39 years of service, mostly in the Vellore division. V.P. Chandrasekar, retired Senior SPO, released a special cover and banner depicting all days of the National Postal Week. G. Srinivasan, Senior Post Master, Vellore HPO, and P.

Ashwath Narayan, Minister for Higher Education, on Wednesday. He was speaking at a workshop on ‘Implementing NEP, a bold step’, held at Jeerge conventional hall of KLE Society’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College here. He asked teachers and administrators not to entertain any doubts about the policy and said the NEP does not aim to remove the principles of merit, reservation, and scholarships to students. “You should all read the guidelines sent to universities and colleges and spread the good word,” he said. “The government will recruit teachers every year. Teachers will be trained, institutions will get academic autonomy. The government will support institutions with resources. However, it will implement the principle of decentralisation,” he said. He also said the NEP would introduce transparency in administration and academics, with all information available in the public domain. He asked private college and university managements to see to it that the fees collected from students is used only for the development of the institution and for paying the salaries of teachers. “The new policy will help shape the new generation to acquire new skills and live better lives. It will help our boys and girls become world citizens,” he said. “This is the third education policy since Independence. It will bring clear changes in the teaching and learning process. It has clearly stated methods to achieve definite objectives goals.” He also said the State Government was organising workshops across Karnataka in the jurisdiction of each university. Saying that the lifestyle in countries such as Japan, China, Germany, and Korea had changed completely in the decades after the Second World War, he said the reason for it was focus on science and technology; something the NEP will strive to do in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-will-help-india-become-a-global-superpower/article37015667.ece

The district administration has urged the government to allow people to freely enter Karnataka as COVID-19 incidence has reduced significantly in all three States. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has sent a letter on the matter to Tushar Girinath, Principal Secretary, Revenue, and member-secretary, State Executive Committee on COVID-19 management. “The COVID-19 positivity rate in the two neighbouring States has come down significantly. Belagavi shares a border with these States. A lot of people need to commute between these States for business and trade. Such movement would be facilitated if the restriction is removed,” he said. “The NWKRTC, which operates buses between these States, has requested the district administration to allow free movement of commuters. The Kolhapur district administration has also made the same request,” the Deputy Commissioner said. The State Executive Committee had made a negative RT-PCR certificate mandatory for travellers from the two States, whether they come by bus or private vehicle. Traders and businessmen have argued that this restriction is scuttling their activities. More than once, the district chamber of commerce and industries has submitted memoranda addressed to the State Government to remove this restriction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-seeks-exemption-from-need-for-rt-pcr-certificate/article37015671.ece

16 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Restoration of Doddajala station under way||Four heritage stations on the outskirts of Bengaluru — Doddajala, Devanahalli, Avathihalli and Nandi — will be restored to their former glory by the end of next year. South Western Railways (SWR), which has undertaken the restoration project, has already started work at Doddajala station at an estimated cost of Rs. 39 lakh. In February, the Bengaluru Division of SWR had signed an agreement with INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) to restore the station. As part of the restoration work, granite slab stones will be reset and walls replastered. Stone masonry will also be redone. SWR has proposed that a new entrance to the station be constructed on the east side to provide better access to the station from the main road (toll free road) that connects to Kempegowda International Airport. Plans also include the construction of a planter box cum retaining wall with landscaping on the southern side, and new ticketing room. Hardscaping in stone has been proposed along the north, east and western stretches of the structure, said officials. The eastern exterior wall of the structure will have panels narrating the context, history and significance of the structure and its heritage, while informal seating spaces will be provided around the existing tree in the form of ‘katte’ (stone seating). All four stations were built on the Bengaluru-Chickballapur light railway (narrow gauge - 62 km) which became operational in August 1915.“The next station where work will be taken up will be Avathihalli. SWR has planned to complete restoration works of all the four stations within a year. INTACH is sourcing funds through CSR initiatives. Restoration work will also involve landscape developments around these structures,” said Chief PRO of the SWR Aneesh Hegde. There is a proposal to develop an ‘Interpretation Centre’ for monuments and history and a café or snack counter at Devanahalli. At Avathihalli station, SWR hopes to build a Silk Museum and Resource Centre along with a park. The popular Nandi halt station will have a rail museum, a cafe and restaurant, a cultural performance centre, pop-up weekend crafts markets and an amphitheatre, among other facilities. No sign of resuming train services to KIA Nearly six months have passed since SWR halted train services to KIA, but there is no indication that they will be resumed. In April, SWR ‘temporarily stopped’ services citing poor patronage. In an attempt to increase ridership, it worked with BIAL to reschedule train timings. Due to non-operation of trains, the new halt station near the KIA boundary remains unused. The Railways resumed services in a phased manner, prioritising routes that had high patronage. On this particular route, ridership was never promising. “Nothing has been decided yet on re-introducing services to the airport,” said an SWR official. Meanwhile, SWR is also buying more time to complete electrification of the line which will help run MEMU trains in the future. It had set August as the deadline to complete the electrification till Devanahalli. The project deadline was pushed back due to delays in shifting KPTCL utilities. Electrification work till Devenahalli is likely to be completed by November.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/restoration-of-doddajala-station-under-way/article37015243.ece

16 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rain wreaks havoc across city||Heavy rains across large parts of the city on Friday evening wreaked havoc on festivities and travel plans. Pockets of South and East Bengaluru saw heavy rains, while other parts witnessed moderate rains. In many areas, roads were waterlogged. Low-lying areas such as HSR Layout, Anugraha Layout, L.N.

The Meteorological Department also forecast “few spells of rain/thundershowers” for the next 48 hours. Chief Civic Commissioner Gaurav Gupta visited areas that suffered flooding and damage due to heavy rains that lashed the city Thursday night. He ordered officials to replace fixed gratings – which had caused reverse flow and flooding –with floating gratings at a stormwater drain near Chokkasandra Lake and demolition of a retention wall built by a BWSSB treatment plant across a SWD in ward 14, that had also caused flooding of the area. According to the BBMP, R.R.

16 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bommai, Siddaramaiah engage in Twitter war over moral policing remark||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah have over the last two days engaged in a bitter exchange of barbs on Twitter, with the latter saying the former’s comments provided enough grounds for him to file a defamation case. It all began with the Chief Minister reacting sharply to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s criticism that he was “handing over law and order to RSS and establishing a Jungle Raj”. Mr. Bommai’s statements that moral policing in coastal districts has to be seen from the prism of “action and reaction” and such incidents occur when there is moral degradation in society was criticised by many including Mr. Siddaramaiah. Mr. Bommai, reacting to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s criticism, said the latter had become “an icon of anti-Hindus” and went so far as to allege that he had got Hindu activists “killed”. Mr. Siddaramaiah hit back, saying he did not expect such a baseless statements from a Chief Minister. “I can file a defamation case for this but I will just advise you to correct yourself,” he tweeted. Earlier, Mr. Bommai invoked the BJP’s 2018 campaign against Mr. Siddaramaiah, who was then Chief Minister, alleging murders of 24 Hindu activists during his time. Mr. Bommai tweeted: “..Jungle Raj was when you were blind, deaf, and dumb to the killings of Hindus under your tenure.” Mr. Siddaramaiah then tweeted a booklet prepared by the Congress on the deaths of Hindus as well as Muslims during their tenure, countering allegations by the Chief Minister. He called the allegations of Mr. Bommai “a desperate attempt to please his RSS masters”. Giving the break up of total number of political murders during 2013-18 at 45, he tweeted: “Accused in the murder of 10 Hindus between 2013-18 were from PFI & SDPI. All were arrested. And, accused in the murder of 11 Muslims and 10 Hindus were from Bajrang Dal and Hindu Jagarana Vedike, friends of RSS.” Reminding the Chief Minister of the BJP’s gaffe of including a living person as one of the murdered workers, he said the Chief Minister should ask the CBI to speed up the probe into the murder of Paresh Mesta and take action against accused in the murders of other Hindu activists as well. He demanded that culprit in the the murder of RTI activist Vinayaka Baliga be brought to book. Mr. Siddaramaiah accused Mr. Bommai of “lighting communal fires for political gains” and said that “true Hindus are intelligent enough to see through” him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bommai-siddaramaiah-engage-in-twitter-war-over-moral-policing-remark/article37015266.ece

The firearm that the accused, Ravish Gowda, 44, used was licenced. He produced both the weapon and the relevant documents, police said. On Wednesday night, Gowda, while driving his car, was involved in an accident with a bike ridden by Anil, an ambulance driver from Bidar. Though nobody was injured in the accident, Anil took objection to Gowda’s driving and allegedly physically assaulted him. Gowda allegedly took out his licenced revolver and fired a shot in the air. Anil lodged a complaint with Yeshwanthpur police, who tracked down the businessman using CCTV footage and arrested him.

16 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Garment sector demands 5% uniform GST||The proposal to fix a uniform GST slab of 12% for the garment sector, if it goes through, will hit the ‘already battered’ industry and may lead to job losses, industry insiders fear. Currently there are two tax slabs - 5% for bills below Rs. 999 and 12% for bills above that. Calls for a uniform tax slab prompted a proposal to fix it at 12% for both slabs. However, representatives of the garment sector are demanding that it should be 5%. “The industry, one of the largest employers, is one of the worst-hit by the pandemic. With no social gatherings and people working from home, sales have dropped by over 50%. People also do not have spending capacity. Meanwhile, the prices of raw materials have shot up significantly. In such a situation, hiking tax to 12% will further hit the industry,” said Sajjan Raj Mehta, of Karnataka Hosiery and Garments’ Association. In a letter to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who was recently appointed chairman of the Group of Ministers on GST Rate Rationalisation, Perikal M. Sundar, president of Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, (FKCCI), said, “This sector may face closure leading to unemployment and loss of revenue to the government.” The proposal has garment workers worried too. A recent study by the Garment and Textiles Workers’ Union (GATWU) estimated that at least 60 garment factories shut down and nearly 40,000, mostly women, lost jobs, in Bengaluru alone since the pandemic. The scale of the crisis is severe across the country, said Jayaram, advisor to GATWU. Even those working have had their salaries cut and in many cases not paid for months, he added. “The demand in the domestic market has fallen steeply and it is in this sector that there has been the most closures and job losses. In such a situation, hiking GST to 12% would lead to a further fall in demand and will eventually hit us workers. It will only mean more closures, loss of jobs and salary cuts. This is the time the government must stand by the sector,” Mr. Jayaram said. Industry representatives recently met the CM and petitioned him seeking a uniform 5% GST slab for the sector. “Earlier, Mr. Bommai, acting on our petition, has written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking a uniform slab of 5%,” said Mr. Mehta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/garment-sector-demands-5-uniform-gst/article37015249.ece

16 October 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Elect Horatti unanimously for a record eighth time, teachers told||Karnataka Rajya Madhymika Shala Noukarara Sangha has made an appeal to the teaching community to create a history of sorts by unanimously electing Chairman of Legislative Council Basavaraj Horatti from the Karnataka West Teachers Constituency. A resolution on this was accepted during the executive committee meeting of the sangha held recently at Lamington High School in Hubballi. The meeting resolved that as Mr. Horatti had been fighting for safeguarding the interests of teachers, they were duty bound to elect him unanimously this time as he had adorned the position of Chairman of the Legislative Council as a representative of theirs. Office-bearers Basavaraj Dharwad, G.R. Bhat, Shyam Mallanagoudar, Prabhakar Bunt, Jagadish Dyavappanavar, Abdul Menasinakai, Vijaya Doddagoudar, Sindhu Bijapur, Srishail Huddar, Wilson Mailey and others, who spoke at the meeting, emphasised the need for re-electing Mr. Horatti for the eighth time. They said that there is a need for exhibiting the unity of teachers by unanimously electing Mr. Horatti. Responding to the felicitation, Mr. Horatti said that it was because of the love, affection and trust shown towards him that he was elected for seven terms in a row. He said that he owed a lot to the teaching community and that he will continue to serve them till his last breath. He said that teachers were responsible for the all the name, fame and various positions he received during the last four decades of his public life. He clarified that although he did not want to contest for the Council poll this time, he was forced to change his decision because of the pressure from teachers, academics and various political parties. Apart from the sangha office-bearers from the districts of Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri and Uttara Kannada, members of various teachers associations and followers took part in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/elect-horatti-unanimously-for-a-record-eighth-time-teachers-told/article37015663.ece

16 October 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||Over 1L pages of manuscripts digitised at Moorusavir mutt||After a fortnight of intense work, over one lakh pages of manuscripts at Moorusavir Mutt at Hubballi have been scanned and stored in digital format. Over 100 volunteers, including regulars such as Veena Paramadi, Basamma Koti, Laxmi Biradar, and Nirmala Bisanal, scanned each palm leaf under the guidance of technical expert and researcher Ashok Domlur. Among other things, over 395 manuscripts dating back to around 300 years were cleaned with lemongrass oil before being digitised. “We are also digitising old books, which are in very bad state. Once digitised, anybody can access them in digital format. These are mostly copies of 12th century vachana literature. There are also works of other prose and poetry, majority of them related to religion and spirituality,” Mr. Domlur, an IT professional who has taken up the work voluntarily, told The Hindu . Mr. Domlur has been travelling across India for almost a decade now in pursuit of his passion for digitising manuscripts. “I have found manuscripts of vachana literature in Rajasthan, Nepal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. While most of them were stored by institutions and religious institutions, I also found manuscripts in households of various districts in Karnataka,” he said. Mr. Domlur said the manuscripts were mostly copies of original works as the life of palm leaves is around 200 to 300 years, and earlier they used to be rewritten on fresh palm leaves. “Digitisation will help preserve them permanently. We will have one copy with us, another in the data centre, and one with the local person or institution who possessed the manuscript. In the coming years, the idea is to given open access to all through the world wide web. But that will take time, as it is huge data and a lot of fund is required to host it on the web,” he said. Mr. Domlur sets aside a part of his income for his passion and sometimes gets assistance from like-minded people. Professional photographer Virupaksh Matti is his regular companion. In Hubballi, after Moorusavir mutt seer Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami gave him access to the library, some people, including Vishwanath Chintamani, Lokesh Koravi, Mallikarjun Kalasaraya, and S.B. Jodalli, offered assistance with over 100 volunteers, mainly women, taking turns to do the work of scanning the documents. From Moorusavir mutt, Mr. Domlur proceeded to Shivayoga Mandir in Bagalkot district where 11 bookshelves full of manuscripts are being digitised. In the last one decade, Mr. Domlur has digitised around five lakh manuscripts, but says there is still a lot to be done. Any information on manuscripts can be passed on to him on 9886867185.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-1l-pages-of-manuscripts-digitised-at-moorusavir-mutt/article37015262.ece

He never compromised on his ideals,” said K. Marulasiddappa, another prominent Kannada writer and a friend of Prof. Rao for many decades. He wrote a novella Eshwar Allah about communal harmony and divisive politics in 1979. In an epilogue he wrote to the novella in 1994, two years after demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, he said it was high time the country woke up to the sweeping communalism, but lamented that was not happening.

16 October 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Eight years on, KKRDB gets full-time secretary||The Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB), which was set up in 2013, has been given a full-time secretary now. R. Venkatesh Kumar, a 2010 batch IAS officer, took charge as the new secretary of KKRDB at the board’s headquarters in Kalaburagi earlier this week. He had earlier served as Deputy Commissioner of Kalaburagi and Raichur that fall under the Kalyana Karnataka region. The KKRDB, which was earlier called Hyderabad Karnataka Region Development Board (HKRDB), was established in 2013 for implementing special development programmes under the special status accorded to Kalyana Karnataka under Article 371(J) of the Constitution. The Regional Commissioner of Kalaburagi division had served member-secretary of KKRDB all these years. And, on September 17, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, in his address at the Kalyana Karnataka Utsava Dinacharane in Kalaburagi, promised that his government would appoint a full-time secretary for the board. Usage of funds Speaking after taking charge, Mr. Kumar said he would take steps to spend the entire amount of special grants in the same year of release. “The KKRDB is now spending around 80% of the funds in a year, which is better than other boards and authorities, including the Border Area Development Authority, the Bayaluseeme Area Development Board, and the Malnad Area Development Board. However, we need to take it to 100% by spending the entire amount in the same year of release,” Mr. Kumar said. Recalling his four-year service in different capacities in the region, Mr. Kumar said that he was aware of development issues in the region and priority would be given to education and health sectors. He also argued for the appointment of permanent teachers at anganwadis and schools in Kalyana Karnataka region instead of teachers on a temporary basis. “The KRDB gave Rs. 40 crore for the development of Raichur airport when I was Raichur Deputy Commissioner.

16 October 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||BJP has lost the moral right to rule country: Siddaramaiah||The BJP government at the Centre has lost the “moral right” to rule the country, Congress leader Siddaramaiah said in Afzalpur on Wednesday. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to tackle the COVID-19 situation. He asked people to bang plates, clap, and light lamps when lives had to be saved by providing vaccination. Nearly 50 lakh people have died of COVID-19 in the country and four lakh in Karnataka alone,” he said. He was addressing a gathering after visiting farmers who lost their crops in excess rainfall at Afzalpur taluk of Kalaburagi district. “The BJP Government’s economic policies have been taking people into poverty for the last seven years,” he said. He also referred to the Anna Bhagya scheme that was announced during his tenure with the mission of making Karnataka a hunger-free State. “We provided 7 kg of free rice to each beneficiary under the scheme, which benefited more than 1.08 crore families and over four crore individuals. The scheme was not for political gain. I felt it was important to provide food to the poor who struggle even to get two meals a day,” he said. He added that this scheme, as well as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Actlaunched by the UPA Government, had helped families in rural areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-has-lost-the-moral-right-to-rule-country-siddaramaiah/article37015670.ece

16 October 2021||KOCHI,KARNATAKA||Motor vehicles authority can blacklist vehicle: Kerala HC||A division bench of the Kerala High Court has held that the State Motor Vehicles authority is entitled to blacklist a vehicle or incorporate the details of any crime in which a vehicle is involved on the Parivahan portal. The Bench led by Chief Justice S. Manikumar observed that the Motor Vehicles authority is vested with ample powers to incorporate the details of the offences in relation to a vehicle on the Parivahan portal as per the clear provision of law. The court made the ruling recently while dismissing an appeal filed by a vehicle owner against the inclusion of the crime registered against him following a dispute over the payment of the price of the vehicle. The Bench observed that the definition of ‘portal’ under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules made it clear and specific that there was a provision for the recording of offences, including compounding, impounding, making endorsements, suspension and revocation of licences and registrations. For cautioning public The court said that it was clear and convincing from the definition of web portal that the portal was created for the larger interest of cautioning the public or any person dealing with a particular vehicle. The government pleader submitted that the Parivahan – Sewa project was the flagship project initiated by the Centre in the light of a new amendment to rule 139 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, which validated the electronic form of motor vehicle documents. The new web-based software, called Parivahan/Vahan, developed by the National Informatics Centre and controlled by the Centre Road Transport Ministry consisted of numerous modules and one such module is ‘Blacklist’, which includes the vehicle numbers and licence numbers having audit objections, complaints, court cases and check reports. The provisions incorporated in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 ensured that sufficient details were included on the portal so as to caution the public at large in respect of the vehicle involved in any crime or cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/motor-vehicles-authority-can-blacklist-vehicle-kerala-hc/article37014892.ece

The programme was organised in association with The Indian Family Business Journal, said a release. Director, Global Family Managed Business Programme, S.P. Jain School of Global Management, Mumbai, Parimal Merchant was the resource person at the event. Prof. Jain dwelt upon the importance of family business and its contribution to the Indian economy during his presentation, which included the history of family businesses in India, universal challenges that family businesses face in India and how the age-old wisdom of ancestors of family business have over a period guided and nurtured these enterprises. Mr. Merchant emphasised the need to inculcate strong values and beliefs in the younger generation with a view to building a strong business structure. KCCI said that family businesses had played an important role in industrialisation, trade and commerce in the country. Some of the leading business houses of today have created enormous wealth, employment and made contribution to nation building, started as family businesses. Dakshina Kannada is no exception with over 90% of the trade, commerce and industry having roots as family businesses. The chamber has mooted the concept of Family Business Centre in the district considering its importance, the release said. The goal will be to provide all resources and support needed to nurture family businesses. KCCI said that family business is not given due attention unlike start-ups and corporations and that has been demotivating the younger generation of family business.

16 October 2021||Mangaluru/Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Trishula Deekshe’ ceremony draws criticism||The ‘Trishula Deekshe’ ceremony conducted by Hindutva groups in Mangaluru on Ayudha Puja has drawn criticism as inciting violence, while the organisations have claimed that it is only a symbolic ceremony and what they distributed cannot be termed ‘arms’. Pictures of the event were widely shared on social media. Defending the programme, Sharan Pumpwell, Mangaluru divisional secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, said it was an annual in-house event where newly recruited activists are administered an oath to stay committed to the cause. It was not held during the last two years due to COVID-19 restrictions. “We are in no way professing use of Trishula (trident) for injuring anybody,” he told reporters on Friday. The event was held in a legal manner, he said. The event was held in Mangaluru and Udupi on October 13 and in Kalladka of Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada last month. Reacting to the incident, Congress leader and former Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy said the Trishula had a place of respect for Hindus but its place is in a puja room.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/trishula-deekshe-ceremony-draws-criticism/article37015269.ece
16 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Usual scenes were missing this time too||Celebrated under the shadow of COVID-19 for the second successive year, the Dasara festivities concluded here on a high note on Friday with the famous Jamboo Savari, which was scaled down as part of the low-key celebrations, confined to the palace premises. Contrary to the announcement that only 500 people would be allowed to the event in view of curbs over the pandemic situation, the turnout was much larger and it looked like celebrations in a normal year. The palace confines were swarming with people, and the COVID-19 norms were thrown to the winds. The event was livestreamed on various platforms to keep the people indoors but the audience was much larger with thousands in attendance. The celebrations that began on a traditional note on October 5 with former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna inaugurating the “Nada Habba” atop Chamundi Hills, came to an end with an impressive finale. It was tusker Abhimanyu’s second Dasara as the lead elephant and it performed its tasks with majesty - carrying the 750-kg golden howdah with the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari placed in it - in the company of caparisoned Kumkhi elephants. The howdah or the Ambari was bedecked in flowers while decorated Abhimanyu was a treat to watch. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s “Nandi Dwaja” puja outside the palace signalled the start of Vijayadashami procession. He, accompanied by other dignitaries, showered flower petals on the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari placed in the howdah. The usual scenes of cheering crowds, watching the grand proceedings from sitting atop the trees and tall buildings, along the usual procession route were missing as the event was confined to the palace and ended in less than an hour with a nominal presence of cultural troupes and tableaux. The government, despite the pandemic under control, decided to keep the festivities low-key as a precautionary measure, following advice from experts. However, it allowed an expansive illumination, with all other Dasara events, barring the cultural programmes at the palace, cancelled. Rain in the evenings during Navaratri played spoilsport. However, the cultural events at the palace saw connoisseurs of music turning up to watch the music and dance shows. The grand Dasara illumination was the best part with lighting this year done in a radius of 102 km, with more roads and streets, and junctions colourfully lit to enliven the festive spirit. People thronged the streets to glimpse the brightly lit roads and of course the palace, causing traffic congestion. The celebrations relatively helped the hospitality sector compared to last year with hotels and restaurants seeing good business, as the festivities, despite being subdued, managed to draw some crowds. The reason: vaccination coverage and sharp drop in COVID-19 cases. CM’s promise The Chief Minister’s statement during Dasara inaugural that next year’s Mysuru Dasara would be a grand affair, provided the pandemic is fully combated, has rekindled hopes of stakeholders who want the early revival. Though inter-state tourists were either nil or less and the footfall was mostly of the locals and those from neighbouring districts, the stakeholders are positive that Dasara has given a headstart, sustaining and helping the tourism sector recover.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/usual-scenes-were-missing-this-time-too/article37015634.ece
16 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Curtains down on traditional Dasara of Wadiyars||For the second year in a row, the private Dasara of the Wadiyars remained a low-key affair due to the pandemic and concluded with the Vijayadashmi procession held within the palace premises, here on Friday. Bringing the curtains down on a hoary tradition being followed by the erstwhile royal family since 1610 CE when Raja Wadiyar ascended the throne at Srirangapatna, this is a practice inherited from the rulers of the Vijayanagar empire who celebrated it on a grand scale. The religious rites followed by the Wadiyars were conducted over the last 9 days amidst the imperatives of maintaining social distancing and hence was out of bounds for all but those involved in the proceedings and immediate family members. A battery of priests supervised the rituals performed by Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar following the footsteps of his predecessors to keep alive a cultural practice which has a history of more than 410 years. The royal elephant (Pattada Aane), the royal horse (Pattada Kudure) and the royal cow (Pattada Hasu) were decorated and taken in a procession to the accompaniment of an ensemble of musicians playing nadaswara. The palace band and the golden palanquin were also part of the procession from the Amba Vilas to the Bhuvaneshwari temple. One of the key elements of the Wadiyar’s Dasara is the Vajra Mushti Kalaga but it was scrapped for the second year in a row. This is a type of wrestling in which the wrestlers wear knuckledusters with spikes and take a swipe at each other and whoever draws the first blood, is declared the winner. Though this type of wrestling finds a mention in the writings of medieval travellers to Vijayanagar, it has gone extinct and the sport is held to mark a tradition only during Vijayadashmi. The private procession of the Wadiyars – though entails all regal paraphernalia including the caparisoned elephants and the palace staff in traditional attires – it is a sea-change from the processions that used to take place during the regime of the maharajas. The maharaja used to sit in the golden howdah carried by the caparisoned elephants and used to be accompanied by the cavalry. The maharaja used to be greeted by the public and receive garlands and other offerings at the designated places and the procession would culminate at Bannimantap where the king would dismount and offer special prayers and conduct ‘shami puja’ as per tradition. In the present times this is confined to the palace premises and Yaduveer reached the temple in a motorised vehicle and not in the silver cart as used to be the practice. He then completed the rites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/curtains-down-on-traditional-dasara-of-wadiyars/article37015632.ece
16 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Of crowd limits and palace confines||The ceiling on audience at the Dasara finale on Friday remained only on paper as large crowds turned up at the palace to watch the Jamboo Savari. The government had restricted the number of attendees to 500. But the number exceeded to a large extent with no check on the crowds. The public had gathered outside the palace at the statue circle to get a glimpse of the “utsava murthy” of Goddess Chamundeshwari seated in the 750-kg golden howdah mounted on the back of tusker Abhimanyu, the lead elephant. With the palace entry limited to a select few, the public gathered near the Balarama Gate of the palace to try their luck in seeing the procession from at least a distance. Fourth time This is the fourth Jamboo Savari in the palace confines in the last three decades. The government led by the then Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily scaled down the processionwhen pneumonic plague struck parts of Surat in Gujarat in 1994. The decision was taken as a safety precaution to contain the spread of plague. Drought In 2002, the Jamboo Savari was again restricted in the wake of severe drought besides former Minister H. Nagappa’s kidnap by forest brigand Veerappan. The finale procession in 2020 and this year has been limited to the palace premises owing to COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/of-crowd-limits-and-palace-confines/article37015630.ece
16 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Cultural troupes, tableaux have their own charm||This year’s Jamboo Savari at the palace had many cultural troupes and tableaux despite being a low-key event. As the pandemic situation is comparatively better than last year, the Dasara Festival Committee permitted more participants in the famous procession marking Vijayadashami, the triumph of good over evil. In a normal year, the Jamboo Savari used to have at least 30-35 cultural troupes and over 25 tableaux besides 10-12 elephants, portraying the State’s rich cultural and folk diversity. The more-than-three-hour long procession used to conclude at Bannimantap, traversing a 5-km distance from the palace. With the pandemic still not over, the Jamboo Savari was confined to the palace and the finale finished in less than an hour. The celebrations were aimed at keeping the centuries-old tradition alive. The total number of troupes in Jamboo Savari were 20, including five tableaux. A tableau on “Azadi Ka Amrutha Mahotsava '', marking the country’s 75th independence day celebrations, was one of them. Other tableaux had different themes. There was a tableau from Mysore Urban Development Authority on its group housing project aimed at meeting the housing needs of the people of Mysuru. With the city expanding at a faster pace, triggering the demand for housing, the MUDA has focused its attention on promoting vertical growth, building affordable apartments. Like last year, this year too there was a tableau for spreading the message on COVID-19, which is the cause for low-key Dasara celebrations. The tableau from the Health Department highlighted the importance of vaccination, hand hygiene, healthy foods and much more. A combined tableau from the Departments of Agriculture and Horticulture gave a peek into the schemes/programmes, especially the crop survey by farmers which is described as a “model”. Another tableau was “Ane Bandi” (elephant wagon) in which the musicians performed during the procession and another one on the importance of safeguarding the environment with strict ‘no’ to cutting trees. After the Nishane and Naupath elephants’ majestic march, the cultural troupes made their entry into the procession. First, it was the Nadaswara team which started their performance followed by a saxophone presentation. The artists performing Veeragase, Kamsale and Dollu Kunita were among the highlights as they performed impressively. Nagari, Puja Kunita, Chili Pili Gombe, Kombu Kahale, Garudi Gombe and Chende Vadana were the other cultural and folk troupes that added colour to the procession. The last was the Yakshagana performance by a local team. Usually, all zilla panchayats in the State used to send their tableaux besides the government agencies and undertakings after getting their themes cleared. The procession used to get at least three troupes from every district. The pandemic altered the procession and its accompaniments. The artists hoped the next year’s Dasara would bring back the original glory of Jamboo Savari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cultural-troupes-tableaux-have-their-own-charm/article37015637.ece
16 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Warm response to a new practice in Mysuru||Signalling the start of a new tradition, the idol (utsavamoorthy) of Goddess Chamundeshwari was brought in a procession from Chamundi Hills to the palace ahead of the Jamboo Savari and was witnessed by a large number of devotees here on Friday. The practice all these years was to bring the idol in a vehicle a few hours before the Vijayadashmi procession or the Jamboo Savari and place it inside the palace, oblivious to the large gathering. The idol would then be shift ed to the golden howdah and hoisted on the elephant’s back a few minutes before the commencement of the Vijayadashmi procession. But the authorities this year decided to bring the idol in a separate procession from Chamundeshwari temple atop the Chamundi Hills to the palace to enable the general public and those who cannot make it to the Jamboo Savari, to get a glimpse of the deity. The district in-charge Minister S.T.Somashekar; S.A. Ramdas, G.T.Deve Gowda, MLAs; Pratap Simha, Mp, and others flagged off the procession that comprised cultural troupes and ensemble of musicians and members of various bhajan mandals besides priests and scholars chanting hymns. A special puja was conducted to the deity and the idol was taken around the temple to witness which a large crowd had gathered at the Chamundi Hills itself. The decorated idol was transferred to a motorised chariot which was embellished for the occasion and people gathered on both sides of the procession route to catch a glimpse since 8 a.m. The chariot with the idol slowly inched its way from the Chamundi Hills to Kurubarahalli Circle and then to Ittigegud where prayers were conducted near the Satyanarayana Swami temple. Crackers were lit to herald the arrival of the procession. The procession then passed through Mansara Road, Lokaranjan Road and J.C.Wadiyar Circle to the Jayamartanda Gate of the palace where it was received with due honours after which it was ushered into the Amba Vilas section of the palace. Given the response of the public, this could be a permanent feature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/warm-response-to-a-new-practice-in-mysuru/article37015636.ece
16 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Dasara illumination extended||On popular demand, the Dasara illumination, which was supposed to have been ended on Friday with the culmination of festivities here, has been extended by nine more days. The expansive illumination, that covers up to 102 km besides 40 junctions, has been a big hit, and the stakeholders of tourism industry and the locals had sought its extension to keep the momentum alive for few more days with the vacations on and tourists continuing to visit the city post-Dasara. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters in Mysuru after visiting Suttur Mutt that a decision has been taken to extend the illumination in view of increase in tourist footfall and also owing to the demand from the elected representatives and the locals. “I have come to know that a lot of visitors from various districts are thronging the city to watch the illumination which has been done well this year. The Minister in charge of Mysuru district too has sought an extension. Therefore, the decision was taken,” he said. Earlier, Mr. Bommai visited the mutt and sought the blessings of Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami. He was accompanied by his wife and other family members. He later went to the palace for the inauguration of Jamboo Savari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dasara-illumination-extended-by-nine-days/article37015251.ece

16 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KARNATAKA||Initiating kids into the world of letters||Thousands of children across the State were initiated into the world of letters at places of worship and cultural centres as part of Vidyarambham on Friday, signifying a return to a tradition disrupted by COVID-19 last year. With the pandemic threat still looming over the State, strict pandemic protocols were in place at all the venues. At most places, parents themselves took on the role of acharyas with the organisers providing guidance in the rituals. Many avoided the ritual of writing the letters on the tongue and instead opted to write on a plate of rice. Vidyarambham rituals were held at the Guruvayur Sreekrishna temple; Sree Vadakkunathan temple, Thrissur; Dakshina Mookambika temple, Kottayam; Chottanikkara Bhagawathy temple, Ernakulam; Sree Mahavishnu temple, Thirunelly; Sree Valliyoorkavu Bhagawathy temple, Mananthavady; Pallikunnu Mookambika temple and Attukal temple, Thiruvananthapuram; besides Thunchan Parambu, Tirur, Thunchan Smaraka Samithi, Iranimuttam, and Kumaran Asan Memorial, Thonakkal. The Chief Minister’s official residence Cliff House too turned into a venue for Vidyarambham. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan initiated four children, Neha, Niya, Kani and Fidel, into the world of letters.

16 October 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||STs unhappy with cancellation of school inaugural function||The cancellation of a function to inaugurate an Eklavya Model Residential School in Bandalli village of Yadgir district has caused a huge disappointment among the Scheduled Tribes and has also led to a tussle between the Kabbaliga-Koli community and followers of the former MLA and Chairman of Nijasharana Ambigara Chowdaiah Abhivruddi Nigama Baburao Chinchansur on the one side and Scheduled Tribes and district president of Maharshi Valmiki Nayaka Sangha Mareppa Nayak Mogdampur on the other. On Saturday last, Minister for Transport and Scheduled Tribes Welfare B. Sriramulu returned to Yadgir without inaugurating the Eklavya Model Residential School after Mr. Chinchansur stopped the Minister’s vehicle midway stating that the school cannot be inaugurated as he had not been invited to the function despite him putting immense efforts to build the school during his tenure as Minister. However, the Deputy Commissioner later issued a clarification stating that the former Minister had been invited to the function. This unexpected move by Mr. Chinchanur caused anger among the Scheduled Tribes and also Mr. Mareppa Nayak Mogdampur and followers of Minister Mr. Sriramulu who then staged a dharna and urged the Minister to inaugurate the school. However, Mr. Sriramulu decided not to go ahead with it and cancelled the inaugural programme. Requisition A day after the incident, Nagarathna Anpur and other leaders of the Kabbaliga-Koli community filed a requisition with the Superintendent of Police of Yadgir seeking an apology from Mr. Mogdampur for what they said using unparliamentary language against Mr. Chinchansur. Meanwhile, Mr. Mogdampur wrote on his Facebook page, along with a video of Ms. Anpur, and criticised Mr. Chinchansur for creating an embarrassing situation for the Minister and the district administration by forcing them to cancel a government programme and causing inconvenience to poor students who were expected a new building for them. He also said that he was ready to face any consequences, as he had not committed any mistake. Meanwhile, Mr. Chinchansur apologised to the Scheduled Tribes stating that the youth of the community had misunderstood him over the episode. He also made an effort to close the matter. According to Mr. Mogdampur, members of his community have submitted to Tahsildar of Shorapur a memorandum addressed to the Deputy Commissioner seeking action against Ms. Anpur and others.  The former Minister Baburao Chinchansur stopped Minister Sriramulu’s vehicle midway stating that the school cannot be inaugurated as he had not been invited to the function despite him putting immense efforts to build the school during his tenure as Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sts-unhappy-with-cancellation-of-school-inaugural-function/article37015654.ece

While SIK has seen the largest departure: 124%, Malnad has seen a 90% departure and Coastal 85%. North Interior Karnataka is the only region which has had normal rainfall with no departure from normal whatsoever. Karnataka on the whole has recorded large excess rainfall with a 62% departure from normal. KSNDMC officials attributed the current rains to two troughs in the Bay of Bengal as well the Arabian Sea, contributing to rain since last week. “Last year too, we saw a similar prolonged monsoon,” a senior official said. In 2019 too, the monsoon had a late withdrawal in October. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had recently said that in October alone, as many as 21 people had lost their lives in rain-related incidents in October, and since June, loss of crop over 4.71 lakh hectares has been estimated. A low pressure area over the Lakshadweep area and southeast Arabian sea, and also an east-west trough is expected to result in isolated heavy rainfall over Coastal, South Interior Karnataka and Malnad districts over the next two days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/16-districts-receive-large-excess-rainfall/article37015247.ece

Somashekar, Mayor Sundanda Palanetra, Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham, and Police Commissioner Chandragupta. The inauguration was followed by the national anthem and the 21-gun salute even as the elephants raised their trunks and the mahouts saluted as a mark of respect. This was Abhimanyu’s second Dasara as the lead elephant and he pulled it off brilliantly. Only six elephants took part in the procession, including tuskers Gopalaswamy, Dhananjaya, and Ashwathama. Earlier, the Chief Minister performed ‘Nandi Dwaja’ puja at the Balarama Gate, prior to flagging off the procession. The Jamboo Savari, in a normal year, used to have at least 30 to 35 cultural troupes and over 25 tableaux, besides 10-12 elephants, portraying the State’s rich cultural and folk diversity. With the pandemic still not over, the procession was shortened and cultural troupes were restricted to 20, including five tableaux. A tableau on ‘Azadi ka Amrutha Mahotsava’, marking the country’s 75th Independence day celebrations, was one of them. There was another tableau that spread the message on combating COVID-19. ‘Nagari’, ‘Puja Kunita’, ‘Chili Pili Gombe’, ‘Kombu Kahale’, ‘Garudi Gombe’, ‘Chende Vadana’ and other cultural and folk troupes added colour to the procession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/large-crowds-witness-jamboo-savari/article37015254.ece

He was speaking after visiting the art show on Friday. “I was really surprised to see Lokame Tharavadu. I have participated in the Kochi Biennale many times. The biennale is an international event that attracts all art lovers. It’s interesting Lokame Tharavadu, of the same nature as the biennale, is brought to Alappuzha, which has the speciality of being a heritage city,” Mr. Kamal said. “My opinion is that Lokame Tharavadu, where artists of the new and old generations come together, should continue. Even after this edition, it should continue on the soil of Alappuzha along with the biennale,” he said. Mr. Kamal said Lokame Tharavadu offered diversity of paintings and a great collage of pluralism. “Cinema is an art form that has reached out to the masses and has become popular. Painting is another perspective of it. Painting and sculpture existed here for centuries before the advent of cinema. I think painting is a reality of human life. Cinema does not often feel like a realistic portrayal of life. In painting, an artist sees ordinary people and their lives, their anxieties, hysteria, happiness and so many different expressions in many perspectives,” he said. The show, being organised by the Kochi Biennale Foundation with the support of the State Government, features the works of 267 artists in seven different venues in Alappuzha. Bose Krishnamachari has conceptualised and curated the exhibition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kamal-relishes-lokame-tharavadu/article37015479.ece

NOC sought The organisations have written to Principal Secretary, Environment and Ecological Department, demanding that the government should desist from giving permission to Rallis India Ltd. that has sought NOC to go ahead with field trials. The petitioners comprising Nammura Bhoomi Namagirali Anyarigalla (a forum of about 40 organisations including farmers’ unions, organic farming associations, farm labourers’ unions, Grama Seva Sangha, environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy, science and environment columnist Nagesh Hegde, and agri economist and former chairman of Karnataka Agriculture Prices Commission T.N. Prakash Kammaradi) have stated that the firm applied to the government on July 3 seeking permission to carry out trials. The petitioners pointed out that the State already has a Bt cotton variety. They argued that the State had, in fact, lost its rich diversity in cotton crops as most of the other farmer and nature-friendly native cotton varieties had been discontinued after the arrival of Bt cotton variety in 2002. They said there were global concerns about the negative impact of BT varieties on ecology and health. They argued that restricted field trials can also cause damage. With respect to maize, the petitioners said the government should encourage farmers to grow diverse varieties of food crops as against imposing monoculture of growing only one variety of maize. Other countries, states The petitioners maintained that the transgenic technology was not only harmful, but also a stale one. This was the reason why more than 20 countries had completely banned GM crops while half of the 28 European countries had declared themselves as free from GM crops, they said. Even in India, several states including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, and Gujarat have decided against allowing field trials of GM crops, they pointed out. They urged the government not to permit field trials for cotton and maize.  The petitioners maintained that the transgenic technology was not only harmful, but also a stale one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-experts-urge-govt-not-to-allow-field-trials-of-bt-cotton-maize/article37015270.ece
16 October 2021||Hyderabad,KERALA||Speculation rife over TRS MP rejoining Cong.||Is rebel Telangana Rashtra Samiti MP D. Srinivas planning ‘Ghar Wapsi’ to the Congress shortly? The answer seems to be in the affirmative, if the meeting of the former Congress veteran with Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president A. Revanth Reddy and working president Kusum Kumar on Thursday is any indication. What caught political circles by surprise is the lengthy discussion the three leaders had at the residence of Mr. Srinivas in MLA’s Colony in Jubilee Hills. The Congress leaders called on Mr. Srinivas, who is recovering from a shoulder fracture. While Congress circles maintained that the visit was only a courtesy call to enquire about the health of the former APCC president, the latest political developments did figure in the discussions that took place. The Backward Classes leader, who hails from Nizamabad district, has been lying low ever since differences cropped up between him and the TRS leadership. Though nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the TRS, Mr. Srinivas did not have smooth sailing in the new party allegedly due to the treatment meted out to him by the local TRS elected representatives and a former MP. Keeping away from all TRS activities, the Rajya Sabha member is understood to have made up his mind to quit the pink party in the next few months. He quit the Congress after losing the 2014 Assembly election and joined the TRS in 2015. He was Advisor to the government (Inter-State Affairs) in 2015 and, subsequently, nominated to the Rajya Sabha in June 2016. Mr. Srinivas’ term ends in June next year, but indications are that he might quit his MP seat some time around Sankranti. Sources privy to the recent discussions told The Hindu that Mr. Srinivas had dropped enough hints about his plans to come back to the Congress soon. Highly placed Congress sources said a senior leader had telephonic discussions with Mr. Srinivas two months ago. “Mr. Srinivas was a very senior leader in the Congress party and does not need any introduction. He has access to Sonia Gandhi and other seniors. So, it will not be a difficult task for him to return. His presence in the party will boost the morale of the Backward Classes,” the sources said. Sources close to Mr. Srinivas said that he was miffed at the manner in which the TRS leadership treated him after his entry into the party. After promising him a pride of place with an important role in organisational work, the former PCC chief was completely ignored and gradually sidelined. The distance between him and the TRS top brass grew so much that he was not even invited to party meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/speculation-rife-over-trs-mp-rejoining-cong/article37014904.ece

As per the new rule curve announced by the Central Water Commission (CWC) which is valid till October 20, the blue alert must be issued when the water level touches 2,390.86 ft. The water level in the reservoir stood at 2,390.98 ft at 5 p.m. on Friday, which is 86.5% of the total storage level. The water level on the same day last year was 2,392.52 ft (87.93 %). A KSEB official said the rain in the catchment area had subsided and the inflow through the Periyar also had gone down. The water level reached the blue alert mark at 9 a.m. on the day. The chances of opening the dam shutters are remote as there is a difference of 6 ft to the the orange alert level (2,396.86 ft) and 7 ft to the red alert level (2,397.86 ft). The full reserve level of the dam is 2,403.50 ft, he said. The official said the blue alert may be withdrawn when the level is revised on October 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/blue-alert-sounded-for-idukki-dam/article37015490.ece
16 October 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Move to amend Forest Act draws greens’ flak||The Centre's move to amend the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 has evoked strong protest from environmental organisations. The proposed amendments seek to restrict community access to forest resources while offering relaxations for commercial activities such as safaris, zoos, mining and other non-forest use on forest land. N. Badusha, president, Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti, an environmental organisation, says that the Forest Conservation Act is “the most powerful weapon” in the country to conserve the remaining 30% area of forest land. If the existing Act is amended, it would sound the death knell for the remaining patches of forest in the country, Mr. Badusha said. The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had invited comments and feedback on the proposals within a month of its release. But the one-month time limit is a breach of pre-legislative consultation policy, says Mr, Badusha. Though several High Courts had directed to publish such notifications in local languages as well, the MoEFCC has published it only in English so far, he says. P.A. Vinayan, president, Ferns Nature Conservation Society (FNCS), an NGO based in Wayanad, says if the amendments are effected, this would lead to massive destruction of forest land, resulting in desertification, water scarcity and decimation of the agriculture sector. As many as 14 amendments are proposed and each proposal has a double-talk, he says. Contrasting norms When the document suggests shrinking the scope of the Act in the context of business and development, it talks of expanding the scope of the Act when it comes to community ownership over forest resources, he points out. It offers full relaxation to businesses such as safaris, zoos, linear projects, mining and other non-forest use on forest land. Whereas, it restricts and tightens the scope for community access and centuries-old traditional ownership by local communities, Mr. Vinayan adds. The organisations have sought the intervention of the State government.

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court, while disposing of a petition filed by a city resident, had asked the civic administrators to complete the tree count within four months. The civic body will convene a meeting of the Town Planning Standing Committee of the corporation to chalk out the formalities for the census. The Centre for Heritage Environment and Development and a non-governmental agency will be roped in for the job, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. Incidentally, the local body had counted 6,443 trees that were located on public places in the city in a unique exercise conducted 11 years ago. The census report, Trees of Kochi, was released by the then Mayor Mercy Williams at a function held at the council hall. The counting was carried out by the Rajagiri outREACH of the Rajagiri School of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, for the Kochi Corporation. In public places The survey results identified 2,086 large trees, 1,953 medium-sized and 1,761 small tones in the city. The volunteers had also spotted 542 saplings in public places of Kochi. While the survey focused on trees in public places, those located in private holdings were not covered in the exercise. The survey was greeted by criticism that the trees located on public places accounted for less than two per cent of the total number of trees in the city and majority were on private holdings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-to-carry-out-tree-census-in-city/article37015445.ece
16 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Pampa desilting: Union Ministry seeks counsel||The Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has sought the opinion of the Ministry of Law on whether the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 has an overriding effect on the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 in the case related to the removal of sand from the Pampa river pending before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The southern bench of the tribunal had constituted an expert committee after it took suo motu notice of The Hindu report ‘Forest dept. told to permit sand removal from Pampa’ published on May 30 last year. The State respondents were told to respond to the circumstances under which the National Disaster Management Act was invoked for the purpose of desilting. The Opposition had accused the Left Democratic Front Government of having used flood preparedness as a cover to bypass the Forest Conservation Act. Centre’s approval In its affidavit filed before the tribunal, the Ministry stated that prior approval of the Centre is required for carrying out any non-forestry activity. It is pertinent to note that the removal of sand or debris from the river during 2019 was done after obtaining clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. But the same clearance was not obtained for the removal of debris in the Pampa and Kakki rivers in 2020, it said. The Ministry pointed out that any decision on the use of forest land for non-forestry purposes is done on the basis of field data and other scientific/field reports/inputs on the area by an expert committee. It is true that both the Acts have non-obstante clauses, it said. The tribunal had sought the view of the Ministry as to whether permission under the Forest Conservation Act was required for such activities. It was also asked whether the Disaster Management Act will override the environmental laws. The legal opinion of the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, was sought in view of the ambiguity in considering the overriding effect between the provisions of both the Acts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pampa-desilting-union-ministry-seeks-counsel/article37015482.ece

Acquitting all the accused, Jomy Anu Issac, the Judicial First Class Magistrate 6, Ernakulam, concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. All the witnesses to the occurrence of the alleged offence, including the complainant Juby Poulose, a businessman, turned hostile to the prosecution. There is absolutely no evidence to prove the prosecution case, the court concluded. The criminal case booked against Mr. Hussain was the first one registered by the anti-goonda squad formed by the previous LDF government. The arrest of Mr. Hussain, a former Kalamassery area secretary and the Ernakulam district committee member of the CPI(M), had forced the party on the backfoot in the district. Mr. Hussain, who was suspended from the organisation after an inner-party inquiry, was reinstated in January this year. The prosecution case was that Mr. Hussain and the second accused, Karukapilly Siddique, restrained and threatened Saju John, the staff of Mr. Poulose on June 10, 2015. The next day, Siddique and the third accused, K. K. Faisal, forcibly took Mr. Poulose to the Kalamassery area committee office of the CPI(M) and threatened to eliminate him and his family if he didn’t settle the dispute with Sheela Thomas, the fourth accused in the case. Again on June 12, Mr. Poulose was called to the CPI(M) office and criminally intimidated to settle the dispute. During the trial, the prosecution declared Mr. Poulose as hostile as he submitted that he didn’t lodge a complaint against Ms. Thomas. He also denied all his averments and allegations made by him in the First Information Statement. He also deposed that the case between him and Ms. Thomas was settled, the court noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-leader-acquitted-as-witnesses-turn-hostile/article37015446.ece

The arrested were identified as Kochappa, 27; his father Joy, 58; and mother Molly, 55, of Pindimana. They stand accused of murdering Eldhose, who ran a studio by the name Seven Arts in Chelad. The police said that the victim had given Kochappa, who was largely unemployed, a loan of Rs. 3 lakh. The victim had been reportedly demanding it back following which Kochappa invited him to his house in the guise of settling it on Sunday night. “While at their home, the father and son jointly hammered him to death using an axe. They also threw away his mobile phone,” the police said. The duo then allegedly took the body sandwiched between them on the victim’s own scooter to a nearby canal. The body was abandoned in the canal and the scooter alongside. Later, the mother burnt the axe used for the alleged murder into ashes. She also recovered the mobile phone and smashed it into smithereens. The body was found on Monday morning and the event initially got passed off as an accident. However, the fact that the canal had no water at that time, coupled with the post mortem report that the injury was caused by a blunt object, raised the suspicion of the police. Also, they found it odd that his mobile phone was also missing. A probe around the missing phone turned out to be the breakthrough as the victim’s family told the police that he had told them that he was on the way to Kochappa’s house to settle the debt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-member-family-arrested-for-murder/article37015447.ece

It is claimed to be the State’s first artificial heart implant. The patient, undergoing treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy for the past six years, was admitted to the hospital with cardiogenic shock, breathing difficulty and hypotension in early September. But she had to be put on ventilator support after her condition deteriorated with ongoing heart failure and pulmonary edema. She was sustained on VA ECMO for 20 days and while the kidney and liver functions were brought back to normal, the cardiac function was just 20%. This was when an LVAD (left ventricular assist device) implant was suggested. LVAD is a mechanical pump implanted in patients with heart failure which helps the bottom left chamber of heart (left ventricle) pump blood out to the body. The doctors then performed a nine-hour surgery and the patient, the communication said, was stable and safe. Along with cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Sujith, Dr. Anand Kumar V.

The incident took place on Thursday. According to the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA), the doctor on duty was allegedly assaulted by Soorandu West panchayat president and another person for refusing to confirm the death of a drowning victim. Reportedly, the doctor was putting a cast on a patient's leg when the body was brought to the hospital in an ambulance. The president said the body belonged to a person who died two hours ago and asked the doctor to verify the death. The doctor, however, refused to verify the death of a drowning victim without taking the body to examination room. He said it was mandatory to do so since it was a case of unnatural death. All deaths of unnatural manner are usually examined to find if it's a homicide, suicide or accident. With the refusal, the president and his accomplice started assaulting the doctor, who was later admitted to Kottarakkara taluk hospital. Reportedly, the president and a man named Kanjiravila Ajayan phoned the hospital superintendent later and threatened to go ahead with the complaint. Strike, OP boycott “The doctors at Sasthamcotta taluk hospital will go on a strike and boycott OP until the culprits are arrested under the Hospital Protection Act,” said KGMOA president Dr. Reena and secretary Dr. Roshan Raj.

16 October 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Greenfield road stretch to be rearranged: NHAI||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has said the alignment of the proposed Greenfield Road from Thenmala to Kadampattukonam on National Highway 744 will be rearranged, avoiding public institutions, residential areas, mosques, temples, places of worship, and schools as much as possible, N.K. Premachandran, MP, has said. The decision has been taken at a meeting held with the NHAI authorities to discuss complaints received from various places regarding the alignment. Steps have been taken to rearrange the alignment so that it does not include the Kuriode Bhadrakali temple, Pathadi masjid, Anapuzhakkal masjid, and other densely populated areas. If land or buildings have to be acquired for the road, owners will be given the maximum market price and compensation prior to three years from notice. Officials say the land will be acquired at a fair price and the consultancy in charge has been instructed to rearrange the alignment so that the local people can get the maximum benefit from the new road. Officials have informed the MP that the plan is to finalise the alignment as soon as possible and complete the road construction at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greenfield-road-stretch-to-be-rearranged-nhai/article37015470.ece
16 October 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Rubber plantations open up for herbs||Aimed at augmenting the income of those growing natural rubber, the Rubber Board has embarked on a scheme to promote intercropping of medicinal plants in rubber plantations with the support of Ayurveda companies. Officials said here recently that the programme was launched on a pilot basis in association with the Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala on the rubber estates in Malappuram. The Ayurveda company has executed a memorandum of understanding in this regard with the Rubber Producers Societies (RPS), which also includes a buy-back arrangement for harvested produce at a rate fixed in advance. Intercropping Though the practice of intercropping has not yet flourished on a large scale, probably due to lack of awareness and technical inputs, experiments conducted at some locations over the past two years have yielded good results. “The area of intercropping, currently being held in 10 acres of land, is being scaled up based on response. More Ayurveda companies have come up expressing interest in the scheme while consultations are also on with the State Medicinal Plant Board to get subsidies for growers,” said an official. Under the project, the Rubber Board plans a sequential intercropping of medicinal plants by taking into account the availability of land and sunshine. Increase yield It helps increase yields by doubling up on available growing space, thus ensuring better returns than mono-cropping. During the initial two to three years of the rubber plantation cycle, plants that require sunlight will be cultivated, followed by those growing in partial shade during the next three years. In mature plantations, shade-tolerant varieties such as Karimkurinji, Atalodakam and Chuvannakoduveli can be grown. As part of the initiative, the Rubber Research Institute of India has also initiated a programme to generate quality planting materials of endangered medicinal plants using biotechnological tools.  Programme launched on a pilot basis in association with Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala on estates in Malappuram||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rubber-plantations-open-up-for-herbs/article37015468.ece
16 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Hundreds step into the world of learning||This was the first public outing they could remember over the past two years for most of the children who stepped into the world of learning on Friday, undergoing the Vidyarambham ceremony. They were barely a year old when the whole world shut down. For almost two years, they led a sheltered life, rarely getting a view of the world outside, for they were deemed too vulnerable to COVID. Thrown into the midst of a crowd all of a sudden, some of them were in a panic mode, while some cried, only to smile later as they drew letters on a platter of rice. That they were initiated into the world of letters by familiar persons such as parents or grandparents was the saving grace, as they were in comfortable surroundings, rather than in the lap of an unfamiliar priest or celebrity. Hundreds of kids of the age group 2 to 4 in the district were initiated into the world of letters on Friday, the last day of Navarathri. The Vidyarambham ceremony was held in every temple and some cultural centres across the district. The rituals began around 8 a.m. following the COVID protocol and the rules set by the State government as well as the Malabar Devaswom Board. Families had to turn up with their own platter of rice. However, the Azhakodi Devi temple in Kozhikode City had offered rice platters to the kids, well sanitised after each use. To avoid the risk of COVID, the usual practise of getting the kids initiated by a well-known person of letters or priests was abandoned this year. Instead, the responsibility fell on the parents or relatives of the kids. Some parents were not ready to risk their child’s exposure to a crowd even for Vidyarambham and hence chose to carry out the ritual in their private spaces. In Kannur Despite the COVID-19 scare, temples were flooded with people, who came with their children in large numbers to initiate them into the world of letters during the Vidyarambham ceremony in Kannur on Friday. Even though enough care was taken to follow the COVID protocol, it turned out into a difficult task for the temple authorities and police personnel deputed for crowd management. In Pallikunnu Mookambika temple, the crowd gathered since early morning. The administration allowed no more than 500 persons on the occasion. It was no different at Muzhakkunnu Mrindagasaileswari temple, where people arrived from various places. More than 700 persons booked here for the ceremony. Volunteers and the police were deputed in large numbers to control the crowd. In Wayanad Hundreds of children, along with their parents, took part in the Vidyarambham ritual in Wayanad district. Temples had made elaborate arrangements for the ceremony adhering to the COVID-19 protocol. The ritual was performed in all major temples under the Malabar Devaswom Board in the district, including Sree Valliyoorkavu Bhagavathi temple, Mananthavady; Sree Mahavishnu temple, Thirunelly; and Sree Mahadeva temple, Thrissilery, as well as Sree Maha Ganapathi temple at Sulthan Bathery and Sree Mariyamman temples at Sulthan Bathery and Kalpetta. The ritual was not performed in those temples last year owing to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hundreds-step-into-the-world-of-learning/article37015434.ece

The Department of Culture recently announced that the song was favoured due to its secular nature. Varughese Mathew, Principal of St. Xaviers' College of Arts and Science in Kozhikode, has received a letter from the department informing that it has been shortlisted. He had nominated the song for Kerala Geetham. It was in 2018 that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called for a song with secular values to be chosen as the State’s official anthem. The Department of Culture and Kerala Sahitya Akademi received hundreds of entries, of which fewer 10 have been shortlisted. Prayer song Mr. Mathew had made the nomination when he was Principal of the Little Flower Institute of Social Sciences and Health College, Kaithappoyil, Kozhikode, in 2018. Uniform prayer He had earlier pushed the song as a uniform prayer song at schools in the State. “This anthem played a key role in inculcating the true spirit of the NSS among thousands of youngsters in the State,” said Mr. Mathew. However, the author of the song has not been ascertained and there are at least five claimants. The tune was set by Mavelikara Gopinath. The song emphasises the ideals of the movement and is sung during all NSS gatherings. It gained popularity, along with the movement, which became active on campuses in the State in the 1990s.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nss-anthem-shortlisted-for-kerala-geetham/article37015435.ece

16 October 2021||MYSURU,KERALA||Scaled-down Jamboo Savari this year||The famed Jamboo Savari was the shortest and quickest for the second year in a row with the procession, as a part of ‘Nada Habba’, limited to Amba Vilas Palace precincts. COVID-19 precautions were conspicuously missing with SOPs thrown to the winds, with large crowds turning up despite curbs to witness the annual spectacle. Abhimanyu, the lead elephant, had an easier task to accomplish as he had to march carrying the 750-kg golden howdah for a shorter distance (around 400 metres) instead of the usual 5-km-long distance on the designated route. The procession that began around 4.45 p.m. concluded in less than an hour. The event was limited to 500 people but the turnout exceeded that to a large extent. Overall, the celebrations were simple and confined to keeping with the centuries-old tradition alive. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai flagged off the Jamboo Savari, showering flowers on the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari placed in the golden howdah and carried by Abhimanyu in the company of ‘kumki’ elephants Kaveri and Chaitra, from an elevated podium. He was accompanied by Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court Ritu Raj Awasthi, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, scion of the erstwhile Mysore royal family, district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar, Mayor Sundanda Palanetra, Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham, and Police Commissioner Chandragupta. The inauguration was followed by the national anthem and the 21-gun salute even as the elephants raised their trunks and the mahouts saluted as a mark of respect. This was Abhimanyu’s second Dasara as the lead elephant and he pulled it off brilliantly. Only six elephants took part in the procession, including tuskers Gopalaswamy, Dhananjaya, and Ashwathama. Earlier, the Chief Minister performed ‘Nandi Dwaja’ puja at the Balarama Gate, prior to flagging off the procession. The Jamboo Savari, in a normal year, used to have at least 30 to 35 cultural troupes and over 25 tableaux, besides 10-12 elephants, portraying the State’s rich cultural and folk diversity. With the pandemic still not over, the procession was shortened and cultural troupes were restricted to 20, including five tableaux. A tableau on ‘Azadi ka Amrutha Mahotsava’, marking the country’s 75th Independence day celebrations, was one of them. There was another tableau that spread the message on combating COVID-19. ‘Nagari’, ‘Puja Kunita’, ‘Chili Pili Gombe’, ‘Kombu Kahale’, ‘Garudi Gombe’, ‘Chende Vadana’ and other cultural and folk troupes added colour to the procession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scaled-down-jamboo-savari-this-year/article37014900.ece

16 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Computer Science is top choice||Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) remains the most preferred engineering branch in the State, thanks to a resurgent campus placement trend boosted by the technology sector. The College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, (CET), followed by Government Engineering College (GEC), Thrissur, and TKM College of Engineering, Kollam, continue to hold sway over engineering and architecture aspirants. The first phase of allotments to engineering colleges in the State has reaffirmed the status quo as far as students’ priorities for years are concerned. State merit seats for CSE have been filled with students having ranks up to 95 in the CET. The corresponding ranks in the Thrissur GEC and TKM College of Engineering are 265 and 468 respectively. Big firms Jiji C.V., Principal, CET, which recorded “over 200%” placements last year, says the long-standing demand for Computer Science and related streams has been reinforced by the current trend in campus recruitments. This year too, 56 placements have already been recorded by the seventh-semester CSE batch. These include two students who have received placements from Amazon, which has offered an annual package of Rs. 32 lakh, and five by Oracle for Rs. 16.64 lakh per annum. Other streams The other engineering streams that have found takers in order of priority are Electronics and Communication Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering. The last State merit seat to be filled among government and government-aided colleges has been allotted to the 7,762nd rank-holder for the Instrumentation and Control Engineering stream at the NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad. Government Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara, functioning under the Institute of Human Resource Development (IHRD), has remained the most attractive option among government-controlled self-financing colleges. Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi, has shone bright among private colleges. The college, which had received autonomous status last year, has received State merit students up to the 2,673rd rank in CSE. While the available seats of most courses in government and government aided engineering colleges have already been filled, the allotments could witness further movement in next rounds with many students who have joined the CET and other top colleges likely to seek admission in IITs, NITs and medical colleges.

16 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||KPCC to go ahead with revamp||The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) is poised to forge ahead with the second phase of reorganisation despite murmurs of dissent from within its rank and file. A senior leader says All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar, now in Bihar, is scheduled to announce the list of KPCC office-bearers once he reaches New Delhi. New faces The Congress has whittled down the number of office-bearers from 450 to 51. It has strived to strike a social balance.  The party has emphasised youth and competency. The Congress has opted for new faces instead of giving organisational responsibilities to leaders holding elected office. Caste, communal, and gender demographics has influenced KPCC office-bearer nomination in some measure. “It is a Herculean task to ensure that the revamped KPCC reflects a microcosm of Kerala society,” he says. The AICC has asked the KPCC to keep the organisational rejig rancour-free. However, the party’s State leadership has informed the AICC that it is a tall order to “keep all senior leaders pleased.” Moreover, the KPCC has resolved not to allow any individual leader to hold the party to ransom by raising the spectre of defection to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Parleys Nevertheless, it was willing to parley with and provide reasonable accommodation to leaders aligned to different factions. The AICC has reportedly thrown its weight behind the incumbent KPCC leadership. It reportedly felt that a lack of clear helmsmanship has not augured well for the party. Moreover, factions has learned little from the 2016 defeat. The leaders had not arguably done a proper introspection and devised a strategy for the 2021 elections. The election debacle had shocked the previous KPCC leadership’s self-assured hubris that it would carry the day despite the heavy odds. Meanwhile, the national leadership has reportedly not taken kindly to a perceived movement in the Congress in Kerala to single out and attack AICC general secretary, organisation, K.C. Venugopal. Mr. Venugopal had recently told reporters in New Delhi that he had not intervened in the nomination process, which is the prerogative of the State leadership. Perils of delay The KPCC is also of the view that any further delay in revamp would lend credence to the CPI(M) theory that Congress is hard-pressed to put its house in order. Further procrastination would also send a wrong message to the UDF constituents.  The Congress has opted for new faces instead of giving organisational responsibilities to leaders holding elected office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kpcc-to-go-ahead-with-revamp/article37015441.ece

Though the earnings were not huge, life was comfortable, until COVID-19 struck. Now, with most of the companies still in work-from-home mode, and most employees preferring that or a hybrid mode with a few days in office, their business has reduced to a trickle. “We used to get around 50 cars daily, earning Rs. 9,500 in fixed salary and commission for extra cars washed. Now, only seven of us are here, with the rest moving on to other temporary jobs. We now work only three days a week and get not even five cars to wash on most days. The salary has come down by half and there is no commission either. Most of us have been struggling to get by since March last year. Unless the work-from-home trend changes, things will not improve,” says Ms. Chandran. Although the job scene in the IT sector has improved with more recruitments and fewer job losses over the past few months, the other businesses around the tech parks, including restaurants, vehicle services, hostels and house rentals are struggling as only few companies have partially reopened their office operations. Autorickshaw drivers Lalu has been an autorickshaw driver in and around Technopark for 17 years, witnessing the expansion of the IT park over these years. Two months ago, he sold his autorickshaw for a mere Rs. 20,000, and now does odd jobs. “Around 45 autorickshaw drivers used to depend just on the Technopark. Now, there are only around five in the area. In the past few months, I have done everything from masonry work to fish sales. I now ride a pickup autorickshaw on hire, because it has become impossible earn a livelihood by driving autorickshaw around the park. I need to take care of my three children.From the look of it, it will take some time for things to turn around,” says Mr. Lalu. Restaurant workers Nessi Shiju used to work at a restaurant inside Technopark, which has 16 staff members, including 10 women. With the restaurants closing down during the pandemic, her family has been surviving on her husband’s meagre income as a photographer, which has also come down after the COVID-19 outbreak. “Some women from the rural areas have now taken up Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Schema works. Some do housework in flats. I have not landed any other job. The expense of the education of our two children and the home loan are becoming too much to bear,” says Ms. Shiju. Hostel owners Vineetha Antony, who has been running a hostel for IT employees at Kazhakuttam, is now seeing signs of revival. Her facility, in which 12 people used to stay, had remained closed since March 2020. This month, two have returned. But, normalcy is still a long way away. John M. Thomas, CEO, IT Parks Kerala, says that only around 15% of employees in IT parks have returned to work from office. While some companies have been proactive in shifting back to office, many are taking a wait-and-watch approach.

While some families held Vidyarambham for their children at home due to the COVID-19 situation, many others thronged temples and other venues. The numbers were, however, considerably lower than those of the pre-COVID-19 era. Parents, grandparents Vidyarambham rituals organised by temples saw a good turnout, but the pandemic norms prompted changes in the ceremony like last year. At the Saraswathi Mandapam at Poojappura, the children were guided in writing their first letters by their parents or grandparents and not priests or scholars as used to be the norm. They inscribed the invocation to Lord Ganapathy on the children’s tongues with a gold ring and wrote ‘Harishree’ in Malayalam with their index fingers on rice-filled platters. ‘Acharyas’ were present to offer guidance. Parents were also required to bring their own rice and trays for the ritual. As many as 915 children wrote their first words at the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple. Chief priest Narayanan Anujan Namboothiripad of Puliyanoor Ilam led the ceremony at Karikkakom Sri Chamundi Temple. At Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, 150 children were guided by scholars. Over 100 children took part in a separate ceremony at the Navaratri Mandapam nearby. General Education Minister V. Sivankutty inaugurated the ceremony organised by Thidambu, the arts and cultural organisation of Travancore Devaswom Board employees. Cultural organisations, including Thunchan Smaraka Samithi, Iranimuttam; and Kumaran Asan Memorial, Thonnakkal; too organised similar ceremonies. Chief Secretary V.P.

16 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Rein in exodus of students, says CM||Teachers in the higher education sector should ponder over its current state of affairs and attempt to rein in the drain of students to other States and abroad, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was inaugurating the 63rd annual conference of the All Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association (AKPCTA) here on Thursday. “Sadly, we do not offer the courses which higher education aspirants want to pursue. We must expand our bouquet of courses, offering students a wide choice. Each higher education institution must aim at enhancing academic quality. Full-fledged libraries that can be accessed by students anytime must be in place. Universities, research institutions and colleges must all aspire to become centres of excellence. Teachers have a vital role in the government’s efforts to attain such goals,” he said. Foreign students He pointed out that the State attracted several foreign students owing to its firm belief in secular harmony and democracy. However, the Centre pursued a different path by attempting to divide the public through its policies. The Chief Minister also cautioned against alleged attempts made by the Union Government and the Sangh Parivar in distorting history to create false narratives of the country’s independence movement. “There have also been dangerous attempts to propagate superstitions at the expense of scientific thought. The academic community has a crucial role to play in exposing such designs,” he said. Teachers’ workload Higher Education Minister R. Bindu, who presided, said an expert panel would soon be formed to resolve issues pertaining to workload of teachers.

16 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) backs Riyas on remark about contractor-MLA nexus||The CPI(M) on Friday backed Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas' stance that MLAs should not accompany civic contractors to his office. CPI(M) State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said Mr. Riyas’ position was in concord with the party's approach. The Minister had merely mirrored the party's stance. The CPI(M) had issued strict guidelines for Ministers and their staff. It has mandated that the government take decisions independent of personal recommendations. However, Ministers should give a patient hearing to legislators and address issues they raise expeditiously. Mr. Vijayaraghavan rejected speculation that the CPI(M) legislative party had slammed Mr. Riyas for cautioning legislators against coming to his office in the company of civic contractors. Reports had suggested that CPI(M) legislator A.M. Shamseer had slammed Mr. Riyas for making such a statement in the Assembly. When contacted, Mr. Shamseer said the narrative was pure media conjecture. No apologies In Kozhikode, Mr. Riyas said the report that the CPI(M) legislative party had chided him was media inference. "There was no such criticism and I did not apologise as suggested by some sections of the press. Mine was a well thought-out observation in the Assembly", he said. Mr. Riyas said the official-contractor nexus was a primary avenue for corruption. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had flagged it, and he had merely warned legislators of the peril. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan told The Hindu that Mr. Riyas' remark was unwarranted. Non-passage of Bills often impeded civic works. Legislators had the inalienable right to take up such matters with the Minister, he said. “There is no big-ticket corruption in such matters. It is the prerogative of the MLAs, irrespective of their political affiliation, to ensure that development works continue unimpeded in their constituencies,” he said. Congress leaders P. T. Thomas and K. Babu slammed Mr. Riyas. Mr. Babu said Mr. Riyas had portrayed legislators in poor light and he would raise it in the Assembly as a breach of parliamentary privilege.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-backs-riyas-on-remark-about-contractor-mla-nexus/article37015497.ece

Vijayaraghavan on Friday raised the possibility of United Democratic Front (UDF) alliance partners rejecting the ‘anti-development’ posturing of the Congress party. Defending the Left Democratic Front (LDF) Government’s infrastructure development drive, he said Malappuram had initially witnessed protests against land acquisition for national Highway development. The strike impeded NH work from Kuttipuram to Ramanattukara. However, soon people realised that some quarters had misled them. Displaced families realised that their fears were out of place when the government compensated them richly. Moreover, the administration permitted residents to salvage reusable material from dismantled buildings. Soon, they voluntarily removed impediments to the NH project. He said the Congress had opposed Kerala's ambitious semi-high-speed railway project, SilverLine, needlessly. It had sought to sow confusion in the minds of the people. However, the public would see through the Congress party’s deception. He said the LDF was not against Thiruvananthapuram airport modernisation. He said the CPI(M) State secretariat, which met here, had expressed satisfaction with the State Government’s progress. In the initial 100 days of governance, the LDF had handed over 12,000 newly constructed modern dwellings to struggling homeless families. Another 80,000 houses are nearing completion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/allies-will-reject-congress-stand-on-silverline-says-cpim/article37015439.ece

The district administration has urged the government to allow people to freely enter Karnataka, as the incidence of the epidemic has reduced significantly in all the three States. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has sent a letter to Tushar Girinath, Principal Secretary, Revenue and member-secretary, State Executive Committee on COVID-19 management, to exempt the need for RT-PCR certificate. “The COVID-19 positivity rate in the two neighbouring States has come down significantly. Belagavi shares a border with these two States. A lot of people need to commute between these States due to business and trade. Such movement would be facilitated if the restriction is removed,” he said. “NWKRTC, which operates buses between these States, has requested the district administration to allow free movement of commuters. The Kolhapur district administration has also made the same request,” the DC said. The State Executive Committee had made a negative RT-PCR certificate mandatory for travellers from the two States, whether they come by bus or private vehicle. District and Belagavi policy enforced the rule by setting up checkposts on the Kolhapur-Belagavi highway and Sakali-Belagavi highway. Commuters were stopped and their documents checked. Rapid Antigen Test Commuters who did not have the certificate but insisted on crossing the border had to undergo a Rapid Antigen Test in a makeshift testing centre set up near the checkpost.

The firecracker industry was concentrated around Sivakasi in southern Tamil Nadu and about eight lakh workers were involved in the industry for their livelihood. Stating that it was the largest in the country, he also referred to reports that these four governments have imposed a ban on the sale of firecrackers during this festival. “I understand that you have taken this decision based on concerns regarding air pollution. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Supreme Court has already banned certain categories of polluting firecrackers and now, green crackers with significantly less emissions are being manufactured. Therefore a blanket ban on firecrackers is not reasonable.

They are now using the British policy of divide and rule. They will now divide us on caste lines. Then we have to stand together as a Marathi. When it comes to non-Marathi, we have to stand united as a Hindu (against BJP),” said Mr. Thackeray in his annual Dussehra rally address. This was Mr. Thackeray’s first offline speech in over two years and lasted for more than an hour. Reiterating that he is a proud Hindu who sees his Hindutva as nationalism, the Sena chief referred to a speech by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat where he spoke of all Indians having the same ancestors. “If our ancestors are same, then who were the ancestors of those farmers who are protesting? Of those killed in Lakhimpur-Kheri? Do you accept what is happening to them Bhagwatji? Do people accept this?” he asked. The Chief Minister wanted to know whether the use of Central agencies such as CBI, ED and IT against political opponents is also a part of Hindutva. Targeting wives and children is not machismo, but “unmanly,” he said. Pointing out increasing interference of the Centre in State matters, Mr. Thackeray said if the Constitution has given equal rights then all States must come together to stop Centre’s interference. “It is time that the rights of State and Centre must be discussed. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar while writing the constitution had said that States and Centre will have equal rights, except in three sectors of emergency, foreign attack and foreign affairs,” Mr. Thackeray said. Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Pankaja Munde, at a Dussehra rally called by her at Gopinathgadh (named in memory of her father and senior BJP leader, the late Gopinath Munde) in Beed district, took jibes at her own party in the Centre and the State saying while the opposition [BJP] was interested only in toppling the ruling MVA, the latter was solely intent on clinging to power at any cost.

16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU third cut-off list to be released today||With undergraduate admissions under the first and second cut-off lists completed at Delhi University, 51,974 candidates have secured admission to 70,000 seats on offer. The third cut-off list is scheduled to be released on Saturday. But university officials said that colleges are unlikely to offer any major reduction in the required cut-off for admission in general category seats as many colleges are dealing with the problem of admitting more candidates than seats on offer despite asking for near perfect cut-off scores. On Friday, a Delhi University admission official said that at 5 p.m., the university had received 1,18,878 applications for its undergraduate seats under the second cut-off list and 51,974 had completed the payment formalities at the time of closing of the payment gateway to secure admission. Under the first cut-off list, 36,130 candidates had secured their admission out of 60,904 applicants. A total of 2.6 lakh candidates had registered on the university portal seeking admission to various undergraduate programmes offered by the university. Top picks The third cut-off list is expected to have more colleges close the admission process. Under the second cut-off list, Hindu College has closed admission in courses such as English, History, Political Science, Physics, Chemistry and Maths while Lady Shri Ram College had closed admission in Maths. Ramjas had closed admission in B.Com (Hons) while Miranda House had closed admission in English, Political Science, Physics, Chemistry and Maths. SRCC, which has asked for a 100% cut-off for its B.Com (Hons) and BA (Hons) Economics, had reduced its cut-off to 99.12% and 99.75%, respectively, and is likely to offer a further reduction as all the seats have not been filled. Even lesser known DU colleges like Bharati College had closed admission in most of the courses it offers. Switching options According to the university’s admission rules, a candidate who applied in any cut-off and had made the fee payment but later wishes to take admission in any subsequent cut-off, subject to meeting the eligibility conditions and required cut-off, will have to cancel his or her admission and re-apply on the admission portal. A non-refundable cancellation fee of Rs. 1,000 will be levied. The cancellation option will be available only once in a particular cut-off. If, after applying for a cut-off, a candidate cancels his or her admission, she or he will not be able to apply again for the same cut-off. “The total number of cancellations will be restricted to (n-1) where “n” is the total number of cut-off lists. No movement will be allowed during the special cut-off/s and special drive/s,” the university said. At the start of the admission process, Delhi University had said that it would release up to five cut-off lists depending on the number of seats vacant as well as special drives and special cut-off lists to fill reserved seats that remain vacant at some of the off-campus colleges over the years. The entire admission process is scheduled to be wrapped up by November 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/du-third-cut-off-list-to-be-released-today/article37015384.ece
16 October 2021||New Delhi,||On Vijayadashami, Kejriwal hopes ‘Ravana-like Corona’ will end soon||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that Lord Shri Ramchandra had not killed any particular person, but killed adharma with his dharma, and that he prayed that the entire country gets freedom from this ‘Ravana-like Corona’. “All of us have seen Ramlila and how Lord Shri Ramchandra killed Ravana. It is not the killing of any particular person. It is in a way the victory of dharma over adharma,” he said. The CM attended the Ravan Dahan programme organised by the Luv-Kush Ramlila Committee on the occasion of Vijayadashami near Red Fort in Chandni Chowk. He ceremoniously lit the 30 feet effigies of the three demon kings — Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Meghnad — by shooting arrows at them and later participated in the aarti of Lord Shri Ram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/on-vijayadashami-kejriwal-hopes-ravana-like-corona-will-end-soon/article37015375.ece
16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU likely to release its third cut-off list today||With undergraduate admission under the first and second cut-off list completed at Delhi University, 51,974 candidates have secured admission to 70,000 seats on offer. The third cut-off list is scheduled to be released on October 16, but university officials say that colleges are unlikely to offer any major reduction in the required-cut off for admission in general category seats as many colleges are dealing with the problem of admitting more candidates than seats on offer despite asking for near perfect cut-off scores. On Friday, a Delhi University admission official said that at 5 p.m., the university had received 1,18,878 applications for its undergraduate seats under the second cut-off list and 51,974 had completed the payment formalities at the time of closing of the payment gateway to secure admission. Under the first cut-off list, 36,130 candidates had secured their admission of 60,904 applicants. A total of 2.6 lakh candidates had registered on the university portal seeking admission to the various undergraduate programmes offered by the university. The third cut off list is expected to have more colleges close the admission process. Under the second cut-off list, Hindu College has closed admission in courses such as English, history, Political Science, Physics, Chemistry and Maths while Lady Shri Ram College had closed admission only in Maths. Ramjas had closed admission in B.Com (Hons) while Miranda House had closed admission in English, Political Science, Physics, Chemistry and Maths. SRCC reduces cut off SRCC which has asked for a 100% cut off for its B.Com (Hons) and BA (hons) Economics had reduced its cut off to 99.12% and 99.75% respectively and is likely to offer a further reduction as all the seats have not been filled.

A senior police officer said that Ashraf, who was living in India for nearly 15 years as Ali Ahmed Noori, had married a woman in 2007 and left her after three-four months. “The reason to marry was to acquire goodwill in society and for identity documents,” the officer said. Sources said as part of his training, he was asked by his handlers to kill officials in Jammu and Kashmir about a decade ago as well. “His main task was J&K. He needed to fulfil many requirements in J&K — from arms and ammunition to other logistical needs,” the officer said. During initial questioning, the police said, it was revealed that he was involved in the 2011 High Court blasts and so far has admitted to conducting reconnaissance before the blasts. “He has identified Gulam Sarvar, who was involved in the High Court blasts, and said that he had conducted the recce on his directions,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/arrested-pak-national-had-married-in-2007/article37015381.ece
16 October 2021||New Delhi,||HC asks govt. to decide on plea over ‘missing’ trees||The Delhi High Court has ordered the Delhi government to decide on a complaint by an environmental activist who claimed that around 77 trees had gone missing in Sarvodaya Enclave over a span of seven years. Justice Rekha Palli directed the deputy conservator of forest (south) and the tree officer, south division, Department of Forests and Wildlife, to give a reasoned and speaking order on the complaint made by Bhavreen Kandhari, within six weeks. The High Court order came while hearing Ms. Kandhari’s plea seeking a direction that necessary action be taken on her complaint. The Delhi government’s counsel told the court that it did not have any objection to deciding on her complaint expeditiously. “In the light of the aforesaid stand taken by the respondent (Delhi government), the writ petition, along with the pending application, is disposed of by directing the respondent to decide on the petitioner’s complaint dated December 8, 2020, by passing a reasoned and speaking order within a period of six weeks from today,” the High Court said on October 11. In her petition, Ms. Kandhari said that she made a complaint to the official concerned after two tree censuses in Sarvodaya Enclave, New Delhi, in 2011-2012 and 2018-2019, showed that around 77 trees had gone missing in the colony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-asks-govt-to-decide-on-plea-over-missing-trees/article37015377.ece

Justice Mukta Gupta said the man had arrived in India on February 5, 2020, well before the guidelines came into effect on February 15. “The fact that once the guidelines issued on March 24, 2020, were applicable for people entering India on or after February 15, 2020, the same could not have been given further retrospective operation for the petitioner [man] who had arrived in the country on February5, 2020,” the court ruled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-quashes-fir-against-man-for-covid-19-rule-violation/article37015373.ece

16 October 2021||Pune,||Post-Lakhimpur Kheri, signs of Shiv Sena gravitating towards Congress||The aftermath of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s high-voltage spot visit have seen a subtle shift in Maharashtra’s political alliances within the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition of the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Until recently, the Sena’s chief spokesperson, MP Sanjay Raut, had been ruing the Congress’s failure to lead a coordinated opposition to take on the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre. In June, an editorial in the Saamana, where Mr. Raut is executive editor, had slammed Rahul Gandhi for “failing to provide effective leadership to his party and the United Progressive Alliance”, while speaking of Mr. Modi and the BJP in grudgingly admiring tones. Yet, all through last week, in editorials and columns, Mr. Raut showered praise on the Gandhi siblings. In his weekly column, Rokhthok , Mr. Raut, condemning Ms. Vadra’s ‘illegal detention’, remarked that one could see shades of Indira Gandhi in Ms. Vadra’s spirited actions in Lakhimpur Kheri. The Sena MP further said in his column that the Gandhi siblings were the “only leaders” who could provide an alternative to the BJP at the Centre today. “At the time of the formation of the MVA, there were serious misgivings within the senior Congress leadership, notably the Gandhi family, about allying with the Sena to form the MVA. However, post the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and Ms. Vadra’s courageous charge against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the Sena now sees the Congress as the only national alternative capable of taking on the BJP,” said a senior Congress leader. According to sources, a possible clue in the Sena’s volte face in its attitude to the Congress may lie in the growing animosity between the saffron party and its estranged ally, the BJP. Despite being ideologically dissimilar parties, the Sena feels that hitching its star to the Congress’s wagon may help reap indirect dividends for crucial local and regional polls while helping check the growth of the BJP in Maharashtra, say analysts. This change in tack, according senior political analyst Vivek Bhavsar, stems from the Sena’s perception that the BJP is determined to weaken regional parties. The Sena’s gravitating towards the Congress is calculated to have an impact on the crucial civic polls slated for February 2022, particularly the all-important battle for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “The Sena is eyeing the minority vote-bank in Mumbai and it feels that a bond with the Congress at the national level may work in its favour in convincing the Muslim community that the party under Uddhav Thackeray is, in fact, quite ‘moderate’ in practice, capable of accommodating all sections and communities of society under its wing regardless of its professed hardline ‘Hindutva’ ideology. Never mind the fact that the Sena and the Congress have stated that they would be contesting separately in the BMC poll,” said another senior analyst.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/post-lakhimpur-kheri-signs-of-shiv-sena-gravitating-towards-congress/article37015627.ece

16 October 2021||Kandahar,||41 killed in blast at Afghan Shia mosque||Suicide bombers attacked a Shia mosque in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar during Friday prayers, witnesses said, killing at least 41 people and injuring scores more. The assault came just a week after a suicide attack on Shia worshippers at a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz, which was claimed by the Islamic State group. There has not yet been any claim of responsibility for the attack in Kandahar, the spiritual heartland of the Taliban. “Our initial information shows it was a suicide bomber who blew himself up inside the mosque. We have launched an investigation to find out more," a local Taliban official said. Hafiz Abdulhai Abbas, director of health for Kandahar, said: "Information from the hospitals shows 41 killed about 70 wounded in today's mosque attack." At least 15 ambulances were seen rushing to and from the scene, as Taliban security threw a cordon around the area. Eyewitnesses spoke of gunfire alongside the explosions, and a security guard assigned to protect the mosque said three of his comrades had been shot as the bombers fought their way in. Sayed Rohullah told AFP: "It was the Friday prayer time, and when we were preparing I heard shots. Two people had entered the mosque. "They had opened fire on the guards and in response the guards had also opened fire on them. One of them committed a suicide blast inside the mosque." Two more attackers detonated their bombs in crowded areas outside the main building, he and other witnesses said. “We are saddened to learn that an explosion took place in a mosque of the Shia brotherhood in the first district of Kandahar city in which a number of our compatriots were martyred and wounded," tweeted Taliban Interior Ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti. Inside the mosque, after the blast, the walls were pockmarked with shrapnel and volunteers swept up debris in the ornately painted prayer hall. Rubble lay in an entrance corridor. Last Friday, an Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) suicide bomber targeted a Shia mosque in Kunduz, killing scores of people. The group, a bitter rival of fellow Sunni Islamist movement the Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attacks against Shiite worshippers, whom it regards as heretics. U.K.-based conflict analysis firm ExTrac said that if claimed by the IS-K, Friday's assault would be the first by the group in Kandahar, and the fourth mass casualty massacre since the Taliban took Kabul. ExTrac researcher Abdul Sayed said the attack was “challenging the Taliban claims of holding control on the country. If the Taliban can't protect Kandahar from an IS-K attack, how could it protect the rest of the country?" The UN mission in Afghanistan tweeted: "The UN condemns latest atrocity targeting a religious institution and worshippers. Those responsible need to be held to account."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/41-killed-in-blast-at-afghan-shia-mosque/article37014825.ece
16 October 2021||Moscow,||‘IS fighters amassing in Afghanistan’||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said hundreds of fighters loyal to the Islamic State militant group were massing in northern Afghanistan with plans to move between ex-Soviet Central Asian countries disguised as refugees. “According to our intelligence, the number of (IS) members alone in northern Afghanistan is about 2,000 people,” the Russian leader said during a video conference meeting with leaders of other ex-Soviet States. The Russian President earlier this week warned of the threat of veteran fighters from Iraq and Syria with IS links crossing into Afghanistan, while Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it expected the Taliban, which recently gained control of the country, to deal with the threat. On Friday, he said IS leaders in Afghanistan are seeking to project the group’s influence across former Soviet States in Central Asia — which Moscow sees as its backyard — to stir up religious and ethnic discord. “Terrorists are seeking to infiltrate the Commonwealth’s territory, including under the guise of refugees,” Putin said, referring to a group of ex-Soviet countries — some of which border Afghanistan. The Taliban, which seized control of Kabul from a pro-Western government in mid-August, are seeking international recognition, as well as assistance to avoid a humanitarian disaster. Talks next week Mr. Putin’s special envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told Russian news agency Interfax on Friday that Taliban representatives would attend an international conference in Moscow next week alongside regional players Iran, China and Pakistan. President Putin on Friday said there was no need to rush with official recognition of the Taliban but noted that “we understand that we need to interact with them”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-fighters-amassing-in-afghanistan/article37014835.ece
16 October 2021||Washington,||U.S. to allow fully vaccinated travellers from November 8||The Biden administration is expected to announce that its new travel policy requiring foreign nationals travelling to the U.S. to be fully vaccinated will be operational November 8 onwards. The new policy will replace disparate rules that have applied so far to different countries of origin and will provide consistent guidelines based on vaccination status. Specifically, it will ease pandemic-related restrictions for travel from India, the U.K., Ireland, South Africa, Brazil and the Schengen Zone. Canada, Mexico borders The imminent announcement, which was first reported by Reuters, will apply to air travel as well as travel for non-essential purposes via land borders shared with Mexico and Canada. By January, those using land borders for “essential” travel will need to fall in line with vaccine requirements, as per the White House’s forthcoming announcement. “This puts in place a global international travel policy that is guided by public health, stringent, and consistent,” a statement from the White House, sent to The Hindu said. In addition to providing proof of vaccination status from November 8, travellers will need to continue to show a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days of departure from their point of origin. So far exemptions have not been announced but a few are expected. The announcement will follow vaccine recognition guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), i.e., vaccines will need to be approved or authorised by the FDA (the U.S. pharma regulator) or have Emergency Use Listing status from the WHO. “Further guidance on the very limited exceptions to these vaccination requirements, what will be acceptable proof of vaccination, and other operational details are forthcoming,” the White House said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-to-allow-fully-vaccinated-travellers-from-november-8/article37015197.ece
16 October 2021||Berlin,||Germany’s SPD, Greens, liberals reach initial deal||German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz took a step closer to succeeding Angela Merkel as Chancellor, as his Social Democrats, the ecologist Greens and liberal FDP on Friday announced a preliminary deal to form a new government. The three parties have been holding talks since Mr. Scholz’s centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) won the general elections on September 26 with Ms. Merkel’s conservatives in second place as she prepares to leave politics. “Overall, we can sense here that a new beginning is possible, brought about by the three parties that have come together here,” Mr. Scholz told reporters. “We have agreed on a text from the exploratory talks,” he said, adding that this “is a very good result that clearly shows that a government that aims to ensure we achieve progress can be formed in Germany.” Greens co-leader Annalena Baerbock said the initial agreement heralds a “coalition of progress” to “really use the next decade as a decade of renewal”. The agreement that will form the basis of formal coalition talks all but means that Merkel’s CDU-CSU alliance is headed for the opposition benches after scoring their worst post-war election result. CDU leader and chancellor hopeful Armin Laschet had recently said his party remains open to forming a governing coalition, but even his own job is hanging on a thread. Facing their worst crisis in decades, the conservatives are planning a clean sweep of their leadership, with a congress by December to elect their new bosses. Mr. Scholz, who is also Ms. Merkel’s Vice-Chancellor, this week voiced confidence that the three-way talks involving his party will produce Germany’s next government before Christmas. ‘Approval ratings at 62%’ A coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP — known as “traffic-light” after the three parties’ red, green and yellow colours — has found favour with Germans, with 62% approving the constellation as the next federal government, according to a poll published on Friday. Mr. Scholz’s approval rating was even higher, as three in four say it was “good” for him to become Chancellor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/germanys-spd-greens-liberals-reach-initial-deal/article37014829.ece
16 October 2021||Beirut,||Lebanon on edge after sectarian unrest||Lebanon buried on Friday the victims of its deadliest sectarian unrest in years after gunfire gripped central Beirut for hours and revived the ghosts of the civil war. Seven people died and dozens were wounded as a result of violence that erupted on Thursday following a rally by Shia protesters demanding the dismissal of the judge investigating last year’s devastating Beirut port blast. The Shia movements Amal and Hezbollah that organised the protest in front of the Justice Palace accused the Lebanese Forces (LF), a Christian party, of engineering the chaos by aiming sniper fire at the demonstrators. “This massacre was committed by the LF movement,” senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine said during a Beirut funeral on Friday, accusing the party of seeking to “start a civil war”. “We will not be dragged into sectarian strife... but at the same time we cannot allow the blood of our (martyrs) to go to waste,” he added. In Beirut’s southern suburbs, Hezbollah held burials for two of its members as well as a woman who was shot in the head by a stray bullet while she was standing on her balcony. Hundreds of mourners chanting in support of the Iran-backed group carried caskets wrapped in the party’s yellow flag as prayers rang out from loudspeakers. Involvement denied The LF has denied any involvement in Thursday’s violence and said Hezbollah was “invading” off-limits neighbourhoods when the violence broke out. A heavy army presence was visible on the streets Friday amid fears of an escalation. On Thursday, Amal and Hezbollah militiamen filled the streets in their hundreds around Tayouneh, a notorious civil war flashpoint near the spot where the April 1975 bus attack often presented as the trigger of the conflict occurred. As a deluge of bullets riddled residential facades, and gaggles of fighters wearing ammunition vests took over the streets and emptied their magazines haphazardly, civilians crouched in homes, terrified. France, the U.S. and UN appealed for de-escalation but also insisted on allowing the port explosion investigation to continue unhindered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/lebanon-on-edge-after-sectarian-unrest/article37014831.ece
16 October 2021||Leigh-on-Sea,||U.K. Conservative lawmaker David Amess stabbed to death||British lawmaker David Amess was killed on Friday after being stabbed multiple times, according to the police, in the second death of a U.K. politician while meeting voters since 2016. The pro-Brexit Conservative MP, 69, a father-of-five first elected to Parliament in 1983, was attacked inside a church while holding a fortnightly consultation with his local constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, east of London. Essex police said a 25-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and a knife was recovered at the scene. “The investigation is in its very early stages and is being led by officers from the specialist counter-terrorism command,” police chief Ben-Julian Harrington told reporters. Flags were lowered to half-mast outside Parliament, and tributes poured in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Amess, whose death came just over five years after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right extremist. In a book last year called Ayes & Ears: A Survivor’s Guide to Westminster , Mr. Amess noted that Cox’s death had prompted new security guidance to MPs which threatened to limit their access to constituents. “I myself have over the years experienced nuisance from the odd member of the general public at my own property,” he wrote. “These increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of the people openly meeting their elected politicians.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson was chairing a meeting with Ministers in the west of England but promptly returned to London. “The reason I think people are so shocked and saddened is above all he was one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics,” he said of Mr. Amess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-conservative-lawmaker-david-amess-stabbed-to-death/article37015200.ece
16 October 2021||Sydney,||Junta urged to let ASEAN diplomat meet Suu Kyi||Eight countries and the EU diplomatic chief on Friday urged the Myanmar junta to let a regional special envoy meet ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The call comes as concerns grow over the military government’s commitment to a “five-point consensus” agreed with regional bloc ASEAN to defuse the bloody crisis that erupted after Myanmar’s February 1 coup. ASEAN Foreign Ministers met virtually on Friday evening to debate whether to exclude Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing from an upcoming summit over his government’s intransigence. Brunei, which currently holds ASEAN’s rotating chair, will issue a statement on Saturday on the meeting’s outcome, diplomatic sources said. The military authorities have said they will not allow ASEAN special envoy Erywan Yusof to meet anyone currently on trial, which includes Suu Kyi. In a joint statement, the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway and East Timor say they are “deeply concerned about the dire situation in Myanmar” and urged Naypyidaw to “engage constructively” with the special envoy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/junta-urged-to-let-asean-diplomat-meet-suu-kyi/article37014830.ece

LinkedIn said in a blog post on Thursday that it would replace the platform later this year with a stripped-down version that would focus only on jobs, called “InJobs”, which would not include a social feed or share options. “While we’ve found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed,” LinkedIn said. “We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.” The platform expanded in China in 2014, acknowledging at the time that the company would have to censor some of the content users posted on its website to comply with Chinese rules. It has been among the companies hit over the past year by a wide-ranging crackdown by Beijing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/microsoft-to-fold-linkedin-in-china-as-rules-tighten/article37014832.ece

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||How the law caught up with an artful dodger||It was around 10 p.m. on September 25. After celebrating their daughter’s engagement, the Mavunkal family got ready to retire for the evening at their house in Vallayil in Cherthala municipality of Alappuzha district. Suddenly, the police rushed in — some plain-clothed and others uniformed. They went over to the patriarch of the family, 52-year-old Monson Mavunkal, and handcuffed him. Bouncers in Monson’s house, dressed in body-hugging tights, jumped in to save their master. They flexed their biceps and puffed out their chests but retreated meekly when the men and women flashed their IDs. Some took to their heels, eyewitnesses say. “I was about to shut my shop when I heard the commotion. I saw a few young men running. I stopped some of them — they had had lemonade at my shop earlier — and asked them what was happening. But they were too flustered to reply,” says Prashanth whose shop is about 50 metres from the Mavunkal household. Monson’s arrest didn’t make it to the next day’s newspapers as the Crime Branch (CB) managed to keep it well under wraps. But a day later, headlines flashed everywhere in Kerala about the man who had allegedly swindled tens of people of hundreds of crores; a fabulist who had wilfully blurred the line between fact and fiction for personal gain. Seller of ‘antiquities’ “Monson had moved in more than a decade ago and came across as a perfect gentleman. He would sponsor both the local church and temple festivals. He created the impression that he was a hotshot antiquities dealer. So, you can imagine how his arrest came as a shock,” says John Varghese, Monson’s immediate neighbour in Cherthala. The drama then shifted some 45 km from Cherthala to Kaloor in the heart of Kochi city as CB sleuths raided Monson’s rented house, the size of a mansion. This house had doubled up as his private museum and stored what he had claimed were rare antiquities. Monson boasted that his collections included the Staff of Moses, silver pieces received by Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus Christ to Roman soldiers, the throne of Tipu Sultan, a copy of the first edition of the Holy Bible, books and parchments from the libraries of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, the original and hitherto unknown works of Raja Ravi Varma and Pablo Picasso, and crores worth of chemicals that were used for a rocket launch and were certified, he claimed, by a scientist from the Defence Research and Development Organisation. Monson managed to pass off the majority of these cheap knockoffs as rare antiquities. He even got them showcased by media houses. He successfully made people believe that he was an antiquities dealer — by the time he was arrested, after six of his victims jointly petitioned the Chief Minister, he had allegedly cheated people of crores of rupees. The six petitioners said he had cheated them of Rs. 10 crore. Monson told everyone that his bank account had been credited with Rs. 2.62 lakh crore from selling antiquities abroad, and had been frozen under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) since July 2010. He showed bank statements, Finance Ministry papers and even Reserve Bank of India documents — all forged — to his victims to convince them to fund his (non-existent) legal fight to get his funds released. While his collection of ‘antiquities’ and nearly two dozen premium cars showcased his wealth, his connections with the police, politicians, civil servants, film stars, and business fraternity were shown by countless photos and videos. These further convinced his victims of Monson’s influence. “Whenever we asked for our money, he organised a mediation by these influential people and kept fleecing us,” says Anoop V. Ahammad, one of the petitioners who allegedly gave Monson nearly Rs. 6 crore in less than four years. Monson allegedly once organised a meeting in which a senior Congress MP from Kerala agreed to mediate on his behalf through the Public Accounts Committee, constituted by Parliament, to expedite the release of his funds. One of Monson’s immediate neighbours, who wished to remain anonymous, in Kaloor recollects how the narrow lane along his house was often choked with the vehicles of visiting celebrities. Monson even took some of the petitioners to Delhi, where he reportedly got them to exit through the green channel at the airport and arranged a three-star vehicle, purportedly allotted to senior police officials, to shift them to a premium hotel to further prove his influence. He gave away premium vehicles and rare ‘antiquities’ to placate the petitioners at various points. Then, some eight months ago, the petitioners ran out of patience as Monson’s claims turned even more outrageous — he even invoked the Prime Minister to sell his story. “That was when we turned really suspicious and started gathering evidence against him and cross-verifying his claims. We wanted to bind him to something legally tenable. We insisted on an agreement to get our money back,” says Anoop. As the demand for a refund got shriller, Monson even sent two of the petitioners to West Asia to generate funds through the sale of antiquities, convincing them that he could not accompany them as there was a travel ban in place. When they demanded ownership documents of the antiquities, he instead gave them police documents calling for high security for his ‘rare collections’. As persuasion no longer worked, Monson apparently turned to coercion. He flashed the three guns he had and even invoked his connection with the gangster Dawood Ibrahim. He weaved a story of how he killed a person and hung the body from a metro pillar in Mumbai using his connections. He even showed injury marks on his body as proof of his rough life. Nevertheless, the petitioners got him to agree to return the money within three months earlier this year. At the same time, they started digging into his past. The lies unravel Monson was one of four children of a family from a humble background in Cherthala. “Though he carried his father’s family name, he wasn’t in contact with the Mavunkal family. He grew up at his mother’s place in Chaaramangalam in Cherthala. He moved to Idukki after getting married. Then he moved to Vallayil and built a home on the land he got as his share from his father more than a decade earlier. To be honest, we had suspected something fishy as he turned up escorted by premium cars and bodyguards,” says Jose Mavunkal, a relative. Monson’s life in Rajakumari, Idukki, where his wife got a job as a schoolteacher, remains largely unknown. He reportedly used to deal with used cars and electronic equipment. “He was a very decent bloke who did pretty much everything. He was mostly in Ernakulam even then before he left the place permanently after his wife opted for voluntary retirement,” says Joshy, a wiring worker who was very close to Monson during his days in Rajakumari. But Aji Nettoor, his driver for over 10 years, does not speak of Monson glowingly. Instead, he has some damning things to share about his former employer. “I left him eight months ago after I found that he had transacted over Rs. 2 crore through my account without my knowledge. He had opened bank accounts in the names of his employees using his address and had also handled the passbook, chequebook, and ATM. I confronted him when he asked me to lie about a transaction made through my account and left him soon after that,” he says. It emerged then that Monson had a case registered against him at Panthalam police station in Pathanamthitta in 2020 for cheating a man called Rajendran Pillai of Sreevalsam Group of Rs. 6.27 crore using the same FEMA plot. “We were promised an interest-free loan of up to Rs. 100 crore to tide over our financial crisis once his frozen funds were released. But then we realised that he was a fraud and registered the case,” says Shahul Hameed, manager of Sreevalsam Group. As a counter, Monson registered a case alleging that the group didn’t pay the remaining lease running into crores for using his 20-odd premier vehicles kept at the group’s yard. Despite the alleged high-level police intervention to stop it, the Alappuzha District Crime Branch took over the case and found it to be without basis. Now 19 of those vehicles, which Monson had claimed included the one used by Bollywood actor Kareena Kapoor, remain in the custody of Cherthala police. In another case, Rajeev Sreedharan, a resident of Pala in Kottayam district, allegedly lost Rs. 1.72 crore after falling for Monson’s offer to get 500 acres of an estate at Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad which was on lease to the Madhya Pradesh government. Monson is also accused of blackmailing a sexual abuse victim with the footage of the abuse to withdraw the case in which his friend was the perpetrator. Ernakulam South Police registered a case in this regard earlier this year and has sent his mobile phone for forensic examination. The Monson saga keeps throwing up names along the way. These include Anitha Pullayil, a Malayali expatriate with Italian citizenship, whose association with the accused and the high echelons of the State Police made headlines. Pullayil has since then gone on record saying she came to know Monson through the Loka Malayali Sabha, which consists of Malayali expatriates. She admitted to having recommended, as an acquaintance, Monson’s private museum to a former State Police chief but claimed to have distanced herself from him after being warned of his fraudulent ways. She even warned the petitioners about Monson. Monson used his multiple self-styled profiles to his advantage. Besides claiming to be a German-trained cosmetologist and having an honorary doctorate, he claimed to be the managing director of Kalinga Kalyan Foundation, patron of the Pravasi Malayali Federation and allegedly impersonated the chairman of TV Samskara channel, a charge which is now being investigated by CB. A storm in Kerala Monson’s arrest and the pictures and videos that bombarded social media from then also triggered a political storm. Detractors of Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran found it a perfect weapon to attack him as he was mentioned in the petition. Sudhakaran’s photograph at the alleged trickster’s house went viral. Sudhakaran denied any association with Monson, but this did not cut any ice with them. The ruling Left Democratic Front was cornered as well, after top police officers, including then State Police chief Loknath Behera, were found pictured with Monson’s fake antiquities. This even forced Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who also holds the Home Ministry portfolio, to warn the police that they should be careful about their contacts. Behera, now the managing director of Kochi Metro Rail Limited, found himself in a tight spot and he even had to explain that his current leave of absence was not due to the Monson episode, but was for something unrelated. Monson’s alleged trickery also touched a raw nerve with Malayali society when it emerged that a copper inscription from his collection was used to prove a point in favour of the entry of women into Sabarimala, the hilltop Ayyappa temple, during the violent protests of 2018. A reporter with a television news channel, who is now in the dock for his alleged close connections with Monson, first broke the story, which was later followed up by the CPI(M)’s mouthpiece. The inscription, claimed to be over three centuries old, reportedly stated that the hill shrine had followed a Dravidian ritualistic tradition in the olden days, thus justifying women’s entry. The Pandalam royal family, trustees of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple, has sought an investigation into the authenticity of the inscription. Suresh Kumar, a Thiruvananthapuram-based sculptor, is another of Monson’s alleged victims. He is steeped in debts after he sold nine sculptures worth Rs. 80 lakh to Monson in 2019 but received only Rs. 7 lakh. “I had been visiting him at least once every week to get my money. Now, I am left with a debt of Rs. 30 lakh and live in a single room. I had an open-heart surgery and the meagre pension of Rs. 1,600 is not even enough to buy medicines,” says the sculptor with 45 years of experience. Investigators have recovered four of the sculptures, which Kumar says were badly redone, probably to pass off as antiquities. About 70% of Monson’s fake antiquities were bought from a man called Santhosh in Ernakulam who used to rent them for film shoots. Most of his premium vehicles were bought from a Bengaluru-based dealer to whom Monson allegedly still owes a large sum. “Only three of the eight premium cars in his house in Kaloor were road-worthy. Most of them were registered outside the State and we don’t have the details in our database. Even the details of the three cars in our database will have to be verified,” says Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer P.M. Shabeer. Customs also initially showed some interest in the vehicles but lost interest as none of them were imported in Monson’s name. “In the case of antiquities, the owner is bound to explain their procurement. But in this case, even that didn’t apply as the majority of them were fake,” says a senior Customs official. Monson also claimed to possess ivory and a number of valuable conches, forcing forest officers to wade in. “The ivory pair and conches prima facie appear to be fake. But we will send them to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology for scientific assessment nevertheless,” says Geo Basil Paul, Range Officer, Kodanad. Chasing the money trail Since his arrest, CB has registered five cases against Monson — four for cheating and one for impersonation. What seems to trouble the investigation team is the fact that he had reportedly collected only part of the money that he had allegedly swindled through bank accounts, and that too belonging to his employees; most of the funds were received by hand. For a man accused of cheating people of crores, his bank account was found to have a balance of merely Rs. 200. He reportedly spent about Rs. 25 lakh a month to maintain his lavish lifestyle, including an array of bouncers. “It will be hard to make the cheating charges stick since there is little money trail through his account. It is too early to say whether he had stacked the money elsewhere,” say senior CB sources. With Monson’s alleged frauds growing, State Police Chief Anil Kant has formed a special investigation squad headed by Sparjan Kumar, Inspector General, Thiruvananthapuram Range, to probe the cases against him. Meanwhile, the Kerala High Court has lambasted the State police. It even went to the extent of wondering whether the CB investigation will be effective considering the allegations against officers of various ranks. Justice Devan Ramachandran asked the State Police Chief why the police gave Monson protection instead of taking action against him when he claimed to be in possession of valuable articles. Monson, it seems, was arrested in the nick of time, for the petitioners who conducted a parallel probe against him allege that he was in the midst of some new fraudulent activity. He apparently claimed to have sold 93 articles to the Qatari royal family for Rs. 15,000 crore for display in a museum there. Going by his strike rate in conning people, Monson would have probably pulled off even that with ease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/how-the-law-caught-up-with-an-artful-dodger/article37014823.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||It is time to rise in defence of Bollywood||The recent media frenzy targeting actor Shah Rukh Khan following the arrest of his 23-year-old son Aryan for alleged drug possession (though it has since been admitted that no drugs were found on his person) has led to a major campaign against the film industry ecosystem that allegedly enables “drug culture”. While nothing yet has been established in a court of law, the episode is one more instalment in what appears to be a new drama series unleashed by the guardians of our public space — a war on Bollywood. Smearing the industry Last year, there was an all-out assault on the character of starlet Rhea Chakraborty who, after months of media frenzy linking her to the death by suicide of her boyfriend, actor Sushant Singh Rajput, was arrested and detained for several days for allegedly buying drugs for him, claims she denied and which were never substantiated. This in turn had already led to a huge campaign against alleged drug abuse in Bollywood, with four other actresses being called in for questioning. No charges were made, but the process, as is so often the case, proved to be the punishment. But it is not just drugs that have been used to smear the film industry. In January this year, at least 10 police complaints were filed, in more than half a dozen States across the country, against film-makers, actors and Amazon executives of a made-for-television political drama called Tandav , which allegedly offended Hindu sensibilities by its depiction of a character portraying Lord Shiva. Another crime thriller, Mirzapur , underwent similar harassment, for similar reasons; A Suitable Boy had cases filed against it over a kissing scene filmed near a temple. In March this year, properties linked to film-maker Anurag Kashyap, actress Tapsee Pannu and Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhashish Sarkar were raided by the Income Tax department as part of a tax evasion investigation against a company, Phantom Films, that had been dissolved in 2018. The alarm bells have begun to go off in the minds of some in our political class. Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik has alleged that the raids were an attempt to suppress the voices of those who speak against the central government. Jaya Bachchan — a one-time movie star herself, wife of megastar Amitabh Bachchan, and a member of the Rajya Sabha — decried a “conspiracy to defame the film industry”. The latest media campaign against Aryan Khan suggests the conspiracy is still alive. The outsize influence As these allegations suggest, it is not really drugs that are the issue here for the powers-that-be. The alleged violation of our narcotics laws is merely a convenient cudgel to batter an industry that is disliked for other reasons. The political establishment recognises the outsize influence of Bollywood entertainment on the minds and attitudes of the broad viewing — and voting — public. What those in power, who have demonstrated their intolerance of points of view other than their own for some time now, really dislike is not what Bollywood does behind closed doors, but the content of what it puts out — what one might call the political culture of Bollywood. When I wrote my novel Show Business in 1990, some Indian critics were surprised that I would follow The Great Indian Novel with a work that dealt with the trashy world of commercial Bombay cinema. But I did so because to me, Indian films, with all their limitations and outright idiocies, represented a vital part of the hope for India’s future. In a country that is still perhaps 30% illiterate, films represent the prime vehicle for the transmission of popular culture and values. Cinema offers all of us in India a common world to which to escape, allowing us to dream with our eyes open. And with 570 million Internet users, India also offers a remarkable market for new cinema for the OTT (over-the-top) platforms — direct to our laptops and mobile phone screens — a market Bollywood is poised to dominate. Plots and the message In India, popular cinema has consistently reflected the diversity of the pluralist community that makes this cinema. The stories they tell are often silly, the plots formulaic, the characterisations superficial, the action predictable, but they are made and watched by members of every community in India. Muslim actors play Hindu heroes, South Indian heroines are chased around trees by North Indian rogues. Representatives of some communities may be stereotyped (think of the number of alcoholic Christians played by a “character actor” like Om Prakash), but good and bad are always shown as being found in every community. I was first struck by this quality of Bollywood not long after the Bangladesh War, when the 1973 film Zanjeer offered a striking pointer to me of what Bollywood had come to represent in our society. In the film, Pran played Badshah Khan, a red-bearded Pathan Muslim who exemplified the values of strength, fearlessness, loyalty and courage. This was just a year after the bloody birth of Bangladesh in a war in which most of the subcontinent’s Pathans were on the other side, but far from demonising the Pran figure, the film-makers chose not just to portray a strong Muslim character but to make him the most sympathetic presence in the film after the hero. This would not have been possible in many other countries, but Bollywood tended to be consistently good at this sort of thing, making megahits like Amar Akbar Anthony , about three brothers separated in infancy who are brought up by different families — one a Christian, one a Hindu and one a Muslim. The message was clear — that Christians, Hindus and Muslims are metaphorically brothers too, seemingly different but united in their common endeavours for justice. This kind of message is unsurprising, given who makes these films. Many have observed that Muslims enjoy a disproportionate influence in Bollywood, most apparent in the dominance of the trio of actors Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan for three decades (six of the 10 highest-grossing films ever made feature one of the Khans). Several other prominent Bollywood stars — Naseeruddin Shah, Saif Ali Khan and the late Irrfan Khan — are Muslim. None of them was invited when, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conducted a famous photo-op with a couple of dozen Bollywood A-list personalities flown to New Delhi for the purpose. Possible ‘appeasement’ In today’s charged political atmosphere, generated by the ascendancy of political figures associated with Hindutva, the photo-op suggested that the “A” in “A-list” seems increasingly to stand for “appeasement” of the authorities. Many Bollywood celebrities embarrassed themselves by participating in a Government-run social media campaign to denounce global celebrities like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg for their support to our agitating farmers, earning themselves the sobriquet “#Sellebrities”. The real problem is that the Sangh Parivar dislikes diversity, and the film world embodies the very idea of India’s diversity in the way in which it is organised, staffed, and financed — and in the stories it tells. Everything about Bollywood embodies the “composite culture” whose very existence is an affront to the uni-dimensional bigotry of Hindutva. And as India’s entertainment has opened itself to more and more global influence, India’s “mainstream” cinema has increasingly shown a capacity for tackling serious themes — caste discrimination, rural injustice, sanitation, women’s rights, menstruation, female sexuality, interreligious marriage, homosexuality and even global Islamophobia have featured in recent films. A chilling effect This worries those who prefer Bollywood to continue to limit itself to formulaic entertainment, the proverbial “bread and circuses” necessary to distract the general public from governmental failures. The plot is thickening. New Internet guidelines, whose application and operations are yet to be tested, have already prompted Amazon Prime Video to suspend plans for a second season of the popular rural political series Paatal Lok . Other releases are reported to have been postponed indefinitely. Even the prospect of official disapproval has already had a chilling effect. Bollywood, which makes over 2,000 films a year, has long been India’s calling card to the world of entertainment. Our films and TV shows have the capacity of going global on the small screen the way Korean cinema has but Chinese has not — because censorship and intimidation stifles one set of film-makers and not the other. The remarkable creative talents available in India could make the country a global leader for such worldwide offerings. But to do that we must allow our film-makers creative freedom, stop harassing them and cease encouraging media persecution. It is time to rise up in defence of Bollywood.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Vigilance, vaccination and endemic COVID-19||On June 27, 2021, the daily reported COVID-19 cases (seven-day rolling average) had fallen below 50,000, and have remained so for 15 consecutive weeks (Worldometer – Corona-India). That heralded the end of the second wave of India’s epidemic and marked its transition to ‘endemic’ state. It fell below 40,000 on September 9, and below 30,000 on September 24. The trend continues. Population and infection Endemic denotes steady weekly numbers without major fluctuations. Fifteen weeks of this trend spells consistency. Kerala, Sikkim, Mizoram and Meghalaya are outliers/exceptions to the national endemic state — they have not yet transitioned to endemic phase (covid19india.org) but their daily case-trends show they will soon catch up and become endemic. Country-level endemicity indicates that the vast majority of the population is already infected and immune, but how large is the majority? The fourth ICMR sero-survey (June-July 2021) showed 67.6% had antibodies by end July — that is roughly 950 million. The reported cumulative COVID-19 cases by end-July were 30,410,577 (3.2 % of 950 million). So, actual infections were ~30 times the reported number. From August 1 to October 7 — 2,219,097 additional cases were reported, representing, by extrapolation, 70 million infections, taking the total to 1,020 million, the susceptible population therefore is 1,400 - 1,020 = 380 million. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found, in the second sero-survey, that detected antibody prevalence underestimates true immunity prevalence, detecting only ~70% of those who were RT-PCR positive earlier, therefore the susceptible pool may be much smaller. Endemic transmission will be sustained by new infections in previously uninfected remnants plus new additions to population by annual birth cohorts of 25 million (less mortality) and by re-infections in those previously infected. The second wave of the pandemic was driven by the Delta variant, with a basic reproduction number (Ro) of 6-8. The epidemiology formula (1—1/Ro) is used to calculate the herd immunity threshold (HIT) necessary to end the epidemic, which is ~87.5%, in our estimations. Applying the principle of triangulation this observation corroborates the fact of epidemic-endemic transition. On the jab India rolled out its COVID-19 vaccines on January 16, 2021, but the pace of vaccination is slow, 20% having received two doses (2.2% per month). So, the major contributor to reaching HIT was natural infection in two waves. Two recent preprints, one from Christian Medical College Hospital Vellore and the other from Israel indicate that infection-induced immunity confers greater protection than vaccination (https://bit.ly/3DKXEMC and https://bit.ly/2YWCpZE). Thus, India’s immune population has good short-term protection against re-infection and disease. Indeed, the reinfection rate in India according to the ICMR was only 4.5% (https://bit.ly/3pcZp10). India’s COVID-19 control strategy, hitherto addressing epidemic COVID-19, has to be modified now for endemic COVID-19. Two important factors will dictate the modifications: Senior citizens, those with co-morbidity/cancer treatment/organ transplant, etc. and pregnant women, who had not been infected in the past or not yet vaccinated with two doses, would have risks of severe disease, need for hospitalisation, admission in an intensive care unit, and mortality. They have to be traced individually and vaccinated. More by re-infections Endemic transmission will be driven more by re-infections than by first infections. A paper in The Lancet Microbe , October 1 (https://bit.ly/2YOu8qc), reported the durability of immunity against re-infection in coronavirus infections, the profiles of antibody decline and probabilities of re-infection over time, under endemic conditions. Re-infection is likely three months to 5·1 years after peak antibody response, median 16 months. Hence, all previously infected but unvaccinated persons require at least one dose of the vaccine. Studies have shown that those who had natural infection may need only one dose of any approved vaccine to stimulate long-lasting immunity even against reinfection. A meticulous follow-up study of antibody levels in those who had infection is urgently needed to determine when such individuals will need a booster dose. Their immune response profile to one dose of different vaccines also needs to be documented. Persons previously uninfected but vaccinated with two doses have to be given a booster dose of vaccine to offer protection against breakthrough re-infection. Immunology informs that the optimum time interval for a booster dose is six months to one year after the previous dose. We must monitor both the immune response levels and durability post-booster. Such data will then guide if and when any further booster(s) may be required. Contact tracing, testing and quarantine requirements — very important during an epidemic spread — will now have to be confined to the elderly and vulnerable contacts so as to facilitate early recognition and treatment of COVID-19, rather than for everyone. Our two-dose vaccination coverage should be rapidly escalated — the current weekly rate of about 0.6% of the population given a second dose, is too slow and must be revved up — through intensive information-education-communication and by vaccination campaigns. Vaccination should be targeted for the purposes of re-opening all schools and hubs of economic activities. The entire work force in India (organised, unorganised, self-employed, those in the travel and tourism industry) need to be targeted for vaccination; this is best done at the workplace with the help of the respective managements and State health authorities. Thereafter, all social, religious, cultural and recreational gatherings can be allowed. Childhood infection Childhood infection with the coronavirus is mostly mild and self-limiting as children have lower density of the ACE2 receptor (the portal of cell-entry of virus) in their respiratory passages. Multi-system-inflammatory syndrome, a severe complication encountered in children, is fortunately very rare and treatable. Under these circumstances, children are best protected by fully immunising all school personnel (teachers, non-teaching staff, transport) and all eligible subjects at home, thereby creating a protective mantle. After any vaccine gets approved for use in children, (Covaxin and ZyCoV-D may be approved soon), they can be immunised – the easiest way forward would be school-based vaccination camps. Continued endemic transmission is the opportunity to progressively relax restrictions of social contacts, but such return to normalcy must be under the umbrella of vaccination (as detailed above) and universal mask use. When endemicity is sustained over a longer time, seasonal outbreaks (minor waves) must be anticipated — but even they can be averted by vaccination. Vigilance cannot be let down until we ensure that no one remains at risk of severe COVID-19. Dr. T.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Tackling terror||The uptick in the number of deaths of civilians, including those of the minority community after terror attacks recently is a major setback when the number of violent incidents in the Kashmir Valley was the lowest in five years. Orchestrated allegedly by a shadowy force calling itself The Resistance Front (TRF), termed by security forces as being set up by the LeT, the killings have resulted in fear gripping the Valley’s minority Hindu and Sikh communities. Notwithstanding statements from mainstream political parties and separatist organisations condemning the violence, many Kashmiri Pandit and Sikh employees abstained from work or took leave temporarily, worried about their security. This is an unfortunate outcome that calls to mind the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits due to terror attacks in the early 1990s. The reversal of this dangerous trend requires not only a reassurance of security from the Government for members of the minority communities such as the Pandits and the Sikhs but also a commitment for solidarity with the victims from the various political forces and civil society. The targeted nature of the killings by a “faceless” terror group suggests that its aim was to use the disquiet in the Valley with the recent administrative and political measures to foment communal discord and violence. Beyond the condemnation from the polity, civil society in such situations must take the initiative to foster communal amity and to mobilise people across communities against hatred. In this regard, the recent appeals by some masjids in Srinagar requesting the public to show solidarity with the victims and to prevent the furthering of fear among Kashmiri Pandits is a welcome step indicating an intention to not let the situation deteriorate to what happened in the early 1990s. The UT administration followed up with a strong crackdown on the insurgency seeking to isolate and quell the militant network that is allegedly responsible for the attacks. While the reactions from the polity and civil society and the administrative actions by the Government are necessary, they are not sufficient to restore normalcy in the Valley. The suspension of the polity with the absence of an elected Assembly, and the stasis and alienation that had set in since the abrogation of J&K’s special status, its bifurcation and designation as a Union Territory would make the job of administration even more difficult. An immediate renewal of political dialogue to address this along with the restoration of Statehood and the complete resumption of political and press freedoms will help create the environment to isolate and tackle terror in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tackling-terror/article37014811.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Fast forward||With the Gati Shakti National Master Plan that he launched on October 13, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expanded on the familiar theme that India’s slowing economic growth engine can find renewed momentum through major infrastructure upgrades that will cut logistics costs for industry and raise all round efficiency. Essentially a technocentric administrative initiative that promises silo-breaking integration of 16 Ministries including railways, roads and ports through information technology, satellite mapping and data tools, the programme seeks to appeal to the national imagination as an umbrella integrator of Rs. 111-lakh crore worth of projects under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for 2020-25. The importance given in the plan to rail-road multimodal connectivity and higher share of freight for the railways — articulated also by NITI Aayog — has evident multiple benefits. This includes reducing the cost of logistics to GDP that has prevailed at about 14% even at the time the NDA government took office, to an aspirational 8%. There is also the challenge of reducing vehicular emissions from road freight growth in order to meet climate change commitments and containing input costs due to extraordinarily high taxes on diesel. A similar fillip to efficiency in port operations can increase cargo handling capacity and cut vessel turnaround time. Evidently, States have a crucial role in all this, considering that key pieces of the plan such as port linkages and land availability for highways, railways, industrial clusters and corridors depend on political consensus and active partnership. The observations in the Economic Survey for 2020-21 underscore the role of active Centre-State partnerships for infrastructure building. The Survey projects maximum investments towards NIP sectors such as energy, roads, urban infrastructure and railways for FY 2021 and 22, with about Rs. 8.5-lakh crore to be invested by either side annually, besides Rs. 4.5-lakh crore per year from the private sector. There is a steep gradient to cover here, as the effects of COVID-19 continue to be felt in terms of lost jobs, depressed wages and consumption, while the planners are pinning their hopes on infrastructure projects for a new deal outcome that will boost jobs and demand for goods and commodities, besides attracting major investments. Significant delays to projects can often be traced to incompatible and hostile land acquisition decisions that alienate communities or threaten to violate environmental integrity. Given the Centre’s preference for Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing to identify potential industrial areas, policymakers would do well to reclaim lands already subjected to degradation and pollution, rather than alienate controversial new parcels. Convincing citizens that they stand to benefit from such grand plans through better social welfare, lower service costs and higher efficiencies, and respecting federal boundaries while dealing with the States are other imperatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fast-forward/article37014812.ece
16 October 2021||Washington DC,||U.S.-India ministerial dialogue adds focus on climate finance||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met on Thursday for the eighth ministerial meeting of the U.S.-India Economic and Financial partnership. Also in attendance were Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das (who attended virtually). The ministerial held a session dedicated to climate finance for the first time, as per a joint statement. In the run-up to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow at the end of the month, India has been pushing for rich countries to meet their Paris Accord climate finance commitment of $100 billion per year. The two sides “reaffirmed the collective developed country goal to mobilise $100 billion annually for developing countries from public and private sources, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation,” the statement said. Holding such a session, the statement said, reflected the “critical” role climate finance has to play in achieving global climate goals and the two sides’ commitments to drive “urgent progress” in combatting climate change. “We intend to engage further on addressing climate change between our two ministries, as well as through the Finance Mobilization pillar of the recently launched Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue under the U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership.” India has been under pressure, including from the U.S. and U.K., to provide a deadline to reach ‘Net Zero’ emissions. India has so far not made commitments beyond its Paris-related goals and has argued that rich countries must move towards ‘net minus’ commitments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/us-india-ministerial-dialogue-adds-focus-on-climate-finance/article37014798.ece
16 October 2021||Washington DC,||India showing signs of steady economic recovery, says FM||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the Development Committee — i.e., the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and IMF — on Friday and told the Committee that the Indian economy was showing signs of steady recovery despite pandemic-related challenges, the Ministry of Finance said. Ms. Sitharaman also welcomed the World Bank Group’s $157 million in support to more than 100 countries and for approving vaccine projects in 50-plus countries, enabling the purchase of 290 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, the Ministry said via Twitter. The International Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC) — which directs the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and sets its agenda — had met on Thursday as part of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Finance ministers and central bankers, who constitute the committee, including Ms. Sitharaman, were present. A communique from the IMFC noted that while the world economy is recovering from the pandemic, divergences exist between various economies driven by differences in vaccine availability and different levels of policy support. The IMFC also welcomed the new SDR (Special Drawing Rights) allocation, reserve assets of the IMF, $650 billion of which were newly created this year. In her statement, Ms. Sitharaman called for closer examination of the impact on emerging markets of “faster than expected” normalisation of policy in advanced economies. She said the Fund would need to play a key role in ensuring the smooth transition of policy withdrawals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-showing-signs-of-steady-economic-recovery-says-fm/article37014796.ece

Due to the lower cost, rooftop solar photovoltaics (RTSPV) technology, such as roof-mounted solar panels used in homes, and commercial and industrial buildings, is currently the fastest deployable energy generation technology. This is projected to fulfil up to 49% of the global electricity demand by 2050.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Du Plessis runs rampant, powers Chennai Super Kings to 192||Marshalled expertly by M.S. Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings overcame Kolkata Knight Riders by 27 runs to win its fourth title in the Indian Premier League, at Dubai, on Friday. Defending a combative 192 on a good batting surface, Dhoni rang in the changes cleverly, closed down the angles in the field, and kept finding wickets after a blistering 91-run partnership in 10.4 overs between the exciting Venkatesh Iyer and Shubman Gill. Formidable total Earlier, riding on Faf du Plessis’ 59-ball 86, CSK, put in to bat, posted a formidable 192 for three. Then it defended the target with verve although Venkatesh, on zero, was dropped by Dhoni, when Josh Hazlewood got one to seam away. Southpaw Venkatesh made CSK pay. The next delivery was pulled for a six. And the nerveless Venkatesh proceeded to essay a string of shots against pacemen between cover and point, and dismissed Ravindra Jadeja ruthlessly for sixes. Venkatesh eventually fatally sliced Shardul Thakur. Then left-handed Nitish Rana drove a cross-seamer straight to mid-off. Thakur’s double strike hurt KKR. Sunil Narine was superbly taken at deep mid-wicket by Jadeja off Hazlewood. Pace variations were on view. Opener Gill was keeping one end going although he was not able to up the tempo, save a few shots of grace and timing. He was fortunate on 27 when Ambati Rayudu ‘caught’ a skier off Jadeja but replays revealed the ball had struck the spider cam on its way up. Gill was trapped leg-before by a full delivery from Chahar for 51. KKR proceeded to lose a bunch of wickets. Dinesh Karthik was prised out by Jadeja, who then trapped Shakib Al Hasan leg-before. If the choice was between the explosive Andre Russell and Shakib for the final, KKR had picked the wrong man. The out-of-form skipper Eoin Morgan was taken out by Hazlewood. It was all over for KKR Earlier, du Plessis was fortunate to be let off on two by Karthik, who missed a leg-side stumping off Shakib. It was a huge moment in the game. The Kolkata bowlers took a pounding. There was some more bad news for KKR. The in-form Rahul Tripathi hurt his hamstring while fielding. du Plessis and the light-footed Ruturaj Gaikwad disrupted the bowlers’ length, found the gaps, hit over the infield, or cleared the ropes. Incredibly, both finished with 600 plus runs in this edition. From his back-and-across movement, du Plessis launched his attack. Ferguson received the treatment, pulled, punched through covers, and struck through the straight-field. And he also cleared the ropes off the spinners. Meanwhile, Ruturaj (635 runs) went past K.L. Rahul to get his hands on the Orange Cap. Ruturaj, on 32, was caught in the deep off Narine. There was no let up in the barrage of CSK shots. The powerful Robin Uthappa smote Shakib and clubbed Varun Chakravarthy, both over mid-wicket, for a brace of sixes. And Uthappa lifted Narine over mid-wicket for another six. Uthappa’s hurricane 15-ball 31 enabled CSK to maintain its momentum. The bold Uthappa perished attempting a reverse sweep to Narine. In the innings’ climactic phase, the left-handed Moeen Ali timed the ball sensationally, picking Varun’s carrom ball and googly and making a 20-ball unbeaten 37. This was a night when CSK made all the right moves.  Ruturaj (635 runs) went past Rahul to win the Orange Cap A blistering 91-run opening stand between Venkatesh and Gill wasn’t enough for KKR    CSK on the verge of title  KKR was 145 for eight in 18 overs. Gill (51) and Venkatesh (50) came good but the others fell apart||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/du-plessis-runs-rampant-powers-chennai-super-kings-to-192/article37014915.ece
16 October 2021||Male,||India starts favourite against Nepal||Having endured a topsy-turvy beginning to its campaign before a fine turnaround, seven-time champion India will start title favourite when it takes on first-time finalist Nepal in the summit clash of the SAFF Championships here on Saturday. The final will be the 12th for India in 13 editions which shows the domination of the Blue Tigers in this regional tournament. The third-place finish in 2003 was the worst performance. A win against Nepal will also be head coach Igor Stimac’s first trophy after taking charge of the Indian team. Should the team come good, he will become the sixth coach to win the SAFF Championships title and third foreigner after Jiri Pesek (1993) and Stephen Constantine (2015). Stimac will, however, not be in the Indian team dugout on Saturday as he was shown a red card (second yellow card) in the Maldives match apparently for protesting the referee’s decisions. Shanmugam to guide His assistant Shanmugam Venkatesh, himself a SAFF Championships winner, will guide the side. The frayed nerves before the must-win Maldives match are no longer there after a dominant win over the defending and two-time champion, which was considered the toughest opponent in the region but the job is not yet done. Nepal, ranked 61 places below India at 168th, has shown that it is no pushover in this tournament and it needed a late goal (82nd minute) from Chhetri for India to beat it in the round-robin match. India has the psychological advantage as recent statistics will show that Stimac’s side is the clear favourite to lift the title yet again. In the three matches played between the two sides so far this year, India won twice and drew once.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-starts-favourite-against-nepal/article37014808.ece
16 October 2021||London,||All eyes will be on Newcastle as it hosts Spurs||Struggling Newcastle finds itself in the unusual position of being the Premier League’s headline act at the start of its Saudi-led revolution this weekend. So often consigned to the margins during decades of underachievement, all eyes will be on the club on Sunday when it hosts Tottenham in its first match since the controversial takeover that has Magpies fans dreaming of joining Europe football’s elite. Manchester United must defy injury problems as it looks to get back on track at Leicester, while leader Chelsea cannot underestimate a Brentford team unfazed by big reputations. A look at some of the talking points ahead of the weekend action: Sky is the limit Newcastle can suddenly look forward to a brighter future thanks to the blockbuster £305 million ($418 million) takeover driven by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which has taken an 80% stake in the club. The departure of disliked former owner Mike Ashley and the vast financial resources provided by the Saudis could turn Newcastle into a major force in years to come. But while it aims to emulate cash-rich Manchester City, for now it must focus on the fight for survival. The only way is up for the Magpies, whose new owners arrive with the team languishing in the relegation zone, winless after their first seven league games. Manager Steve Bruce is expected to make way for a high-profile replacement but Newcastle hinted at a stay of execution on Thursday when it said the beleaguered boss will handle media duties before the Spurs game.  After the adrenaline rush of Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to Old Trafford, reality has started to bite for Manchester United. Ronaldo’s goal spree at the start of his second spell with United following his move from Juventus papered over some cracks in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side that threaten to derail its bid for a first major trophy since 2017. Hampered by inconsistent attacking play and defensive blunders, United has won just two of its past six games in all competitions. Brentford test for Chelsea Off the pitch, the financial gulf between European champions Chelsea and its west London neighbour Brentford is vast, but Saturday’s first league match between the clubs for 74 years could be a lot closer than it appears on paper. While Chelsea can call on some of the most expensive players in Europe, its unheralded neighbour has returned to the top flight for the first time since 1947 thanks to the shrewd use of analytics in the transfer market and manager Thomas Frank’s tactics. Chelsea’s hopes of retaining its narrow lead at the top of the table rest on matching Brentford’s intensity levels.  The fixtures:   Saturday: Watford v Liverpool, Aston Villa v Wolves, Leicester v Manchester United, Manchester City v Burnley, Norwich v Brighton, Southampton v Leeds, Brentford v Chelsea.   Sunday: Everton v West Ham, Newcastle v Tottenham.   Monday: Arsenal v Crystal Palace .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/all-eyes-will-be-on-newcastle-as-it-hosts-spurs/article37015221.ece
16 October 2021||Antigua,||‘Ambrose is as much an achiever as Gayle’||Curtly Ambrose is an achiever who has earned his stripes to have an opinion of his own which someone like Chris Gayle must learn to “respect” even if it’s not in his favour, said iconic Sir Vivian Richards. Ambrose, a known critic of the ‘Universe Boss’, had told a radio channel in the Caribbean that Gayle shouldn’t be “an automatic choice” in the West Indies playing eleven for the T20 World Cup as he has very little performance to show even in franchise cricket for the past 18 months. To this Gayle had lashed out on Ambrose, saying the former fast bowler of late 80’s and 90’s was a “negative person” for whom he had “no respect”. First captain Richards, who had been Ambrose’s first international captain, came to his former pace spearhead’s defence. “It’s Curly’s honest opinion and he’s entitled to that and he is just as much as an achiever as Chris Gayle at the highest level,” Richards told Daily Observer . “So when you hear it’s coming from an individual who would have also been an achiever and being a legend in the department of the sport we would have represented, you must have respect for that too.” Richards urged Gayle to take Ambrose’s criticisms positively as he might just not be the only one taking a dig at his current form. “If I were Chris, the best positive way I would look at it would be to set my mind on what I would like to accomplish because it is just not Curtly because there are so many folks who would have had their criticisms about Gayle,” added Richards. Ambrose had said: “For me, Gayle is definitely not an automatic choice for starting. When you look at his exploits over the last 18 months, he has struggled not only for the West Indies, but other T20 franchises. The few home series we played, he hasn’t had any scores of significance.” Gayle had an angry repartee at the former pace bowling great, stating that he no longer looks up to him in respect like he did in earlier times.  There are so many folks who would have had their criticism about Gayle, says Richards||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ambrose-is-as-much-an-achiever-as-gayle/article37014910.ece

Praggnanandhaa made a dream start to his campaign in the $40,000 Challengers Chess Tour Finals by blanking Russian talent Volodar Murzin 3-0 in the quarterfinals on Thursday. In the best-of-four-game encounter, Praggnanandhaa won twice with black pieces and emerged triumphant. After dominating the opening game with black pieces and signing off in style with a queen-offer in 38 moves, Praggnanandhaa needed five moves less with white pieces to take a 2-0 lead.

Brazil is now six points clear in the South American qualifying group, ahead of second-placed Argentina who beat Peru 1-0 with a goal from Lautaro Martinez. Brazil took the lead after 10 minutes when Neymar chested down a pass from Fred and rounded the ’keeper Fernando Muslera before firing low between two defenders on the goal-line. Raphinha made it 2-0 after 18 minutes when he bundled home a parried shot from close range and then made it 3-0 after 58 minutes.

16 October 2021||Dubai,||Familiar conditions in the UAE will help Pakistan at the T20 World Cup: Sana Mir||Pakistan emerged as “one of the best teams in the world” playing in UAE and Babar Azam and his men will fare well in the men’s T20 World Cup due to familiarity with the conditions, says the country’s former women’s skipper Sana Mir. The T20 World Cup is set to begin here on Sunday with Pakistan playing its opening fixture against India on October 24. Since the 2009 terror attack on the Sri Lankan team, the PCB has been hosting most of its international matches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah as other teams showed reluctance to tour Pakistan, citing security concerns. “T20 cricket is so unpredictable and it is almost impossible to pick a winner, especially with squads changing all the time,” Mir wrote in her column for ICC. “But with the conditions in mind, it is hard to look past Pakistan. They know UAE so well of course and became one of the best teams in the world while playing there. Head and heart “So, I’m not just following my heart in predicting a good tournament for them. My head says the same thing.” However, Mir feels inaugural champions India and New Zealand can’t be ruled out either. “I like the look of England and the West Indies, while India and New Zealand will always be dangerous too and that’s the beauty of T20 cricket — it’s so open.” Mir, who retired from all forms of cricket in 2019, feels T20 has “changed the game and especially the women’s game.” “In Pakistan, women’s cricket is very different from what it was before. Firstly, it has given us an opportunity to play a different brand of cricket. “When I started with Pakistan, we were such a young and inexperienced squad and learning to construct a 50-over game was not easy for us at the international level. Game-changer “But T20 changed that, it helped us to be more attacking.” She feels the other two formats have also benefited from the emergence of T20 cricket. “I think T20 cricket has benefited the other two formats and you see in Test cricket especially how confident batters are to display their skills. “They can change the course of a Test in one session using shots that didn’t exist 20 years ago.” The standard of fielding has also gone up because of T20 format, reckons Mir. “T20 is so fast, you need fast fielders to make an impact and the standard has never been higher, while the knock-on effect is 50-over and Test cricket has also benefited,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/familiar-conditions-in-the-uae-will-help-pakistan-at-the-t20-world-cup-sana-mir/article37014917.ece

Dhoni also spoke about the importance of individual performances, especially in knockouts and closing out games.

16 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Karan meets Aman in the boys’ final||Karan Singh demonstrated his big game and a sound temperament in overcoming a spirited challenge from top seed Nishant Dabas for a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory in the semifinals of the National junior tennis championship at the DLTA Complex on Friday. In the final, Karan will face the second seed Aman Dahiya who cruised past Sandesh Kurale 6-2, 6-1. Both Nishant and Aman, the two best-ranked juniors in the country, were scheduled to compete in South Africa, but had to stay back to bolster the quality of the national championship. For the sparse gathering, it was a glimpse into the future, as Karan revealed his immense potential. Karan has been focusing on the men’s circuit, and played a matching game with explosive serves and all-court power play blended with a touch of finesse. It was to the credit of Nishant that he weathered the storm to make a battle of it. However, after aligning his game better in the third set, Karan shut out the escape routes for his fellow trainee at the National Tennis Centre. It had to be admitted that National coach Zeeshan Ali has been admirably tuning some of the best talent in the country. In the girls’ section, Shruti Ahlawat stayed on course in her quest for the title, as she outplayed top seed Reshma Maruri for the loss of four games. However, Reshma’s sister Suhitha kept her composure to outgun Anjali Rathi 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.  The results:   Under-18 boys (semifinals): Karan Singh bt Nishant Dabas 6-2, 3-6, 6-3; Aman Dahiya bt Sandesh Kurale 6-2, 6-1; Quarterfinals: Nishant Dabas bt Aayush Bhat 6-2, 3-6, 6-3; Karan Singh bt Rushil Khosla 6-1, 6-2; Sandesh Kurale bt Denim Yadav 6-3, 6-1; Aman Dahiya bt Daksh Prasad 6-1, 6-0.   Doubles (final): Karan Singh & Ajay Malik bt Aayush Bhat & Rushil Khosla 7-5, 6-3.   Under-18 girls (semifinals): Shruti Ahlawat bt Reshma Maruri 6-4, 6-0; Suhitha Maruri bt Anjali Rathi 3-6, 6-4, 6-4; Quarterfinals: Reshma bt Hitakamya Singh Narwal 6-1, 6-0; Shruti bt Lakshmi Prabha 6-3, 6-2; Anjali bt Sanjana Sirimalla 6-2, 6-3; Suhitha bt Ruma Gaikaiwari 6-2, 2-6, 6-0.   Doubles (final): Riya Uboveja & Sudipta Senthilkumar bt Shruti Ahlawat & Ruma Gaikaiwari 7-5, 6-7(1), [10-7].||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/karan-meets-aman-in-the-boys-final/article37015641.ece
16 October 2021||Madrid,||Barcelona begins a testing week as Dynamo Kiev and Real Madrid await||Ronald Koeman said his players will benefit from knowing he is staying on as Barcelona coach and his theory will be tested by a pivotal week that starts when it hosts Valencia on Sunday. After Valencia, Barca faces Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Wednesday before hosting Real Madrid in the first Clasico of the season four days later. Koeman might feel buoyed by the backing of his president, but he will also know the reprieve given to him by Joan Laporta before the international break comes with conditions attached. Barcelona cannot afford further stumbles against Valencia and Madrid, given they sit ninth in LaLiga after seven games played, already five points behind Madrid at the top of the table, albeit having a game in hand. And another slip against Dynamo in midweek could spell the end of their hopes of qualifying for the knock-out stages of the Champions League, after defeats by Bayern Munich and Benfica left Barca rooted to the bottom of Group E. Many believed these matches would be the first for a new coach, after a run of one victory in six games left Koeman looking beleaguered, isolated and out of touch with his president and players. ‘Leaks’ In the press conference before Barcelona's last game against Atletico Madrid, Koeman offered only a little resistance to questions presuming his departure was imminent. "I have eyes and ears and I know that things are being leaked. They are probably true, but nobody has told me," Koeman said. Instead, Laporta emerged on the morning of the Atletico game to say Koeman's job was safe and that he would continue regardless of the result at the Wanda Metropolitano, where a few hours later Barca limped to a 2-0 defeat. "Previously there was no clarity," said Koeman after the game. "It is very important for the confidence of the coach and for the players too, that they know the coach is still here. "We are Barca, we have to win games, this pressure is also normal. It exists for any coach but especially at Barca. "But the president has spoken well. He has made his decision and everything is perfect."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-begins-a-testing-week-as-dynamo-kiev-and-real-madrid-await/article37015452.ece
16 October 2021||Nairobi,||Husband held for Tirop’s murder||The husband of Olympic runner Agnes Tirop has been arrested and will be charged with her murder after Kenyan police launched a nationwide manhunt and found him in the coastal city of Mombasa trying to flee the country, authorities said. Ibrahim Rotich was arrested on Thursday, police said, but only after crashing his vehicle into a truck in a car chase with the police and escaping a first attempt by officers to apprehend him about 460km from Mombasa. He was finally arrested hours later in the eastern city. Gruesome Rotich was detained a day after Tirop, a two-time World championship bronze medallist, was found stabbed to death at her home in the western town of Iten, more than 800km from Mombasa on the other side of the country. The 25-year-old Tirop’s body was found in a pool of blood with stab wounds in the abdomen, police said. Rotich was immediately identified as the prime suspect and police said he went on the run after making a tearful phone call to his family confessing he had done something terrible. Rotich was arrested along with another man he was travelling with and had Tirop’s cell phone with him, police said. The Directorate for Criminal Investigations said Rotich was being questioned at a police station and would be charged with murder. Rotich and Tirop were married in a traditional Kenyan ceremony but were estranged at the time of her killing. Their families had convinced them to try to reconcile and they had apparently met this week to do that. Tirop was a rising star in Kenya after winning the 2015 World cross-country title at the age of 19, the second youngest athlete ever to win that event. She also claimed bronze in the 10,000m at the 2017 and 2019 World championships and finished fourth in the 5,000m at the Tokyo Olympics. Last month, she broke the world record for the women-only 10km road race. Mark of respect Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was one of many who expressed outrage at her killing. Kenyatta said Tirop was a “Kenyan hero” and ordered police to find her killer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/husband-held-for-tirops-murder/article37015454.ece
16 October 2021||Chandigarh,||Amandeep triumphs||Amandeep Drall bounced back with one of the best rounds of the season as she drilled eight birdies against just one bogey for a superb seven-under 65 in the final round to win the 10th leg of the Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour by three shots here. Amateur Avani Prashanth, who shared the overnight lead with Amandeep after two rounds, was left three shots behind despite a fine four-under 68. She finished in second place. Vani Kapoor tripped to one-over 73 and was fourth, while Jahanvi Bakshi (68) was third. Amandeep, for whom this was her first title in 2021, finished with a superb nine-under 207, while Avani was six-under 210 and Jahanvi was four-under 212. Vani also had an under-par total of one-under 215. Amandeep had started the week with 4-under 68 before slipping on the second day with 74. In the final round, she fell back by two shots after the first hole as she bogeyed the first and playing partner and overnight co-leader, Avani had a birdie on the same hole. Soon after Amandeep found her form as she birdied second, fourth, sixth and seventh to turn in 3-under 33. Avani dropped a shot on fourth where Amandeep had a birdie for a two-shot swing. That helped Amandeep go ahead by one. Like Amandeep, Avani also birdied the sixth and seventh but was still one behind at the turn. On the back nine Amandeep drove off on her own with three birdies in a row from 11th to 13th, while Avani had gains only on 13th. Both birdied the 16th but with two holes left and three shots clear Amandeep made no mistake and Avani was unable to find any more birdies. The win also cemented Amandeep’s place on top of the Hero Order of Merit, which she was already leading.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/amandeep-triumphs/article37015455.ece
16 October 2021||Jaipur,||Joshi is champion at Jaipur||Khalin Joshi’s final round of three-under 67 was good enough for him to turn the tables on overnight leader M. Dharma and emerge victorious at the Rs. 40 lakh Jaipur Open golf tournament, organised by Rajasthan Tourism, here on Friday. Joshi (61, 66, 64, 67), who made a dramatic three-putt from four feet on the last hole to end the tournament with a bogey, won by one shot at 22-under 258. Khalin’s fifth career trophy ended a three-year title drought. The 29-year-old Joshi, who hails from Karnataka, overcame the disappointment of his runner-up finish in Delhi last week and took home a winning cheque for Rs. 6,46,600 to move up from fifth to third in the PGTI Order of Merit. He made six birdies and three bogeys on the last day. Dharma (62, 62, 65, 70), the overnight leader by two shots, slipped to second with an even-par 70. He ended the week with a total of 21-under 259. Sunit Chowrasia (64) of Kolkata and Harendra Gupta (65) of Chandigarh tied for third place at 20-under 260. Chowrasia’s round featured seven birdies and a bogey while Gupta had an eagle, four birdies and a bogey. Chandigarh’s Yuvraj Singh Sandhu produced the best round of the tournament, a 10-under 60, but ended tied seventh at 18-under 262. Yuvraj sank an eagle on the 18th from five feet and also made nine birdies and a bogey during his round. Olympian Udayan Mane (64) was tied ninth at 17-under 263.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/joshi-is-champion-at-jaipur/article37015461.ece
16 October 2021||Liverpool,||Klopp questions Newcastle buyout||Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp called on the Premier League on Friday to explain the reasons for approving the buyout of Newcastle by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund amid human rights concerns in the kingdom. Speaking at length about the potential effects of the Saudi ownership, Klopp said Newcastle was now “owned by a country” and would have a “guaranteed” spot in the Champions League within a few years. The Premier League approved the protracted $409 million takeover last week after saying it was satisfied that the Public Investment Fund (PIF) produced “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle.” That fund, which has bought 80% of the club, is chaired by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, while there are six Saudi ministers and an advisor to the royal court on the PIF’s board. Activists have highlighted to the Premier League Saudi human rights violations, including the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul after US intelligence services said they believe the slaying came at the crown prince’s orders. The kingdom has denied that. “Actually, I was waiting for some official statements about it from (Premier League chief executive) Richard Masters or somebody else, because we all know there are concerns about human rights issues,” Klopp said. “I think that’s all clear, we all think the same there,” he said. “Obviously,” Klopp added, “the Premier League, or Richard Masters, thought, yeah, let’s give it a go.’ It’s not the first time, but as far as I know, it’s the first club which is now owned by a country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/klopp-questions-newcastle-buyout/article37015227.ece

16 October 2021||DUBAI,||Dhoni first captain to lead in 300 T20s||Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Friday became the first player in world cricket to captain a team in 300 T20 games across competitions during his side’s IPL summit clash against Kolkata Kight Riders here. The 40-year-old Dhoni, playing his 10th IPL final and ninth for CSK as captain, has led the Yellow Brigade in 214 games across 12 editions that the team has taken part. He also led Rising Pune Supergiants in one IPL season, apart from leading India in six T20 World Cups. His crowning glory was leading India to the T20 World title in South Africa in 2007. Before that tournament, India had played only one T20I in 2006 in South Africa in which Dhoni was part of. “It’s been a long time. We started T20 around 2005-06 and most of the games have been franchise cricket and in the last five years there have been a lot of T20 games in international cricket as well,” Dhoni said at the toss before the final. Darren Sammy, who has led the team in 208 games for West Indies apart from various franchises, is second in the list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhoni-first-captain-to-lead-in-300-t20s/article37014907.ece

Speaking about his plans for next year, Dhoni said, “basically it depends on the BCCI, you know with two new teams coming in. We have to decide what is good for CSK. It’s not really about me being there in the top three or four or whatever the retained number of players is. “It is about, you know, making a strong core and making sure that the franchise doesn’t really suffer because it will be an auction where you have to make the team for the next 10 years,” Dhoni said. “We were definitely in 2008, the core group that carried on for more than 10 years, but we have to have a hard look as to in the next 10 years who are the people, you know, will contribute in a similar manner,” he added. When presenter Harsha Bhogle pointed out that he could be proud of the legacy he has left behind, Dhoni quipped with a smile, “But still I haven’t left behind.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-have-to-decide-what-is-good-for-csk-dhoni/article37015212.ece

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Dharma in practice||Prakriti and the three gunas are the source of the variety of modes and forms in the universe. It is important to understand the extent to which these rule over the complex pattern of the life of all beings, the devas, the humans and the asuras. A story quoted in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad exemplifies this truth in a very striking way, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Once, the devas, the asuras and the human beings seek instruction from Prajapati for their suffering. Prajapati merely utters the syllable “Da” thrice as instruction to all the three of them. Each of them gets the message intended for them. This is because they are self introspective and each of them is able to derive the meaning of the instruction with reference to the inherent defects in their individual natures. The devas understand their weakness as desire and when it is manifest they are led astray. They should learn to curb their own desires. The asuras being by nature powerful lack compassion and so they have to cultivate the quality of mercy. The human beings learn that they should be willing to give to others in charity. They should consciously nurture the habit of being generous to all and not be selfish about their possessions. These are qualities that make up one’s worth. The wise speak of Dharma as a bull resting on four legs, namely Truth, Purity, Compassion and Charity. Brahman is synonymous with Satyam and when we swerve from truth we come under the control of Maya, symbolic of untruth. The second leg stands for purity in all aspects. Compassion, the third leg motivates the practice of the highest dharma, ahimsa. The fourth pada is charity, Dana, which reinforces the principle that the world has got to feed the need of everybody and not the greed of few.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/dharma-in-practice/article37014871.ece

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Master of the||Anupam Tripathi is starry-eyed as he talks about the smash hit Korean show Squid Game, which has propelled him into the limelight. “The love from people around the world hasn’t stopped,” says Anupam, in a virtual conversation from Seoul. The Delhi-born actor plays Contestant 199 Ali Abdul, an undocumented migrant worker from Pakistan who joins 455 other debt-ridden contestants as they participate in a series of children’s games with a deadly twist... all for a whopping cash prize. Amidst all the gore and betrayal in Squid Game , Anupam’s Ali stands out, an endearing character that the Internet has collectively chosen to root for. Casting an actor to play Ali was something that had the show’s director Hwang Dong-hyuk worried and in a Netflix interview following the show’s release, he said that Anupam Tripathi appeared ‘out of the blue’. “He was fluent in Korean and he could act. His emotional acting was amazing,” Dong-Hyuk recalled. Anupam landed the role after multiple rounds of auditions and says that it was then that he realised how different playing Ali was going to be compared to his previous on-screen appearances. “I began to think about the similarities as well as differences Ali and I shared. Ali was a healthy guy and needed to look like someone who had power to compete and do well in the games. For that, I had to work hard on my physique and gain six kilos,” recalls the actor, who has lived in South Korea for the last 11 years. Born and raised in Delhi, Anupam made his way to South Korea after bagging a scholarship to study acting. Anupam says he relied on articles and documentaries to learn more about migrant workers in South Korea and across the world. “These are very real things happening across the world. I kept filling my mind by meeting people, reading about them and watching documentaries to play Ali on screen,” he says. Being fluent in Korean meant that Anupam had to work on his dialogue delivery, given that the character he was playing had probably been in South Korea for less than a year. “It was hard to go back and undo things,” he says, with a laugh. “I sought out friends from abroad who had only recently come to South Korea to converse with them.” On the show, Ali is introduced in the middle of the terrifying red-light green-light game as he heroically saves fellow contestant Seong Gi-Hun (Lee Jung-Jae) from elimination. “I remember Jung-Jae asking me to be free and express myself however I wished to,” he says. It is, however, Anupam’s scenes with another contestant, Cho Sang-Woo (played by Park Hae-Soo) that has come in for much praise. Park Hae Soo, he says, was a gentle and caring co-star with whom he spent a lot of time. “While I sought him out for feedback, he used to do the same with me, and that was surprising as he’s such a well-known actor. There was constant exchange of ideas.” While he has played small roles in popular K-dramas Descendants of the Sun and Hospital Playlist, among others, Anupam hopes that Squid Game will mark the start of diverse characters being given prominence on screen and impact the way stories are told. “In my opinion, all kinds of characters will be seen; I’m working hard too for this change to happen in the future. Going forward, I can play any character,” he says, referring to representation on screen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/master-of-the/article37015176.ece

For someone watching cricket for the first time, KL Rahul would’ve stood out that day for two reasons. One: he made the most number of runs that game (116 off just 51 balls) even as his team lost by a run. Two: his hairstyle. Rahul looked more like a West Indian player with his cornrow braids. The team’s coach, Anil Kumble, was mildly shocked.  The Beckham inspiration   “My mantra has always been: ‘Try things. If something doesn’t come off, I don’t mind it’,” says Rahul, 29, of his fashion choices, ahead of the launch of Puma’s 1DER, an athleisure range he is designed with the sporting brand, which released on September 30. This mantra applies to his life, too. In school, Rahul , the son of two professors, used to turn up in flip-flops and coloured hair. He admits to being a rebellious teenager, but this was not just to provoke people. An ardent David Beckham fan, he had an idea of how he wanted to look even then. “I was more interested in his lifestyle, and less about the football,” adds the cricketer, who now follows personalities like Justin Bieber and Travis Scott. “They are artists who also dipped their hands into fashion. That interested me and I thought I could do this too.” And, he did. Two years ago, Rahul launched his street-wear label, Gully, with retail partner Zeko Online. 1DER, too, is an avenue to express his fashion ideas and the range (recently released on Flipkart)includes low-boot sneakers (crafted in leather, with mesh upper) in bright hues of orange and blue, caps, and  an apparel line comprising hoodies, pants and the like.  “It was so cool to work with the Puma team [he’s been associated with the brand since 2018]. I discuss designs and colours, especially for the sneakers, as I am a massive sneakerhead.”  Expressions in ink   Aftercricket, fashion is his second love. His mother was shocked when he got his first tattoo (wings on his back) at 16. Rahul went on to tattoo his mother’s name, Rajeshwari, on his right wrist. “Every tattoo has a unique story.” This is especially true for the one on his right forearm — it reads, ‘ deshi basara ’ — an inspiring chant from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises, which roughly translates to ‘rise’. Rahul, after a horrific Test debut in Melbourne, bounced back within a week in Sydney with a fine century. This year, too, he was among India’s key performers in their Test wins in England. This, after being dropped from the Test side for a while. His journey has seen many falls and rises. He concludes, “I would not have wanted it any other way.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-game-to-puma/article37015157.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Bakari, the baboon returns to the big screen||Real-life animal drama unfolds in Sony BBC Earth’s Serengeti 2 as the series returns to capture stories of iconic African savannah animals. Bakari, the baboon struggles with family life. Kali the lioness makes a difficult decision. A family of leopards arrive — and the cubs test their mother’s patience as they get used to their new home. The series is produced and directed by John Downer, a passionate zoologist who has been making groundbreaking Nature documentaries for the BBC for over 30 years. He is known for shows like Serengeti (2019), Polar Bears : Spy on the Ice (2011), Spy in the Snow (2020). In an interview over Zoom, the Emmy winner talks about lessons learned from his interactions with animals. In Serengeti1 , we meet a lonely lioness, a passionate baboon and many other animals. What happens in Serengeti2 ?     Serengeti 2 continues where series 1 left off with a host of new storylines and a cast of old favourites as well as some endearing new animal characters. The wonderful thing about Serengeti is that it keeps delivering new stories. All the animals continually surprise us. There are disasters, triumphs and other things that make drama. There are baby animals that have to learn to live in this very tricky world... Like humans, animals have different personalities and make different decisions. When there are so many different species crammed together and having to interact with each other, you get all the drama. Nothing is predictable and that’s why it’s so refreshing, and keeps those stories coming, evolving, and changing. Can you share a story that surprised you? Bakari, the baboon and his troupe were trapped up a roosting tree surrounded by water. I had expected him to climb down the tree or try swimming in the water, but he decided go up the very top and leap to get somewhere near the land. A whole lot just followed. That was something you couldn’t write, expect or anticipate. That’s what I love aboutSerengeti,to show those animals thinking for themselves and making decisions. I am sure another baboon would have made a different decision. There is surprise after surprise. How dramatised is the story-telling?  We shot it over two years. The stories are based on their real behaviour but the dramatised bit is how we mix the stories together and fill in the narrative. In normal natural history, you miss so much. But in a drama, you have to fill in those gaps. We follow the story of the cheetah and cubs from beginning to end. We got some adorable little leopard cubs, the hardest animals to film because they are so secretive. They let us into their lives and we used all techniques to get closer to them. Stories developed from those encounters. Though dramatisation gives license to change or shift time, the heart of it lies in real behaviour. What are the challenges you faced while filming Serengeti 2 ?  Flooding is one. I remember going across a little stream and an hour later filmed some great sequences with a new zebra foal (which features in the first programme). Then, the rain started and the stream became a river and un-crossable. We had to travel four hours to find a place that we could cross. Since we filmed during COVID-19, getting the teams out there was a real problem. One of our team members, stayed there for an entire year knowing that if he left, he’s never going to get back. What is the biggest takeaway for audiences?     Our films tell the stories of many animals. You can never expect where the stories would twist and turn. The important incident that happened is the biggest floods I have ever seen in Africa. This is the result of climate change. We started to see the impact on this ecosystem where it continuously rained. How do the animals cope with the land becoming a lake? I am hoping that people understand how interconnected our lives are. The whole point is to empathise, love those animals, and try and understand their problems.  Serengeti 2 premieres on October 18 at 9 pm on Sony BBC Earth||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bakari-the-baboon-returns-to-the-big-screen/article37015168.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Aditi Rao Hydari: ‘Maha Samudram’ is an unapologetic mainstream film||Aditi Rao Hydari is the Maha of Maha Samudram , the recently-released Telugu film. Her author-backed role is the centre of the drama but that is not the only reason she agreed to do the film. Settling down for an interview while promoting the film, Aditi says, “The biggest draw was director Ajay Bhupathi.” Having watched the director’s debut film RX-100 , she says, “I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. The storytelling was immersive. I respect him for his command over writing and filmmaking.” Ajay waited nearly two years for Aditi’s dates, given her other commitments and the pandemic upsetting schedules. But ultimately she was on board.    Maha Samudram being a larger-than-life mainstream outing was also a draw for Aditi: “Ajay is proud and unapologetic about the film’s large canvas that celebrates the heroes, the heroine, songs, dances and the drama. I love all of that in the film. I also got to work with two actors I admire and respect — Sharwanand and Siddharth. There is a notion that smaller films are more realistic and hence have stronger stories while the massy films sacrifice the story for songs and dances. Don’t we love the stories in Sholay or Bajrangi Bhaijaan ?” She recalls what she learnt from director Mani Ratnam during the making of Tamil films Kaatru Veliyidai and Chekka Chivantha Vaanam : “Mani sir made me value the ease of communicating with a director, comprehending what he or she wants from an actor, and the value an actor can bring to the script. All of this happened while working with Ajay Bhupathi. He was so sure of what he wanted from his actors to the point of being adamant, like a five year old.” Without divulging much, she describes Maha as a woman who goes through tumultuous events but retains her sense of calm, amid the storm brewing around her. As much as Aditi enjoys working in Ajeeb Daastaans (Hindi anthology) or Sufiyum Sujatayum (Malayalam), she is game for films like Maha Samudram. The bonus is the theatrical release. Her recent films, including V (Telugu), Girl on the Train and Sardar ka Grandson were direct digital releases during the pandemic. When she debuted in Telugu with Sammohanam (2018), it was a homecoming, given her paternal roots in Hyderabad. Though she wasn’t adept in the language, she dubbed for the film, staying in sync with her character of a North Indian female actor working in Telugu cinema.    Her mixed lineage and exposure to multiple cultures while growing up has made Aditi fit into films across different languages: “My grandmother is Mangalorean and a part of my family thinks I look like a Mangalorean. My grandfather is Telugu and I feel at home here. My dad is a Bohri Muslim and I’ve done similar roles. My dad lived in Chennai for a few years and I learnt Bharatanatyam from the age of five. Tamil comes to me more easily than Telugu.” At one point her mother, Hindustani classical singer Vidya Rao, asked if Aditi wanted to take up Tamil as a second language in school. Aditi refused, stating that Tamil was a tough language to learn: “I wish I had learnt it then.” But the acceptance she receives from people who watch films in different languages, she says, makes it worthwhile. Aditi recalls a Kerala-based newspaper stating that the actor is ‘our Sujatha’. “Malayalam cinema has such talented people and to find that kind of acceptance there was so moving. I am glad I can connect with people beyond the boundaries of language or religion.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/aditi-rao-hydari-maha-samudram-is-an-unapologetic-mainstream-film/article37015184.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Flour, sugar and the flavour of theyyam||It took a little over 25,000 biscuits to make a 24-foot tall portrait of the theyyam . Artist ‘Da Vinci’ Suresh, who has been on a mission to create 100 portraits using non-traditional art material, created the artwork for Bake Story Live Bakery in Kannur. This is his 79th portrait. After 15 hours of work that included putting together tables, drawing, sorting and stacking cookies, Suresh completed the portrait, which captures the incredibly nuanced face of the theyyam . Themukhathezhuthu(face painting) of the theyyam , a traditional art form which has its origins in the Malabar region of Kerala, is extremely intricate. “I had to recreate each line and curve accurately. I had to research in order to get the patterns on the head gear and the face right,” says Suresh. Sketching took two to three hours. Then came sorting the confection according to colour, size and shape. “The initial idea was to use just cookies made at the bakery. But the artist had to use bread, buns, dried fruits, puffed rice, jalebis and laddoos to capture the complexity of the mukhathezhuthu ,” says cook book author and chef consultant of the bakery, Rasheed Muhammed, who conceived the idea. Out of the box The bakery had held a week-long festival to mark its second anniversary in July this year, showcasing 150 kinds of traditional handmade biscuits. The cookies sold at the bakery are made by a family of bakers at Faridabad. “The idea was to create awareness and appreciation for our own diverse traditions of sweet-making in a creative way,” says Rasheed. The cookies in the portrait were sent to a veterinary farm for recycling, he adds. “Being in the open for 15 hours would turn the cookies soggy and we did not want it to go to waste,” Rasheed adds. For artist Suresh, who has created photographic portraits of celebrities and national heroes with everything from nails to gold ornaments, the creative process most often involves physical labour. For instance, his 80th and most recent portrait was of Mahatma Gandhi: he made it using over one lakh inflated balloons at the Kerala University campus in Thiruvananthapuram. The 182-feet installation needed over 100 people to set it up. “But it is a labour of love,” he says. Most of his portraits are installations — he made a 3D installation of Messi after the Copa America win for a sports shop in Mathilakam in Kodungallur. The 25-foot work was done using football jerseys, boots and other sports gear. “When you are re-creating people’s faces with materials, your options for colours are limited. You have to make do with what you have. If the placement of one object in the portrait changes, the person’s face changes,” says Suresh. He adds, “I don’t know how to explain my process, but I started out painting hoardings and I get my experience from there. The thing about doing such portraits is that there is no rehearsal or a do-over. You just go with the flow.”   Ancient art Theyyam is a ritual form of dance worship traditionally performed in the northern regions of Kerala. The art form is believed to be thousands of years old.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/flour-sugar-and-the-flavour-of-theyyam/article37015172.ece

Narrated by Gaiman himself for Audible, alongside actors like James McAvoy and Riz Ahmed, the audio version (launched in September 2021) has received great reviews across the spectrum, with good reason. Now, the podcast and audiobook platform has announced that Indian audiences will soon get a Hindi version of The Sandman . This is just one among the slew of announcements made by Audible India this week. They’ve just released an all-you-can-listen Audible Plus catalogue with over 15,000 titles available to existing users. There’s also a ‘free tier’ with over 150 Audible-exclusive podcasts and Originals (audio stories) — including Kaali Aawazein narrated by Amitabh Bachchan — and over 40,000 popular podcasts.  Expanding to new audiences  During a virtual interaction with The Hindu Weekend , Shailesh Sawlani, VP and Country GM, Audible India, said, “I think there’s plenty of room to grow within the audience we already cater to. What we’re trying to do with the new Plus catalogue is to deliver more value to our subscribers, including those who’re prolific consumers of more established forms of media, like streaming.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/audibles-streaming-shift/article37015154.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Love Actually||“Love is complicated, messy, glorious,” says author Parinda Joshi over phone from San Francisco. “Especially for youngsters today who are grappling with dating and relationships, trying to juggle reality and perceptions.” It is not just romantic love that is complicated, all kinds are, especially in families. And despite a salacious-sounding title, Parinda’s latest book, A House Full of Men, is a drama about a dysfunctional family, with multiple romances woven in. The mantle of running a home falls on the shoulders of Kritidhara, the 25-year-old protagonist, after the death of her mother. Her father, grandfather and twin brothers, each dealing with their own challenges, seem oblivious to her emotional plight. “We often don’t give our loved ones enough credit. By assuming her family would not understand her, Kritidhara is guilty of making the same mistake.” Set in Lucknow, House Full... (published by Harper Collins)  is drawn from experiences most Indian readers will identify with. However, Parinda treats topics such as second marriages, burdensome secrets, nosy neighbours and sibling rivalry, with a large dose of humour that makes her characters relatable, worth emulating even. Throw in a know-it-all housemaid, a lingering ex and a temperamental pet, and you could be reading about someone you know, maybe even yourself. Fans of chess, Wodehouse and pop culture will enjoy generous references sprinkled throughout the book. “Each character is navigating their own way through some form of emotional turbulence. Though House Full... might not be voluminous, there is enough scope to flesh out the characters into an episodic series,” says the author whose book Made in China was made into a Bollywood film in 2019 and starred Rajkumar Rao, Mouni Roy and Boman Irani. Talking about the age-old debate of book versus movie versions, Parinda believes an ‘as is’ adaptation is not always possible. “Subtext needs to be added for on-screen characters,” she says, adding actors bring depth to a character with their gestures, mannerisms, expressions and costumes. “Against popular ‘author’ ethic, each of my books comes under different genres — the previous two were a dark comedy and a social thriller. I am always writing in the background,” says Parinda, who works in a fashion start-up. An avid traveller and a humour junkie, Parinda, who toyed with the idea of becoming a stand-up comic, says it is easier to deliver a message, “wrapped in humour, rather than served straight up.” “My fascination with words began in middle school and I had a penchant for exaggerating as a child. The colourful art of storytelling found its way through pen pals, blogs, articles and now, books.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/love-actually/article37015175.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Why Shoojit Sircar had to wait for two decades to make ‘Sardar Udham’||Shoojit Sircar, who was born and raised in Bengal, has a distinct Punjab connection. Quite a few of his friends are from Chandigarh and Patiala. He even went to a Delhi University college named after Shaheed Bhagat Singh. His breakout film Vicky Donor revolved around a Punjabi family. And now, Punjab is also the place that gave Shoojit the idea for his upcoming movie Udham Singh starring Vicky Kaushal. About 20 years ago, just after college, Shoojit visited Jallianwala Bagh, where hundreds of protestors were shot dead under British orders on April 13, 1919. “It’s a place with a vibration. If you are familiar with what happened there, it touches you. It touched me during my first visit,” recalls Shoojit, “For a few years, I visited the place on the anniversary of the massacre. A lot of people would sit beside the wall and cry. Most of them were elders... I didn’t know who they were. But those visuals stayed with me.” He didn’t have a story, he didn’t have the money, and he didn’t have the actors. But the young graduate somehow knew he wanted to make a film on Jallianwala Bagh. The idea that Shoojit has been nurturing all these years has finally sprouted into Sardar Udham. Udham Singh was one of the few people who survived the tragedy. 21 years later, he went all the way to London to assassinate General O’Dwyer, who as Punjab’s Lieutenant Governor sanctioned the killings. Shoojit’s film traces the journey of this relatively little-known revolutionary. There are quite a few movies on Udham’s more famous contemporary from Punjab: Bhagat Singh. It is also one of the reasons Shoojit wanted to make a film on Udham; to shed more light on this man, who, he says, is seen as an avenger, folklore hero, revolutionary, and a philosopher.  Sardar Udham is Shoojit’s first biopic. To make a film about real people and events, he says, was tricky. His fictional characters are based on people he has met or known. In a way, they are more accessible to him than Udham, whom he has never met and can never meet. “It was difficult to get to know the character, to have conversations with it, to break it down,” he says. Putting a story together  There was not a lot of information available about Udham. He had to piece together his story from the fragments found in Hunter Committee Report (on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre), news articles, essays, and documentaries. After gathering as much information as possible, Shoojit had to then weave his fiction around it. “Since he is a freedom fighter, we should also be careful of how we are going to project him. For example, what he wore on a particular day can vary. But his sensibilities, his morals and values, his philosophy must not be wrong.” Irrfan Khan was supposed to play Udham. “I wanted a cerebral actor to play him. Who else than Irrfan?” But after his passing away last year, the role went to Vicky Kaushal. “I liked Vicky from Masaan. I needed someone who can be receptive to my idea of this character. And after listening, he adds his own touch to the portrayal. He also looked convincing in the different ages of the character.”  Sardar Udhamwill be on Amazon Prime Video from October 16||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/why-shoojit-sircar-had-to-wait-for-two-decades-to-make-sardar-udham/article37015180.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Everything makes||If you’re a child of the 80s and 90s, growing up in India, chances are you spent your younger years on a diet of  Champak , Amar Chitra Katha , and Chandamama . The stories tended to be slapstick or heavy on morals and mythology. “Shouldn’t you be reading something more serious?” was a question I often found myself fielding. That’s not a question one would ask a young person reading Comixense though. The new, quarterly comic magazine published by Ektara Trust aims to feed the ‘intelligence, imagination and empathy’ of readers between the ages of 12 and 17 with nuanced stories that touch upon science, technology, the environment and social justice.   The magazine is the brainchild of Goa-based artist and designer Orijit Sen. “From being a reader, collector and maker of comics from a young age, they taught me so many things that textbooks just couldn’t,” he says. “They provoked my imagination and the stories stimulated so much in me as a reader. Comics allow you to go back and forth in a way no other narrative medium does. The reader can break time and space in their own way to construct and deconstruct the narrative.”  Calling all comic artists  Launching a print magazine at a time when publications are going digital-only might raise eyebrows. Sen argues that the pandemic has forced young people to shift almost every aspect of their lives online. “We wanted to give them a reprieve from this digital life.” At a larger level, Sen believes that while countries like Japan and France have long-standing cultures of m anga and b andes dessinées , the comics scene in India needs to have more artists and writers who know and understand the medium. He sees Comixense as a possible breeding ground for this.  Rooted in realities  The richly-illustrated stories leap boldly across time and place and are rooted in lived realities and experiences, linking our past to the present and the future.      “Even though they’re rooted in science, these aren’t topics and themes that our education system deals with,” says CG Salamander, whose story Roots in issue 2, looks at thepazhaverkadu, or mangrove forests of Chennai’s Pulicat Lake. Young Rahman plants saplings in the water with his grandfather, in an attempt to protect the coast from the Thimingala, a folkloric monster that ‘swerves and swells, slithers and sides, swallowing shores’ and is a manifestation of the sea itself. Lokesh Khodke’s illustrations spillover between the pages and panels, mimicking the water and it’s will to move where it pleases. “This is not just a personal story about the environment, but talks of a wider social movement and the struggles people are fighting,” he says, adding, “Children often grow up with a skewed perception of certain communities. Stories like Roots and The Adivasi Will Not Dance (Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, Priyanka Purty and Neha Alice Kerketta) widen their perspective.” Sen hopes the magazine will be an antidote to the social media content that is created, consumed and forgotten with ease. Something that invites young people to read, pause, linger and revisit these stories, perhaps discovering something new each time they do.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/everything-makes/article37015153.ece

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Are we hugging yet?||The word ‘phygital’ was filed for copyright in 2013 by Momentum, an Australian ad agency, but 2020 saw it mentioned everywhere. That the fashion world would adapt to it has been a revelation. Most recently, we had FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week — the first post-pandemic phygital show in India — with 10 on-ground physical shows, and digital previews. For those of us who find inspiration, freedom and livelihoods in the fashion scene, this was good news.  A big new world  Jio Convention Centre was the venue. The space looked larger as the crowd was miniscule. The usual drinks lounges and media centres were missing, and with its high ceilings and tech-driven security, it was the safest I’d felt in a public place in a while. There was a strict mask, RT-PCR, and vaccination protocol, and show director Neeraj Gaba said, “We were tested every day for 12 days, quarantined alone before the physical shows, and maintained security bubbles.” The audience sat six feet apart, on individual chairs, in circles. But I missed the buzz of stylists, photographers, editors and celebs hanging around shows and stalls.  Hello from the other side  Many of us were seeing our peers for the first time since the start of the pandemic. There was hilarious confusion before greeting anyone — ‘Are we hugging yet?’ — and air kisses are a fashion joke. As I walked out of a show, Mitali Rannorey, a model I’ve styled several times, texted me: “So glad to see you in the audience today! I can’t come closer because we are in a bubble!” When I asked her how the 2021 experience was, she replied, “Walking on the ramp feels the same, but I miss the people.”  The Reunion  While not officially on the FDCI x LFW roster, Vaishali S’ bridal line, Shakuntala, was the first physical show I attended in 18 months, a day before fashion week officially began. At the Taj Mahal Palace hotel ballroom, it was her first outing in India after her Paris Couture Week debut in July. Her commitment to indigenous weaves was commendable, but for some looks it did not translate well. In stark contrast, veteran couturier Tarun Tahiliani opened the calendar with a mind-boggling 78-ensemble show. “Community is of paramount importance; it became essential that we support, help, and guide each other,” said Tahiliani, as he put a celebration of Indian karigari on full display.  Show and tell  “There is no virtual medium that can replace the human experience,” Nishant Gadhok of Gently Altered — a company that elevates event experience via sound and light design — told me as he closed the finale. But he acknowledged that the time away has helped him realign his visual language. And that is something we need. Internationally, fashion weeks that returned to physical shows this season have shown a lot of creativity. For instance, earlier this month, Balenciaga’s SS 2022 show in Paris took an innovative turn. Creative director Demna Gvasalia had guests and models walk the red carpet, and then watch a new Simpsons episode — where the characters walked as models. An immersive experience where the audience became a part of the show. Yes, making fashion weeks go live once again in India is step one, but fashioning them to be more creative will help bring fun in step two.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/are-we-hugging-yet/article37015055.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Why the queue?||Of late, cars have been snaking across our TV screens, stalled bumper to bumper at petrol pumps, producing inappropriately hearty ROFLMAO among us, that the UK should be queuing up, for a change. To us, who have grown older, wiser, fatter, sleepier — on calls which keep telling us to ‘Please wait, you are in a queue,’ this is less newsworthy than star shenanigans. We have spent at least a good percentage of our lives in queues, at banks, ticket counters, billing desks or lugging pillows to the all-night stake-out outside a school that would open its kindergarten admission window the next morning. And now, finally, the world has caught up! It’s time for us to teach everyone else some Qetiquette. Do not argue with chappals .  Chappals have rights, same as you or I. Someone who needs to attend the call of nature may legitimately leave his chappals , with full power of attorney, to replace him in the queue. Do not body-shame.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Everything makes||If you’re a child of the 80s and 90s, growing up in India, chances are you spent your younger years on a diet of Tinkle , Champak , Amar Chitra Katha , and Chandamama . The stories tended to be slapstick or heavy on morals and mythology. “Shouldn’t you be reading something more serious?” was a question I often found myself fielding. That’s not a question one would ask a young person reading Comixense though. The new, quarterly comic magazine published by Ektara Trust aims to feed the ‘intelligence, imagination and empathy’ of readers between the ages of 12 and 17 with nuanced stories that touch upon science, technology, the environment and social justice. The first of its kind in India (for this age group), the magazine is the brainchild of acclaimed Goa-based artist and designer Orijit Sen. “From being a reader, collector and maker of comics from a young age, they taught me so many things that textbooks just couldn’t,” he says. “They provoked my imagination and the stories stimulated so much in me as a reader. Comics allow you to go back and forth in a way no other narrative medium does. The reader can break time and space in their own way to construct and deconstruct the narrative.”  Calling all comic artists  Launching a print magazine at a time when publications are downing their shutters or going digital-only might raise eyebrows. Sen argues that the pandemic has forced young people to shift almost every aspect of their lives online: from school to socialising to extracurricular activities. “We wanted to give them a reprieve from this digital life.” At a larger level, Sen believes that while countries like Japan and France have long-standing cultures of m anga and b andes dessinées , the comics scene in India needs to have more artists and writers who know and understand the medium. He sees Comixense as a possible breeding ground for this. In fact, many of the contributors to the first three issues have never worked in this format before, and answered open calls for entries, or were given a one-line brief.  Rooted in lives realities  I was out when the first two issues arrived at home. I returned to find a torn and crumpled envelope lying on the table, and two children furtively reading an issue each under their desks while online school was in session. When I finally got hold of the magazines, I could see why they’d been so enthralled. The richly-illustrated stories leap boldly across time and place and are rooted in lived realities and experiences, linking our past to the present and the future, giving the reader a deeply-immersive reading experience.  The Plague Doctor’s Apprentice (Indrajit Hazra and Paue), starts in Florence, 2020, as riots break out against government-imposed Covid-19 lockdowns. The story then steps back in time to 1630, when Florence is in the grip of the Bubonic Plague. Hazra draws parallels between the two periods: from differing scientific opinions to the racism certain communities faced. From 1630, the reader travels well into the future in Love for Dummies (Venita Coelho and Pia Alize Hazarika). The Earth has finally rid itself of humans, and the machines we have created are in charge of cleaning and maintaining our cities on loop. “Because I was writing for a comic for the first time and was very excited by the idea of images equally important to words, I decided to throw in an homage to artists I loved,” says writer Venita Coelho, who hopes that Comixense will show young readers there is more to life than Amar Chitra Katha . “I am a great fan of ACK , but I do think that comics have come of age and so should our readers!”  Science meets age-old wisdom  While The Irritability of Plants (Sarat T Rao and Pakhi) looks at the life of scientist and polymath JC Bose and his groundbreaking work in the field of plant neurobiology, The Razor and the Scalpel (Sheela Jaywant and Hasine Casukhela) pauses on an unsung hero of the medical field and the implement he wields. “Even though they’re rooted in science, these aren’t topics and themes that our education system deals with,” says CG Salamander, whose story Roots in issue 2, looks at the Pazhaverkadu, or mangrove forests of Chennai’s Pulicat Lake. Young Rahman plants saplings in the water with his grandfather, in an attempt to protect the coast from the Thimingala, a folkloric monster that ‘swerves and swells, slithers and sides, swallowing shores’ and is a manifestation of the sea itself. Lokesh Khodke’s illustrations spillover between the pages and panels, mimicking the water and it’s will to move where it pleases. “This is not just a personal story about the environment, but talks of a wider social movement and the struggles people are fighting,” he says, adding, “Children often grow up with a skewed perception of certain communities. Stories like Roots and The Adivasi Will Not Dance (Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, Priyanka Purty and Neha Alice Kerketta) widen their perspective.”  Expanding the mind  Sen hopes the magazine will be an antidote to the social media content that is created, consumed and forgotten with ease. Something that invites young people to read, pause, linger and revisit these stories, perhaps discovering something new each time they do. “We concern ourselves with making the story and art excellent, and having a theme that’s broad enough to accommodate a variety of perspectives. I think if a reader doesn’t understand something, but likes the story they’ll make an effort to find out more. That’s how you learn — when you’re curious,” he says. Who ensures the content is age appropriate? “Two [out of three] of us in the editorial team have several years of experience with creating stories for young readers and we rely on that when making decisions on the content. Overall, we explore themes and topics that we feel are relevant to young, curious readers.”  Future issues will examine themes such as spies and surveillance and a sense of duty. It’s hard to imagine anyone trying to dismiss Comixense as childish or silly or a waste of time. If they do, they clearly have some growing up of their own to do.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||A-game to Puma||In 2016, India was playing West Indies in a two-T20I series in Florida, a rather unusual venue for a cricket match. In the US, the game remains exotic (except among the increasing number of Indian expats, of course). So the short form of the game was supposed to be a promotional effort. For someone watching cricket for the first time, KL Rahul would’ve stood out that day for two reasons. One: he made the most number of runs that game (116 off just 51 balls) even as his team lost by a run. Two: his hairstyle. Rahul looked more like a West Indian player with his cornrow braids. The team’s coach, Anil Kumble, was mildly shocked.  The Beckham inspiration   “My mantra has always been: ‘Try things. If something doesn’t come off, I don’t mind it’,” says Rahul, 29, of his fashion choices, ahead of the launch of Puma’s 1DER, an athleisure range he’s designed with the sporting brand, which released on September 30. This mantra applies to his life, too. In school, Rahul , the son of two professors, used to turn up in flip-flops and coloured hair. He admits to being a rebellious teenager, but this was not just to provoke people. An ardent David Beckham fan, he had an idea of how he wanted to look even then. “I was more interested in his lifestyle, and less about the football,” adds the cricketer, who now follows personalities like Justin Bieber and Travis Scott. “They are artists who also dipped their hands into fashion. That interested me and I thought I could do this too.” And, he did. Two years ago, Rahul launched his street-wear label, Gully, with retail partner Zeko Online. 1DER, too, is an avenue to express his fashion ideas and the range (recently released on Flipkart) includes low-boot sneakers (crafted in leather, with mesh upper) in bright hues of orange and blue, caps, and  an apparel line comprising hoodies, pants, and the like.  “It was great to work with the Puma team [he’s been associated with the brand since 2018]. I would discuss designs and colours, especially for the sneakers, as I am a massive sneakerhead,” he says.  Expressions in ink   Aftercricket, fashion is his second love. “These days, with social media, you can see what guys around the world are wearing. And, I think, ‘Oh, that’s pretty cool. But I could do something cooler by pairing it with something else’,” he says, adding that his philosophy, in fashion and life, is simple: if it makes you feel good, don’t hold yourself back from doing it. “As long as I am not disturbing anybody or harming anyone, I can do whatever makes me feel good.” His mother, for instance, was shocked when he got his first tattoo (wings on his back) at 16. She even gave him a bar of soap to wash it off, and was upset when he told her it’s permanent. Rahul, who went on to tattoo his mother’s name, Rajeshwari, on his right wrist, says, “Every tattoo has a unique story. They serve as reminders.” This is especially true for the one on his right forearm — it reads, ‘ deshi basara ’ — an inspiring chant from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises . According to the film’s composer Hans Zimmer, ‘ deshi basara ’ roughly translates to ‘rise’. Rahul, after a horrific Test debut in Melbourne, bounced back within a week in Sydney with a fine century. This year, too, he was among India’s key performers in their Test wins in England. This, after being dropped from the Test side for a while. His journey has seen many falls and rises. “I would not have wanted it any other way,” concludes Rahul.  Priced between Rs. 1,499 and Rs. 4,999, 1DER by PUMA is available on Flipkart, puma.com, and select Puma stores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/a-game-to-puma/article37015035.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||More than wives and wombs||Marriage is in the air. Last week, a friend shared a most edifying Twitter conversation. It started with a lady from Chennai complaining that her family’s 35-year-old well-heeled and “suave” priest was still unmarried. She scolded “uppity, Brahmin girls” for not marrying him even though he earns tons of money and has his own house and car. To this, one distressed male replied, “Most Brahmin girls are only attracted to money”. Irony did not even whimper as it died quietly. Another man got business-like: “We have to import from Uttar Pradesh where there are enough poor Brahmin girls,” he suggested. A third guy roared, “Educated Girls of Brahmin Community Must Come Forward to Marry VEDHIC COMMUNITY.” At this point, one gentleman expressed bafflement that a deserving priest couldn’t get a bride and suggested he look among othervarnasfor a woman “so long as she is ready to upgrade her thinking and lifestyle fit for the saubhagyavati of apurohit.” When someone suggested that the man could stay unmarried, he was told that this might mean a “next generationpurohitshortage for us.” Meanwhile, the aforementioned unfeeling and uppity girls remained firmly absent from the discussion, expressing no willingness whatsoever to purify their thoughts on the flame of a nearby holy fire and lie down on the altar of marriage. At this stage of impasse, a new lament was introduced. An engineer-banker said he knew a boy working in a Tata factory in a small town who could not get a bride because most women did not want to move to a Tier 3 city. This was greeted with more chest-beating about how modern women had become ungrateful, greedy, and picky. This was roughly when I realised my BP was rising gently. So, I decided to head off and vacuum my car. (Note: Any vigorous cleaning activity makes you feel like you have scoured the filth off your Twitter feed.) But I was stopped short again. Clearly, it was not to be my happy BP day. This time, someone shared the speech that Karnataka Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar had given for World Mental Health Day at Bengaluru’s NIMHANS. Lo and behold, the minister too was lamenting that women were turning down the fantastic opportunity that marriage offers. “I am sorry to say,” he said ominously, “lots of modern women in India want to stay single.” Anyone will stay single when the option is to marry a giant blimp bloated with chauvinism, misogyny, entitlement and opinions, but who will tell the minister that? In fact, if the good minister had done his homework, he would have stumbled upon the latest National Crime Records Bureau statistics, which finds housewives accounting for the highest number of female suicides in India, at 51.5%. Besides, divorce rates are rising. Clearly, not all is sunshine and light in the hallowed corridors of marriage. But the minister had a further grievance. “Even if they get married,” he continued, “they don’t want to give birth. They want surrogacy.” Gosh, the horror. Imagine not yearning to throw away nine months of your life or career on pregnancy. The audacity with which men decide what women should or should not do with their lives is breathtaking. As is the notion that women are hard-wired for marriage and motherhood, and that not wanting either somehow diminishes them or makes them responsible for ‘stress’ in society. Women’s actions don’t cause stress in society, it’s society that makes life a living hell for women, so let’s clean those Augean stables first. The minister called all this “a paradigm shift in our thinking, which is not good,” but didn’t specify who exactly it isn’t good for. For women, the shift is excellent — for their physical, mental, and financial health. As for Indian men, they need to grow up, grow smart and grow a pair before whining on and on about why women don’t want to marry them. This ‘paradigm shift’ might cause them some mental agony but whoever said adulthood was easy. That Twitter thread I began with rippled with this same astonishment — that women aren’t jumping up to marry any darned bachelor who owns a house and a car. Sorry lads, dream on. Women don’t need to wash your clothes and bear your brats to get a car. They buy their own.

It makes her the right person to talk about this reset from a virtual to a physical showing. The recently turned entrepreneur with Wilderbee Talent Camp (who admits she detests the term ‘veteran’), says she enjoyed every bit of the chaos this season. The digital shows of previous seasons, while micromanaged to perfection “were strenuous as the shoots began in the morning, with no audience” to keep the energy going. “With these offline events, it is those 10 minutes when we perform that really make the show. For a model like me, that is the highlight of my day, the joy of walking the ramp, with the lights, the audience and the media photographers,” she explains. With the management following Covid protocol to the last letter, and with RT PCR tests every single morning, the models easily managed the three days of quarantine and eight days of the show. As for the new expansive venue, Jio Convention Centre, Rana says it reminded her of international ramps. “I enjoyed the backstage madness [that was missed over the last 18 months]. The first show was Tarun Tahiliani’s and so many things went wrong. I tripped a little bit, the zip in my corset split and was stitched backstage, we were working with less time, and people were screaming… and I was loving it. There was so much of laughter!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/10-minutes-of-joy/article37015057.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||New goals for Indian NFTs||Known as the ‘NFT-Punk’, Raghava KK is riding the non-fungible token wave. At Boundless Space, the group charity auction by Sotheby’s and Burning Man, he made a $94,500 splash as his NFT, La Petite Mort (part of The Orgasm Project ) went under the digital hammer, after a starting bid of just $100! The ‘phygital’ piece (with a digital as well as a physical artwork, both of which belongs to the bidder) was created in collaboration with data scientist Harshit Agrawal, neuroscientist Abhijeet Satani and material scientist Ben Tritt — to explore how humans contend with love, loss, boundaries, introspection and the like. The online auction featured over 150 artists and Raghava’s was among the top five bids. (The highest bid was $1,08,000 for photographer Peter Ruprecht’s work.) When I first met Raghava in Mumbai, at the Ashish Balram Nagpal Gallery at Radio Club way back in 2003-’04, he told me that he ‘loves painting with his hands and sometimes his feet’. I remember being sceptical. Yes, he was witty and clever, an upwardly mobile toon-gen artist, but was he someone to look out for, who would set new trends? This was right after he had made a big splash as a droll newspaper cartoonist known for his bold line and an eye for ‘telling it like it is’. When he established himself in the US in 2012, he was collected by the likes of Paul Simon, Jeff Bezos and Shah Rukh Khan. Now, as he cracks the Indian presence in the world of NFTs with a mammoth sale, the art world is sitting up and taking notice of the boy from Bengaluru who has made it big in New York, once again.  Down, but never out  “I want the world to have a bit of disruptive India in their collections. This disruptive technology has the potential to create utopias and dystopias — as with any technology,” says Raghava, adding, “Exclusivity is rare in a capitalistic economy, but crypto investors, typically libertarian, look to break out of this. It’s an anti-political statement to re-establish the real-world art system.” Working with curatorial advisor Myna Mukherjee, who advised Sotheby’s on the project — and who is also featuring his work at Artissima, with co-curator Davide Quadrio, in Turin, Italy, next month — Raghava, 41, can finally say he is a ‘trendsetter’. This, given that he had an uphill task shushing naysayers with his grit and dedication to his work, especially since he does not come from a ‘typical art background’. Many took umbrage with his blurring of high art and popular art. His oeuvre spans painting, sculpture, installation, film and iPad art, always linked by his challenging opinions on identity, conformity, gender. Raghava even viewed his lavish wedding — in 2007 to actor-musician Netra — as a piece of performance art. Here is an artist who once said, “Be a dude before you can become an ascetic, be a rock star even if it is in your own house!” However, it was not just in his own house that Raghava was practising his larger-than-life style. A decade ago, he was known for his 9/11 caricature of Osama Bin Laden that raked up enough of its share of controversy. “After the 9/11 incident, I swore I would never do cartoons but, of course, I could not stick to my promise — to stay away from being creative. I cherish change the most; it gives me the opportunity to reinvent myself,” he says. So, when he got divorced a few years ago, he “went on a new journey of reinventing myself and exploring new experiences. The minute I feel comfortable, I begin to itch, and I try to throw myself into the midst of anarchy”, he quips, adding, “The only times you learn is when you feel vulnerable, because you're forced to do something different. You develop new skills when you're down.”  Constantly challenging himself  Raghava has collaborated with American singer Erykah Badu to design T-shirts for her charity, Blind, curated India’s first AI art show in 2018, created artwork for musician Paul Simon’s concert tour, even participated in an education initiative at NuVu Studios, an offshoot of Harvard and MIT, where he helped develop a new form of participatory art (enabling paintings to become touch screens within picture frames). Art has helped him be relevant. “I’m always rethinking my idea of what the role of art in the world is.” He acknowledges that technology, because of the “endless possibilities it offers”, is important to his work — especially since it can bring artists, technologists and scientists from around the globe together, to create. “It is essential for artists to think like scientists and be rigorous in their perception and thought process. At the same time, scientists need to be more creative in how they look at the world. I think it is very important to bring these worlds together for a better tomorrow.” However, not everyone is as keen about jumping into tech pixel. After the big splash made by Beeple’s NFT Everydays: the First 5000 Days , which sold for $69 million at the beginning of March this year, the raised eyebrows persist, as does the chitter-chatter in art circuits about whether this is a bubble that will burst soon. But with Raghava’s collaborative work setting a new record for NFTs by Indian artists, it looks like the bubble is far from bursting. He is excited to première a work from his new body of work, Edges , at Artissima in Italy next month. He is also featuring Strange Genders — created using AI — a collaborative piece with Harshit Agrawal and 64/1, that talks about the gender spectrum. “[64/1] is an art collective started by my brother Karthik and me that focusses on blurring art, art criticism and art education. The work is going to be featured at Classical Radical, a museum show associated with Artissima. I’m also looking forward to more shows with Le Petit Mort series. [There will be] a major exhibition and projects that I’ll be bringing over in collaboration with [Myna Mukherjee’s] Engendered early next year,” he concludes.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Why the queue?||Of late, cars have been snaking across our TV screens, stalled bumper to bumper at petrol pumps, producing inappropriately hearty ROFLMAO among us, that the UK should be queuing up, for a change. To us, who have grown older, wiser, fatter, sleepier — on calls which keep telling us to ‘Please wait, you are in a queue,’ this is less newsworthy than star shenanigans. We have spent at least a good percentage of our lives in queues, at banks, ticket counters, billing desks or lugging pillows to the all-night stake-out outside a school that would open its kindergarten admission window the next morning. And now, finally, the world has caught up! It’s time for us to teach everyone else some Qetiquette. Do not argue with chappals .  Chappals have rights, same as you or I. Someone who needs to attend the call of nature may legitimately leave his chappals , with full power of attorney, to replace him in the queue. Do not body-shame.  Someone’spaunch may prod your back, someone’s oily, unruly hair may fly into your mouth, someone’s onion-breath may shoot at your neck. Adjust- maadi to the overflowingness of their bodies. Squash along politely. If God meant you to social-distance, He would have made you a lamppost. Take the week off.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Are we hugging yet?||The word ‘phygital’ was filed for copyright in 2013 by Momentum, an Australian ad agency, but 2020 saw it mentioned everywhere. That the fashion world would adapt to it has been a revelation. Most recently, we had FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week — the first post-pandemic phygital show in India — with 10 on-ground physical shows, and digital previews. For those of us who find inspiration, freedom and livelihoods in the fashion scene, this was good news.  A big new world  Jio Convention Centre was the venue. The space looked larger as the crowd was miniscule. The usual drinks lounges and media centres were missing, and with its high ceilings and tech-driven security, it was the safest I’d felt in a public place in a while. There was a strict mask, RT-PCR, and vaccination protocol, and show director Neeraj Gaba said, “We were tested every day for 12 days, quarantined alone before the physical shows, and maintained security bubbles.” The audience sat six feet apart, on individual chairs, in circles. But I missed the buzz of stylists, photographers, editors and celebs hanging around shows and stalls.  Hello from the other side  Many of us were seeing our peers for the first time since the start of the pandemic. There was hilarious confusion before greeting anyone — ‘Are we hugging yet?’ — and air kisses are a fashion joke. As I walked out of a show, Mitali Rannorey, a model I’ve styled several times, texted me: “So glad to see you in the audience today! I can’t come closer because we are in a bubble!” When I asked her how the 2021 experience was, she replied, “Walking on the ramp feels the same, but I miss the people.”  The Reunion  While not officially on the FDCI x LFW roster, Vaishali S’ bridal line, Shakuntala, was the first physical show I attended in 18 months, a day before fashion week officially began. At the Taj Mahal Palace hotel ballroom, it was her first outing in India after her Paris Couture Week debut in July. Her commitment to indigenous weaves was commendable, but for some looks it did not translate well. In stark contrast, veteran couturier Tarun Tahiliani opened the calendar with a mind-boggling 78-ensemble show. “Community is of paramount importance; it became essential that we support, help, and guide each other,” said Tahiliani, as he put a celebration of Indian karigari on full display.  Show and tell  “There is no virtual medium that can replace the human experience,” Nishant Gadhok of Gently Altered — a company that elevates event experience via sound and light design — told me as he closed the finale. But he acknowledged that the time away has helped him realign his visual language. And that is something we need. Internationally, fashion weeks that returned to physical shows this season have shown a lot of creativity. For instance, earlier this month, Balenciaga’s SS 2022 show in Paris took an innovative turn. Creative director Demna Gvasalia had guests and models walk the red carpet, and then watch a new Simpsons episode — where the characters walked as models. An immersive experience where the audience became a part of the show. Yes, making fashion weeks go live once again in India is step one, but fashioning them to be more creative will help bring fun in step two.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/are-we-hugging-yet/article37015108.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Not just a game||Who would have thought a dystopian story of 465 debt-ridden contestants willing to put their lives at stake for 45.6 billion won (approximately $38.6 million), playing a deadly version of a children’s game, would have taken off as it did? Ever since Squid Game ’s premiere on September 17, the nine-episode Korean series directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk has been the most watched and talked about show across the globe — it amassed 111 billion views since its release making it Netflix’s biggest series ever. “The aesthetic is brilliant and unlike anything on TV right now,” says film critic Raja Sen, explaining that whileSquid Gamedraws us in with drama on a very universal level and makes us care about the characters, it then entices viewers the way a reality show would: with rule-changes, advancing levels, and elimination threats. “Audiences living through a pandemic might be relating more easily to characters whose survival is threatened. We have all lost friends and family over the last year, and that, clubbed with anxiety and uncertainty on various levels, does make us feel trapped like the characters in the show. Cheering for the protagonist, therefore, feels satisfyingly cathartic,” he adds.  Rise of thrillers   Amidthe slow-burn romances and fun comedies, K-dramas are tackling subjects that highlight the ills plaguing their society. And the interest in such horror-thrillers has been picking up recently. Like Squid Game , the super hit 2019 zombie series, Kingdom — directed by Kim Seong-hun, and set in the 16th century — is ironically predictive of the future. Though it follows the story of a kingdom afflicted by a mysterious plague that turns people into zombies, Bae Doona, one of the stars of the show, admits that the period drama (all set for Season 3) is also a telling tale of the current times we live in. On similar lines is Hell is Other People , a 2019 psychological thriller that critiques how expectations and power structures make life hell for the helpless; 2020 horror-fantasy Sweet Home , where humans turn into monsters based on their long-hidden desires; and last year’s critically-acclaimed Extracurricular , which tells the dark story of a student who takes to a life of crime to pay his college fees.  Resonating now   Interestingly,director Dong-hyuk admits that Squid Game was rejected by studios 10 years ago, when he first wrote the pilot (inspired by his own debt-ridden state). “At the time, it seemed unfamiliar, too violent, complicated and not commercially viable,” he said, during the show’s promotions. Today, however, it’s these very traits, “reflective of the times we live in”, that is finding its fans. Filmmaker Vijayeta Kumar, who watched the show twice, says that the horror and gore in it “isn’t just the deaths, but what capitalism and greed do to you”. “The horror of poverty, being debt-ridden to the extent you have to sign away your own body, and not being able to fit into a class-conscious society, is, for me, the real scary part,” he says.  Squid Game has struck a raw nerve as South Korea grapples with increasing household debt, income inequality and lack of employment. It has found resonance across the globe because many have been facing severe financial crisis over the last few decades. And now the pandemic has seen many lose their jobs, businesses and source of income. For people grappling with mental stress and anxiety, the extreme representation of it on screen seems to have triggered varied reactions. Dr Kamna Chibber, Head of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare has had several clients discuss the show’s premise with her. “People identify with parts they feel are reflective of the reality of the world they occupy, that are easy for them to make sense of,” she says. “However, it is also important to recognise that there are people who do not identify with the media they consume and are not attracted to the same. Aggression and violence across platforms needs to be represented in ways that it prevents over-identification, and the de-sensitisation that can occur as a result of continued exposure to it.”      “While the slice-of-life and romance drama subjects rarely come with a variety, the horror-thriller genre is on the rise for a reason. Korean writers mirror isolated harsh realities to give a face to these horrors because their [South Korea’s] society functions in a certain way” Samir Makwana, tech writer and editor, who closely follows K-dramas||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/not-just-a-game/article37015130.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Everything makes||If you’re a child of the 80s and 90s, growing up in India, chances are you spent your younger years on a diet of Tinkle , Champak , Amar Chitra Katha , and Chandamama . The stories tended to be slapstick or heavy on morals and mythology. “Shouldn’t you be reading something more serious?” was a question I often found myself fielding. That’s not a question one would ask a young person reading Comixense though. The new, quarterly comic magazine published by Ektara Trust aims to feed the ‘intelligence, imagination and empathy’ of readers between the ages of 12 and 17 with nuanced stories that touch upon science, technology, the environment and social justice.   The first of its kind in India (for this age group), the magazine is the brainchild of acclaimed Goa-based artist and designer Orijit Sen. “From being a reader, collector and maker of comics from a young age, they taught me so many things that textbooks just couldn’t,” he says. “They provoked my imagination and the stories stimulated so much in me as a reader. Comics allow you to go back and forth in a way no other narrative medium does. The reader can break time and space in their own way to construct and deconstruct the narrative.”  Calling all comic artists  Launching a print magazine at a time when publications are downing their shutters or going digital-only might raise eyebrows. Sen argues that the pandemic has forced young people to shift almost every aspect of their lives online: from school to socialising to extracurricular activities. “We wanted to give them a reprieve from this digital life.” At a larger level, Sen believes that while countries like Japan and France have long-standing cultures of m anga and b andes dessinées , the comics scene in India needs to have more artists and writers who know and understand the medium. He sees Comixense as a possible breeding ground for this. In fact, many of the contributors to the first three issues have never worked in this format before, and answered open calls for entries, or were given a one-line brief.  Rooted in lives realities  I was out when the first two issues arrived at home. I returned to find a torn and crumpled envelope lying on the table, and two children furtively reading an issue each under their desks while online school was in session. When I finally got hold of the magazines, I could see why they’d been so enthralled. The richly-illustrated stories leap boldly across time and place and are rooted in lived realities and experiences, linking our past to the present and the future, giving the reader a deeply-immersive reading experience.  The Plague Doctor’s Apprentice (Indrajit Hazra and Paue), starts in Florence, 2020, as riots break out against government-imposed Covid-19 lockdowns. The story then steps back in time to 1630, when Florence is in the grip of the Bubonic Plague. Hazra draws parallels between the two periods: from differing scientific opinions to the racism certain communities faced. From 1630, the reader travels well into the future in Love for Dummies (Venita Coelho and Pia Alize Hazarika). The Earth has finally rid itself of humans, and the machines we have created are in charge of cleaning and maintaining our cities on loop. In this landscape, two crash test dummies take a stroll through an immersive art museum, studying works of art by Klimt, Picasso and Koons and musing about love. “Because I was writing for a comic for the first time and was very excited by the idea of images equally important to words, I decided to throw in an homage to artists I loved. After all, what was it that robots were unlikely to understand? Art and love,” says writer Venita Coelho, who hopes that Comixense will show young readers there is more to life than Amar Chitra Katha . “I am a great fan of ACK , but I do think that comics have come of age and so should our readers!”  Science meets age-old wisdom  While The Irritability of Plants (Sarat T Rao and Pakhi) looks at the life of scientist and polymath JC Bose and his groundbreaking work in the field of plant neurobiology, The Razor and the Scalpel (Sheela Jaywant and Hasine Casukhela) pauses on an unsung hero of the medical field and the implement he wields. “Even though they’re rooted in science, these aren’t topics and themes that our education system deals with,” says CG Salamander, whose story Roots in issue 2, looks at the Pazhaverkadu, or mangrove forests of Chennai’s Pulicat Lake. Young Rahman plants saplings in the water with his grandfather, in an attempt to protect the coast from the Thimingala, a folkloric monster that ‘swerves and swells, slithers and sides, swallowing shores’ and is a manifestation of the sea itself. Lokesh Khodke’s illustrations spillover between the pages and panels, mimicking the water and it’s will to move where it pleases. “This is not just a personal story about the environment, but talks of a wider social movement and the struggles people are fighting,” he says, adding, “Children often grow up with a skewed perception of certain communities. Stories like Roots and The Adivasi Will Not Dance (Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, Priyanka Purty and Neha Alice Kerketta) widen their perspective.”  Expanding the mind  Social justice and politics are the very foundation of Sen’s own personal work. “Our school syllabus doesn’t address social justice, and whatever you grow up to do, a sense of empathy and social justice must be a default setting.” Sen hopes the magazine will be an antidote to the social media content that is created, consumed and forgotten with ease. Something that invites young people to read, pause, linger and revisit these stories, perhaps discovering something new each time they do. “We concern ourselves with making the story and art excellent, and having a theme that’s broad enough to accommodate a variety of perspectives. I think if a reader doesn’t understand something, but likes the story they’ll make an effort to find out more. That’s how you learn — when you’re curious,” he says. Who ensures the content is age appropriate? “Two [out of three] of us in the editorial team have several years of experience with creating stories for young readers and we rely on that when making decisions on the content. Overall, we explore themes and topics that we feel are relevant to young, curious readers.” And the response to the magazine has been positive and encouraging so far. “We’re constantly surprised to hear which stories readers respond to. A friend’s 11-year-old enjoyed The Plague Doctor’s Apprentice , even though some may say the content is too mature for a child that age.” Future issues will examine themes such as spies and surveillance and a sense of duty. It’s hard to imagine anyone trying to dismiss Comixense as childish or silly or a waste of time. If they do, they clearly have some growing up of their own to do.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||A-game to Puma||In 2016, India was playing West Indies in a two-T20I series in Florida, a rather unusual venue for a cricket match. In the US, the game remains exotic (except among the increasing number of Indian expats, of course). So the short form of the game was supposed to be a promotional effort. For someone watching cricket for the first time, KL Rahul would’ve stood out that day for two reasons. One: he made the most number of runs that game (116 off just 51 balls) even as his team lost by a run. Two: his hairstyle. Rahul looked more like a West Indian player with his cornrow braids. The team’s coach, Anil Kumble, was mildly shocked.  The Beckham inspiration   “My mantra has always been: ‘Try things. If something doesn’t come off, I don’t mind it’,” says Rahul, 29, of his fashion choices, ahead of the launch of Puma’s 1DER, an athleisure range he’s designed with the sporting brand, which released on September 30. This mantra applies to his life, too. In school, Rahul , the son of two professors, used to turn up in flip-flops and coloured hair. He admits to being a rebellious teenager, but this was not just to provoke people. An ardent David Beckham fan, he had an idea of how he wanted to look even then. “I was more interested in his lifestyle, and less about the football,” adds the cricketer, who now follows personalities like Justin Bieber and Travis Scott. “They are artists who also dipped their hands into fashion. That interested me and I thought I could do this too.” And, he did. Two years ago, Rahul launched his street-wear label, Gully, with retail partner Zeko Online. 1DER, too, is an avenue to express his fashion ideas and the range (recently released on Flipkart) includes low-boot sneakers (crafted in leather, with mesh upper) in bright hues of orange and blue, caps, and  an apparel line comprising hoodies, pants, and the like.  “It was great to work with the Puma team [he’s been associated with the brand since 2018]. I would discuss designs and colours, especially for the sneakers, as I am a massive sneakerhead,” he says.  Expressions in ink   Aftercricket, fashion is his second love. “These days, with social media, you can see what guys around the world are wearing. And, I think, ‘Oh, that’s pretty cool. But I could do something cooler by pairing it with something else’,” he says, adding that his philosophy, in fashion and life, is simple: if it makes you feel good, don’t hold yourself back from doing it. “As long as I am not disturbing anybody or harming anyone, I can do whatever makes me feel good.” His mother, for instance, was shocked when he got his first tattoo (wings on his back) at 16. She even gave him a bar of soap to wash it off, and was upset when he told her it’s permanent. Rahul, who went on to tattoo his mother’s name, Rajeshwari, on his right wrist, says, “Every tattoo has a unique story. They serve as reminders.” This is especially true for the one on his right forearm — it reads, ‘ deshi basara ’ — an inspiring chant from Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises . According to the film’s composer Hans Zimmer, ‘ deshi basara ’ roughly translates to ‘rise’. Rahul, after a horrific Test debut in Melbourne, bounced back within a week in Sydney with a fine century. This year, too, he was among India’s key performers in their Test wins in England. This, after being dropped from the Test side for a while. His journey has seen many falls and rises. “I would not have wanted it any other way,” concludes Rahul.  Priced between Rs. 1,499 and Rs. 4,999, 1DER by PUMA is available on Flipkart, puma.com, and select Puma stores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/a-game-to-puma/article37015086.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||More than wives and wombs||Marriage is in the air. Last week, a friend shared a most edifying Twitter conversation. It started with a lady from Chennai complaining that her family’s 35-year-old well-heeled and “suave” priest was still unmarried. She scolded “uppity, Brahmin girls” for not marrying him even though he earns tons of money and has his own house and car. To this, one distressed male replied, “Most Brahmin girls are only attracted to money”. Irony did not even whimper as it died quietly. Another man got business-like: “We have to import from Uttar Pradesh where there are enough poor Brahmin girls,” he suggested. A third guy roared, “Educated Girls of Brahmin Community Must Come Forward to Marry VEDHIC COMMUNITY.” At this point, one gentleman expressed bafflement that a deserving priest couldn’t get a bride and suggested he look among othervarnasfor a woman “so long as she is ready to upgrade her thinking and lifestyle fit for the saubhagyavati of apurohit.” When someone suggested that the man could stay unmarried, he was told that this might mean a “next generationpurohitshortage for us.” Meanwhile, the aforementioned unfeeling and uppity girls remained firmly absent from the discussion, expressing no willingness whatsoever to purify their thoughts on the flame of a nearby holy fire and lie down on the altar of marriage. At this stage of impasse, a new lament was introduced. An engineer-banker said he knew a boy working in a Tata factory in a small town who could not get a bride because most women did not want to move to a Tier 3 city. This was greeted with more chest-beating about how modern women had become ungrateful, greedy, and picky. This was roughly when I realised my BP was rising gently. So, I decided to head off and vacuum my car. (Note: Any vigorous cleaning activity makes you feel like you have scoured the filth off your Twitter feed.) But I was stopped short again. Clearly, it was not to be my happy BP day. This time, someone shared the speech that Karnataka Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar had given for World Mental Health Day at Bengaluru’s NIMHANS. Lo and behold, the minister too was lamenting that women were turning down the fantastic opportunity that marriage offers. “I am sorry to say,” he said ominously, “lots of modern women in India want to stay single.” Anyone will stay single when the option is to marry a giant blimp bloated with chauvinism, misogyny, entitlement and opinions, but who will tell the minister that? In fact, if the good minister had done his homework, he would have stumbled upon the latest National Crime Records Bureau statistics, which finds housewives accounting for the highest number of female suicides in India, at 51.5%. Besides, divorce rates are rising. Clearly, not all is sunshine and light in the hallowed corridors of marriage. But the minister had a further grievance. “Even if they get married,” he continued, “they don’t want to give birth. They want surrogacy.” Gosh, the horror. Imagine not yearning to throw away nine months of your life or career on pregnancy. The audacity with which men decide what women should or should not do with their lives is breathtaking. As is the notion that women are hard-wired for marriage and motherhood, and that not wanting either somehow diminishes them or makes them responsible for ‘stress’ in society. Women’s actions don’t cause stress in society, it’s society that makes life a living hell for women, so let’s clean those Augean stables first. The minister called all this “a paradigm shift in our thinking, which is not good,” but didn’t specify who exactly it isn’t good for. For women, the shift is excellent — for their physical, mental, and financial health. As for Indian men, they need to grow up, grow smart and grow a pair before whining on and on about why women don’t want to marry them. This ‘paradigm shift’ might cause them some mental agony but whoever said adulthood was easy. That Twitter thread I began with rippled with this same astonishment — that women aren’t jumping up to marry any darned bachelor who owns a house and a car. Sorry lads, dream on. Women don’t need to wash your clothes and bear your brats to get a car. They buy their own.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Manish Malhotra’s metaverse debut||A few months ago, when The Hindu Weekend delved into fashion NFTs, we came across several international experiments — from NFTs given away to selected attendees at Paris Fashion Week, to Brooklyn-based digital creator Ravi Guru Singh, who minted the first traditional Indian fashion NFT collection. But where were the Indian fashion designers? Why weren’t we seeing NFT bundles from a Tarun Tahiliani or Anamika Khanna? The recent FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week finally catapulted us into the metaverse. Manish Malhotra dropped India’s first fashion NFT on homegrown platform WazirX, and it sold out in seconds! The collection included sketches and GIFs of five couture pieces worn by models and actors such as Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, and Lisa Ray. ‘Illuminous Showstopper’, a custom-made constellation sketch for Kareena Kapoor Khan, got the highest bid — picked up by NFT creator-collector Mike Blue for 3,000 WRX (approximately Rs. 2.8 lakh). “[My first NFT collection] traced the journey of the brand; the moments that have been instrumental to taking the label to what it is now,” said Malhotra, on a FDCI x LFW panel discussion. The designer has always been open to experimentation: he was part of LFW’s first virtual reality experience, back in 2017, which went on to become the most-watched fashion video in India on Facebook at the time (it has over 4.2 million views). “I’m always intrigued by the new. There’s something so amazing about technology, and the reach is so wide. NFTs are a new world, and it helps make [your work] universal and immortal,” he said, adding, “There just might be NFT outfits in the future; you never know. That’s the fun part.” We are counting on it, especially with the recent news that Italian luxury fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana has set a new record by selling NFTs amounting to around $6 million. We’d like to break some records too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/manish-malhotras-metaverse-debut/article37015082.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Behind Niklas Elmehed’s gold portraits||Swedish artist Niklas Elmehed is an anonymous celebrity. He lives every artist’s dream — as soon as the portraits drawn by him are revealed, they are seen and shared by millions of people and media channels around the world. Yet, he’s not a household name. That might change, thanks to a tweet from the Nobel committee stating that Elmehed is the artist behind the distinctive gold-and-black portraits that accompany the annual proclamation of the Nobel Prize winners. How much time is he given, before the announcement, to draw the portraits? This question, now most frequently asked, is one that he’s not allowed to answer. “Unfortunately, I can’t tell you that, it’s confidential!” he says with easy good humour, on a Zoom call with The Hindu Weekend from the Nobel committee headquarters in Stockholm. With the Nobel Prizes, it’s not just timing that’s everything, it’s the confidentiality as well. But he can tell us how drawing the laureates is both a marathon and a sprint. “I’m pretty fast, so it’s a few hours for each portrait. There’s a lot of preparation before — it’s like a sports event: you have to train for weeks, even years, then go to the race, and finish in a very short time,” says Elmehed, 44, who has been doing these portraits since 2012.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Audible’s streaming shift||The Sandman audiobooks, based on the series by Neil Gaiman, are an excellent example of how a classic in one medium (in this case, comics) can receive a new lease of life, even an all-new audience, when it’s adapted into another medium. Narrated by Gaiman himself for Audible, alongside actors like James McAvoy and Riz Ahmed, the audio version (launched in September 2021) has received great reviews across the spectrum, with good reason. Now, the podcast and audiobook platform has announced that Indian audiences will soon get a Hindi version of The Sandman . This is just one among the slew of announcements made by Audible India this week. They’ve just released an all-you-can-listen Audible Plus catalogue with over 15,000 titles available to existing users for no additional costs. There’s also a ‘free tier’ with over 150 Audible-exclusive podcasts and Originals (audio stories) — including Kaali Aawazein narrated by Amitabh Bachchan — and over 40,000 popular podcasts from around the world.  Expanding to new audiences  During a virtual interaction with The Hindu Weekend , Shailesh Sawlani, VP and Country GM, Audible India, said, “I think there’s plenty of room to grow within the audience we already cater to. What we’re trying to do with the new Plus catalogue is to deliver more value to our subscribers, including those who’re prolific consumers of more established forms of media, like streaming.” He added that the category is growing at the speed of knots in India. “For Audible, India has been one of the fastest-growing markets in its history. Our most engaged listeners are tuned in for over two-and-a-half hours per day, and people are now listening to audio stories and podcasts while engaged in their daily lives, their jobs.”  Pandemic programming  According to industry studies, the last couple of years and the more recent pandemic-induced lockdowns have led to people spending more time with audio books — the average weekly consumption has risen from seven to 16 hours. Perhaps why the platform has now invested in different kinds of formats and stories: from thrillers and comedies to family dramas and ghost stories. Several upcoming ones now feature Bollywood actors — something we’ve seen on Spotify India, which recently released V irus 2062 , with Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal lending their voice. Sasural Wonder Phool , for example, is a Hindi-language romantic comedy starring Sanya Malhotra ( Shakuntala Devi ) and Varun Malhotra ( Fukrey ), set in a family that runs a sex clinic.  Betting on regional content  Soon, we might get to listen to these performers as they adapt your favourite international audio stories into Indian languages. “We’re always on the lookout for stories from around the world that we feel would do well irrespective of language. We have recently released Buri Nazar , which is an adaptation of a popular Audible title, Evil Eye ,” says Sawlani, who is quick to add, “There are a lot of things in motion that we can’t talk about today. And it’s actually an opportunity that works both ways; this is also a chance for Indian Originals to reach out to an international market.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/audibles-streaming-shift/article37015146.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||The temple she wore||Shilo Shiv Suleman is the founder-director of the Fearless Collective, where she helps over 400 artists protest against gender violence through their work. But last week, the outspoken Indian contemporary artist, 32, made news for her installation, Temple , showcased at the charity auction event, Boundless Space, by Sotheby’s and Burning Man Project. Presented at an estimate of $30,000-$50,000 and eventually sold for $56,700, Temple is a wearable installation and a ‘ritual performance’. Suleman says it reclaims not just her connection to her family's history but also sees the female body as a site of devotion, worthy of worship. With an Instagram following of about 54,000, the artist has been successful with various mediums of expression. At 16, she illustrated stories of her life in thick red hand-bound journals. “I found I could tell other stories too, which led to me illustrating books for children, with 10 published books by the time I was 18, and a TED talk with a million views when I was 21,” she says. Temple has its origins in a small temple in Kannur, Kerala. Suleman shares how her father’s Nambiar family had been custodians of this temple and had “tended to Sree Oorpazhachi Kavu, the temple of the Mother Goddess and her Ancient Grove of Herbs”. She talks about connecting with her estranged father in that temple back in December 2019, before she created this work during the pandemic’s second wave. Edited excerpts from an interview:  What emotions did you experience while creating and wearing this powerful piece of art,Temple?   This is indeed the season of the goddess. While in Indian culture, the goddess has been worshipped outside of ourselves, rarely have we, as Indian women, embodied the same kind of reverence and sacredness that is bestowed upon temples or idols inside temples. So for me, Temple was really a reclamation of the goddess inside of us and inside every woman. This particular piece is inspired by the dancers in Kerala who channel the mother goddess. But it's only men who are allowed to perform and channel these energies. In a lot of Indian traditions, there's a belief that women are not powerful enough to hold the divine feminine inside of themselves. So this piece is really challenging some of those notions, and especially during Navratri, as we are counting down every night and making these hawans for the goddess as a reminder that the goddess exist inside all of us.  Tell us about the process of creatingTempleand its journey.    It was made in Jaipur at my studio in Hawa Mahal. I worked with artisans from the Lohar community. My grandfather Haji Suleman is from the Lohar community and was a metal Worker, so it is a very interesting amalgamation of both sides of my family. The conceptualisation of the piece started during the second wave in India, which was, as we all know, pretty horrific. And in that deep and dark time, I found myself making this piece almost as a soft light and a remembrance of power. I moved to Rajasthan, where over a period of three months I worked on making the 40-kilo piece around my body. I wanted it to exist as something that could be worn on my body but could also be an altar, and a temple in its own way.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||10 minutes of joy||Long-time Indian model, Lakshmi Rana, was seen closing or ending shows at all the on-ground events at FDCI x LFW. It makes her the right person to talk about this reset from a virtual to a physical showing. The recently turned entrepreneur with Wilderbee Talent Camp (who admits she detests the term ‘veteran’), says she enjoyed every bit of the chaos this season. The digital shows of previous seasons, while micromanaged to perfection “were strenuous as the shoots began in the morning, with no audience” to keep the energy going. “With these offline events, it is those 10 minutes when we perform that really make the show. For a model like me, that is the highlight of my day, the joy of walking the ramp, with the lights, the audience and the media photographers,” she explains. With the management following Covid protocol to the last letter, and with RT PCR tests every single morning, the models easily managed the three days of quarantine and eight days of the show. As for the new expansive venue, Jio Convention Centre, Rana says it reminded her of international ramps. “I enjoyed the backstage madness [that was missed over the last 18 months]. The first show was Tarun Tahiliani’s and so many things went wrong. I tripped a little bit, the zip in my corset split and was stitched backstage, we were working with less time, and people were screaming… and I was loving it. There was so much of laughter!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/10-minutes-of-joy/article37015109.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Satya Paul and the new rules of retail||Opening new stores at a troubled time may seem counter-intuitive, but there is enough historic precedence to show that it is actually a smart thing for retail businesses to do. This is why I was not surprised to be invited to the opening of the newly-remodelled Satya Paul store at Delhi’s DLF Promenade mall in September. Far-sighted businesspeople know that property becomes more accessible when a calamity, let’s say a global pandemic, hits and smaller players are forced out. They also know that however long it lasts, there will be a time when human nature will become inured to its horrific reality, and shop. We will always shop to mark our personal and family milestones, and to feel alive. With this realisation, I look at the story of brand Satya Paul’s revival with great interest. And if we allow ourselves to, the Indian fashion industry can learn a lot from this iconic label’s new direction. “The first thing we did,” says Darshan Mehta, President and CEO of Reliance Brands (RBL), “was to shrink the label almost to half its market size”. This process began in April 2019 after Reliance Brands upped its investment in Genesis Colors, Satya Paul’s holding company. By June, designer Rajesh Pratap Singh had come on board as Creative Director. Before the hiring of one of India’s most talented designers, though, were the Dark Ages; a decade or so when Satya Paul’s brand name, made iconic by the founder’s groundbreaking saris since the mid-1980s, stood diluted with badly-regulated franchisees across the land and indiscriminately offered product categories. These ranged from logo-ed wallets and tie pins to cut pieces of cheap digital prints on Chinese satins, crepes, and georgettes. Corporate gifting catalogues touted ready boxes of tie-pocket square-cuff links combos sourced from our infamously productive neighbour nation, while the in-house design team tried feebly to break into the wedding market with digital-printed ‘couture’lehengasand gowns. It was a Pierre Cardin situation. And bringing hot young talent Masaba on board in 2012 didn’t help either, because she never truly had the run of the brand. Most Indian designers who have been around for a few years will resonate with these struggles. But today, with the industry as a whole having suffered first the exodus of its artisans during the CAA-NRC debacle and then facing the realities of a global pandemic for a year and a half, Satya Paul’s long struggles can become teachable moments.  The big clean-up   “Giventhe history of the brand, we had to do something drastic,” adds Mehta. “As part of the new strategy, we began cleaning up the market.” Consequently, the label closed all of its franchisees, and even bought back stock from the distributors who would sell to MBOs, no matter which collection or season it belonged to. “We needed to go back to the beating heart of the brand,” says Mehta. And this is where Rajesh Pratap Singh came in. In terms of design, Singh went back to the brand archives, pulling out old examples of the founder’s work with the weavers of Benaras and Telangana, as well as his floral prints and his experiments with colour and printmaking. “How would Mr Paul design ready-to-wear if he were here now? What can we do with the medium of digital printing without making it excessive and, therefore, meaningless?” are some of the questions that he asked, and answered through his first two collections for the label.  Making of a global Indian brand? Today,with its numerous franchisees closed and its owned stores going through makeovers, Satya Paul’s retail presence across India is beginning to look more like the tightly-managed brick-and-mortar strategies employed by luxury brands that concentrate on experiential touch points rather than chasing numbers. “I have become tired and a little defensive about a question that has been coming at me for the last 20 years: why isn’t there a luxury brand coming out of India? Now I feel it’s time we give a fitting answer, even if it takes two or five or 10 years,” says Mehta. To do this, he has a two-pronged approach. Giving Singh complete freedom to take the brand forward in a direction in keeping with the earliest values of the label — bold prints, colour, and luxury — while restraining the retail spaces. “The store at Promenade in Delhi is already open, and we’re opening a flagship at the new Jio World Drive Mall soon. Another store will open at Delhi’s Khan Market in late November…” he lists. “We’re looking at around 10 to 12 locations at the most.” For Singh, it’s a strategy that works, whether it’s for Satya Paul or in general. “We’ve been told for so long that physical retail is on its way out and everything is going online, but the truth is that when it comes to luxury fashion, people do want to come and interact with what they intend to buy,” he says. The key, apart from great service and storytelling by the sales staff, is to bring people into the brand universe. It is a straightforward strategy that will need time to prove itself, as does anything that the stakeholders are willing to commit to. Perhaps, amid the new wave of Indian brands being acquired by corporate bigwigs like Reliance Brands and the Aditya Birla Group, it can show India’s fashion designers the way forward when it comes to making their mark in retail. And before we chalk it up to the money such companies bring, we must remember that the designer labels being acquired today are the ones who remained steadfast to their creative visions. Even when they stumbled and fell, remember that they got up again and again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/satya-paul-and-the-new-rules-of-retail/article37015094.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||New goals for Indian NFTs||Known as the ‘NFT-Punk’, Raghava KK is riding the non-fungible token wave. At Boundless Space, the group charity auction by Sotheby’s and Burning Man, he made a $94,500 splash as his NFT, La Petite Mort (part of The Orgasm Project ) went under the digital hammer, after a starting bid of just $100! The ‘phygital’ piece (with a digital as well as a physical artwork, both of which belongs to the bidder) was created in collaboration with data scientist Harshit Agrawal, neuroscientist Abhijeet Satani and material scientist Ben Tritt — to explore how humans contend with love, loss, boundaries, introspection and the like. The online auction featured over 150 artists and Raghava’s was among the top five bids. (The highest bid was $1,08,000 for photographer Peter Ruprecht’s work.) When I first met Raghava in Mumbai, at the Ashish Balram Nagpal Gallery at Radio Club way back in 2003-’04, he told me that he ‘loves painting with his hands and sometimes his feet’. I remember being sceptical. Yes, he was witty and clever, an upwardly mobile toon-gen artist, but was he someone to look out for, who would set new trends? This was right after he had made a big splash as a droll newspaper cartoonist known for his bold line and an eye for ‘telling it like it is’. When he established himself in the US in 2012, he was collected by the likes of Paul Simon, Jeff Bezos and Shah Rukh Khan. Now, as he cracks the Indian presence in the world of NFTs with a mammoth sale, the art world is sitting up and taking notice of the boy from Bengaluru who has made it big in New York, once again.  Down, but never out  “I want the world to have a bit of disruptive India in their collections. This disruptive technology has the potential to create utopias and dystopias — as with any technology,” says Raghava, adding, “Exclusivity is rare in a capitalistic economy, but crypto investors, typically libertarian, look to break out of this. It’s an anti-political statement to re-establish the real-world art system.” Working with curatorial advisor Myna Mukherjee, who advised Sotheby’s on the project — and who is also featuring his work at Artissima, with co-curator Davide Quadrio, in Turin, Italy, next month — Raghava, 41, can finally say he is a ‘trendsetter’. This, given that he had an uphill task shushing naysayers with his grit and dedication to his work, especially since he does not come from a ‘typical art background’. Many took umbrage with his blurring of high art and popular art. His oeuvre spans painting, sculpture, installation, film and iPad art, always linked by his challenging opinions on identity, conformity, gender. Raghava even viewed his lavish wedding — in 2007 to actor-musician Netra — as a piece of performance art. Here is an artist who once said, “Be a dude before you can become an ascetic, be a rock star even if it is in your own house!” However, it was not just in his own house that Raghava was practising his larger-than-life style. A decade ago, he was known for his 9/11 caricature of Osama Bin Laden that raked up enough of its share of controversy. “After the 9/11 incident, I swore I would never do cartoons but, of course, I could not stick to my promise — to stay away from being creative. I cherish change the most; it gives me the opportunity to reinvent myself,” he says. So, when he got divorced a few years ago, he “went on a new journey of reinventing myself and exploring new experiences. The minute I feel comfortable, I begin to itch, and I try to throw myself into the midst of anarchy”, he quips, adding, “The only times you learn is when you feel vulnerable, because you're forced to do something different. You develop new skills when you're down.”  Constantly challenging himself  Raghava has collaborated with American singer Erykah Badu to design T-shirts for her charity, Blind, curated India’s first AI art show in 2018, created artwork for musician Paul Simon’s concert tour, even participated in an education initiative at NuVu Studios, an offshoot of Harvard and MIT, where he helped develop a new form of participatory art (enabling paintings to become touch screens within picture frames). Art has helped him be relevant. “I’m always rethinking my idea of what the role of art in the world is.” He acknowledges that technology, because of the “endless possibilities it offers”, is important to his work — especially since it can bring artists, technologists and scientists from around the globe together, to create. “It is essential for artists to think like scientists and be rigorous in their perception and thought process. At the same time, scientists need to be more creative in how they look at the world. I think it is very important to bring these worlds together for a better tomorrow.” However, not everyone is as keen about jumping into tech pixel. After the big splash made by Beeple’s NFT Everydays: the First 5000 Days , which sold for $69 million at the beginning of March this year, the raised eyebrows persist, as does the chitter-chatter in art circuits about whether this is a bubble that will burst soon. But with Raghava’s collaborative work setting a new record for NFTs by Indian artists, it looks like the bubble is far from bursting. He is excited to première a work from his new body of work, Edges , at Artissima in Italy next month. He is also featuring Strange Genders — created using AI — a collaborative piece with Harshit Agrawal and 64/1, that talks about the gender spectrum. “[64/1] is an art collective started by my brother Karthik and me that focusses on blurring art, art criticism and art education. The work is going to be featured at Classical Radical, a museum show associated with Artissima. I’m also looking forward to more shows with Le Petit Mort series. [There will be] a major exhibition and projects that I’ll be bringing over in collaboration with [Myna Mukherjee’s] Engendered early next year,” he concludes.

The builder handed over more than 1,000 units to owners between 2012 and 2016, and almost all the flats are occupied. However, he has not handed over the common services, but has formed an Association. Recently, a notice (Form VI , under Society Act) was displayed and it contained the names of the members. I approached the Association’s secretary and mentioned that I was not a member, I had not signed any membership forms, and paid a subscription. He stated that as per the byelaws of the Association, duly certified by the appropriate authority, every owner becomes a member of the Association by default. He also mentioned that there is provision in the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. Is this accurate? A Baskaran Chennai When you buy a flat or an apartment, you have an independent ownership of the specific unit owned by you and joint ownership in common areas. There are several obligations and duties that the joint owners should be aware of and comply with in terms of maintenance and common areas and amenities. It is possible that some of the facilities provided to the apartment owners are retained and managed by the builder on a chargeable basis. These aspects would be covered in the construction agreement entered into with the builder. Further, the Tamil Nadu Apartment Ownership Act (which is partially in force) stipulates that the apartment owners shall form a association for the purpose of maintaining all common areas, facilities and amenities and that the administration of every property shall be governed by the bye-laws of the association. Under the provision of RERA, the builder is responsible to enable the formation of an association within three months of the majority of allottees having booked their flats in the project. Considering the above, every flat owner should become a member of the association and adhere to the bye-laws. If any act or decision of the governing committee of the association affects your interest, you can raise the same in the general body meetings and seek redressal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/membership-for-an-association/article37015190.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Demystifying India’s asset management plans||The government has set up a target to make India a $5 trillion economy. To achieve this goal, it is targeting to unlock optimal value from public sector assets which have not yielded potential return or which are sub-optimally utilised, by the way of ‘asset monetisation’. It has set an aggressive target of raising around Rs. 6 lakh crore under the National Monetization Pipeline (NMP). The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) envisages infrastructure investment of Rs. 111 lakh crore over a five-year period between FY 2020 and FY 2025. With an annual average investment of Rs. 22 lakh crore, this is a significant step-up (~2.5 times) vis-à-vis historical levels of spending on infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure is directly proportional to the growth in GDP/ economy of a country. It will also lead to a multiplier effect on the local economy to boost retail, real estate, tourism and generate employment opportunities and also unlock public sector potential, tapping private sector efficiencies through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and create critical sources of revenue. Under the National Asset Monetisation Policy, the assets are divided into two categories: core and non-core assets.  Core assets include sports assets such as stadiums, highway operational toll roads, power transmission assets, oil and gas pipelines, airports, telecom assets, warehousing assets. Non-core assets  comprise land, office space, factories, commercial spaces, properties belonging to the railways, defence and a number of PSUs. These includethe top five sectors such as roads (27%) followed by railways (25%), power (15%), oil and gas pipelines (8%) and telecom (6%). Roads and Railways together contribute ~52% of the total NMP value. Niti Aayog has also created a dashboard for tracking progress and for providing visibility to investors. The government is also targeting several REITs/InvITs to monetise State and PSU assets and this change will enable them to attract investments from a wider market of retail investors. Assets  The Ministry of Railways: It targets raising Rs. 1,52,495 crore through asset monetisation with plans to award 90 passenger trains and 400 stations to private players (Tier 1: 50 stations, Tier 2: 100 stations, and Tier 3: 250 stations), 256 goods sheds, 673 km Dedicated Freight Corridor, 630 Hill railways, 7281km Konkan Railway and 18,700 OHE Invit during the year. It aims to increase the modal share (freight) of railways from 26% to 45% while continuing to provide best-in-class services for passengers. Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and Indian Railway Station Development Corporation(IRSDC) have four key mandates as a part of its development plan — leasing of 84+ commercial sites, 2250 railway colony redevelopment, 60+ railway station redevelopment and building multi-functional complexes. The NIP envisages a total capex of Rs. 13.7 lakh crore by both the centre and states over FY 2022-25, of which Rs. 1.6 lakh crore is envisaged through the PPP mode.  The Ministryof Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH): It has set a target of raising Rs. 1,60,200 crore through asset monetisation. It plans to monetise 1,32,499 kms of roads through Infrastructure Investment Trust (InviT), Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) and securitisation. NHAI is in the process of monetising its completed and operational highway projects under the Infrastructure Investment Trust route to mobilise additional financial resources through the capital markets. Selected operational portfolio of projects will be held through an SPV. The indicative value of the NHAI InvIT fund raise from the current tranche underway is about Rs. 5,000 crore. The first tranche of InvIT is expected to consist of ~586 km of NH assets in Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal, and Bihar.  The Departmentof Telecommunications: It has a target of raising Rs. 35,100 crore for which it has already undertaken the monetisation of tower assets of BSNL and BharatNet. About 2,86,255 km of existing fibre assets of BBNL and BSNL, laid under the Bharatnet project spanning over 16 states have been considered for monetisation through PPP mode. Rent Operate Transfer(ROT) and Develop, Build, Finance, Operate and Maintain (DBFOT) model has been adopted for monetising assets under the telecom sector. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has started the process of selling non-core assets of HMT Ltd and MTNL Ltd. Under Union Budget 2021-22, the government allocated Rs. 14,200 crore for telecom infrastructure that entails completion of optical fibre cable (OFC) based network for Defence services, rolling out broadband in 2.2 lakh panchayats, improving mobile services in the North East and an additional outlay of funds to expand the reach of broadbands in rural areas through PPP model and boost Digital India initiative.  Ministry ofYouth Affairs and Sports: With a  Rs. 11,450 crore target, it plans to monetise over 130 state-owned stadiums in the country including about 50 cricket stadiums and 2 Sports authority Regional centres. The stadiums are likely to be leased out to the private sector by way of an operation and maintenance contract, OMDA based PPP model or through InViTs. The ministry has already floated a tender for Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. The government to build world class sports infrastructure through brownfield PPP projects.  Ministry of CivilAviation: As for the sale of assets under the Ministry in 2021-22 has set a target of raising Rs. 20782 crore, the government is considering selling the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) stake in the joint venture of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad airports. This is besides the 25 AAI airports that it will monetise through the OMDA based model (Operation, Management, Development Agreement). AAI has identified 6 airports in Tier 2/Tier 3 cities namely, Amritsar, Varanasi, Bhubaneswar, Indore, Raipur and Trichy for the purpose of monetisation through brownfield PPP models. The AAI has announced a few developments in Indian Airports—construction of a new airport on a greenfield site in Hollongi (Arunachal Pradesh) by November 2022 and a new integrated passenger terminal building expansion of Tiruchirappalli and Pune Airport (March 2022). The Airport Authority of India (AAI) signed a concession agreement with Adani Group for three airports—Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram.  Ministry of ShippingPorts and Waterways (MoSPW): It has set a target of raising Rs. 12,828 crore has identified over 31 berths that it plans to monetise through the PPP mode which consists of Paradip port, Shyama Prasad Mukherji Port (Kidderpore and Haldia), JNPT port, Mumbai port and many more. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust launched a comprehensive solid waste management project as a part of its green port initiatives. Land Monetisation is one of the oldest sources of revenue besides its core operations. MoSPW leases some part of the land for commercial developments and some part of land for township development.  Ministry of Power: With a Rs. 39,832 crore targeted investment, it aims to monetise assets of Powergrid for more than Rs. 7000 crore in the first phase. These assets, which are mainly High Voltage Transmission lines and substations, are held by Powergrid in the form of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Key entities whose assets have been considered are NHPC, NTPC and SJVNL who own the bulk of the hydel assets and NTPC (under Ministry of Power) and NLC (under Ministry of Coal) that own renewable assets. The proceeds from the asset monetization would be deployed by Powergrid in their new and under-construction projects. The government plans to monetise the assets of state-owned power companies like NTPC and REC through the InvIt model, and half the proceeds may go into strengthening state transmission and distribution infrastructure. Asset recycling is a key strategy of the Government of India to release the capital invested in operational assets and the proposed InvIT of Powergrid would attract both domestic as well as global investors including sovereign wealth funds. The government had approved liquidity support packages involving one-time loans of about Rs. 1,30,000 crore from Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) to discoms, to clear their overdue payments  Ministry of Petroleumand Natural Gas: It has identified non-core assets worth Rs. 24,462 crore for monetisation which includes assets from Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) through the InvIt route. The government is looking to monetise operating infrastructure assets, to finance new infrastructure development. Some of the assets include 2 hydrogen-generating units in Gujarat and some ESG assets like effluent treatment plants, sulphur recovery units, water treatments plants etc., from IOC, worth about Rs. 10,000 crore. The Dhabhol-Bengaluru pipeline(1414km), Dahej-Uran-Panvel-Dabhol (815km) pipeline worth Rs. 5,000 crore from GAIL and HPCL’s product pipeline from Mangalore-Hassan worth Rs. 2,500 crore and more assets are being identified. This will help GAIL to mobilise over Rs. 20,000 crore through this route that could be helpful in developing new pipeline infrastructure. Apart from the above mentioned assets the government is planning to raise Rs. 28,747 crore from Mining, Rs. 28,900 crore from warehousing and investments worth Rs. 15,000 crore in urban real estate. Factors to consider There is noneed to outrightly sell assets for monetisation. There are several viable commercial models to facilitate this objective through adequate upfront premiums, regular revenue shares, standard service delivery parameters with defined penalties and termination clauses in the contract. Asset monetization can be taken up through two methods classified as Direct Contractual Approach which mean direct contract between public and private partner or the PPP model which consists of OMDA (Operation Management Development Agreement) and ToT( Toll Operate Transfer) and other method is Structured Financing Models which consists of investment in InvITs, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and Asset-Backed Securitisation (ABS). Adoption of any model would depend upon various factors viz. asset profile, objectives for monetisation, expectations of sponsor and investors etc. The most optimal or selected model, could hence very well be one of the above or a hybrid structure. It just needs to be structured correctly to achieve a win-win scenario for all: the government, the investor and the public. With asset monetization, the revenue proceeds can be reinvested in new infrastructure without resorting to public debt while better maintaining the existing infrastructure facility. It also leads to a comprehensive modernization drive with innovative techniques and ideas replacing the obsolete ones. But this is a sensitive decision-making process that needs to consider the correct valuation of the assets, the future infrastructure needs of the country and the private sector’s ability to fulfil the targeted objective. Equally important is the willingness of the citizens to accept management of public infrastructure in private hands. Their grievances, if any, need to be promptly answered by the operating private player.

16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Mudrooms for the monsoon||Come rain, and it translates into slush and muck at your doorstep. Keep them at bay this rainy season by making friends with a Western concept: the mudroom. Historically, mudrooms were born in rural settings where roads were unpaved and boots were perennially muddy. The result? Wet footprints, mud on the floor, and very often boot tracks through the home. Mudrooms were typically seen in farmhouses in the 18th century and more often than not were a small closet-like space off the kitchen or at the entryway. By the 1970s, many homes in the West had such areas which were usually located between the garage and the kitchen. Indian homes and mudrooms don’t really go back a long way but there’s no reason that they shouldn’t. Especially not in the monsoon! Try out these easy tips to transform a small entryway or verandah into a mudroom this season. Design it to be functional A mudroom has certain specific functions; it’s the small entryway where footwear and outer clothes can be removed and placed before entering the home. Place a coat stand for wet raincoats, a mesh umbrella stand for dripping umbrellas and a stone-lined tray for slushy shoes. Style it right Function should never detract from the form; so what if it’s just the humble mudroom? Simple or elegant, a few décor elements will transform this space into a welcoming and warm one. Add a mirror for last-minute touch-ups. The mudroom staple No mudroom can do without a bench. This piece of furniture works in myriad ways — you can perch yourself to wear or take off your shoes, put down your shopping bag or sit to take a call. Make it a space-intensive area by creating room to put shoes underneath. Keep the kids in mind Children are the ones who love to wade in muddy puddles and it’s important that you kit out the mudroom to suit them. Avoid closets and cupboards; low-hanging hooks for rain coats and a boot stand are ideal. The flooring should be anti-skid, so look for options to avoid accidents. Cut the clutter Where kids are, clutter seems to follow. Keep your mudroom organised and clutter-free, by making the space as functional and efficient as you can. Double up the hook rows; you can use one for hanging rain gear and the other for bags. Bring in a set of bins or baskets if space permits. It allows everyone to have a designated space for their things. Go vertical Mudrooms are not really rooms; they’re usually little nooks or niches. Make the most of the small square footage by exploring the vertical dimension with shelves, closets and cubbies. You’ll have enough storage and a neat mudroom. Could you ask for anything more? Get it ready-to-go Make your mudroom the best go-to spot from your home. A couple of charging points to get your phone ready to go, a key organiser and a catchall for your sunglasses will ensure that you’re out of your home without forgetting a thing. The mudroom may be a foreign concept, but it’s one that can be adopted by almost any family. The best part is that it can serve different purposes for different families. Use it to stash your purses, bags, raincoats, and sports gear. A series of racks, hooks, and hangers can help optimise storage options, keep clutter out of the other rooms, and ensure that all your things are organised better. Also, the addition of accessories such as a bulletin board or a chalkboard can help draw up schedules for all family members, ensuring that everyone’s on the same page.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/mudrooms-for-the-monsoon/article37015188.ece
16 October 2021||October 16 2021 00:00 IST,||Demystifying India’s asset management plans||The government has set up a target to make India a $5 trillion economy. To achieve this goal, it is targeting to unlock optimal value from public sector assets which have not yielded potential return or which are sub-optimally utilised, by the way of ‘asset monetisation’. It has set an aggressive target of raising around Rs. 6 lakh crore under the National Monetization Pipeline (NMP). The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) envisages infrastructure investment of Rs. 111 lakh crore over a five-year period between FY 2020 and FY 2025. With an annual average investment of Rs. 22 lakh crore, this is a significant step-up (~2.5 times) vis-à-vis historical levels of spending on infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure is directly proportional to the growth in GDP/ economy of a country. It will also lead to a multiplier effect on the local economy to boost retail, real estate, tourism and generate employment opportunities and also unlock public sector potential, tapping private sector efficiencies through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and create critical sources of revenue. Under the National Asset Monetisation Policy, the assets are divided into two categories: core and non-core assets.  Core assets include sports assets such as stadiums, highway operational toll roads, power transmission assets, oil and gas pipelines, airports, telecom assets, warehousing assets. Non-core assets  comprise land, office space, factories, commercial spaces, properties belonging to the railways, defence and a number of PSUs. These includethe top five sectors such as roads (27%) followed by railways (25%), power (15%), oil and gas pipelines (8%) and telecom (6%). Roads and Railways together contribute ~52% of the total NMP value. Niti Aayog has also created a dashboard for tracking progress and for providing visibility to investors. The government is also targeting several REITs/InvITs to monetise State and PSU assets and this change will enable them to attract investments from a wider market of retail investors. Assets  The Ministry of Railways: It targets raising Rs. 1,52,495 crore through asset monetisation with plans to award 90 passenger trains and 400 stations to private players (Tier 1: 50 stations, Tier 2: 100 stations, and Tier 3: 250 stations), 256 goods sheds, 673 km Dedicated Freight Corridor, 630 Hill railways, 7281km Konkan Railway and 18,700 OHE Invit during the year. It aims to increase the modal share (freight) of railways from 26% to 45% while continuing to provide best-in-class services for passengers. Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and Indian Railway Station Development Corporation(IRSDC) have four key mandates as a part of its development plan — leasing of 84+ commercial sites, 2250 railway colony redevelopment, 60+ railway station redevelopment and building multi-functional complexes. The NIP envisages a total capex of Rs. 13.7 lakh crore by both the centre and states over FY 2022-25, of which Rs. 1.6 lakh crore is envisaged through the PPP mode.  The Ministryof Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH): It has set a target of raising Rs. 1,60,200 crore through asset monetisation. It plans to monetise 1,32,499 kms of roads through Infrastructure Investment Trust (InviT), Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) and securitisation. NHAI is in the process of monetising its completed and operational highway projects under the Infrastructure Investment Trust route to mobilise additional financial resources through the capital markets. Selected operational portfolio of projects will be held through an SPV. The indicative value of the NHAI InvIT fund raise from the current tranche underway is about Rs. 5,000 crore. The first tranche of InvIT is expected to consist of ~586 km of NH assets in Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal, and Bihar.  The Departmentof Telecommunications: It has a target of raising Rs. 35,100 crore for which it has already undertaken the monetisation of tower assets of BSNL and BharatNet. About 2,86,255 km of existing fibre assets of BBNL and BSNL, laid under the Bharatnet project spanning over 16 states have been considered for monetisation through PPP mode. Rent Operate Transfer(ROT) and Develop, Build, Finance, Operate and Maintain (DBFOT) model has been adopted for monetising assets under the telecom sector. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has started the process of selling non-core assets of HMT Ltd and MTNL Ltd. Under Union Budget 2021-22, the government allocated Rs. 14,200 crore for telecom infrastructure that entails completion of optical fibre cable (OFC) based network for Defence services, rolling out broadband in 2.2 lakh panchayats, improving mobile services in the North East and an additional outlay of funds to expand the reach of broadbands in rural areas through PPP model and boost Digital India initiative.  Ministry ofYouth Affairs and Sports: With a  Rs. 11,450 crore target, it plans to monetise over 130 state-owned stadiums in the country including about 50 cricket stadiums and 2 Sports authority Regional centres. The stadiums are likely to be leased out to the private sector by way of an operation and maintenance contract, OMDA based PPP model or through InViTs. The ministry has already floated a tender for Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. The government to build world class sports infrastructure through brownfield PPP projects.  Ministry of CivilAviation: As for the sale of assets under the Ministry in 2021-22 has set a target of raising Rs. 20782 crore, the government is considering selling the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) stake in the joint venture of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad airports. This is besides the 25 AAI airports that it will monetise through the OMDA based model (Operation, Management, Development Agreement). AAI has identified 6 airports in Tier 2/Tier 3 cities namely, Amritsar, Varanasi, Bhubaneswar, Indore, Raipur and Trichy for the purpose of monetisation through brownfield PPP models. The AAI has announced a few developments in Indian Airports—construction of a new airport on a greenfield site in Hollongi (Arunachal Pradesh) by November 2022 and a new integrated passenger terminal building expansion of Tiruchirappalli and Pune Airport (March 2022). The Airport Authority of India (AAI) signed a concession agreement with Adani Group for three airports—Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram.  Ministry of ShippingPorts and Waterways (MoSPW): It has set a target of raising Rs. 12,828 crore has identified over 31 berths that it plans to monetise through the PPP mode which consists of Paradip port, Shyama Prasad Mukherji Port (Kidderpore and Haldia), JNPT port, Mumbai port and many more. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust launched a comprehensive solid waste management project as a part of its green port initiatives.
