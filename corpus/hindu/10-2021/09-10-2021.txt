09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||After 68 years, Tatas win back Air India with Rs. 18,000 cr. bid||After 68 years, Air India is all set to return to the Tata fold. Tata Sons subsidiary Talace Pvt. Ltd. emerged as the winning bidder for the debt-laden national carrier after quoting an enterprise value of Rs. 18,000 crore. The government will take a hit of Rs. 28,844 crore. The Tatas will own a 100% stake in Air India, as also 100% in its international low-cost arm Air India Express and 50% in the ground handling joint venture, Air India SATS. Apart from 141 aircraft and access to a network of 173 destinations, including 55 international ones, Tatas will also have the ownership of iconic brands such as Air India, Indian Airlines and the Maharajah. Handover by Dec. The Group of Ministers led by Home Minister Amit Shah approved the winning bidder in its meeting on October 4. The government aims to complete the transaction by December 2021, when it will transfer its shares and hand over the airline to the new buyer. “Talace quoted an enterprise value of Rs. 18,000 crore. Of this, Rs. 15,300 crore is the debt component of Air India to be taken on by the winner, and the remaining Rs. 2,700 crore will be cash paid to the government,” DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said at a press briefing. Revised bidding criteria The government had revised the bidding criteria last year and invited bids on enterprise value (equity and debt value), which allowed players the flexibility to quote the debt they were willing to take on instead of a pre-determined, fixed debt along with minimum cash consideration of 15% for equity. “On an emotional note, Air India under the leadership of Mr. JRD Tata had, at one time, gained the reputation of being one of the most prestigious airlines in the world. Tata will have the opportunity of regaining the image and reputation it enjoyed in earlier years. Mr. JRD Tata would have been overjoyed if he was in our midst today,” Ratan Tata, Tata Group’s Chairman Emeritus, said in a statement. He added that it would take “considerable effort” to rebuild Air India, though at the same time “it will provide a very strong market opportunity to the Tata Group’s presence in the aviation industry”. Tata Sons owns 84% share in Air Asia, which has a market share of 5.2%, and 51% stake in Vistara, which has a market share of 8.3%. Together with Air India’s market share of 13.2%, Tatas could be in control of 26.7% market share, and be the second biggest player after IndiGo. The second bidder, a consortium led by Ajay Singh, had quoted an enterprise value of Rs. 15,100 crore. The reserve price fixed by the government before opening the bids on September 28 was Rs. 12,906 crore. The government will absorb the balance debt of Rs. 46,262 crore, which will be transferred to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up by it — Air India Assets Holding Ltd. When adjusted against non-core assets such as land and buildings worth Rs. 14,718 crore that will also be parked in the SPV and the cash amount of Rs. 2,700 crore from Tatas, the net liability on the government comes to Rs. 28,844 crore. “The taxpayers have put in Rs. 1,10,277 crore in Air India since 2009-10, which includes Rs. 54,584 crore cash support and Rs. 55,692 crore as guarantee support for loans,” Mr. Pandey said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/after-68-years-tatas-win-back-air-india-with-rs-18000-cr-bid/article36908794.ece

09 October 2021||HUBBALLI,||Shettar says Cong., JD(S) criticising RSS for minority appeasement||Stating that both the Congress and the Janata Dal(S) are competing with each other to criticise RSS for the sake of minority appeasement, the former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar has said that had it not been for RSS, four or five Pakistans will have emerged in the country by this time. Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi on Friday, Mr. Shettar said that because of the RSS, the country is safe and peaceful now. “The RSS is engaged in nurturing unity and integrity of the country,” he said. Criticising RSS has become fashionable for the Congress and the Janata Dal(S) and both Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy are engaged in criticising the BJP for the sake of politics, he said. Regarding Mr. Kumaraswamy’s differentiation between the old and today’s RSS, Mr. Shettar said that one could believe if one had said that the old and new Congress or Janata Dal(S) are different. “But in the RSS, individuals may change but not the ideology and principles. The Nation First objective of the Sangh remains the same even today,” he said. Regarding Income Tax search on the residences of close aides of the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, he said that it should not be linked to politics. “Mr. Yediyurappa himself has said that the law will take its own course. I concur with him,” he said.  ‘In the RSS, individuals may change but not the ideology and principles and the Nation First objective of the Sangh remains the same even today’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/shettar-says-cong-jds-criticising-rss-for-minority-appeasement/article36909060.ece
09 October 2021||MYSURU,||Festival vibes unaffected by low-key Dasara in Mysuru||The State Government’s decision to scale down the Dasara festivities, which began on Thursday, has not whittled down the festival vibes in the city. This is evident from the steady increase in the number of people visiting Chamundi Hills for darshan and the response to the illumination ofvarious streets and circles taken up as part of the festival. Though the numbers are nowhere near the crowds during the pre-pandemic days, there is a steady increase in public turnout. However, the number of people attending cultural programmes at the palace is low because of the restrictions in place to prevent a surge in COVID-19 infections. Even the district in-charge Minister, S.T. Somashekar, has said that the number of people attending the cultural programmes is less than the 500 limit set by the authorities. However, the online transmission and live programmes have received a warm response, with over 70,000 people watching the inauguration of the Dasara cultural programmes on the first day. It is customary for people to skip temple visit on the day of Dasara inauguration given the state protocols in place for the visit of elected representatives. But by evening, the floodgates open for devotees, and it was no different on Thursday and again on Friday. Daily visit There are devotees who make it a point to visit the temple multiple times during Nada Habba as there is a new decoration for the deity on each day of the festival. On Friday, the temple authorities were forced to keep the precincts open throughout the day because of the steady flow of devotees. Even the parking lot was full and some visitors struggled to find space to park their vehicles, though the situation eased by late in the afternoon. The temple tends to close around 2 p.m. for darshan, but on Friday the steady flow of visitors forced the authorities to extend the darshan timings. Besides, as it was Friday, which is considered auspicious, the crowd was larger. However, it is the illumination of roads and circles, besides public offices of importance, that is a big draw, and the city roads tend to get clogged by traffic by evening. Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation has illuminated more than 100 km of roads in Mysuru, aside from various public offices and circles. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation is also operating open-top buses and there is significant demand for it to witness the city come alive in lights.  Up in lights Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation has illuminated over 100 km of roads in Mysuru, aside from various public offices and circles in Mysuru||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/festival-vibes-unaffected-by-low-key-dasara-in-mysuru/article36909227.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, China patrols face off in Tawang||Some Chinese soldiers of a large patrol were detained for a few hours by the Indian Army after a minor face-off near Yangtse in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh last week, according to official sources. “Some Chinese soldiers were detained for a few hours and let off after the issue was resolved at the ground level as per established protocols between the two countries,” an official source said. Face-offs occurred because of the differing areas of perception due to the demarcated boundary, and as both sides undertook patrolling activities up to their line of perception, another source said. “The face-off occurred as patrols of both sides came face to face, which lasted for a few hours, and was resolved by local commanders,” a source noted. “There has been no damage to our defences,” one of them observed. The Army has not responded to questions on the incident. The latest face-off occurred as the two sides are set to hold the 13th round of Corps Commander talks for disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The two sides have so far undertaken disengagement from the Pangong Tso and Gogra areas. Defence sources said that whenever patrols of both sides physically met, the situation was managed according to established protocols and mechanisms agreed upon by both sides. “Physical engagement can last for a few hours prior to disengaging as per mutual understanding,” one of the sources cited above said. Asked about the detention of Chinese soldiers by the Indian Army, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian replied, “I am not aware of the relevant information.” Peace and tranquillity in these areas of differing perceptions had been possible due to adherence to the existing agreements and protocols between the two countries, the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-china-patrols-face-off-in-tawang/article36908799.ece
09 October 2021||MANGALURU,||Pollution Control Board issues notice to MRPL on oil leak||The Regional Office of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL) asking it to submit an action taken report immediately on removal of oil spills in the marshy land near MRPL Phase III, failing which it will recommend to the board to initiate suitable action against the refining major besides recommending levy of environmental compensation. Issued by the Environment Officer of Board’s Mangaluru Regional Office, the notice was based on complaints from Jokatte Nagarika Horata Samithi and Democratic Youth Federation of India State president Muneer Katipalla. Mr. Katipalla has shared the copy of the notice which said, based on the complaints of discharge of mixed blackish effluent into the marshy area near MRPL Phase III on September 25 this year, pollution control officials visited the spot and the refinery was asked to plug the leak. The officials again visited the area on September 29 and found that a layer of oil mixed blackish effluent was seen mixed with water in the marshy land. Upon examination of the collected samples, certain parameters were above the standard level, it said and added that MRPL did not respond to the notice issued on that day as yet. KSPCB, therefore, has asked MRPL to remove the oil from the marshy land and submit the action taken report without further delay and also, submit an on-site emergency plan. If the refinery did not respond immediately, the Regional Office will recommend to the board to initiate further action under the provisions of the Water Act and also recommend levying environmental compensation, the notice said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pollution-control-board-issues-notice-to-mrpl-on-oil-leak/article36909355.ece
09 October 2021||KAKINADA,||Police unearth 10 booby traps laid by Maoists||Personnel of the Anti-Naxal Squad (ANS) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) on Friday unearthed at least 10 booby traps allegedly laid by the Maoists in the Mallampeta forest cover on the Andhra Pradesh-Chhattisgarh border in Chintoor Agency. The spot where the traps were found shares a border with Sukma district of Chhattisgarh. This is said to be the biggest booby trap laid by the Maoists on the tri-State border of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh in recent years. The ANS was led by Chintoor ASP G. Krishna Kanth and was on a combing operation on the State border. ‘Tragedy averted’ “The booby trap is believed to be the traditional technique of Gutti Koya tribe of Chhattisgarh. A major tragedy has been averted with their detection,” said East Godavari Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu. The Maoists had laid the booby traps by digging trenches, in which they reportedly planted sharp bamboo arrows and covered them with leaves. The security forces found a few hundred sharp bamboo arrows in the traps. Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a press conference here, Eluru Range DIG K.V. Mohan Rao said the strategy of laying the booby trap was once rampant in Chhattisgarh. “We will design our new strategy to detect such traps in future,” Mr. Mohan Rao added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/10-booby-traps-laid-by-maoists-unearthed/article36908744.ece
09 October 2021||GUNTUR,||Will not let farmers down: CM||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday said that a level playing field would be created in marketing of agricultural products to ensure that farmers got remunerative prices. “We will not let down our farmers, battling many crises, including climate change. Our government will intervene whenever the prices are declining and support farmers through a price stabilisation fund,’’ Mr. Jagan said at a review meeting on agri infra projects. Stating that the performance of Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBK) had been lauded across the country, Mr. Jagan said the kendras had evolved as a single point facility for access to fertilizers, pesticides and quality seeds. “Ensure farmers receive the orders placed in RBKs, which will also act as sub dealers from next rabi season. There is also a need to effectively counter misinformation propaganda on the RBKs. Community hiring centres will be set up where paddy is being cultivated,” he said. The Chief Minister instructed officials to encourage farmers to cultivate alternative crops such as millets instead of paddy under borewells and to provide incentives to farmers who cultivated alternate crops and told officials to set up processing plants at these locations. The officials said they were setting up seed-cum-millet processing units at 33 places and 20 of them would be ready by December. It was targeted to complete all units by March 2022, they said. The officials said milk collection was on the rise in the districts where the Jagananna Paala Velluva programme was being carried out. While pointing out that false information was being propagated on Jagananna Paala Velluva programme, Mr. Jagan said that Amul was not a private company, but a cooperative dairy which was being operated by farmers to whom the profits were being passed on and added that conditions were created to hike milk procurement price after Amul entered the market. Fishing harbours The officials explained to the Chief Minister the progress of works pertaining to setting up of food processing units and informed that works on fishing harbours at Juvvaladinne, Nizampatnam, Machilipatnam and Uppada were in progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-will-not-let-farmers-down-cm/article36908786.ece
09 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Guidelines for school reopening unveiled||The State Government on Friday unveiled final guidelines for reopening of schools from November 1. Bio-bubbles will be implemented at the class level to ensure physical distancing when students reach schools after more than 18 months owing to COVID-19. Each bio-bubble will comprise six to 10 students. One class may have two or three bio-bubbles. Only the students in a bubble will interact with each other. On no account should the students in one bubble interact with one in another bubble. If the students in one bubble are from the same location, their travel arrangements too can be planned together. If a student in a bio-bubble gets COVID-19, the entire bubble will go into quarantine. At the primary level, teachers should be part of the bio-bubble to the extent possible. Students who have symptoms will be tested. Operating procedures Minister for Health Veena George, along with Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty, on Friday spoke at length about the standard operating procedures to be adopted. Basic health check-ups will be done for students and staff in association with the Health Department as soon as schools reopen. Mr. Sivankutty clarified that students need be sent to school only if parents/guardians were willing. The eight-part guidelines titled ‘Thirike Schoolilekku’ include general guidelines, directions for students, arrangements to be made at school and at the local self-government level, awareness creation, and monitoring of the situation. Classes 8 and 9 will resume on November 15. Classes will be held till noon for the first two weeks. Saturday will be a working day except on holidays. Students will come to school in batches, with only two students on a bench for primary classes. Batches are not compulsory in schools where students strength is low. Differently abled students or those with comorbidities need not come to school initially. If a school has more than 1,000 students, only 25% of the students need reach the campus at one time. After the first two weeks, a review will be held of the number of students reaching school, shift system, and the midday meals. Digital classes will continue. Detailed academic guidelines and academic calendar will also be published.

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC revives DA case against Minister, wife||The Supreme Court on Friday revived a disproportionate assets case against Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh and his wife while holding that the CBI need not always conduct a preliminary inquiry before registering an FIR against public servants in corruption cases. A three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud set aside a decision of the Telangana High Court in February 2020 to quash the corruption / disproportionate assets case against Mr. Suresh and his wife T.H. Viajayalakshmi, an Income-Tax Commissioner. The High Court reasoned that the CBI had registered the FIR without bothering to first conduct a preliminary inquiry into the couple’s “known sources of income” or information submitted to the government under the Central Civil Services Rules. The High Court had found the corruption charges “ prima facie unsustainable” after going through these sources of income on its own. Differing with the High Court, Mr. Justice Chandrachud, in a 64-page judgment, said, “We hold that since the institution of a preliminary inquiry in cases of corruption is not made mandatory before the registration of an FIR under the Code of Criminal Procedure, Prevention of Corruption Act, or even the CBI Manual, for this court to issue a direction to that effect will be tantamount to stepping into the legislative domain. Hence, we hold that in case the information received by the CBI, through a complaint or a ‘source information’, discloses the commission of a cognisable offence, it can directly register a regular case instead of conducting a preliminary inquiry, where the officer is satisfied that the information discloses the commission of a cognisable offence.” Mr. Justice Chandrachud also dismissed contentions raised by the couple that CBI had no jurisdiction to register a case in the State as Andhra Pradesh had withdrawn general consent in November 2018. “The FIR has been registered in Chennai, and that the general consent by the State of Tamil Nadu still stands,” the court held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-revives-disproportionate-assets-case-against-education-minister-suresh-wife/article36908789.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC dissatisfied with U.P.’s status report on probe||The Supreme Court on Friday said the Uttar Pradesh Government’s resolve to seriously investigate the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and deaths, including allegations of murder against a Union Minister’s son, seemed just all talk and no action. “Your seriousness is only in words and not in your actions,” Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana addressed the government. Justice Hima Kohli told the State, “There is an old adage which rings true in this situation — the proof of the pudding is in the eating...” The State is represented by senior advocate Harish Salve and State Additional Advocate-General Garima Parshad. ‘A case of brutal murder’ Justice Surya Kant, on the Bench, told the State, “It is a case of brutal murder of eight persons, law must take its course against all the accused.” The court stated that it was dissatisfied with the government’s status report on the investigation. Chief Justice Ramana pointed out how even a special investigation team formed by the State was made of “local” police officers, inspectors, Superintendents and a DIG. The court asked whether the State has yet made a request to the CBI to take over the case. Mr. Salve replied in the negative. After a pause, the court itself went on to express doubts about transferring the case to the CBI. “The CBI is not a solution for reason of the persons involved...,” Chief Justice Ramana told Mr. Salve. The “persons involved” may have been a reference to the case’s link to a Central Minister. Mr. Salve began his submissions, saying a “young man”, ostensibly Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra, was being “targeted”. Mr. Ashish is accused of shooting dead a farmer while trying to escape agitated farmers after vehicles in the Minister’s convoy rammed into them. “The charges are serious,” Chief Justice Ramana addressed Mr. Salve. The latter said a notice had been issued to Mr. Ashish, asking him to appear before the police by 11 a.m. “tomorrow”. “If the person does not come, the rigour of law will take its course,” he assured. The CJI asked sharply,“Is it the same way you treat other accused too? Like sending notices, etc.” Mr. Salve said he was instructed by the State that the postmortem report on the victim did not show bullet injuries. “That is why notice was issued. If the allegations are true, it is certainly a Section 302 IPC [murder] case,” he stated. After conferring for a moment, the CJI addressed Mr. Salve, “This is the opinion of the Bench... As a responsible State government with a system and police, when there is a serious allegation of death or gunshot injury, will any other accused in this country be treated the same way?”The senior lawyer urged the court to give some more time to the State to repair the shortfalls in the investigation. He said everything would fall in place in a day or two. He would talk to the Home Secretary and the DGP. He said the court could list the case immediately on reopening after the Dussehra holidays. The Bench posted the case for October 20 as the first item on the list. TV channel’s claim The hearing witnessed a lawyer inform the Bench about a tweet by a TV channel that the CJI visited the Lakhimpur Kheri violence victims on Thursday. The CJI, however, brushed the remark aside, saying, “I was sitting in court and hearing cases.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-dissatisfied-with-ups-status-report/article36908796.ece

Video footage showed bodies surrounded by debris inside the mosque that is used by people from the minority Shia community. The Islamic State-Khorasan group claimed responsibility for the attack. They have repeatedly targeted Shias in a bid to stir up sectarian violence in Sunni-majority Afghanistan. In a statement released on its Telegram channels, the jihadist group said that an IS suicide bomber “detonated an explosive vest amid a crowd” of Shiite worshippers who had gathered inside the mosque. IS said the “perpetrator of the attack was an Uyghur Muslim”. The blast follows several attacks, including one at a mosque in Kabul, in recent weeks, also claimed by the the Islamic State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/suicide-bomber-kills-46-in-afghanistan-mosque/article36908801.ece
09 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Tension near Durga temple over telecast of another religion’s event||Mild tension prevailed near the Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvala Devastanam here on Thursday when a private television channel, which had arranged an LED screen to telecast the Dasara Utsavams, reportedly propagated another religion. The television channel organisers, who were telecasting the festivities atop Indrakeeladri, and at other places in the vicinity of the temple, suddenly played the activities of another religion, which angered the devotees. A devotee allegedly hurled a stone at the LED screen installed near Model Guest House, located on the banks of Krishna river. The screen was damaged and a few other devotees reportedly entered into an argument over the telecast of another religion’s activities near the Durga temple. The police, who were deployed at the guest house and other points, rushed to the spot and pacified the devotees. They stopped the telecast of the other religion programme at the temple and brought the situation under control. One Town CI P. Venkateswarlu said that Temple Executive Officer D. Bramaramba had lodged a complaint on the issue of telecasting of other religion near the temple and a case had been registered against C-Channel, Keerthi Creations and other organisations. “We are in the process of identifying the CCTV footage and a detailed investigation is on.

The coal shortage is also pushing the country’s energy sector into turmoil,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said in his letter to the Prime Minister on Friday. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy also urged the Prime Minister to revive the stranded / non-working pit-head coal plants in India without the PPAs, or revive coal linkage on an emergency basis, to save precious time involved in coal transport and quality limitations in coal transportation to non-pit head coal plants. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said directions may be given to banks to provide working capital loans liberally to Discoms till the crisis is tided over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bail-out-state-from-power-crisis-jagan-urges-pm/article36909391.ece

Ranjit was shot dead at the behest of Gurmeet reportedly for his suspected role in the circulation of an anonymous letter, which narrated how women were being sexually exploited by the sect head at the Dera headquarters. According to the CBI charge sheet, Gurmeet believed that Ranjit was behind the circulation of the anonymous letter.

09 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||KPCC cracks the whip on indiscipline||The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) will crack the whip on party workers who played truant and shrunk away from organisational responsibilities during the 2021 Assembly election campaign for reasons ranging from factionalism and favouritism to localism. KPCC president K. Sudhakaran, MP, said on Friday that the disciplinary action was based on the reports filed by various committees that identified the structural failures that led to the party’s crushing defeat at the hustings. The KPCC had identified 97 leaders for corrective action. More would follow. A party insider said that, for instance, in Thiruvananthapuram, the Congress would hold to account persons responsible for diverting the expensive multi-colour posters printed for candidates to waste paper dealers. Similar incidents left the party red-faced during the electioneering and provided ammunition to the political opposition. Moreover, the party felt that its candidates, especially women, lacked organisational support and were left to fend for themselves largely. In contrast, the Left Democratic Front had mobilised Kudumbashree and Asha workers and other neighbourhood women self-help groups to knock on doors and get out the vote for ruling front candidates. Election funds The KPCC was also reportedly verifying suspected diversion of election funds. Fund crunch had seriously hobbled the Congress campaign. In contrast, the LDF and National Democratic Alliance were flush with election funds. The KPCC had also spotlighted at least 58 incidents that lowered the stature of the Congress in public, including instances of infighting spilling into the open and verbal duel between leaders. The KPCC also took cognisance of the RSP’s complaint that the UDF’s election machinery had failed in Chavara, resulting in Shibu Baby John’s defeat. It has constituted a committee comprising K. Mohankumar, K.P. Dhanapalan, and P.J. Joy, all former MLAs, to look into the causes for defeat in the Chavara, Kunnathur, Idukki, Azhikode, Kayamkulam, Adoor, Peerumade, Thrissur, and Balussery constituencies. The KPCC has also banned rank and file from forming organisations, particular factions, or social media groups independent of the party without the leadership’s prior consent. They also could not use Congress iconography on posters without sanction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kpcc-cracks-the-whip-on-indiscipline/article36909159.ece

09 October 2021||CHENNAI,||Palk Bay scheme will be given a fillip: Murugan||The Union Government is considering increasing the unit cost of deep-sea fishing vessels under the Palk Bay scheme to make it more attractive to fisherfolk, L. Murugan, Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Information and Broadcasting, said here on Friday. In an interaction with senior journalists of The Hindu Group on Friday, the Union Minister, who was accompanied by K. Annamalai, president of the Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP, conceded that the original unit cost of Rs. 80 lakh was “inadequate” [to meet the requirements of the fisherfolk]. This was why the Union Ministry asked Cochin Shipyard Ltd., a company fully owned by the Union Government, to work out the revised cost. “They [the Cochin Shipyard] have given their opinion. Now, the unit cost may touch Rs. 1.3 crore. Once the technical nod comes, we will go ahead,” the Union Minister explained. He was responding to a question whether the Centre would bring the Palk Bay scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), wherein the unit cost of deep-sea fishing vessels had been fixed at Rs. 1.2 crore. Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017, the Palk Bay scheme, being financed by the Union and the State Governments with beneficiary participation, envisaged the provision of 2,000 vessels in three years to the fishermen of the State and motivate them to abandon bottom trawling. The current year’s Policy Note of Fisheries and Fishermen Welfare Department of the Tamil Nadu government said that 42 deep-sea fishing vessels had been launched with 43 more in various stages of construction. Marine Fisheries Bill As for the proposed Marine Fisheries Bill, Mr. Murugan termed the opposition to it “politically motivated”, and said the legislation would not “in any way affect our fishermen in any place”. It had been mooted in the absence of any law to regulate fishing activity taking place beyond 12 nautical miles from the shore. Up to 12 nm, the State laws were in place. “The new legislation will protect our fishermen if there is any [illegal] activity by a foreign fishing vessel,” Mr. Murugan said. As for the proposed penalty, he said the fishermen had to register themselves as part of the legislation, as otherwise there would be a fine of Rs. 1,000. “In fact, State laws in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have higher amounts of fine,” the Union Minister said. Regarding promotion of seaweed farming, he said Tamil Nadu would get a special economic park as a pilot project. The foundation stone for the park project was likely to be laid during the third week of November. Fisherwomen would be among the beneficiaries of this programme. The Kisan Credit Card would also be extended to the fisherfolk. Under the PMMSY, five fishing harbours would be modernised as per international standards and the idea was to encourage exports of fish products. Answering a question on the issues concerning administration of temples by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department in Tamil Nadu, the Union Minister urged the State government to implement the directions given by a Bench of the Madras High Court in this regard. He also wanted the government to ensure that income generated from temples be used for proper maintenance of the temples concerned.  Marine Fisheries Bill will protect our fishermen if there is any [illegal] activity by a foreign fishing vessel L.

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SKM calls for farmers’ protest on Oct. 12||Protesting farm unions have issued a call for farmers to gather again in strength at Tikonia in Uttar Pradesh on October 12, the “ antim ardaas ” day when the last rites would be conducted for the farmers who died at Lakhimpur Kheri last Sunday. From there, the ashes of the victims would be taken to all the districts of Uttar Pradesh, to the gurdwaras of Punjab, and to all the States, to spread the message that “the BJP government was terrorising farmers”, according to leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which held its general body meeting at the Singhu border on Friday. “There was immense anger not just that such an incident has happened, but that the government is protecting the accused for so long,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dakaunda faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), assessing the mood of those who attended the meeting. If the prime accused, Ashish Mishra, was not arrested and his father, Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra, not removed from the Union Council of Ministers by October 11, the SKM vowed to intensify its protest with a nationwide “rail roko ” between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on October 18, followed by a mahapanchayat in Lucknow on October 24 along the lines of the mass gathering in Muzaffarnagar last month. On Dasara, farm unions planned to burn effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. In a statement, the SKM rejected the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and the judicial inquiry set up by the Uttar Pradesh Government, noting that the Supreme Court had also said it was not satisfied. It also agreed with the court that an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) would not be a solution either, and “demanded an impartial investigation that will report directly to the Supreme Court”, welcoming the court’s order asking the police to keep all evidence intact. ‘Shaheed Kisan Diwas’ Declaring October 12 “Shaheed Kisan Diwas”, the platform of unions protesting against the three farm reform laws appealed to farmers across Uttar Pradesh and the country to make their way to Tikonia on that day. “There would have been at least 20,000 people gathered in Tikonia last Sunday. At that time, the anger could have sparked off a riot between Hindus and Punjabi Sikhs, who [the latter] are major landowners in the area, so [BKU leader] Rakesh Tikait played a key role in preventing that and dispersing the crowd,” said All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah, who was part of the SKM’s core committee, alleging a conspiracy to provoke communal violence by Mr. Mishra and other BJP leaders. “Now, a big crowd will build up again, but the leaders will ensure that the anger is channelled into peaceful protest,” he added, estimating that 15,000-20,000 people would gather. Senior Punjab farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said he was on his way to Lakhimpur Kheri on Friday, and other leaders planned to arrive over the weekend. Mr. Mollah and other leaders confirmed the plans for a “ kalash yatra ” to disperse the ashes of the victims across the country over 10 days. “We want the message to go out as far as possible that the BJP is now actively killing farmers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/skm-calls-for-farmers-to-gather-on-oct-12/article36908715.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supreme Court to conduct physical hearings twice a week||In a decisive step towards the pre-pandemic routine, the Supreme Court has made physical hearings the norm twice a week. “In view of the encouraging response from the Bar and with a view to further facilitate hearing through physical mode, all the matters listed on Wednesday and Thursday, as non-miscellaneous days, would be heard only in the physical presence of the counsel/parties in courtrooms,” a court circular said. The court released its modified standard operating procedure (SOP) after taking suggestions from the Bar and experts’ advice to make access to the courtrooms less cumbersome. Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana recently informed senior advocates that the court was working on striking a balance between lawyers’ access to courts and their safety and good health at the workplace. He had said the court was apprehensive about how crowded courtrooms would potentially expose lawyers and staff to infection. 15-minute break In the modified rules, the court stated that there would be a 15-minute break at the discretion of the Bench during physical hearings. The courtrooms have to be vacated during this interval in order to sanitise them. Lawyers would be called in for one case after the other. They could wait at the Bar lounges in the building for their cases to be called. This step had been added to avoid crowds in the corridors. Working capacity The court, however, added a rider to the physical hearings on non-miscellaneous days, saying a Bench could take a call to revert to virtual mode if it found that the number of lawyers in a particular case exceeded the working capacity of the courtroom as per the COVID-19 norms. The circular said cases listed on Tuesday, as a non-miscellaneous day, would also be heard in physical mode. However, on prior application by the advocate-on-record (AOR) for the party, appearance through video/tele-conferencing mode would also be facilitated. Cases on Mondays and Fridays, which are miscellaneous days, would continue to be heard virtually for the present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-hold-physical-hearings-twice-a-week/article36908729.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Twitter war strains ties between Cong. and Kishor||The Congress and election strategist Prashant Kishor’s public sparring over the grand old party’s (GOP) prospects of political revival triggered a war of words between Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and the Trinamool Congress. In a tweet, the Trinamool directly attacked former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi for his defeat in Amethi, without naming him. “Rich words coming from a first-time CM. Punching above your weight doesn’t bring honour to you, Mr. @bhupeshbaghel. What a shoddy attempt to please the high command! By the way, is @INCIndia going to try to erase the historical defeat at Amethi through yet another Twitter Trend?” the Trinamool said on Twitter. This was in response to Mr. Baghel’s tweet that said, “People looking for a ‘national’ alternative based on poaching INC [Indian National Congress] functionaries who can’t win even their own seats is in for a big disappointment. Unfortunately, to become a national alternative deep-rooted and concerted efforts are needed and there are no quick-fix solutions.” The Twitter war was first triggered by Mr. Kishor, who said those who were hoping for quick revival of the GOP on the basis of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident would be disappointed. Hitting back, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “It’s a grave sin if anyone views Lakhimpur Kheri in terms of political gain or loss. I wouldn’t like comment [on] a consultant’s remarks.” Mr. Baghel’s tweet and Mr. Surjewala’s comments were a direct response to Mr. Kishor’s tweet earlier in the day. “People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP led opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting themselves up for a big disappointment. Unfortunately there are no quick fix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of GOP,” Mr. Kishor had tweeted on Friday. His tweet is significant as it comes in the midst of speculation that the election strategist could be joining the Congress as part of the “GOP’s revival plan”. Mr. Kishor is now the principal political adviser to Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress. Though he didn’t name any leader in his tweet, the obvious reference is to the buzz that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s arrest in Sitapur, bordering Lakhimpur Kheri district, created in the media. But beyond the immediate context, Mr. Kishor’s tweet indicates a falling out with the Congress. Sources told The Hindu that the Congress was divided over his parallel induction as a general secretary and as a member of the Congress Working Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-and-kishors-relationship-turns-sour/article36908719.ece

The units include a fighter squadron, a helicopter unit and a surface-to-air nissile (SAM) squadron. “When I look at the security scenario we face today, I am acutely conscious that I have assumed command at a crucial time. We must demonstrate to the nation that external forces will not be allowed to violate our territory,” ACM Chaudhari said addressing the ranks at the Air Force Day parade. “Our efforts in completing all COVID-related tasks were also a major achievement in support of the national efforts,” he added. Coinciding with the celebrations of the 75th year of Independence, 75 aircraft and helicopters took part in the Air Force Day parade and fly-past with several formations showcasing some of the key air operations of the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh. The No. 47 Squadron, equipped with upgraded MiG-29 fighters, was deployed for a defence role after the Balakot air strike. It flew extensively and maintained a constant vigil to ensure that there were no misadventures by adversaries, the IAF said. The citation said, “In May 2020, the squadron was deployed for air defence as well as air-to-ground operations in the northern sector and carried out extensive operations at high altitude.” The squadron also undertook the first overseas deployment by a MiG-29 UPG aircraft when it participated in Exercise Eastern Bridge V with the Royal Oman Air Force, the citation said.The squadron was formed on December 18, 1959. The second unit citation went to the 116 Helicopter Unit, formed on August 1, 1967. It is now equipped with the the indigenous Advanced Light Helicopter Mark IV (ALH Mk IV) Rudra. After Balakot, the unit was deployed at the forward bases of the South Western Air Command Area of Responsibility (AOR) to counter threats of slow-moving aerial platforms, the citation said. Day and night operations In May 2020, after the Galwan skirmish, the unit was deployed for offensive operations at a high-altitude airfield in the Ladakh area. “The unit quickly established the first-ever high-altitude attack helicopter detachment in the region and executed day-and-night operations, including air to ground weapons delivery at high altitudes,” the citation read. The third unit citation was given to 2255 Squadron Detachment Air Force, a frontline OSA-AK-M, SAM-guided weapon squadron in the Kashmir AOR. “The squadron was mobilised for air defence activation in Ladakh in response to the Galwan stand-off in the last week of June 2020. Since then, the squadron has undertaken various innovations to sustain serviceability and reliability of its equipment,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prompt-action-proved-iafs-combat-readiness-iaf-chief/article36908734.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Subramanian to return to academics||Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian has decided to return to academia at the completion of his three-year tenure in early December. “Being provided the opportunity to contribute during a period of tremendous uncertainty and epochal change has been the lucky icing on the cake. So, while being conscious of the enormous privilege bestowed on me, I will happily return back to serving the country as a researcher after fulfilling my three-year commitment,” he said in a statement on Friday. An Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, and Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), Calcutta, alumnus, Mr. Subramanian was a Professor at the Indian School of Business before his appointment as the CEA in December 2018. The CEA’s post had been vacant at the time for a few months after his predecessor Arvind Subramanian left citing “personal reasons”. The CEA thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being a “keen listener” with an intuitive understanding of economic policy, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for allowing the Economic Surveys he presented to be free-spirited, and officials across Ministries for being receptive to his ideas by supporting as well as challenging them. “In close to three decades of my professional life, I am yet to encounter a more inspiring leader than the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji . His intuitive understanding of economic policy combines with an unmistakeable determination to use the same to elevate the lives of common citizens,” the CEA said about his experiences with the Prime Minister. “The momentous change in India’s economic thinking post the pandemic – inter alia embracing ethical wealth creation by empowering the private sector and economic recovery driven by government capital expenditure – bears testimony to his leadership. Alloyed with his keen listening, the freedom to speak one’s mind that he unstintingly encouraged enables such phenomenal change. On umpteen occasions, I have walked out inspired after a meeting with him – only a genuine leader can elicit such sentiment,” Mr. Subramanian noted. Terming Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman a “scholar at heart”, he said her “sense of humour and easy manner” play a critical role in enabling a healthy debate in North Block meetings “that is so essential amidst epochal change”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chief-economic-adviser-to-return-to-academics/article36908711.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Centre didn’t specifically ask for oxygen deaths data: Cong.||The war of words between the Opposition and the government continues on whether there were COVID-19 deaths due to oxygen shortage in the second wave of pandemic. Pursuing his privilege motion against Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar, Rajya Sabha member and Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal, in a letter to Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, pointed out that the Centre never “categorically asked the States for reporting COVID-19 deaths due to oxygen shortage”. Mr. Venugopal had moved a notice of breach of privilege against Ms. Pawar in July during the monsoon session on her written reply to a parliamentary question that there were “no deaths due to oxygen shortage reported by the States during the second wave of COVID-19”. In her response to Mr. Venugopal’s notice, Ms. Pawar, on September 10, in a letter to Mr. Naidu stated that she was “factually correct” and no “false statement had been laid on the table of the House”. Mr. Venugopal said Ms. Pawar’s response was “misleading” since the “Centre never categorically asked the States for reporting COVID-19 deaths due to oxygen shortage”. He also pointed out a comment by Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma that appeared in the media saying the same thing. The Minister, though, has said that MPs had relied on media reports as evidence and had not placed on record details of deaths reported by any State due to shortage of oxygen. “The Minister has claimed and refuted a serious breach of privilege on the pretext ‘that the Members of Parliament have relied on media reports as evidence’. However, the Minister has not refused the reports quoted,” Mr. Venugopal noted. The Minister, in her response, has said that the States were asked to send in reports according to globally accepted WHO and ICMR guidelines. But in her reply, she does not clearly answer the question on whether these guidelines also included questions on oxygen shortage. Hitting out at the government, Mr. Venugopal observed that instead of taking suo motu cognisance of the incidents, the Minister was “deliberating misleading” and was “convolutedly trying to find an alibi”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-didnt-specifically-ask-for-oxygen-deaths-data-cong/article36908736.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Govt. has failed to protect J&K people’||Condemning the incidents of violence in Jammu and Kashmir, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said terrorism had not stopped because of the removal of Article 370 or demonetisation. In a tweet, soon after two government teachers (a Sikh and a Pandit) were shot dead by militants in the Eidgah area of Srinagar, Mr. Gandhi charged the Union Government with failing to provide security to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “Incidents of violence are increasing in Kashmir. Terrorism has neither stopped due to demonetisation nor after the removal of Article 370. The Central Government has completely failed to provide security,” Mr. Gandhi said in a tweet. “We strongly condemn the attacks on our Kashmiri brothers and sisters,” he added . The killing of the teachers took the number of civilians shot dead in the last five days in the Kashmir Valley to seven, including four from the minorities. On Tuesday, the Kashmir Valley witnessed three targeted civilian killings in 90 minutes, which included a prominent Kashmiri Pandit businessman Makhan Lal Bindroo, who owned a well-known pharmacy in Srinagar, and a golgappa and bhelpuri seller from Bihar. “The Modi government garners votes by promising to protect the Kashmiri Pandits, but has failed to provide them security. When will the pseudo-nationalist BJP government be able to control Pakistan-backed extremism?” asked Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-has-failed-to-protect-jk-people/article36908700.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||31 selected for lateral entry posts||The Centre on Friday recommended 31 candidates from private sector and public sector undertakings for appointment at senior and mid-level positions in various Union Ministries under the “lateral entry” programme on a “contract basis”. The most number of such appointments — six — are to the Ministry of Finance. Reservation or caste-based quotas do not apply to these recruitments. As per norms, the posts of Joint Secretary, Director, and Deputy Secretary are filled by officers belonging to the All India Service ‘Group A’ services, which includes the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Indian Police Service (IPS) and the Indian Revenue Service (IRS). A Joint Secretary is the third highest ranking officer in the government. A press statement issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoP&T) said that it had requested the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) “to select suitable persons to join the Government at the level of Joint Secretary/ Director/ Deputy Secretary in various Ministries/ Departments of the Government of India on contract/deputation basis.” The request was made on December 12, 2020 and February 12, 2021. The UPSC launched online recruitment applications in February and March. “In response, a total of 295 applications for Joint Secretary, 1,247 applications for Director, and 489 applications for Deputy Secretary posts were received,” the DoPT said. Based on the online application forms, the UPSC shortlisted 231 candidates for the interviews. The interviews were conducted from September 27 to October 8, and 31 candidates were recommended. The last such appointments were made in 2019, when nine candidates were selected.

Mr. Ajay told presspersons in Lucknow that Mr. Ashish, alias Monu, did not go to the police as he was unwell. Responding to questions on whether his son was absconding, Mr. Ajay said Mr. Ashish had not gone anywhere, but was in their Shahpur Kothi residence. The Union Minister said his son would report to the police on the next date given by them. Mr. Ajay also said Mr. Ashish had informed the police that he was willing to provide them with evidence and his statement. New notice Police in Lakhimpur Kheri pasted a new notice outside the Mishras’ residence summoning Mr. Ashish to appear at the Crime Branch office in Police Lines at 11 a.m. on Saturday. Legal action would be taken if he did not turn up, said the notice. The Uttar Pradesh police had on Thursday arrested two persons and issued summons to Mr. Ashish for questioning in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed. Amid demands for Mr. Ashish’s arrest in the murder case, the police issued him summons to appear at the Reserve Police Lines in Lakhimpur Kheri at 10 a.m. on Friday. Mr. Ajay maintained that his son was not at the site of the incident or in any of the cars that mowed down the farmers. Mr. Ashish was in their ancestral village, Banveerpur, attending the annual wrestling event organised by their family, said the Union Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ashish-skips-police-questioning-union-minister-says-he-is-unwell/article36908713.ece
09 October 2021||Srinagar,||Fresh militant recruits had role in targeted killings: police||The J&K police suspect that more than three fresh militant recruits may have carried out the recent targeted killings of seven civilians, including the Principal and a teacher of a government school, in the past one week, in the capital and in Bandipora. Sources said the police were also investigating reports that the militants segregated teachers on the basis of their religion at the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Iddgah Sangam, before killing the Principal and the teacher from minority communities. Initial police investigation suggested the militants, just two or three of them, walked into the premises of the school, headed for the room of the Principal, and confiscated the mobile phones of the staff members before segregating them. “In all such cases, terrorists have been using pistols. These acts are committed by newly recruited militants or those who are about to join the militant ranks,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Mr. Kumar said the police were working hard to identify “part-time, hybrid militants”. “We have received several leads and are working on it. We appeal to the general public, especially minority communities, not to panic,” he added. Meanwhile, security has been beefed up outside business establishments owned by minority community members and areas in which non-local labourers stay in the Valley “as a precautionary measure”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fresh-militant-recruits-had-role-in-targeted-killings-police/article36908697.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Low attendance in parliamentary panel meets’||Reacting to The Hindu ’s report on the delay in the formation of Parliamentary Standing Committees (PSC), in a clarification, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs has attacked the Opposition for its low attendance in the meetings, specifically pointing at the Trinamool Congress. The Ministry in a statement here said the “15-day delay was due to the discussions that were going on whether to nominate MPs who have not attended even one meeting of the Committees in the previous term and also whether they should be re-nominated to the same Committees”. Specifically, pointing out the Trinamool’s dismal record in participation in the PSCs, the Ministry said the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, had only attended two of the 27 meetings of the Committee of Transport, Tourism and Culture, of which he is a member. Mr. O’Brien headed this committee in the last Lok Sabha and in 2019, based on the Trinamool’s reduced strength, the party was given only one committee to chair — Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution. The Ministry said: “This is a very dismal performance of a leader of his [Mr. O’Brien’s] stature. Further, AITC’s (Trinamool) Deputy Leader and Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha and 2 other members of AITC attended no sittings of DRSCs [Department-related Standing Committee] during 2020-21. Furthermore, average attendance of AITC Members in committee meetings is approximately 23%. This shows their seriousness towards Parliament and its instruments.” The Ministry’s statement said: “AITC leader in Rajya Sabha says delay in constitution of committees is subversion of democracy. When the parliament is in session you don’t allow it to function. When committee meetings are held you and your Members do not attend committee meetings. Isn’t that a subversion of democracy? How can you now take to Twitter to criticise the government.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/low-attendance-in-parliamentary-panel-meets-ministry/article36908716.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Rajnath, Lalu pay tribute to Paswan||On the first death anniversary of former Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) patriarch Lalu Prasad and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi paid their tributes at 12 Janpath here on Friday. Mr. Singh’s visit assumes significance in the context of the recent split in the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) into factions supported by Ram Vilas’s son, Chirag Paswan, and his brother, Pashupati Nath Paras. Since the split, the lingering question was whether Mr. Paswan was part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) or not. The Janata Dal (United), the NDA’s ally in Bihar, had been insistent on not allowing Mr. Paswan in any of the NDA deliberations as he had fought the Bihar Assembly election alone and against the JD(U). Mr. Yadav’s visit was equally important as the RJD patriarch had on several occasions called Mr. Paswan to join the RJD-led ‘Mahagathbandhan’ against the BJP-JD(U) alliance. Mr. Paras, meanwhile, had organised another function to mark the first death anniversary of his brother in Patna. The function was attended by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav. Also present was senior BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajnath-lalu-pay-tribute-to-paswan/article36908717.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Modi, Kishida commit to strengthening relations||Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to new Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday evening, in their first conversation since the latter took charge this week, committing to strengthen bilateral relations and opposing the use of military and economic force in the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad with the U.S. and Australia. “The leaders discussed the increasing alignment of perspectives, and robust cooperation, between India and Japan in the Indo-Pacific region. They reviewed the progress of cooperation under the Quad framework in this regard,” said a Ministry of External Affairs statement, which gave details of the talks that lasted about 25 minutes. It stated that Mr. Modi invited Mr. Kishida to visit India for a summit. A statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted, “Both leaders shared their strong opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force and to economic coercion, while confirming that the two countries would deepen cooperation on economic security such as through resilience of supply chains”. The statements are significant as tensions have been rising in the South China Sea over a record number of Chinese jets being flown into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the past week, after recent military exercises involving the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and other allies in the region. On Tuesday, Mr. Kishida, who was earlier known for a moderate foreign policy line and now taken a tough posture on countering China, spoke to President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Mr. Modi and Mr. Kishida discussed plans for celebrating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations next year, and promote cooperation on “green technology, digital, healthcare, enhancing connectivity”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-kishida-commit-to-strengthening-relations/article36908702.ece

The latter said a notice had been issued to Mr. Ashish, asking him to appear before the police by 11 a.m. “tomorrow”. “If the person does not come, the rigour of law will take its course,” he assured. The CJI asked sharply,“Is it the same way you treat other accused too? Like sending notices, etc.” Mr. Salve said he was instructed by the State that the postmortem report on the victim did not show bullet injuries. “That is why notice was issued. If the allegations are true, it is certainly a Section 302 IPC [murder] case,” he stated. After conferring for a moment, the CJI addressed Mr. Salve, “This is the opinion of the Bench... As a responsible State government with a system and police, when there is a serious allegation of death or gunshot injury, will any other accused in this country be treated the same way?” The senior lawyer urged the court to give some more time to the State to repair the shortfalls in the investigation. He said everything would fall in place in a day or two. He would talk to the Home Secretary and the DGP. He said the court could list the case immediately on reopening after the Dussehra holidays. The Bench posted the case for October 20 as the first item on the list. TV channel’s claim The hearing witnessed a lawyer inform the Bench about a tweet by a TV channel that the CJI visited the Lakhimpur Kheri violence victims on Thursday. The CJI, however, brushed the remark aside, saying, “I was sitting in court and hearing cases.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-dissatisfied-with-ups-status-report/article36908708.ece

Sanjay Tickoo, who heads the Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti (KPSS), a body representing the voices of those who did not migrate from the Valley in the 1990s, said, “Neither those who stayed back since the 1990s or those who returned to the Valley are feeling secure.” Hundreds of Sikhs, including the relatives of the deceased principal Supinder Kaur, carried the mortal remains on a stretcher and marched on the city’s streets for swift action against the perpetrators of the crime. They also held a sit-in in front of the Civil Secretariat in Srinagar. Jammu and Kahmir’s regional parties made a collective appeal to the Pandits not to consider migration. The BJP and several Jammu-based parties also organised street protests against the killings in Jammu and demanded protection for the minorities. National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah, who visited the victim’s family, said, “We can’t let the perpetrators of these terror attacks succeed in their evil designs. The overwhelmingly majority of us don’t want you to go. It is our prime responsibility, especially of the majority community, of the Valley to safeguard the lives of minorities.” Gupkar alliance meets Meanwhile, NC president Farooq Abdullah chaired a meeting of the Gupkar alliance, an amalgam of regional parties, which was attended by Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti too. Gupkar alliance spokesman M.Y. Tarigami said the onus to create a conducive security environment lay with the Centre. “We as responsible political parties will play our role to reduce the levels of suspicion and fear,” he said. Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also condemned the killings. He reiterated that the Hurriyat was for “a just resolution through peaceful means of the Kashmir conflict”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panic-stricken-pandits-go-on-leave-in-valley/article36908709.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC flags consequences of growing digital divide||The digital divide caused by online classes will defeat the fundamental right of every child to education, the Supreme Court warned on Friday. The court rued how the right to education now hinged on who could afford “gadgets” for online classes and who could not. Little children whose parents are too poor to afford laptops, tablets or an “optimum” Internet package at home for online classes during the pandemic have dropped out of school and even run the danger of being drawn into child labour or worse, child trafficking, the court said. “During the course of the pandemic, as schools increasingly turned to online education to avoid exposing the young children to the pandemic, the digital divide produced stark consequences… Children belonging to the Economically Weaker Sections [EWS]/Disadvantaged Groups [DG] had to suffer the consequence of not having to fully pursue their education or worse still drop out because of the lack of access to Internet and computers,” a three-judge Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B.V. Nagarathna noted in an order. ‘Give access to facilities’ The court said even though schools are now reopening gradually due to the receding curve of the pandemic, the “need to provide adequate computer-based equipment together with access to online facilities for children is of utmost importance”. “The needs of young children who represent the future of the nation cannot simply be ignored in this manner. A solution has to be devised at all levels of the Government, State and Centre, to ensure that adequate facilities are made available to children across social strata so that access to education is not denied to those who lack resources. Otherwise the whole purpose of the Right to Education Act, enabling the merging of EWS students with the mainstream students even in unaided schools will stand defeated,” the court noted. The court held that Article 21A (the right to free and compulsory education for children aged between six and 14) has to be a reality. “The need for underprivileged children to access online education cannot be denied,” the Supreme Court underscored in the order. The court was hearing a petition filed by private school managements challenging a Delhi High Court order of September 2020, directing them to provide their 25% quota EWS/DG students online facilities free of cost. The High Court had said the schools could get reimbursement from the government. The Delhi government had earlier appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court order, saying it had no resources to reimburse the schools for the online gadgets. Though the Supreme Court had stayed the High Court order in February 2021, the Bench led by Justice Chandrachud said both the Centre and the States such as Delhi could not bow out of their responsibilities towards young children. ‘Hold consultation’ The Bench asked the Delhi government to come out with a plan to effectuate the ‘salutary object’ upheld in the High Court decision. The court said the Centre should join in the consultation. “The issues raised in the present proceedings will not only cover the unaided schools, but also government and aided schools,” the court noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-flags-consequences-of-growing-digital-divide/article36908727.ece

When adjusted against non-core assets such as land and buildings worth Rs. 14,718 crore that will also be parked in the SPV and the cash amount of Rs. 2,700 crore from Tatas, the net liability on the government comes to Rs. 28,844 crore. “The taxpayers have put in Rs. 1,10,277 crore in Air India since 2009-10, which includes Rs. 54,584 crore cash support and Rs. 55,692 crore as guarantee support for loans,” Mr. Pandey said. There are no underlying assets as such. This is all loss being funded through the debt guaranteed by the government. AI has a loss of Rs. 20 crore a day,” Mr. Pandey explained the government’s decision to sell the airline for Rs. 18,000 crore. “The government has addressed all the concerns of employees.

However, the effectiveness of these protocols has now come into question after the stand-off in eastern Ladakh last year following ingress by Chinese troops into Indian territory at multiple locations, which is still under way. Last week, during a visit to the forward areas of eastern Ladakh, Army chief Gen. Manoj Naravane expressed the confidence that through talks, the two sides would be able to reach a consensus on how disengagement could take place and all the friction points got resolved. At the same time, he said that China had deployed troops in considerable numbers all across eastern Ladakh and northern fronts right up to the Eastern Command. “Definitely, there has been an increase in their deployment in the forward areas, which remains a matter of concern for us,”he noted, adding that India was well poised to meet “any eventuality.” The Chinese have been undertaking such transgressions along the LAC. In August, over 100 Chinese troops transgressed 4-5 km into Indian territory at Barahoti in Uttarakhand and returned after few hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-patrols-face-off-in-tawang/article36908692.ece

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Air quality panel expects reduced stubble burning||A reduction in the area under paddy cultivation in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, as well as a shift away from paddy varieties that take long to mature, could see a reduction in stubble burning this year, the Centre-constituted Commission for Air Quality Management said in a statement on Friday. The total paddy area in Haryana, Punjab and the eight NCR (National Capital Region) districts of Uttar Pradesh has reduced by 7.72% during the current year as compared to last year. Similarly, total paddy straw generation from the non-basmati variety of rice is likely to be reduced by 12.42% during the current year as compared to the previous year. It’s the non-basmati variety of rice, whose stalk remains, that is usually burnt off by farmers ahead of sowing wheat. The Commission said: “Both Central and State Governments of Haryana, Punjab and U.P. have been taking measures to diversify crops as well as to reduce the use of PUSA-44 variety of paddy. Burning of paddy straw from the non-basmati variety of crops is the prime concern. Crop diversification and moving away from PUSA-44 variety with short duration High Yielding Varieties are part of the framework and action plan for control of stubble burning.” Data from Haryana, Punjab and U.P. suggests total paddy straw generation is likely to come down by 1.31 million tonnes (from 20.05 million tonnes in 2020 to 18.74 million tonnes in 2021) in Punjab; by 0.8 million tonnes (from 7.6 million tonnes in 2020 to 6.8 million tonnes in 2021) in Haryana; and by 0.09 million tonnes (from 0.75 million tonnes in 2020 to 0.67 million tonnes in 2021) in the eight NCR districts of U.P. this year. The total quantity of straw generated by the respective States was 28.4 million tonnes in 2020, which is now expected to come down to 26.21 million tonnes in 2021.

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana , the Sena said the Union Government had flagrantly misused agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the I-T Department and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a bid to defame the MVA leadership. On Thursday, I-T authorities raided several businesses and offices, including sugar factories in Pune, Satara, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar and Kolhapur among other places in Maharashtra.

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hybrid sessions can’t be forever: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday prima facie did not approve of hybrid court hearings, which is a combination of physical and virtual mode of court proceedings, as a permanent feature. A hybrid system would see only a few lawyers come to court. A Bench led by Justices L. Nageswara Rao and B.R. Gavai said hybrid options would have lawyers argue from exotic spots around the world while judges sit in courtrooms. “We want courts to be opened up to the public... For the past two months we have made physical hearings optional and we have not seen one advocate in court on most of the days. Given an option, people are very comfortable in their offices,” Justice Rao said. The court was hearing a plea filed by the National Federation of Societies For Fast Justice to retain the hybrid option . The court has however issued notice in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hybrid-hearings-cant-be-forever-sc/article36908725.ece

Along with him, five other men arrested in the case too were sent to the same jail. Two women, including model Munmun Dhamecha, were sent to Byculla women’s prison, a police official said. They are likely to spend the weekend in the quarantine cells of the two prisons as the Sessions Court, where they will need to file appeal for bail, would not be working on October 9, the second Saturday of the month, police sources said. The Narcotics Control Bureau has arrested 18 persons so far after raiding a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and allegedly recovering narcotic drugs. Incidentally, the court’s order rejecting bail to Aryan Khan came on his mother Gauri Khan’s 51st birthday. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, appearing for the NCB, opposed the bail pleas, arguing that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to hear the applications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-denies-bail-to-aryan-two-others/article36908693.ece

09 October 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan Cong. puts up united face||Putting up a united face ahead of by-elections to two Assembly seats, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot travelled together in a helicopter and addressed rallies at Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad after the Congress candidates filed their nomination papers on Friday. AICC general secretary Ajay Maken and Pradesh Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra flew with the two leaders, who have been at loggerheads for more than a year over a power sharing arrangement in the State. Mr. Maken later posted a picture of the Congress leaders sitting inside the helicopter on his twitter account, tagging both Mr. Gehlot and Mr. Pilot. The two leaders, leading rival camps in the State Congress, travelled together barely a week after Mr. Gehlot sent across a sharp message to his opponents by affirming that he was going to stay in politics for the next 15 to 20 years. On Thursday, Mr. Pilot said at a function in Jaipur, that he would be active for 50 years. Tonk MLA Mr. Pilot drove the car from the helipad at Vallabhnagar to the venue of the election rally, with the Chief Minister accompanying him on the front seat. While Mr. Gehlot has put at rest all speculations about a change of guard in Rajasthan after the turmoil in Punjab, the focus on ensuring Congress' victory in the bypolls has indicated that the internal strife in the party might have reduced. Party candidates Preeti Shaktawat in Udaipur's Vallabhnagar and Nagraj Meena in Pratapgarh's Dhariawad filed their nominations before the rallies started. Speakers at the rallies sought to convey a message that the party was not only united, but also capable of taking on the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-cong-puts-up-united-face/article36908952.ece

09 October 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Girl killed as rider tries to avoid pothole||A teenager was mowed down by a truck after she fell off the scooter she was riding pillion on when the rider swerved to avoid a large pothole on the road. The tragic accident took place on the outskirts of the city on Magadi Road on Friday morning. Nubiya, 17, was returning to her home in Goripalya from Tavarekere with two relatives – Ahran, 21, who was riding the scooter and her younger sister Afreen, 15, when the accident occurred. They were riding triple. They were near Chikkagollarahatti, where the width of Magadi Road reduces to only 16 feet, and so Ahran is likely to have taken a sudden sharp right turn to avoid a pothole. The rear-end of the scooter touched a lorry behind them causing Ahran to lose his balance. All three fell off the scooter. Ahran and Afreen fell to their left, while Nubiya fell to her right and came under the wheels of the lorry. She died on the spot. This is the second accident in less than three days on the same road as the result of motorists trying to avoid potholes. On October 6, Wednesday night, Krishnappa, 57, a sub-inspector with Excise Department was killed in an accident when he tried to navigate a pothole, and came under the wheels of a lorry. “That stretch of road is already very narrow but sees a heavy volume of traffic every day. A project to widen the stretch into a four lane highway has been pending for a long time now,” said Jagadeesh, Dy.SP, Nelamnagala. The condition of the road is a safety hazard, with potholes full of water due to the recent spate of rains. “In both accidents, the two-wheeler riders were either trying to avoid or navigate a pothole,” said Mr. Jagadeesh. The Madanayakanahalli police have now registered a case under Section 304A of IPC for death due to negligence against the lorry driver, concerned officials of Public Works Department and Machohalli Gram Panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/girl-killed-as-rider-tries-to-avoid-pothole/article36908738.ece

Stalin on Friday inspected the Chennai Central Square, which is coming up in front of the central railway station at a cost of Rs. 389 crore. Once the project is completed, commuters will be able to switch over from one mode of transport to another as this square aims to connect Metro Rail, MRTS, suburban trains and buses as well. Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) has finished some landscaping work in this space and has begun the construction of a three-level underground car parking facility with a capacity to house 1,500 vehicles. In addition, two buildings will be developed and handed over to a firm for commercial establishments like retail outlets or to be leased out as office space. Mr. Stalin inspected the facilities and instructed teams to complete the work at the earliest. Two more subways were being constructed on Poonamalleee High Road and the idea was to provide easy access to all major buildings such as the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Ripon Buildings, Madras Medical College and Puraitchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Chennai Central Railway Station. The Chief Minister also visited the Kathipara Square which has been built at a cost of Rs. 14 crore with a walkway, children’s play area and retail outlets. While lanscaping work is over, CMRL plans to identify clients to set up food stalls and kiosks and has floated tender for the work. Mr. Stalin then oversaw the phase II construction work of Thelliagaram Chennai Metro Rail station coming up near Sri Ramachandra Medical College, Porur, and told the officials that the work should be completed on time, without causing any traffic congestion or hassles to commuters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-inspects-metro-work-at-major-junctions-in-chennai/article36908865.ece

09 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Kakkalur Industrial Estate cries for attention||The Kakkalur Industrial Estate at Tiruvallur, one of the oldest in Tamil Nadu, is beset with infrastructure issues. The main problem is an open canal flowing through the estate. It was meant to transport excess water from the Putlur lake to the Thanneerkulam lake. But the water overflowing from the Tiruvallur sewage treatment plant is diverted through it. As the water does not flow through, it gets stagnated. “When it rains, the sewage gets mixed with the rainwater. The contaminated water is being blocked by the locals from running into the Thanneerkulam lake. This causes flooding of units near the outlet,” said K. Baskaran, secretary of the Kakkalur Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association (KIEMA). This has been the situation for the past few years. On a few occasions, equipment has been damaged and production has been lost. “Failure to address this issue immediately will lead to the closure of 30-40 units this rainy season,” he said. The industrial estate has around 522 micro, small and medium units, of which 234 are operating. “Some units have closed temporarily after the outbreak of COVID-19, while some others have wound up business. The rest have moved to other locations,” Mr. Baskaran said. Garbage dumping is another long-standing problem. All the garbage from the Kakkalur panchayat is being dumped on the SIDCO premises and burnt. The electricity transmission lines (33 KVA and 110 KVA) to the Kakkalur sub-station are criss-crossing the area where garbage is burnt. The smoke could damage these high-voltage lines. A letter from KIEMA president N. Subramanian pointed out that representations had been made to the branch manager, SIDCO, Kakkalur, but the issue is yet to be resolved. The main access roads to the estate are also in bad shape. And proper lighting is needed at all the important junctions. The KIEMA office-bearers and those operating out of this estate have requested the government to look into these issues immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kakkalur-industrial-estate-hit-by-infra-woes/article36908901.ece

09 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N.’s seroprevalence is 70%||A re-survey of the third serosurvey has put Tamil Nadu’s overall seroprevalence at 70%. Of the 37 districts, Virudhunagar, Tenkasi and Chennai have over 80% seropositivity, while Perambalur, Ariyalur, the Nilgiris and Karur have seropositivity of less than 60%. The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine had taken up the State-wide Cross Sectional Serosurvey-Phase III during July-August 2021. A total of 827 clusters were included, with 24,586 samples covered. Among them, 17,090 individuals had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is causing COVID-19. The findings that were first released on July 31 put the overall seroprevalence — the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 — at 66.2%. On Thursday, the Directorate released the findings of a re-survey. “Five districts in each upper/lower limit are resurveyed as a measure of reconfirmation. Our results are in confirmation with the latest Indian Council of Medical Research survey,” said T. S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. The seropositivity of Virudhunagar, which remained on top of the chart, rose from 84% to 88% following the re-survey. Tenkasi came in second with a seroprevalence of 83%, which was previously 78%. Chennai’s seropositivity remained unchanged at 82%. Madurai and Theni had a seropositivity of 79% and 76% respectively. In fact, the seroprevalence went up in some western districts that previously had the lowest levels. The seropositivity of Erode, which earlier found itself at the bottom of the table with 37%, rose to 70%, while Coimbatore had 71% (previously 43%) and Tiruppur had 70% (previously 46%). Officials attributed the increase to the exposure to infection and the ramping up of vaccination. Four districts reported a seropositivity of less than 60% — Perambalur (58%), Ariyalur (56%), the Nilgiris (55%) and Karur (51%). “We are moving towards a safer zone. The ongoing rapid vaccination through mega camps is helping us in moving fast,” Dr. Selvavinayagam said. Earlier, the State-wide serosurveys conducted by the Directorate found a seropositivity of 32% during October/November 2020 and 29% in April 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tns-seroprevalence-is-70/article36909326.ece

09 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Suspended special DGP moves HC to quash ICC proceedings||Suspended Special Director-General of Police Rajesh Das has moved the Madras High Court challenging the inquiry conducted against him by an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) on a complaint of sexual harassment lodged by a woman Indian Police Service (IPS) officer in February this year. In his writ petition, the suspended officer accused a member of the ICC of being biased against him and alleged that principles of natural justice were not followed scrupulously before the committee concluded the inquiry and submitted its report to the State government on April 8. He urged the court to quash all proceedings that had been conducted so far by the ICC and order a proper inquiry by following due process of law in accordance with the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013. The petitioner said the woman officer had lodged her first complaint on February 22 and it led to the constitution of the ICC headed by Additional Chief Secretary Jayashree Raghunandan. The ICC comprised five others, including Additional Director-General of Police Seema Agarwal and Inspector-General of Police A. Arun. On February 27, the petitioner claimed to have made a representation to the Home Secretary and requested to remove Ms. Agarwal and Mr. Arun from the committee on the ground that they were biased against him. Nevertheless, the ICC began inquiring into the issue even before his representation could be considered, he said. It was much later that he came to know that the government had removed Mr. Arun alone from the ICC and replaced him with K. Joshi Nirmal Kumar. However, Ms. Agarwal continued in the committee which did not even furnish copies of statements made by the witnesses to him, the petitioner complained. The suspended Special DGP claimed that most of the witnesses were subordinates to the complainant and therefore he had requested to transfer her so that the witnesses could depose freely. However, his request was not adhered to and the committee went ahead with the proceedings, he said. Further, submitting that the committee’s report had led to issuance of a charge memo to him on May 31, the petitioner said even the ICC’s report was not served on him. “As such the entire proceedings are vitiated and the entire proceedings of the third respondent (ICC) are liable to be struck down,” his affidavit read.  The principles of natural justice were not followed scrupulously before the committee concluded the inquiry and submitted its report to the State government on April 8Rajesh Das||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suspended-special-dgp-moves-hc-to-quash-icc-proceedings/article36908878.ece

The aim is to encourage volunteer chapters across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/liver-awareness-campaign-launched/article36908876.ece
09 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea to publicise new draft guidelines for universal accessibility||The Madras High Court on Friday directed the Centre to respond to a public interest litigation petition which insisted upon giving wide publicity to the draft ‘Harmonised guidelines and standards for universal accessibility in India, 2021’ so that people could express their views on creating a disabled-friendly environment by providing easy access to public spaces. Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup said they were of the view that the prayer sought by the petitioner required to be considered. However, before taking a final decision, they ordered notice to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and said the officials concerned must furnish written instructions to a Central Government standing counsel by October 21. Vaishnavi Jayakumar, a cross disability rights advocate living with psychosocial disability, and also the co-founder of The Banyan, had filed the PIL petition. She pointed out that the Central Public Works Department, falling under the Union Urban Affairs Ministry, had published the draft guidelines on its website and called for public comments on or before August 27 by e-mail. Stating that it was not known as to when the draft guidelines were uploaded, she said even she came to know about them only during a conversation with an accessibility expert in September. She said the draft had not been publicised well, and therefore, people had no means to know about the draft guidelines and participate in the process. Pointing out that the draft guidelines run to 317 pages, the petitioner said sufficient time ought to have been given for soliciting public comments and the document ought to have been screen reader- or assistive technology-friendly so that the visually challenged could read them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-publicise-new-draft-guidelines-for-universal-accessibility/article36908898.ece

Sameeran said here on Friday. At a consultation meeting on the Master Plan, the Collector said the plan document would look at requirements of Coimbatore in 2031 and 2041. The plan should reflect the aspirations of the industry and the growth of different sectors. The development of the urban conglomeration should be in the right way. The vision is to develop Coimbatore to be the economic capital of the State or even south India, he said. He told The Hindu that following the first consultative meeting held on Friday, committees would be formed for every sector and there would be a panel of urban planners too. Meetings would be held regularly to incorporate suggestions from all sectors. “This will not be just a land use document. It will be a holistic plan looking at the requirements of Coimbatore for the next 30 years,” he said. At present, the proposals were based on the suggestions from different stakeholders. These would be studied and finalised. At a presentation made on the proposed Master Plan, it was pointed out that the Coimbatore’s strengths were its industries and institutions and its weaknesses were depleting ground water level and poor services in the fringe areas. The opportunities lay in sectors such as renewable energy and tourism. It would be a holistic plan that would cover areas such as transport, agriculture, education, etc. Coimbatore is expected to come under the large town category by 2031. The draft Plan envisions setting up of a logistics park on 45 acres, a cricket stadium and explore the possibility of developing satellite towns.

Forest Minister K. Ramachandran told The Hindu on Friday that a government order was ready to award compensation to people whose applications for the relief were pending for long. According to the Minister, 2,901 applications were pending, a majority of which were not cleared by the AIADMK government. A sum of Rs. 5.68 crore was required to pay compensation to the affected people. The Minister said 337 people had lost their lives in attacks by wild animals in the last five years in the State. “The AIADMK government did not give full compensation for many of these deaths...No application for solatium [for deaths] is pending after the DMK came to power.” Addressing Forest Department staff and various stakeholders at the concluding ceremony of the Wildlife Week celebrations at the Tamil Nadu Forest Academy in Coimbatore, he said the DMK government was determined to prevent incidents of human-animal interactions. The Minister pointed out that wild animals would not stray if the forests were healthy. The Forest Department found that the natural vegetation in forests had been affected by invasive plants which were introduced by the Westerners. To address the issue, it would launch a project this year for the rejuvenation of forests by removing invasive plants. Native plant species would be reintroduced. Mr. Ramachandran stressed that forest protection was essential to handle issues such as human-animal interactions and ozone depletion. “If we protect forests, they will naturally stabilise the environment... The government is on a mission to increase the forest cover from 23.98% to 33% in the next 10 years.” To tackle human-animal interactions, the Forest Department had increased the strength of frontline staff, he said. It would also revive the village forest committees as they would get early information on wild animals straying from forests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-comes-up-with-relief-package-for-damage-caused-by-wild-animals/article36908905.ece

Swaminathan was pending for a long time and wanted the government to expedite the issue pending against him for his alleged corruption at the Bharathiar University, Coimbatore when he was the V-C. “Such actions will be a lesson to present V-C and also those who serve in higher education”, it said. Another resolution wanted the Bharathiar University V-C to conduct the meetings of the statutory bodies as per the provisions of the statutes and Act of the university and also conduct elections to the Syndicate from principals, teachers and senate as the vacancies remain for a long period. The AUT urged the university V-C to take immediate steps to fill up the statutory post of Registrar, Controller of Examination, Dean and Director of Distance Education which remain vacant for more than four years. The AUT appealed to the government to interfere and establish the PG Extension Centre of Bharathiar University at Chikkaiah Naicker College (CNC), Erode. “Since it is a government college now and the infrastructure is already in place, the university can save the expenditure on the investments,” a resolution said. The AUT also wanted the government to expedite the process of declaring CNC as a government college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aut-backs-action-taken-against-v-c/article36909038.ece
09 October 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Vegetable traders seek election to market assn.||Urging the district administration and the corporation to take steps to conduct elections to Nethaji Daily Vegetable Market Association, a section of traders closed their shops and submitted a petition to the administration here on Friday. The association has 807 members who run the shops at the market that functions on V.O.C. Ground premises. Traders said that election should be conducted once in three years to elect office-bearers for various posts of the association. But, election was last held in 2014 and the tenure of office-bearers was extended twice. Though elections should have been conducted in 2019, due to COVID-19 elections were not conducted in the last two years, they added. A section of traders said that the office-bearers had collected Rs. 70,000 from traders for purchasing house site plots and wanted it to be completed before the election was held. But, another section of traders wanted elections to be held at the earliest. On Friday, around 300 shops remained closed while other traders carried out their business as usual. Traders wanted the election to be held so that their grievances related to collection of toll by contractors, house site pattas and issues related to allocation of shops in the new market premises on R.K.V. Road could be settled. Police personnel were posted on the market premises to prevent untoward incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vegetable-traders-seek-election-to-market-assn/article36909032.ece

09 October 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||Kelavarapalli dam receives effluent-mixed water||This week, Kelavarapalli dam received a steady rise in the inflow of water from across the border due to the heavy rains in Karnataka. The water was a foamy mix indicating that industrial effluents were being washed down the Thenpennai river and into the dam from the across the border following rain. On Friday, the water level in the dam was 41.33 ft out of the total storage capacity of 44.28 ft. The inflow into the dam was 760 cusecs, while the outflow into Thenpennai river from the dam was 820 ft. Industrial units Each year, the heavy rain washed down some environmental concerns along with the increased inflow into the dam. Each year, the dam witnessed routine spells of inflow of frothy mix of water, which the farmers dependent on the dam water for irrigation claimed was a result of industrial pollutants from units dotting the outskirts of the city along the waterways. Study conducted A few months ago, a team of analysts from the Pollution Control Board had drawn samples of Kelavarapalli dam water in compliance with the National Green Tribunal order to look into the matter. According to the Collector V. Jayachandra Bhanu Reddy, the chemical analysis of the sample indicated that the frothy water was a result of untreated sewerage that got washed down the river from Karnataka and into the dam. “Whenever the untreated sewage got mixed with water, it affected the surface tension of water, causing a build-up of surface foam,” explained Dr. Reddy. The findings have since been tabled before the NGT, says the Collector. To a query if the untreated sewage water mixed in the inflow into the dam would affect the farmlands dependent on the water for irrigation, the Collector said, "the impact on farmlands had not been studied or analysed". Asked if the issue was taken up with the authorities across the border in Karnataka, Dr. Reddy said, “we believe they are already aware of it. Treatment plants are coming up on their side, but how many, how exactly are they coming up, with regard to all this, we have sought their response.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kelavarapalli-dam-receives-effluent-mixed-water/article36909034.ece

A native of Kannur in Kerala, she achieved the Guinness record for singing in most languages at an event held at the Indian Consulate in Dubai on August 19. She received the certificate and citations in Dubai on Thursday. While her singing talent was identified by her parents T.C. Satish, a dermatologist, and Ayilliath Sumitha at the age of three, her passion for languages came naturally to her after listening to a Japanese song rendered by a guest at her home. She quickly browsed through websites to learn the lyrics, and within a few hours, she sung the entire song, recorded and forwarded it to the guest. The guest was stunned as Suchetha sung flawlessly. That was enough to trigger the 10-year-old to learn songs in various languages. Speaking to The Hindu from Dubai, Ms. Suchetha termed her achievement as God’s gift. “Whenever I listen to these songs, the music, the words, and the exact diction just sink into my mind,” says Ms. Suchetha, who is trained in Carnatic and Hindustani music. Of all the languages, she found German a bit difficult. However, she even surprised the Germans, when they heard her render a German song. She is now gearing up for her first solo live performance in Dubai on November 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teen-sets-record-by-singing-in-120-languages/article36908746.ece

The MSMEs had also demanded insulation from “unfair pricing” by corporates by way of a Minimum Support Price for MSME products. HOSTIA sought the setting up of a Small Entrepreneurs Welfare Board to provide support to the families of MSMEs in the event of death, accidents, or heavy losses. On the infrastructure front, Hosur Trade and Export Promotion Center that was announced in 2017 was still to take off. HOSTIA urged the government to expedite the project which would help augment trade activities within the district. Similarly, HOSTIA also demanded “operationalising the Hosur Airport project under the Udaan Scheme” to facilitate growth in the region. The government should also provide infrastructure for the setting up of a private industrial estate in Kelamangalam, where the Hosur small industries association owned 90 acre. The petition was handed over to the Finance Minister, HOSTIA president K.Velmurugan told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hostia-calls-for-interest-waiver-on-loans-from-tiic/article36909048.ece

09 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Siblings reunited with family members||Two siblings rescued by the Child Welfare Committee in 2013 were finally reunited with their family members on Friday. The family members originally from Tiruchi district traced the two siblings based on the statement given by their parents before their death in 2016. In 2013, fortune-tellers Shanmugan and Parvathi came to Madurai along with their children Mary and Vijay. It was said that the fortune-tellers had asked the children to stay back at the railway station. They then ventured out to find clients. The other children of the couple stayed back in their home in Tiruchi district. Under these circumstances, the Railway Police found the children then aged 7 and 2 respectively begging in the railway station. The police then alerted the child helpline and handed the children to the Madurai Child Welfare Committee. The committee left the children in registered homes. They were given shelter and education. It was said that the parents had approached the Child Welfare Committee, but decided to leave the children under the care of the committee. The other siblings did not know the whereabouts. Based on the statement given by their parents in 2016, the elder brothers and sisters of the siblings tried to trace them. Finally, based on available records, the Child Welfare Committee was able to reunite the family members. Member of the District Child Welfare Committee L. Shanmugam said that the two siblings, now aged 15 and 10, would continue to stay at the respective homes and complete their school education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/siblings-reunited-with-family-members/article36908988.ece
09 October 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK men will indulge in malpractice in rural local body polls: AIADMK||Alleging that some of the ruling party functionaries were determined to indulge in malpractice in the polling scheduled to be held on Saturday for the rural local body election, a delegation from the AIADMK submitted a memorandum to Collector S. Aneesh Shekhar here on Friday. Speaking to reporters, former Ministers Sellur K. Raju and R.B. Udayakumar, MLA V V Rajan Chellappa and other senior functionaries said that though the polling was scheduled to be held in 97 stations on Saturday, the cameras were installed only in 11 among them. “We had already complained about this with the officials concerned three days ago, but there had not been any tangible action...” they claimed. The DMK government had miserably failed to fulfil its poll promises. On the contrary, it had withdrawn populist measures implemented by the then AIADMK regime, which included ‘Thalikku Thangam’ and the 50 % subsidy for two-wheeler to womenfolk. Unable to stomach the popularity of the AIADMK, the present government was bent upon winning the rural local body polls by indulging in malpractice and other illegal ways, they charged. The Collector, the delegation said, had assured to hold discussions with the officials and ensure that there was transparency at all levels during the polls, Mr. Udayakumar said and added that the DMK was trying to misuse the official machinery. The State Election Commission had announced conduct of normal elections to the rural local body in two phases (October 6 and 9) for the newly created nine districts. Apart from the normal election, the SEC was also conducting poll to posts, which had fallen vacant. In Madurai district, election was being held for 25 posts, including ward member among others. With 17 candidates elected unopposed, election was being held for the remaining eight posts, which included district panchayat council member (ward 16 in Thirumangalam). With the DMK and the AIADMK vying with each other to emerge victorious, the administration had deployed adequate bandobust in sensitive stations, officials added. Counting would be held on October 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-men-will-indulge-in-malpractice-in-rural-local-body-polls-aiadmk/article36909322.ece

09 October 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Big adrenal tumour in preteen girl removed||Gastroenterologists at Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Centre removed a big tumour of the adrenal gland, known as pheochromocytoma, from a 12-year-old girl. The 14x10 cm tumor was removed with the minimally invasive surgery procedure called laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Laparoscopy is usually used for removing adrenal masses only if the growth is smaller than six cm and open adrenalectomy (the traditional surgery with large incision) is done on patients with pheochromocytoma measuring more than six cm. In this patient, her obesity, the size of the tumour and its presence on the right adrenal gland made the 1.5-hour surgery distinctive, the doctors said. “The patient's age was a deciding factor for laparoscopy as it involved smaller scar, less discomfort and substantial benefits in terms of patient recovery,” said head of gastroenterology Ramesh Ardhanari, who led the team. The patient from Tenkasi had reported with abdominal pain and during scanning for ovarian cyst was also diagnosed with right adrenal gland pheochromocytoma. “The irregular secretion of adrenalin and noradrenaline causes high blood pressure, palpitations and headache and it is not possible to perform any other surgery without removing the adrenal tumour first,” Dr. Ardhanari said. He said this was a feat for his team consisting of senior gastroenterology consultants N. Mohan, Srinivasan Ramachandran, S. Jegadesh Chandra Bose, and senior anaesthetist N. Maharajan, because to the best of his knowledge, no one else in the world so far has removed right adrenal tumour of this size using laparoscopy. The patient was discharged three weeks ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/big-tumour-removed/article36909011.ece

09 October 2021||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||Geographical Indication Tag for Kanniyakumari clove||The spices growers of Kanniyakumari have obtained the Geographical Indication Tag for the clove being grown in the hilly regions of the district as it is known for its rich aromatic oil content. Clove, one of the prominent spice crops of the district, is grown on 760 hectares in the densely wooded areas of Maaraamalai, Blackrock and Velimalai in the Western Ghats of the Veerapuli Reserve Forests and Mahendragiri. The district represents about 73% of the area under clove in Tamil Nadu. Of the total production of 1,100 tonnes of cloves in India, Tamil Nadu accounts for close to 1,000 tonnes, of which over 65% is grown in the district. “The climate in the hilly regions of Kanniyakumari district is ideal for clove cultivation. This region benefits from both the south-west and north-east monsoons. Also, the ‘sea mist’ comes in and works up the moisture needed for the crop. The black soil here, rich in organic nutrients, is suitable for clove cultivation. This makes the cloves grown in the region unique,” Collector M. Aravind says. With the highest percentage of volatile oil content present in the clove buds, the crop being grown in the district is much sought-after. The ‘sea mist’ also helps with eugenol. The eugenol acetate content in the oil is higher, lending better aroma and flavour to the clove buds. “While the typical volatile oil content is about 18%, the volatile oil content in the Kanniyakumari clove buds is 21%, resulting in 86% of eugenol. Furthermore, drying happens naturally at the plantations located at an altitude of about 800 metres and having moderate temperature. This means a limited loss of essential oils and an increase in their concentration,” Mr. Aravind says. The flower buds, stalks and fallen leaves are used in essential oil preparation. The clove bud and its oils are also used in the medical, pharmaceutical and perfumery industries. The clove buds from Kanniyakumari is preferred for the presence of higher volatile oils. To get the global recognition for the uniqueness of Kanniyakumari clove, Maaraamalai Planters Association and Blackrock Hill Planters Association made efforts, with the backing of the district administration, for securing the GI Tag. “The GI Tag assigned to the cloves being harvested in the district will rightly convey the value of this product to the international consumers and traders,” Mr. Aravind says.

09 October 2021||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||Five held with ambergris||A forest team, which recently nabbed timber smugglers with four tonnes of rosewood in a midnight operation deep inside the Western Ghats, has arrested five persons with ambergris worth Rs. 4.90 crore. When the police received information about the movement of unidentified persons in Indra Colony in Chunkaankadai near here, they raided the house of C. Dhanapaul and found five persons there with 4.90 kg of ambergris, a waxy substance secreted by sperm whale and found floating in sea or washed ashore and used in perfume. Buying and selling ambergris is against the law in India as it is a product of the sperm whale, a protected species under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. As the police alerted the forest department officials on Thursday evening about the culprits with Rs. 4.90 crore-worth ambergris, District Forest Officer Ilaiyaraja and Assistant Conservator of Forest Sivakumar, rushed a forest team, led by Velimalai Forest Range Officer A. Manimaran to the spot that detained the fivesome. They were identified as S. Subramanian, 45, of Paimpozhil in Tenkasi district, Y. Mohamed Sultan, 52, of S. P. Pattinam in Ramanathapuram district, J. Varadharajan, 40, of Sulerikaadu in Chengelpattu district, F. Sylvester, 47, of Aruvikkarai near Thirvuattar in Kanniyakumari district, now residing at Thalavaipuram in Ramanpudhur in Nagercoil and L. Jegan alias Vergil Lopez, 47, of Puththankadai near Thiruvattar. The forest personnel found that the team, on getting the ambergris from the fishermen, whose identities are yet to be established, was scouting for prospective buyer to sell the ambergris. After being produced before the Special Judge for Forest Cases, they were remanded in judicial custody. The hunt is on to nab Dhanapaul.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/five-held-with-ambergris-worth-rs-490-crore/article36909029.ece
09 October 2021||NAMAKKAL,TAMIL NADU||Namakkal village to get better road connectivity||The long standing demand of Adukanpudhukombai villagers is finally getting fulfilled with the beginning of works for laying a road to the village. Located at the foothills of Kolli Hills, Adukanpudhukombai is on the Tiruchi-Namakkal border. While the habitation falls in Namakkal district, the forest range falls under Tiruchi Forest Division and it has always been a tricky situation for the villagers. While the habitation has access to basic amenities, the villagers have to trek through the forest range to access main roads in Tiruchi as there is no connectivity with Namakkal side. The villagers said they had to stay indoors after dusk due to lack of proper road and light facilities. In case of emergencies, the villagers would have to trek down with the help of a torchlight through the forest. The need for a road got delayed due to administrative issues. Recently, District Collector Shreya P. Singh conducted a grievances redress meeting in the village and assured the villagers of road connectivity. The district administration now sanctioned laying of a water bound macadam road under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Ms. Singh said, “discussions were held with the Tiruchi Collector and he too responded positively. Road has to be laid for 1.62 km of which 1.14 kms passes through the forests. The works have begun and are expected to be completed within a month. The road will be developed into a tar road later.” She added that street lights would be provided to the stretch, and it would provide easy access to the villagers with Tiruchi district once completed. The district administration also arranged for providing nutritious food for pregnant women and 13 children from an anganwadi centre in Tiruchi district. Earlier, these families had to depend on the anganwadi centre in Pallikattupatti in Namakkal that was 20 km away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/namakkal-village-to-get-better-road-connectivity/article36909050.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||SC revives assets case against A.P. Minister||The Supreme Court on Friday revived a disproportionate assets case against Andhra Pradesh Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh and his wife while holding that the CBI need not always conduct a preliminary enquiry before registering an FIR against public servants in corruption cases. A three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud set aside a decision of the Telangana High Court in February 2020 to quash the corruption/disproportionate assets case against Mr. Suresh and his wife, T.H. Viajayalakshmi, an Income Tax Commissioner. The High Court had reasoned that the CBI had straightaway filed the FIR without bothering to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the couple’s “known sources of income” like income tax returns, election affidavits or information submitted to the Government under the Central Civil Services Rules. The High Court had found the corruption charges “prima facie unsustainable” after going through these sources of income on its own. Differing with the High Court, Justice Chandrachud, in a 64-page judgment, held that a preliminary enquiry is not mandatory before registering an FIR against a public servant for corruption if the CBI felt that the information it has received discloses a cognisable offence. “We hold that since the institution of a preliminary enquiry in cases of corruption is not made mandatory before the registration of an FIR under the Code of Criminal procedure, the Prevention of Corruption Act or even the CBI Manual, for this court to issue a direction to that effect will be tantamount to stepping into the legislative domain. Hence, we hold that in case the information received by the CBI, through a complaint or a ‘source information’, discloses the commission of a cognisable offence, it can directly register a Regular Case instead of conducting a preliminary enquiry, where the officer is satisfied that the information discloses the commission of a cognisable offence,” the top court held. The court did not, however, take away the value of conducting a preliminary enquiry in an appropriate case. “The need for a preliminary enquiry will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Even when it is conducted, the scope of a preliminary enquiry is not to ascertain the veracity of the information, but only whether it reveals the commission of a cognisable offence,” Justice Chandrachud noted. An accused cannot demand preliminary enquiry as a “matter of right”, the court explained. “A preliminary enquiry is valuable in corruption cases not to vest a right in the accused but to ensure that there is no abuse of the process of law in order to target public servants,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sc-revives-assets-case-against-ap-minister/article36908756.ece

09 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Rs. 77-crore market remains idle as traders stay away||Farmers groups, who have been allotted shops at the Central Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers at Kallikudi, have urged the government to make the new market complex functional in the wake of failed efforts to shift traders from Gandhi Market to this facility. The Tiruchi Market Committee, functioning under the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business, had recently called for applications for allotment of some of the unallotted shops in the complex, which, however, remains non-functional. The market was built at a cost of Rs. 77 crore with financial assistance from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Situated about 12 km away from the city off the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, the complex has been at a centre of a row ever since it was opened in September 2017 after wholesale traders of Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, for whom it was meant for, refused to shift to the market on the grounds that it was far removed from the city and the shops did not suit their requirements. The market was established on 9.79 acres with 830 shops. In September last year, the Tiruchi Market Committee allotted 412 shops to traders (after cancelling the initial allotment of shops to Gandhi Market traders) after the government decided to allot shops to traders from any part of the State without restricting it to those from Gandhi Market. More than 100 shops were allotted to Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs), Farmers Producers Groups (FPGs) and Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs). A few days ago, the market committee has called for applications to allot 211 vacant shops meant for traders and 49 reserved for farmers’ groups. Meanwhile, the FIGs, FPGs and FPOs, organised as a federation held a meeting recently to take stock of the situation. They said that officials had earlier said that traders will be shifted from Gandhi Market to the Kallikudi market which will function as the central market. As Gandhi Market traders were reluctant to shift to the new market, it is lying in disuse, defeating the very purpose of establishing the facility and rendering crores of rupees a dead investment. This has also raised a question mark over the livelihood of farmers who were part of the groups allotted shops at the market, the federation said. Urging Chief Minister M. K. Stalin to infuse a fresh lease of life to the Kallikudi market, the federation has called upon the government to suspend collection of rent for the shops allotted to them until the market was made functional. Second market “We are facing much hardship as we are not able to run the shops as customers are not coming. The market has to be made functional somehow and it can become successful if given a push. The government could develop and promote the complex as a second market in the city. The new market need not be confined to traders selling vegetables, fruits and flowers. It can be a multi-product market,” said M. Thangavel, coordinator of the federation, and president of Manikandam FPG.

09 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Digital timers are back at two automatic signals||The Traffic Police here have planned to reinstall digital timers at important traffic junctions in the city to enable road users motorists know the waiting time at the automatic traffic signals. To begin with, the Traffic Police authorities have reinstalled the digital timers at Mambazha Salai junction and Karur Bypass Road junction which witness heavy volume of traffic movement. Police sources said that they have planned to reinstall the digital timers at other important traffic junctions soon, for which Head Post Office junction, Vestry School roundabout, Mannarpuram, TVS Tollgate, Palpannai, Kohinoor Theatre junction, Puthur Four Road and Othakadai had been identified. With the digital timers on, road users will know exactly how much time they have to wait at a red signal or the time the green signal will be on before it turns into amber. Without the timers, they cannot switch off their vehicles to conserve fuel at busy junctions where they have to wait for long The digital timers were installed at the traffic signals a few years ago but were removed later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/digital-timers-are-back-at-two-automatic-signals/article36909013.ece
09 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Now, colleges go in search of cooks after opening hostels||Colleges are into overdrive to find cooks, as they who had left for home and native villages after the hostels were closed due to the lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The normal practice of the institutions is to hire cooks and renew their contract every year. They used to have a break of one or two months during summer, and get back to the institutions. Since the cooks have seemingly chosen to settle down in their villages for an alternative livelihood, they have now become scarce. Many institutions are currently managing the situation by engaging erstwhile helpers who are usually from the neighbouring villages. “But the menu is limited. It will take more time for us to offer variety in the menu,” a Principal of a government-aided arts and science college in the city said. The cooks, particularly those from the Chettinad area, have taken advantage of the situation and are striking a hard bargain, sources said. Usually, the cooks are paid anywhere between Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 15,000 on a monthly basis, alongside free food and accommodation. They are likely to demand a few thousands of rupees more, according to a college teacher. The college heads say they know fully well they cannot delay fixing the issue at once, since the students cannot be expected to be patient beyond a point in matters of food. The situation is now manageable since the hostels are not functioning to full capacity. But the number of inmates is on the rise gradually. For once, college managements have realised that the demand-supply factor could work with teachers recruited for self-supporting programmes, but not cooks, and that the cooks need to be treated with more dignity henceforth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-colleges-go-in-search-of-cooks-after-opening-hostels/article36909016.ece

09 October 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Young lawyers should aim at helping the poor and needy’||Karnatak Law Society’s Rajalakhamgouda Law College organised its annual endowment prize distribution ceremony, valedictory of the academic year and farewell function for final year students in Belagavi on Wednesday. Principal Senior Civil Judge and Chief Judicial Magistrate Bhat Manjunath Narayan distributed the prizes. He asked junior lawyers to learn from all senior lawyers in court and not just their immediate seniors. “You have been groomed by professors in college, but there are no teachers in court. There is scope for errors in theoretical training. But legal practice is like being in a war zone. Any error on your part will affect your client and his family over generations,’’ he said. “Young lawyers should aim at helping the poor and needy, rather than making money. Focus on all the good you can do. Society needs good judges and lawyers and you should aim at being good judges and lawyers,’’ he said. Advocate and secretary of the society Vivek G. Kulkarni asked law graduates on learning the craft, rather than on remuneration. “Honesty and integrity play an important role in moulding a good lawyer,’’ he said. Advocate and Chairman of Governing Council of the college S.V. Ganachari, who presided over the function, said that advocacy is a noble profession and it demanded honest pursuit of knowledge. “ A second year LL.B student Krishna Bandodekar won the M.K. Nambyar Memorial Gold Medal for scoring the highest marks in Constitutional Law for the academic year 2019-2020. The gold medal is given out of the endowment instituted by Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal in honour of his father late M.K. Nambyar who was a leading expert in Constitutional Law. Mr. Bhat also gave away different endowment awards and sports and cultural prizes. Suhas Huddar won the general championship in the male category and Ujwala Hawaldar won the general championship in female category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/young-lawyers-should-aim-at-helping-the-poor-and-needy/article36909062.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Key irrigation works under the scanner||Search and seizure operations by the Income Tax Department on B.S. Yediyurappa’s close aide Umesh and 31 contractors, which started on Thursday morning and were going on till late on Friday, are covering monetary transactions pertaining to major ongoing irrigation works in the State. Tenders awarded Tenders awarded and payments made over the last two years, when Mr. Umesh allegedly played a key role in the awarding of these contracts, are under the scanner. I-T sleuths are trying to map alleged generation of black money and its transactions in these contracts, sources said. Prominent contractors being searched include those who bagged key tenders over the last two years such as D.Y. Uppar, Shankar and Sreenivas, sources said. Works under the scanner include Narayanpur Right Bank Canal, Malaprabha Ghataprabha canal modernisation project, Hemavati left and right bank canals, KRS modernisation, and canal remodelling works, sources said. The contractors raided also have works under Rural Drinking Water Project, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, and other PWD works which are ongoing. Anomalies “Clearing poor quality or incomplete works, excess billing, inflated estimates, and taking up works even before the work orders were issued are some of the anomalies that have been in practice in the department, which generates a lot of black money which plays a role in the politics of the State,” a senior Irrigation Department official said. However, I-T raids on contractors were a routine affair, officials added. What sets apart the ongoing raids was that Mr. Umesh, a key aide of the formerChief Minister, had emerged as the main focus. Officials allege he had become a point person for irrigation tenders over the last two years. I-T sleuths have reportedly found some documents pertaining to the department at his residence during the raid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/key-irrigation-works-under-the-scanner/article36908850.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Reinstatement of senior citizens’ council sought||As senior citizens continue to face a plethora of problems induced by the pandemic, NGOs have urged the State Government to step in. Among their demands are reinstating the State Council for Senior Citizens and addressing insurance coverage for elders. HelpAge India, which has been working in the field, has submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai asking for the reinstatement of the council. “The State Council was headed by the Minister for Women and Child Development, Director - Department of Differently Abled and Senior Citizens Empowerment and also involved representatives from NGOs and senior citizens,” the memorandum said, adding that meetings were conducted to review of welfare schemes, maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens and to ensure improving the delivery services, and appropriate recommendations for the welfare programmes for senior citizens were made to the government. “It is regrettable that the State Council has not been functioning since the last few years. It was formed in 2007, but the implementation has not been there. We want it reinstated so that the committee can monitor schemes and recommend budget needs according to the need of the elderly,” said Prakashan M., State in-charge, HelpAge India. With senior citizens being among the vulnerable groups as far as COVID 19 is concerned, they have also asked for extension of health insurance. At present, it is available for seniors up to the age of 65 with a meagre extension, and this applies only to diseases which the insured person acquires after the date of the policy. “This facility does not apply to old diseases. However, most elderly need insurance facility after the age of 65 to be extended up to 85 years,” the NGO has said. They have also asked for a separate department for senior citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reinstatement-of-senior-citizens-council-sought/article36908839.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Colleges asked to resubmit syllabus ahead of October 12 opening||Barely four days before degree colleges are set to open for the new academic year, syllabi are yet to be finalised. Colleges in Karnataka have been asked to resubmit their modified syllabus to their respective universities after the Department of Higher Education changed the assessment pattern earlier this week. Initially, colleges were asked to change their syllabus for UG programmes in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP) and submit it to the respective universities. But with the assessment pattern also changed, colleges that had submitted the revised syllabus have been instructed to re-submit it keeping in mind the revised regulations. As per the new assessment pattern, 40% of the total marks have been allocated to internal assessment and 60% to end semester theory examination. However, for practical examinations, equal weightage will be given to the internal assessment and end-semester examinations. Bengaluru City University (BCU) on Thursday issued an order to all principals of affiliated and autonomous colleges instructing their respective chairpersons of the board of studies to go through the revised draft regulations and make the necessary changes. With colleges so close to starting the new academic year, the constant changes have teaching staff worried. Lecturers and principals are disappointed that the Higher Education Department decided to make the change after most departments had submitted their syllabi. “We had elaborate discussions with our board members and finalised our syllabi. Now we will have to convene the meeting again to make changes. It is very difficult to organise the meeting as many of our board members are industry experts,” said a lecturer of an autonomous college. Another principal of a government first grade degree college said that she has directed all teachers to ensure that the assessment is tweaked to incorporate more research projects, field visits and seminars as there is greater emphasis on internal assessment. “We know that teachers will have to work again, but we have no option but to ask our lecturers to brainstorm and suggest new evaluation methods,” the principal said. Colleges are all set to reopen on October 12 for all semesters for 2021-22. First years will have a syllabus that will be aligned with NEP for the first time. Many lecturers described the process as frustrating as apart from problems with setting the syllabus, the training programme where they will learn about teaching pedagogies is scheduled only later this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/colleges-asked-to-resubmit-syllabus-ahead-of-october-12-opening/article36908835.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Building owners arrested||The city police have arrested the couple who owned and built the multi-storeyed residentialcomplex that collapsed in Kasturinagar on Thursday. The arrested property owners have been identified as Ayesha Beg and her husband Mirza Aksar Ali Beg. They had started construction in 2012 and finished it in 2014. Deputy Police Commissioner (East) D. Sharanappa said that preliminary technical investigations revealed poor quality of construction to be one of the prime reasons for the collapse of the building. Furthermore, the couple built the residential complex on a 40x60 feet site violating several norms. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who visited the spot on Thursday, had told reporters that the building was constructed on a 40x60 site as a ground-plus-two floor house. However, they allegedly violated several norms and built additional floors than what had been permitted including a penthouse. As of Friday evening, the demolition was still under way. The BBMP used gas cutters and helped residents retrieve valuable items that could be salvaged. The debris is yet to be cleared. Assistant Engineer Shankarappa has been suspended after the BBMP found that the building had more floors than sanctioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/building-owners-arrested/article36908830.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Wastage higher in Covaxin||Karnataka that had managed to extract and administer extra doses from each COVID-19 vaccine vial till July end, has again reported a wastage of 0.06%. The wastage is especially seen in Covaxin at 0.82%. Although the State has recorded ‘negative wastage’ in Covishield thereby extracting 3,43,951 extra doses from the overall usage, as many as 46,472 doses of Covaxin have been wasted so far. With this, Covaxin wastage has been recorded at 0.82% as of October 7. Vaccine usage is calculated as the proportion of vaccines administered out of the total allotted. After the COVID-19 vaccination was rolled out in January, a vaccine wastage of nearly 7% was being reported initially. However, by July 23, 2021, this turned into ‘negative wastage’ of -2.23% thereby adding a total of 1,75,165 doses to the assigned stock in vaccination centres. State Health officials attributed this to meticulous micro planning of the vaccine sessions. According to data from the Health Department, the net wastage of Covishield from May 1 till July 23 was -2.72%, which resulted in 1,67,917 additional doses being extracted from the stock assigned to the vaccination centres. This was far more than the 7,248 additional doses (-1.74%) extracted from Covaxin stocks. Now, as of October 7, while ‘negative wastage’ of Covishield reduced from -2.72% to -0.7%, districts reported a cumulative loss of 46,472 doses (0.82%) of Covaxin. Highest in Bagalkot While Bagalkot recorded the the highest Covaxin wastage at 10.83%, Kalaburagi (3.2%), Dharwad (2.62%), Vijayapura (2.57%) and Chitradurga (2.42%) followed. Cumulatively (both Covishield and Covaxin together), while Bagalkot recorded a wastage of 2.9%, Kalaburagi and Hassan recorded a wastage of 2% each. While Ballari and Chitradurga recorded a wastage of 1.8% each, Vijayapura and Koppal recorded 1.7% each. Sources said this wastage was mainly because the State is facing a shortage of auto-disabled syringes of 0.5 millilitre capacity. This variety with low dead space (LDS) is preferred for COVID vaccination as the syringe breaks after a single use and ensures low wastage. Due to the shortage, the department is now supplying districts with 2ml syringes and the use of larger syringes is one of the reasons resulting in spillage of doses, sources said. Admitting that there is a short supply of syringes from the Centre, Arundathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission, said syringes used for routine immunisation were being diverted for COVID vaccines. She attributed the Covaxin wastage to the low demand for this vaccine now. “Initially there was high demand, especially among youngsters, to get Covaxin shots. However, now only those who are due for second doses are seeking it,” she said. Pointing out that vaccinators usually open a vial only after the required number of beneficiaries are available - 20 for Covaxin and 10 for Covishield, she said: “As Covaxin takers are mainly second dose beneficiaries, we cannot send them away even if we do not have the required number.” ‘Negligible’ Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said the wastage is negligible and least when compared to other States. Denying that the wastage was due to use of 2ml syringes, he said the 2ml syringes come with markings and vaccinators can easily load the exact 0.5ml of the vaccine from the vial. “We are also in the process of procuring the auto-disabled 0.5ml syringes,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/wastage-higher-in-covaxin/article36908838.ece
09 October 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Byelections: Bommai has the tricky task of taking all factions of BJP together||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai is facing the tricky task of taking all factions in the BJP together during campaigning for the byelections to two Assembly seats scheduled for October 30. Though the BJP has the advantage of being in power, the stakes are high for Mr. Bommai as this is his first electoral test after becoming Chief Minister, especially in the wake of the party central leadership declaring that he would lead the party in the 2023 Assembly elections. A misstep will give a handle to his detractors within the party to appeal to the high command to keep the option on the leadership open. “The Chief Minister has proved that he has a grip over the administration. He has to now prove that he has political grip too,” observed a senior BJP leader. The unenviable task of taking all the factions together was evident with the party leadership revising the list of in-charge leaders for the byelections to include the name of B.Y. Vijayendra, son of the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. He was appointed oneof the in-charge leaders for Hangal seat after his followers criticised the party leadership for not considering him for election management. However, the party not fielding Revathi Udasi, daughter in-law of the late C.M. Udasi who was very close to Mr. Yediyurappa, besides the income tax raids on a close aide of the former Chief Minister, appear to have made it even more tricky for the Chief Minister to get the full support of his predecessor. Though theoretically things appear to be easy for the BJP, party insiders said that things may go wrong if Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp or some of the party’s old guards become inactive in these two seats. Another tricky issue for the BJP is that Sindgi is in Vijayapura district where disgruntled leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal holds sway. Mr. Yatnal is not on the same page with most leaders of the party, particularly the camp of Mr. Yediyurappa. Mr. Bommai was in the national capital on Friday and will spend part of Saturday also there visiting national leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/byelections-bommai-has-the-tricky-task-of-taking-all-factions-of-bjp-together/article36908854.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||GoM on GST will meet soon: Bommai||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is also chairman of the Group of Ministers (GoM) on GST, on Friday met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Delhi and said he would call a meeting of the GoM soon for holding discussions on rationalisation and restructuring of taxes for increasing GST revenue. The Union Finance Ministry has sought a report of the GoM in two months and he would call the meeting of Ministers in the group soon, Mr. Bommai said. NABARD loan During the meeting, Mr. Bommai urged Ms. Sitharaman to direct NABARD to give more loans to the State in the current financial year for taking up rural development projects. NABARD has set aside Rs. 1,500 crore loan to the State in 2021–22. The Chief Minister also sought more funding from SIDBI for financing micro and small enterprises. The Union Finance Minister responded to the State’s plea and assured of giving directions during the meeting in the first week of November, Mr. Bommai said. As farmers are facing shortage of fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and muriate of potash (MoP) for taking up sowing in the rabi season in the State, Mr. Bommai also called on Union Minister for Fertilizers, Health and Family Welfare Mansukh Mandaviya in the national capital and sought additional quantity of nutrients. Mr. Bommai sought 32,000 tonnes of DAP, which is the preferred fertilizer across the State, and 10,000 tonnes of MoP for the rabi season. The Minister assured of supplying nutrients in a week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gom-on-gst-will-meet-soon-bommai/article36908857.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Amidst coal crisis, Karnataka power situation fine for now||As the country grapples with the coal supply crisis, Karnataka, which is dependent on other States, is keeping its fingers crossed and hoping for a resolution soon. As of now, renewable sources are keeping the power situation stable, authorities said. V. Ponnuraj, Managing Director, KPCL, was unavailable for comment. However, KPTCL MD N. Manjula told The Hindu that at present, the situation in Karnataka was manageable thanks to solar and hydro power in addition to copious rain.” “As of now there is no problem. It has been raining, so IP set load is low. There could be a problem if it stops raining. Load-wise, evening peaks is the problem,” she said, adding that demand is also lower than that during summer. Another senior KPTCL official said Karnataka’s lack of coal mines means the State has to import all its coal from other States. “We are relatively safer because of solar and hydro power. We have surplus power in the morning, but in the evening, consumption rises as lights are switched on. We are hoping that the coal situation improves soon,” said the official. Meanwhile, energy experts are focussing on renewable energy. Abhishek Nath, Sector Head-Energy and Power at Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said power consumption in the country this year has been higher than pre-COVID levels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/amidst-coal-crisis-karnataka-power-situation-fine-for-now/article36908846.ece
09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Notice to Karnataka Govt., Lokayukta on cooperative bank’s plea||TheHigh Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notices to the State Government and the Lokayukta institution on a petition filed by Muslim Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mysuru, claiming that the Lokayukta had no jurisdiction over the petitioner-bank. Contending that the State Government neither had any share capital nor controlling stake in the bank, which is an autonomous institution under the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act, it has been claimed in the petition that the Lokayukta could not have acted upon a complaint against the bank under the provisions of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984. The bank has questioned the report submitted by the Upalokayukta based on a complaint against the bank, and the actions of the Lokayukta, who asked the Government to submit an action-taken report based the report of the Upalokayukta. As the Government had asked the bank to inform the action taken based on the report forwarded by the Lokayukta, the petitioner has sought a direction from the court to quash the report of the Upalokayukta and the Lokayukta. A Division Bench comprising Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar and Justice P. Krishna Bhat, before whom the petition came up for hearing, adjourned further hearing while asking the Government to file its response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/notice-to-karnataka-govt-lokayukta-on-cooperative-banks-plea/article36909069.ece

09 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Remarks against RSS not made with an eye on polls’||Denying allegations that his outbursts against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were made with an eye on the bypolls, JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said that he had, in fact, advised minority community leaders to support secular parties -- either Congress or his own party -- depending on who has a better chance of winning. Speaking at Channapatna, the former Chief Minister claimed he was being “broad minded”, while Congress leaders were indulging in “petty politics” to defeat the JD(S). The regional party has fielded Muslim candidates in the bypoll-bound Hangal and Sindgi seats and Congress leaders have alleged that the party had done so with the aim of splitting minority votes to help the BJP. He said that he stood by his statement that the RSS had the country and the State politics in its grip and it was not aimed at weaning away minority votes. Meanwhile, at a press conference in Bengaluru, JD (S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda dismissed the claim of some BJP leaders that he had at one point of time praised RSS. “I have nothing do with RSS nor do I know anything about it,” he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/remarks-against-rss-not-made-with-an-eye-on-polls/article36908845.ece

Justice R. Devdas passed the order recently while disposing of petitions filed by Pani Yapung and 19 other students pursing MBBS courses in various colleges. Taking note the restrictions and conditions issued by the government and the technical advisory committee for students arriving from other states to write medical exams, the HC said there is a possibility that these students could have tested positive and so missed the exams. As the RGUHS had earlier issued a notification enabling such students who were issued hall tickets but were unable to attend to write examination subsequently, the court said that similar benefit should be provided to the petitioner students if they were not able to appear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relief-for-medical-students-who-could-not-write-exams/article36908842.ece

The National Investigation Agency, which took over the case, said the probe revealed the bomb blast to be one among the series of five blasts, all in courts, set off by members of the Base Movement, an organisation, owing allegiance to Al-Qaeda. “Nainar Abbas Ali and Dawood Suleiman had formed the Base Movement in Tamil Nadu in January, 2015, inspired by the ideology of Al-Qaeda and its leader Osama Bin Laden. They had recruited the other accused persons and hatched a criminal conspiracy to threaten government departments, especially courts, holding them responsible for atrocities and injustice meted out to a particular religious group. In pursuance to the conspiracy, they had systematically issued threats to prison authorities and police officials of different states and to the French embassy in India,” NIA said in a statement. NIA had filed a chargesheet in 2017 and the trial concluded in May 2021. The NIA Special Court held the three guilty, and the quantum of punishment will be announced on October 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-convicted-in-2016-mysuru-court-blast-case/article36908844.ece

09 October 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Address concerns over natural resources’||The former chairman of ISRO A.S. Kiran Kumar has said that even as advanced technologies are emerging, society has a crucial responsibility of addressing issues concerning availability of natural resources. Delivering the 70th and 71st convocation address of Karnatak University, Dharwad, through a virtual platform on Friday, he said that harnessing the potential of technology to solve the problems of the common man through innovative strategies is a noble goal to strive for. Elaborating on the Indian Space research programme, he said that advances in satellite remote sensing, global navigation satellite system, geographic information system have now made it easier to integrate ecological, environmental and other issues for developing predictive models and providing effective decision support systems. “Earth observation from space, along with other applications, is a cost-effective method for effective monitoring of environment and management of land, ocean and freshwater resources and also, providing essential data to decision-makers. Once converted into practical information, these data can be used to formulate policy and implement programmes at national, regional and international levels,” he said. As the pandemic continued to affect people across the globe, technological solutions are helping monitor and control the spread of the disease. And, these aides are in fact lessening the load on the healthcare system, he said. Mr. Kiran Kumar said that virtual platforms using videoconferencing and digital monitoring are becoming extremely handy and safe. “The use of mobile payment applications and social media to collect real-time data about the location of people are enabling tracking and movement of carriers. Machine learning models are developed using this information towards predicting the transmission pattern of the virus. Smart technologies, like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, are being widely adopted to track and check the disease spread, manage payments, optimise medical supply and enforce restrictive measures,” he said. The former ISRO scientist said that the role of big data analytics is becoming crucial in developing real-time forecast and in helping health care professionals with decision-making based on profound database. Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan asked students to shun inferiority complexes and develop positive thoughts to climb up the social and professional ladder. “The NEP-2020 is being brought in to empower students in honing skills and making them globally competent. The knowledge earned should be utilised for nation-building work,” he said. Vice-Chancellor of the university K.B. Gudasi spoke. On the occasion, Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot virtually presented Karnatak University Diamond Jubilee Professor Award to Tejraj M. Amminbhavi who has guided 46 research students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/address-concerns-over-natural-resources/article36909065.ece

09 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Action sought against Hindutva groups for threat to college||Several organisations and activists have urged the Dakshina Kannada district administration and the police to take action against Hindutva groups for what they said issuing a threat that they will not allow St. Aloysius College, an autonomous institution, to name a garden on its Kotekar Beeri campus after deceased activist Stan Swamy. In an open letter, they said that it is criminal intimidation by the Hindutva groups. The district administration and the police should provide adequate protection to the college to ensure that there is no interference in its private affairs. “We call upon the district administration and the police to take immediate action against these organisations for engaging in criminal intimidation and issuing such threats,” the letter said. The letter has been endorsed by several organisations including Campaign to Defend Democracy, All India People’s Forum (AIPF), People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Amar Jesani, P. Sainath, Anil Sadagopal, Dunu Roy, Harsh Mander, Kavita Srivatsava, Meera Sanghamitra, Nandini Sundar, Pieter Friedrich and Ram Puniyani. “The signatories condemn the open threats of violence by groups such as ABVP, VHP and Bajrang Dal against a private autonomous Catholic college in Mangaluru for its decision to name one of its parks after the late Swamy whose death has become symbolic of the systemic oppression of a human rights activist standing with the most marginalised communities,” the letter said. “They (the groups) have absolutely no right to interfere in the goings-on of a private institution. These organisation have a stated purpose and history for violence, communal divisiveness and subscribe to an idea of our country with scant regard to the Constitution and the Rule of Law. This blatantly illegal behavior is a consequence of the free run that is being given to these organisations in coastal Karnataka,” it said. “These organisations are imposing social apartheid, interfering in the private affairs of citizens and acting against the Constitutional principle of fraternity by engaging in daily acts of violence and intimidation with impunity. Members of these organisations have engaged in lynching of minorities across the country, conducting riots and engaging in violence to push minorities into second-class citizenship,” it said. The signatories said that late Swamy was a person who was falsely implicated in cases that are pending against him and subjected to the most inhuman treatment leading to his untimely death. He dedicated his entire life to the uplift of the oppressed sections of society and was targeted precisely for this reason.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/action-sought-against-hindutva-groups-for-threat-to-college/article36909372.ece
09 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Udupi ZP to recommend action against bank officials||Udupi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Y. Naveen Bhat on Thursday said that the administration will write to banks to initiate action against officials concerned for their failure to conduct field survey to help arecanut and pepper growers avail themselves of crop insurance. Presiding over a district-level review committee meeting of commercial banks in Udupi, Dr. Bhat said that the committee had directed banks to conduct field survey to rectify anomalies in crop survey for 2016-17 and 2018-19 and to submit the required documents to insurance companies in the last two meetings. This was to help farmers who had availed themselves of loans Dr. Bhat said that the credit to deposit (CD) ratio of banks in the district, that should have been 60%, has marginally improved from 45.27% in June 2020 to 45.71% in June 2021. Much needs to be done to improve the ratio, he said and pointed out that several banks, including Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, State Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, IDBI Bank, Karnataka Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank, were lagging behind in achieving the target. He said that banks should strive to offer the maximum service to customers and provide comprehensive information to them on the available services when they approach them. Banks should attempt to enlarge their operational base by conducting maximum financial transactions, he said and added that there were complaints of insufficient services to customers. Reserve Bank of India’s Assistant General Manager in Bengaluru Venkatesh said that banking services should be provided to villages that have more than 2,000 population. In the coming days, all banking transactions will be digitised. Banks should ensure cash is available in ATMs round-the-clock and penalty will be levied on those banks that do not maintain sufficient cash. Lead Bank Manager P.M. Pinjar said that there was a 12.87% increase in deposits with banks collecting Rs. 28,976 crore deposits as on June, 2021. He said that loan disbursal increased by 9.14% with Rs. 13,247 crore being lent. The target of Rs. 2,290 crore loan disbursal for the first quarter of the current fiscal has seen an achievement of up to 98.34% with disbursal of Rs. 2,252 crore as loan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/udupi-zp-to-recommend-action-against-bank-officials/article36909363.ece

09 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Viewing the glitter from the ‘Ambari’||‘Ambari’, the hop-on hop-off double-decker bus, is now running to its full capacity, thanks to the effervescent and expansive Dasara illumination. The rising popularity of Ambari impelled the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) to add two more buses to the existing fleet of two in view of the ongoing festivities. Tourists and locals are climbing up the buses and travelling on the rooftop to get the glimpse of the city that has come alive with impressive illumination. The bus is running full in the evenings. “The response has been good. After a dull start, because of the pandemic, the Dasara season has come as an advantage. Locals and those from neighbouring districts are taking the rides,” KSTDC sources said. Ambari is a 40-seater bus but all passengers wish to travel on the roof to experience the city. The lower AC deck that mostly used to be unoccupied is also getting passengers. KSTDC charges Rs. 250 per passenger for a ride. After facing many hitches, Ambaari had hit the road in the first week of September. It has given a new platform for experiencing and exploring the city’s heritage wonders. Ambaari’s rollout had faced hurdles since the last one-and-half years owing to the pandemic situation and lockdowns. It was formally launched in March this year. The bus route covers Hotel Mayura KSTDC office, Deputy Commissioner’s office, Crawford Hall, Kukkarahalli Lake, University of Mysore, Folklore Museum, Ramaswamy Circle, Palace Karikallu Thotti, Jayamarthanda Gate of the palace, zoo, Karanji Lake, Jockey Quarters’ Circle, Snow City, Chamundi Vihar Stadium, St. Philomena’s Church, Bannimantap, and City Railway Station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/viewing-the-glitter-from-the-ambari/article36909231.ece
09 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Morning walkers treated to boiled eggs||Early morning walkers and joggers at Kukkarahalli Lake in Mysuru were in for a treat on Friday when members of the Mysuru unit of National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) served them boiled eggs. The second Friday of October is observed as World Egg Day every year to create awareness about the nutrients present in the eggs and the benefits of its consumption. The members of NECC’s Mysuru unit had put up a makeshift tent near Kukkarahalli Lake and offered a plate of two boiled eggs sliced and sprinkled with pepper salt in a plate of salad comprising sliced cucumber, onion and tomato. Several morning walkers and joggers were served with the eggs free of cost. “We prepared and served the eggs, keeping hygiene in mind. Though we wanted to serve them between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., all the 3,000 eggs that we had prepared were consumed by 9 a.m. itself”, said Satish Babu, Chairman of NECC, Mysuru Zone. The NECC members distributed pamphlets on the health benefits of consuming eggs. Describing an egg as the “nature’s most perfect package of nutrition”, the information pamphlet said an egg was “naturally sealed” and “absolutely unadulterable”. The protein in egg was described as “of highest quality” and was used as a “standard to measure the quality of any other protein foods”. Though eggs were distributed in schools and old age homes during the earlier World Egg Day celebrations, it was the first time NECC observed the day by serving morning walkers and joggers boiled eggs. On the occasion, Mr. Babu urged the State government to include eggs in the mid-day meals of schoolchildren across the State. “Presently, eggs have been included in the mid-day meals of children in only nutritionally backward districts of Ballari, Bidar, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Vijayapura and Yadgir in North Karnataka for 46 days in a year. The government should include eggs in the mid-day meals of children across the State and eggs should be served five days a week”, said Mr. Babu. Consumption He said the per capita consumption of eggs in India was just 79 while many in certain other countries such as Japan it was more than 350. The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has recommended 180 per capita consumption of eggs. In Karnataka, Mr. Babu said a total of 1.8 crore eggs are produced every day. While Bengaluru alone consumes 70 lakh eggs every day, Mysuru consumes a total of 10 lakh. While eggs produced in Karnataka meet the requirement in neighbouring Goa and Maharashtra, eggs produced in Tamil Nadu are transported to markets in Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/morning-walkers-treated-to-boiled-eggs/article36909233.ece

Bank Note Paper Mill India, Mysuru (BNPM) has contributed a sum of Rs. 70 lakh under its CSR initiative for constructing the enclosure for orangutans that arrived here in August from Singapore and Malaysia. “This generous contribution of BNPM goes a long way in the conservation of the endangered great apes, and facilitate their display,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni. The zoo got two pairs of orangutans from Singapore and Malaysia as it managed to strike a major animal exchange deal. The 17-year-old male, Merlin, and 13-year-old female, Atina, arrived from Singapore zoo while five-year-old male, Afa, and the 7-year-old female, Minnie, were brought from Malaysia zoo.  Giraffes given In return, the Mysuru zoo has given two pairs of giraffes. According to the zoo records, the last time the zoo displayed orangutans was in the 1970s and the zoo authorities’ best efforts thereafter to get an orangutan pair did not materialise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bank-note-paper-mill-builds-enclosure-for-orangutans/article36909234.ece

Prathapan had imparted values to students, nurtured their talents, and helped shape the future of many in a career spanning 27 years. The government bestowed on him a State award for best teacher in 2015-16 for his meritorious service. After his retirement in 2017, Mr. Prathapan has taken a plunge into farming not just to kill time but also to produce safe-to-eat vegetables. 15 types of vegetables The teacher-turned-farmer has found success in his new endeavour while practising good agricultural practices. Mr. Prathapan has transformed three acres of fallow land at Kanjikuzhy grama panchayat into a thriving organic vegetable farm. He is growing organically 15 types of vegetables, including snake gourd, ridge gourd, beans, bitter gourd, tomato, chilli, ladies’ finger, and turmeric in two plots of 1.5 acres each. “I have great childhood memories of farming. During my stint at DV HSS, Charamangalam, I was part of several agricultural activities in the school. After retiring, I decided to get into farming full-fledged, primarily driven by the motive of producing safe vegetables,” says Mr. Prathapan, a native of Charamangalam in Kanjikuzhy. He began growing vegetables on 1.5 acres of land provided for free to him for farming by Cheruvaranam native Babu Mon. His own land After he harvested a good crop in the first three years, Mr. Prathapan last year bought 1.5 acres of land near his house. “On an average, my farm, spread across two plots, is producing 50 kg of vegetables on alternate days. I am making between Rs. 600 and Rs. 1,500 on alternate days. Moreover, I am contributing, albeit on a small scale, to the production of pesticide-free vegetables,” he says. His wife P.S. Radha, a retired government employee, is part of the farming initiative. Upon hearing about Mr. Prathapan’s success story, Agriculture Minister P. Prasad had visited his farm last month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/best-teacher-now-nurtures-safe-veggies/article36909188.ece

Less than two weeks into cracking the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services examination of 2020, Malini has secured the first rank in stream 1 of the Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) examination conducted by the Public Service Commission. She has secured 135th rank in the Civil Services exam. Malini, hailing from Chettikulangara, says she is happy to have topped the KAS but has not yet decided on joining the Kerala Administrative Service. She aspires to join the Indian Foreign Service as she awaits the service allocation of the UPSC. A former English teacher, she decided to try Civil Services and the KAS “to serve society”. “I have worked as a teacher in private institutions in Delhi and Kochi. After I made my choice, I quit the job and started preparing for the Civil Services and later for the KAS. In 2020, I joined the High Court as an administrative assistant, but took leave to fulfil my dream,” says the 29-year-old. While she bagged the first rank in the KAS in the first attempt, she had attempted the UPSC Civil Services exam four times.

This is the NCC’s only airstrip in the country and is being constructed by the Public Works Department (PWD). The airstrip will be used to provide training for NCC Air Wing cadets in flying small aircraft and there will be facilities for their accommodation. The NCC will provide training to 1,000 cadets at the facility in a year. The NCC’s two-seater Virus SW-80 aircraft will be the first one to land on the airstrip, according to officials. NCC Kerala Deputy Director General Brigadier P.K. Sunilkumar on Wednesday said some more works were to be finished and the plan was to open the airstrip as early as possible. Training purpose “It is for training cadets in microlight aircraft,” he said adding the facilities could be used for the public in emergency situations. “It is a State asset and the government can decide on using it in emergency situations,” he said. This is the first airstrip in the district that has no rail connectivity due to its hilly topography. An NCC official said the district administration could use the airstrip for disaster management requirements. Though an airstrip was earlier planned at Anakkara, near Kumily, it did not materialise. In the meantime, the idea of an NCC airstrip moved on track and is nearing completion despite several hurdles. The construction of the airstrip started on 12 acres allotted by the Revenue Department on May 21, 2017. “The runway is nearing completion and there will be facilities to park aircraft,” said the official. Tarring of the shoulder runway needed to be done and it required only three to six days. All works were expected to be completed by October 20, he added. The airstrip work was being taken up at an estimate cost of Rs. 13 crore. It is learnt that the Civil Aviation Ministry had given the green signal for landing aircraft at the airstrip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nccs-airstrip-at-idukki-nearing-completion/article36909146.ece

09 October 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Creating awareness on child marriage||Child marriage is common among tribespeople, especially the Paniya and Kattunaikar tribes in Wayanad, and has remained part of their custom for many years. In several cases, tribal youths who marry underage girls as per their traditional customs are booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) is preparing to come up with a 45-minute film titled Inja in tribal language to create awareness among tribespeople on the implications of child marriage. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan released the poster of the film on Friday. Several tribesmen ignorant about the stringent provisions under the POCSO Act had wed minor girls keeping with their traditional practice and ended up in jail, said K. Rajesh, sub-judge, Wayanad. Many a time, cases were registered without a formal complaint from the minor girl or her parents, added Mr. Rajesh, who is also Secretary of Wayanad DLSA. Usually such cases are registered after the minor girl is admitted to hospital for delivery. The hospital authorities inform the police, and the latter arrest the husband under the POCSO Act. As many as 250 such cases have been registered in Wayanad district alone from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, said Mr. Rajesh. Though many awareness programmes were conducted by various government agencies and NGOs to create awareness among the tribespeople, they were yet to show results. “Hence, we planned to produce a film in tribal language to make a positive impact,” he added.  Inja focuses on the social and legal problems faced by a minor tribal girl after being married, said Bhaskaran Bathery, the director of the film. ‘Inja’ is the name of the protagonist, and Theertha of Cherumad tribal hamlet in Nenmeni essays the role. The film is being produced by Wayanad DLSA with financial assistance from the Scheduled Tribes Development Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/creating-awareness-on-child-marriage/article36909141.ece

09 October 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||‘Sheep were domesticated in subcontinent’||Researchers at the Central University of Kerala (CUK) have found that domestication of sheep had taken place in the Indian subcontinent, especially in the Indus Valley civilisation regions, in the 6th or 7th millennium BC. A study, led by M. Nagarajan, Assistant professor, Department of Genomic Science, CUK, has found genetic evidence that sheep had been domesticated in the region in contrast to the general belief that they were domesticated then in West Asia alone, and that they had arrived in the Indian subcontinent through migration. Even though India ranks second in terms of sheep population, represented by 44 well-described breeds, genetic diversity and phylogeography of Indian sheep breeds remained poorly understood, particularly the south Indian breed, Dr. Nagarajan told The Hindu . However, the study has provided strong genetic evidence that the Indian subcontinent was one of the domestication centres of the lineage A sheep. When DNA sequences were compared with other breeds across the world, it was found that the Indian sheep haplotypes were unique and highly diverse. The high genetic diversity and statistical analysis suggest that sheep were domesticated in the country. “We are proposing that wild Sheep, O. vignei blanfordi in Mehrgarh [Pakistan], may be a potential progenitor of domestic sheep lineage, and detailed genome sequencing of this wild sheep may further contribute to our understanding of the genetics of domestic sheep,” said Dr. Nagarajan. He added the study has also found that the introduction of sheep ‘lineage B’ into the Indian subcontinent had been through sea route, and not from the Mongolian plateau. Researchers also retrieved the mitochondrial DNA sequences of another 11 breeds for analysis, he added. He said among the south Indian breeds, except for Mandya, all others, notably Bellary, Coimbatore, Hassan, Katchaikatty Black, Nilgri, Ramnad White, and Vembur, were fully encompassed with lineage A, while Kenguri Kilakarsal, Madras Red, Mecheri, and Tiruchy Black breeds, had low occurrences of lineage B mitochondria. In contrast, a majority of individuals of Mandya and Sonadi breeds carried a high frequency of lineage B. The research titled ‘Evidence for independent domestication of sheep mtDNA lineage A in India and introduction of lineage B through Arabian Sea route’ has been published in the Scientific Reports .

A consultancy firm, which was appointed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to ready a detailed project report (DPR), is readying the feasibility report. The firm will suggest ways to add one more lane in four-lane portions by redesigning components of the 45-metre-wide NH Bypass, like vacant space on service roads, which can be added to the main carriageway, sources said. A detailed software-aided survey is being carried out as part of the feasibility study. The firm has submitted an inception report to the NHAI. Land acquisition, if needed, will be minimal, since clearing of encroachments will in itself increase the width of service roads in most areas, they added. The Edappally-Vyttila stretch is largely four-lane, although it carries around one lakh passenger car units daily, traffic that requires minimum eight-lane width. This has been causing acute congestion and accidents. The Vyttila-Aroor stretch has a few six-lane portions thanks to widening of the carriageway and new bridges built over a decade ago. The NH Bypass caters for intra-city, inter/intra-State vehicles, which include national permit, container, tipper, and tanker lorries. This is apart from over a dozen pedestrian-dense junctions on the stretch. Most of them lack signages, pedestrian crossing lines, high-mast lights, and other warning measures. This often causes pedestrian fatalities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/feasibility-report-for-six-laning-of-nh-bypass-by-december/article36909332.ece

Four of the six petitioners —Yakub Purayil, Anoop V. Ahammad, Shameer M.T., and Shanimon — have petitioned State Police Chief Anil Kant in this regard. “When we turned up for giving evidence to the Crime Branch probing the case in Ernakulam a few days ago, two persons came to our hotel at Vyttila. One person, a resident of Kunnamkulam, was known to us and had asked for an appointment to meet us. “But he was accompanied by an unknown person who started issuing threats against naming KPCC chief K. Sudhakaran during television channel debates,” said Mr. Shameer. Subsequently, the petitioners filed a complaint with the Maradu police. They alleged that unknown people kept visiting their homes in Kozhikode when they were away and issued threats to even family members and relatives. A petition was filed at the Pantheerankavu police station as well. “We keep receiving threatening calls from anonymous numbers that seem like from outside the country. So, we have even stopped attending such calls. Then some people try to dissuade us from going ahead with the petition by approaching us through relatives who are Congress supporters,” Mr. Shameer said. The petitioners on Friday also issued notice for defamation to actor Sreenivasan who had allegedly termed the petitioners as fraudsters. That was uncalled for, as none of us even has a petty case against us anywhere, he added. Notwithstanding the alleged threats, the petitioners, however, are resolved to remain steadfast in their complaint against Monson.

Along with the widening, the road will be extended to Padma Junction on M.G. Road and to Chakkaraparambu on NH Bypass. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) is expected to release funds to the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB),  the implementing agency which will develop the road, once the final notification handing over the stretch to the PWD is ready. The PWD’s design wing had readied the detailed project report (DPR) for the widening and extension of the 4-km road. It might be revised, considering the need for a flyover that has been proposed at Kathrikadavu Junction, it is learnt. There were two main obstacles to availing KIIFB funds — the first, the Corporation not formally handing over the road to the PWD, and, the second, the delay in finalising the DPR. Taking note of this, Mayor M. Anilkumar held talks with the then District Collector S. Suhas and steps were taken to ready the DPR. It was followed by a site visit by Mr. Anilkumar, MP Hibi Eden, MLA T.J. Vinod, and District Collector Jafar Malik.  Along with the widening, the road will be extended to Padma Jn. on M.G.

The issue found a mention in a resolution moved by KPOA State committee member E.K. Abdul Jabbar at the 32nd meeting of Ernakulam Rural police held at Aluva Police Society Hall. The resolution, which was unanimously passed at the meeting, stated that policing involved interacting with people from all walks of life. “However, the failure to identify dubious characters among them will prove very costly. Hence, all police officers are requested to be alert and observe caution in such interactions,” read the seventh point in the resolution. Earlier, while inaugurating the meeting, K. Karthick, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural), said the entire force got blamed for one-off incidents and the actions of a few. Mr. Karthik said good officers should assess matters and take corrective actions. KPOA district president M.K. Murali presided over the meeting. Photographs of former Director General of Police Loknath Behera and ADGP Manoj Abraham along with Monson’s allegedly fake antiquities’ collection had recently gone viral on social media.

09 October 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Calicut University for new-gen courses||The Academic Council of Calicut University has decided to request the State government to include new-generation undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the eligibility criteria for government jobs. Graduates in tourism, multimedia, and aquaculture are unable to apply for government jobs, as they are not considered eligible by the Public Service Commission (PSC), the university said here on Friday. The council also urged the PSC to constitute an expert committee to look into recognition of courses for employment in the government sector. Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj, who chaired the council meeting, said a team would visit Lakshadweep on October 21 to expedite continuation of varsity courses and launching of new ones. Rank lists Meanwhile, director of admissions Denoj Sebastian said rank lists would be prepared and submitted to colleges to fill vacancies for undergraduate courses. After the third allotment for admission to undergraduate courses in the varsity, as many as 58,283 seats remain vacant at government, aided and self-financing colleges in five districts. The figure excludes seats in autonomous colleges. The total number of seats available in this academic year is 98,662. Of them, 9,197 are at government colleges, 129 at university centres, 22,959 in the aided sector, and 66,377 seats in the self-financing segment. After the third allotment, the number of seats to be filled in government colleges are 593 in Kozhikode district, 596 in Malappuram, 521 in Palakkad, 471 in Thrissur, and 62 in Wayanad. In the aided sector, of the 9,997 vacant seats, Kozhikode district has 1,418 seats, Malappuram 2,854, Palakkad 1,223, Thrissur 3,628, and Wayanad 874 seats. In the self-financing sector, there are 45,948 vacant seats in five districts. As many as 34,767 seats remained vacant when the admission process got over in 2020, and they included 919 in government colleges and 3,444 in aided colleges. A reason cited was that there were no takers for additional seats allotted in the sports quota for Lakshadweep students. Besides, many students discontinued studies, the university said. In the previous year, there were 22,836 vacant seats.

09 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||State yet to roll out BH series||Fearing loss of revenue, Kerala seems to be delaying the implementation of the Bharat (BH) series registration of vehicles rolled out by the Union Ministry of Road Transport recently. The new rule was introduced on August 28 and registration for the plates commenced on September 15. Anyone who is a government or public sector undertaking employee in the State or Centre is eligible to register his vehicle. An employee of a company in the private sector that has offices in at least four States or Union Territories is also eligible to get the BH number on voluntary basis. Like several counterparts, including neighbouring Karnataka, the Kerala Government wrote to the Centre seeking a temporary suspension in the registration of the BH series in the Dtate. But the Centre has asserted that the new system should be implemented without any delay. Incidentally, Odisha is the first State to implement the new rule. Dealers’ charge Vehicle dealers say several aspirant buyers are postponing their decision to purchase new cars owing to the delaying tactics adopted by the State Government. In fact, the Ministry of Road Transport brought in the digital system of allotting BH series registration to vehicles so that the vehicle owner did not have to go through the red-tapism at transport offices in the States. At present the road tax in Kerala ranges from 9% to 21%, depending on the consolidated price of the vehicle, GST and cess. “The road tax levied in Kerala is one of the highest in the country,” a car dealer said. However, for vehicles registering under the BH series, the road tax will be charged at 8% if the cost of the vehicle is below Rs. 10 lakh. It is 10% for those costing between Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 20 lakh. And for vehicles costing more than Rs. 20 lakh, the tax is 12%. Diesel vehicles will be charged 2% extra and electric vehicles, charged 2% less tax. Also, the road tax would be levied for two years and in multiple of two thereafter unlike the State collecting the upfront tax for 15 years. A boon The new system is a boon for government and private employees who are on transferable jobs. Previously, when a vehicle is registered in a State and kept in another State for more than 12 months it is subject to assignment of new registration. The transfer of registration from one State to another is a complicated and time-consuming process. The owner had to submit a No Objection Certificate from the parent State, assignment of new registration mark after the road tax is paid in the new State and application for refund from the parent State.  Government or public sector undertaking employee in the State or Centre is eligible to register his vehicle||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-yet-to-roll-out-bh-series/article36909155.ece

Viji, the State president of Asanghatitha Meghala Thozhilali Union (AMTU), has received many awards in honour of her work to uphold the dignity of women. However, WINGS (Women Integration and Growth Through Sports) Kerala, a fellow fighter in the field, noticed that she did not have a house or space to keep all the mementos she received from the various receptions that were accorded to her. And, that was when the organisation decided to gift Ms. Viji a house. “There is no better reward for the woman who was at the forefront to uphold our rights to have toilets and also the right to sit at our workplaces,” said Deepa P.M., former secretary of WINGS Kerala. In 2018, the BBC had selected Ms. Viji as one of the 100 women to bring about substantial change in the world. Building a house was, however, no mean task for the organisation. A civic committee was formed with Preman Tharavattath as convenor and Sudha Haridwar as treasurer. Soon, help started pouring in from various quarters. Contributions from common people, ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 10,000 and sometimes even more, were used to purchase three cents of land near Palazhi at a total cost of about Rs. 10 lakh two years ago. Ms. Viji then applied for the Kozhikode Corporation’s funding under PMAY-LIFE project, which added to the amount collected through crowdfunding. Handover on Oct 27 The house, being built at an approximate cost of Rs. 10 lakh, is in the final stages of construction and will be handed over to Ms. Viji on October 27 by WINGS Kerala president N. Vinaya in the presence of secretary Prasanna Parvathi and well-wishers from all over the State, including Father Augustine Vattoli and poet V.M. Girija who played major roles in realising the project. “This is a reward from us out of pure love and respect for the politics that Ms. Viji represents. We hope this will give her the freedom to continue raising her voice before anyone, without having to think about the consequences,” said Ms. Deepa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/womens-rights-activist-to-get-house-of-her-own/article36909131.ece

The COVID-19 protocol has been cited for the delay in completing preliminary hearing in the cases. Besides, the Kerala High Court has to dispose of a petition filed by a notary, C. Vijayakumar, seeking to exclude him from the list of accused, special prosecutor N.K. Unnikrishnan told The Hindu . The police had made Mr. Vijayakumar an accused on the charge of stamping and approving a fake document to help prime accused Jolly Joseph take control of the assets of the family of her husband. The preliminary hearing under Section 226 (opening case for prosecution) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is basically a legal procedure to hear the prosecution and defence before the court officially frames the charges and reads out the chargesheet to the accused. The case relates to Jolly, 47, eliminating two branches of the Ponnamattom family after giving them poison or cyanide-laced food or drink over a period of 14 years. On October 4, 2019 the police had opened the family tombs to examine the reasons behind the mysterious deaths of six persons from a family. The chain of deaths had taken place between 2002 and 2016. Jolly allegedly poisoned to death her mother-in-law, Annamma Thomas, 57, a retired teacher in 2002. Then the family treated it as a natural death. Six years later, her father-in-law, Tom Thomas, 66, died of a mysterious heart failure. In 2011, her husband, Roy Thomas, died in a similar manner. However, the autopsy revealed poisoning as the cause of death. Likewise, Annamma’s brother Mathew Manjadiyil died in 2014. In 2016, Sily, wife of Shaju Zacharias, who is Roy’s cousin and Jolly’s second husband, and Shaju’s one-year-old daughter Alphine also died. A complaint filed by Rojo Thomas, youngest son of Tom Thomas, with Vadakara Rural Superintendent of Police K.G. Simon led to unravelling of the mysterious deaths. The chargesheet in all the cases were submitted in the court last year. Jolly and M.S. Mathew, aka Shaji, who allegedly supplied cyanide to the former are lodged as remand prisoners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/koodathayi-trial-yet-to-begin/article36909204.ece

A unique charity scheme based at Thootha on the Malappuram-Palakkad border offering free wedding dresses for the marriage of the needy is becoming the talk of the town. It is called Nassar’s dress bank. A former Non-Resident Indian (NRI), Mr. Nassar now dedicates a part of his time and resources for the dress bank. He collects wedding dresses from those who are ready to donate, gets them dry-cleaned, and stores them neatly in a shop that he has rented at Thootha. The dresses are displayed as though they are in a textile shop. Those who can not afford wedding dresses can approach Nassar’s dress bank and take any item of their choice for free. “And they don’t have to return it,” said Mr. Nassar. Good response People from different parts of south India are approaching Mr. Nassar, both for donating their wedding dresses, and for borrowing dresses as well. “It came as a surprise to me when I learnt that most women in our areas seldom use their wedding dress after wearing it for a few hours during the function. They keep the expensive dresses just for the sake of memory. When I asked them to donate their wedding dresses, the response I got was tremendous,” said Mr. Nassar. On learning about his unique venture, hundreds came forward to donate their wedding dress. He now has more than 1,000 dresses in his bank. They include saris, frocks, churidars, suits, and Sherwanis. They cost anywhere between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 50,000. “They don’t look like second-hand,” he said. Those who take the bride’s or the groom’s dress have the freedom to keep it or return it after their big day. However, most people prefer to keep it. “For the needy, these dresses may be so dear that they would wear them again on other occasions,” said Mr. Nassar. Focus on privacy He never reveals the identity of the people who collect the wedding dress from his bank. His shop is a little distance away from the Thootha bazaar in order to provide privacy for those who come in search of him. “Everyone has self-esteem. Just because they can’t afford a wedding dress, their plight need not be exposed in society,” said Mr. Nassar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nassars-dress-bank-brightens-bridal-hopes/article36909220.ece

Software malfunction Pointing out that Corporation officials were blaming software malfunction for the murky situation, Mr. Surendran said the IT department had to assume responsibility for the error since 2016. He said CPI(M) leaders were involved in many such scams in the State. This, he said, was the reason why the officials responsible for the diversion of building tax funds were not being arrested. “The Home Department is bound to investigate such a case that has led to the misappropriation of funds remitted by citizens. Such scams could be happening in other local bodies also,” he said. “CPI(M) leaders were behind the embezzlement of SC funds in the Corporation. It is clear that the perpetrators have the backing of higher-ups in power.” Mr. Surendran said the common man could not expect justice from a State Government that shielded racketeers like Monson Mavunkal. The BJP would step up its agitation on the issue till the officials behind the racket were exposed and punished, he added. BJP district president V.V. Rajesh presided.  The Home Department is bound to investigate such a case. Such scams could be happening in other local bodies also. K.

Tonnes of waste foundry mould sand generated at the State Government undertaking Autokast Ltd will now be turned into bricks for the construction sector, courtesy a technique developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) at Pappanamcode here. Autokast managing director Prasad Mathew and NIIST director A. Ajayaghosh signed an agreement for transfer of the know-how to Autokast in the presence of Industries Minister P. Rajeeve on Thursday. This eco-friendly technology can benefit housing schemes such as the LIFE Mission. Cherthala-based Autokast, which manufactures ferrous castings components, generates 600 to 700 tonnes of foundry waste sand every month. Only a fraction of it could be reused, Autokast officials said. The rest would be discarded as waste. Technique NIIST developed the technology to make bricks from the silica sand through a simple, cement-bonded compression moulding technique, Dr. S. Ananthakumar, Chief Scientist, Ceramics Activity Materials Science and Technology Division at NIIST, who headed the project, said. Under the agreement, NIIST will transfer the know-how to Autokast where both the institutions will set up a brick manufacturing plant, designed to produce 4,000 bricks per day. The cement bonding and compression moulding technique can produce high-strength bricks that meet the IS 1077 standards, according to NIIST scientists. The project was part of the ‘Waste to Wealth’ research programme of the CSIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/foundry-waste-sand-in-autokast-to-be-turned-into-bricks/article36909198.ece

Mohamed Riyas on Friday inaugurated the Air Force Museum set up by the Department of Tourism with the technical support of the Indian Air Force (IAF) at the Akkulam Tourist Village here, coinciding with the 89th Foundation Day of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Built at a cost of Rs. 1.97 crore, the museum takes the visitors through a simulated flight experience and has several other features. “This project will be beneficial not only for Akkulam and the capital district but for Kerala Tourism as a whole. The museum gives an opportunity to know more about Indian Air Force. The aircraft-model museum and the flight engine will be a novel experience for visitors,” Mr. Riyas said in his address. The Minister said the caravan policy recently announced by Kerala Tourism had opened a new front offering immense possibilities. “The caravan parks will generate employment for local people. The Government will extend all support like quick approvals for electricity connection for setting up caravan parks. Caravan Tourism will also provide plenty of opportunities for local artistes to perform before tourists,” Mr. Riyas said. Air Marshal J. Chalapati, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Air Command (SAC), IAF, was the chief guest on the occasion. In his address, Air Marshal Chalapati said, “We have two objectives in establishing the museum. One is to make it highly attractive to visitors and the second is to motivate the youth of Kerala to join the IAF. The flight simulator installed here will give a realistic experience for visitors.” Kadakampally Surendran, MLA, presided over the function. Spread over two floors, the museum of aircraft models has features including a flight cockpit model with simulator.

09 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Pole-mounted EV charging stations set up in Kozhikode||The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is going in for 'pole-mounted charging stations' for electric vehicles in a big way. Set to be launched with 10 charging stations mounted on electricity poles in Kozhikode city on Saturday, the programme will be extended to other parts of the State as well with 1,000 units in Phase II. The 10 charging units in Kozhikode will benefit electric autorickshaws and two-wheelers, the KSEB said. Auto drivers can use their mobile phones to make the payment. A 'full charge' costs Rs. 70, which will enable the autorickshaws to run 120-130 km. 600 e-autos Kozhikode district has around 600 electric autorickshaws, the highest in the State. At present, the operators charge the batteries overnight at their houses. However, once the battery runs out after plying the given distance, they find it difficult to re-charge them as charging stations are few in number. This is where the pole-mounted units come in handy. Every time the pole-mounted facility is used, details such as the time taken, the volume of electricity used, and the amount remitted will be automatically passed on to the KSEB and the driver. Kozhikode-based start-up Charge MOD developed the charging equipment and software. The pole-mounted stations were set up at a cost of Rs. 2.52 lakh sourced from the State Government's e-mobility promotion fund. Economical option According to the KSEB, an autorickshaw running on petrol would use up 14 litres to cover 120 km. An electric auto would need only seven units of electricity to cover the same. A petrol auto plying, on an average, 3,600 km a month would run up a fuel bill of Rs. 13,500. Whereas, an electric auto can cover the same distance at just Rs. 2,200, the KSEB said. Electricity Minister K. Krishnankutty will inaugurate the pole-mounted stations in Kozhikode city at 9.30 a.m. on Saturday. The KSEB has also kicked off the tendering process for Phase II where 1,000 pole-mounted stations will be set up in various districts.  The programme will be extended to other parts of the State as well with 1,000 units in Phase II||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pole-mounted-ev-charging-stations-set-up-in-kozhikode/article36909150.ece

Hundreds of private operators have been forced to discontinue their services due to COVID-19-induced financial constraints. The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will secure these buses on wet lease so that adequate number of vehicles are available for the Grama Vandi services, Minister for Transport Antony Raju informed the Assembly on Friday. Annual lease The Grama Vandi initiative, to be spearheaded by the KSRTC, is designed to connect rural areas of the State that face connectivity problems. Private-owned buses will be secured on an annual lease. All concessions available for KSRTC buses will be applicable to the proposed services. Inter-district services are under consideration. In areas inaccessible to big buses, 18 to 32-seater vehicles will be used, Mr. Raju said. The Transport Department is collaborating with the Local Self-Government Department for rolling out the services. The services will be operated on routes recommended by local self-government institutions (LSGIs) at ticket fares determined by the KSRTC. The timings will be decided by the local bodies. On the other hand, the diesel expenses have to be met by the local bodies. Private entities and organisations can sponsor the services, the Minister said. The KSRTC has decided to collaborate with the Civil Supplies Department for rolling out ‘Ration Shop on Wheels.’ The mobile shops will benefit communities, including tribal settlements in remote areas, the Transport Minister said. The Civil Supplies Department has given approval for 10 such ration shops. Steps have been taken to start Labham markets of the Civil Supplies Department, Kudumbashree hotels, and offices of various departments in vacant spaces in KSRTC depots, he said. Bevco outlets Discussions are in progress with the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) for opening liquor outlets in KSRTC-owned spaces, other than KSRTC depots and bus stations, Mr. Raju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-to-wet-lease-private-buses-for-rural-services/article36909215.ece
09 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||LDF Govt. has abandoned pandemic-hit citizens: UDF||The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition on Friday walked out of the Assembly accusing the Left Democratic Front (LDF) Government of adopting a lackadaisical hands-off approach to COVID-19 management. Seeking the leave of the House to introduce an adjournment motion to discuss the government's "abandonment" of citizens mid-pandemic, Congress legislator P.C. Vishnunath asked Health Minister Veena George to state unambiguously whether the second COVID-19 wave in Kerala had abated. The government had "suspiciously" kept the findings of the sero survey secret for over a fortnight. Each day, the state reported more than 12,000 new infections. “Daily 100 to 150 persons are dying from COVID in Kerala,” he said. About 60% of the cases reported in India are from Kerala. As per a government estimate, almost 40% of COVID-19 deaths in Kerala were due to “delay in getting patients to hospitals.” The statistics show that the COVID-19 reporting had failed. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan claimed that the actual COVID-19 death toll was far higher than what was officially reported. The second wave is rapidly sliding into a potentially ruinous catastrophe, catching the State Government sitting. Minister’s stance Ms. George said Kerala was particularly vulnerable to pestilence given its high number of citizens with chronic and severe comorbidities, the population density, close-quarter living and a sizeable number of senior citizens. However, no patient has died due to wanting medical care or supplementary oxygen in Kerala. Kerala's COVID-19 reporting was robust and flawless. Hence, the relatively high numbers compared to other States, she said. Kerala had ramped up vaccination and extended free medical care to COVID-19 infected persons, irrespective of their income bracket or social background. The State has invested Rs. 400 crore in COVID-19 mitigation efforts. It won the respect of the nation for preventing deaths and keeping infections at bay. The government would rectify anomalies, if any, in COVID-19 death reporting. No eligible family would lose out on the ex gratia financial assistance to the kin of the COVID-19 dead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-abandoned-citizens-mid-pandemic-oppn/article36909216.ece

Abdurahiman has said. Replying to questions in the Assembly on Friday, Mr. Abdurahiman said studies carried out so far had not shown that the project would impact the environment adversely. The project would not cause pollution, as the latest technologies would be in use, he said. Propaganda against the project was not founded on fact, the Minister said. “For example, in the Malabar region, it is being alleged that around 100 metres of land would be acquired alongside the tracks. In reality, only two metres, or a maximum of 25 metres would be needed,” he said. The State Government expected to kick off the surveys for acquiring land for the SilverLine project soon, Mr. Abdurahiman said. The government had permitted the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (K-RAIL) to mobilise Rs. 2,100 crore for meeting the land acquisition costs via the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). SilverLine, connecting Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, was aimed at reducing the travel time to less than four hours, from the present 10 to 12 hours. The project was essential for the State, as the Railways had made it clear that more trains could not be introduced in the existing rail network, the Minister said. Sabari Rail Project On the Sabari Rail Project, Mr. Abdurahiman said that the Government expected to implement it in a time-bound manner. The Railways had now asked the State to submit the revised estimate, he said. The State Government had conveyed to the Central Government its willingness to bear half the project cost, he said.  V.

09 October 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||A survival ‘act’ during the pandemic||Marks , an interactive performance by Abheesh Sasidharan and team, was staged in collaboration with the School of Drama of Calicut University on the Aranattukara campus near Thrissur from October 4 to 8. The unique performance-based artistic venture was a homage to the legendary British architect Laurie Baker, the architect of some of the versatile and diverse structures on the Aranattukara campus. Architecture, theatre, nature, performance and people came together in an intertwined aesthetic and polyphonic experience through the staging. “The whole theatre community at the School of Drama was involved in the elaborate and moving performance. In it, techno-art and conservationist politics merge with human rights issues and a critique of hierarchical society,” explains Sasidharan, who has done his PhD in theatre and performance at the Hyderabad Central University. Contemporary theme Animalisation and demonisation of the human and the biopower and resistance potential of the subjugated form a key contemporary theme that is theatrically explored and enacted in intricate and multi-sensory ways in the performance, observes Ajay S. Sekhar, theatre critic and assistant professor, Department of English, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. “The concern for humanity, life at large and ecology are thrust areas of this key artistic intervention. The very survival and sustenance of life during the contagion and the current conjecture involving totalitarian and monopoly formations across the world become the context,” Dr. Sekhar points out. Performance idiom A new performance idiom and language of collaborative and participatory action were evolved through the exploration of the non-visual and auditory stimuli. Touch, smell and temperature differences and sensations were utilised dexterously in the production. “ Marks leaves deep and engaging imprints of life and art onto the body and the mind of the audience as they are guided through the dark interiors and star-lit exteriors. The natural vegetation, huge and meandering mango trees and other wild plants that engulf the campus become the organic arena and real-life props of the performance,” says Dr. Sekhar.  This collective and collaborative artwork involves and actively engages the audience in creating the music of life and collective survival in the time of the pandemic, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-survival-act-during-the-pandemic/article36909310.ece

09 October 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP plans prolonged agitation to highlight agri crisis in Anantapur||The Telugu Desam Party unit of Anantapur on Friday chalked out a plan for a prolonged agitation to highlight the agrarian crisis in the district following the rain deficit for 50 days in the current kharif season. Due to the crisis arising out of the failure of the groundnut crop in majority of the 11 lakh hectares where the crop was sown this year, 17 farmers had reportedly committed suicide in the past 45 days, said Rayalaseema Coordinator Kalava Srinivasulu and Uravakonda MLA Payyavula Keshav at a press conference after the coordination committee meeting held for two hours in the party office. ‘Field-level survey need of the hour’ “It is surprising that neither the Chief Minister nor the Agriculture Minister had spoken on the issue so far and none of the agriculture department officials visited the district to understand the crisis first-hand,” said Mr. Kalava Srinivasulu. He said that constituency in-charge persons of the party were asked to make a field-level survey of the damaged crop and let the agriculture and revenue officials know about it. “We will raise our voices at the district headquarters against the government for not paying Rs. 936 crore input subsidy for the 2018 kharif crop loss,” said Mr. Keshav Srinivasulu, adding that no effort has been made to get insurance for the crop. The government had paid only Rs. 221 crore in 2020 for the loss suffered by 2.29 lakh farmers in 2019, which does not compensate even 10% of their input cost, he observed. The party leaders said since the growing of groundnut had turned non-remunerative, the area sown had come down from 12.26 lakh acres in 2020 to 11 lakh acres this year, and even 50% of that has not been registered under the e-crop booking, which will not help the farmers when they seek compensation from the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-plans-prolonged-agitation-to-highlight-agri-crisis-in-anantapur/article36908805.ece
09 October 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. ‘inefficiency’ led to true-up charges: Payyavula||The State government’s ‘inefficiency’ has led to the imposition of true up charges on citizens, alleged Public Accounts Committee(PAC) Chairman Payyavula Keshav and demanded immediate release of Rs. 20,000 crore to the discoms. At a press conference here on Friday, the TDP leader said the State government had stopped buying power from indigenous sources like the Hinduja Power, stopped production at Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant and running VTPS at Vijayawada at 60% capacity, all of which was forcing it to buy power at a higher rate. The subsidy amount for the agriculture connections to the tune of Rs. 12,000 crore was not paid by the government. Another Rs. 8,000 crore was due from government departments, he said, adding that if paid, true up charges need not be collected.  Not denying that there were some dues during the TDP period also, he said the current government was splurging on purchasing power instead of saving money through purchase of indigenously available power. The TDP leader alleged that the aim was to handover power generation to Adani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-inefficiency-led-to-true-up-charges-payyavula/article36908810.ece
09 October 2021||Belagavi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Girl’s parents among 8 held for man’s murder||The Belagavi police have arrested 10 persons on the charge of murdering Arbaz Mulla, 25, of Khanapur allegedly over his interfaith relationship with a girl. Investigation has revealed that the parents of the girl had paid money to kill the boy, said the police. Apart from Eerappa Kumbar, 54, and Susheela Eerappa Kumbar, 42, the girl’s parents, the arrested include Pundalik alias Maharaj Nagappa Mutagekar of Ottoli village, 39. The victim’s body was found on the railway track on September 28, bearing stab injuries. A press note by Lakshman Nimbaragi, Superintendent of Police, stated that Najeema Sheikh, the victim’s mother, had given a complaint to the railway police that her son was killed for his relationship with a girl from her neighbourhood in Khanapur. She had suspected the involvement of three persons, including the girl’s father, “Maharaj”, and one person called “Birje”. “Investigation led the team members to uncover a conspiracy by the accused and then their arrest,” a member of the investigation team said. The parents had agreed to pay Rs. 5 lakh to get the boy out of the way. As an advance, they had paid Rs. 50,000 to Mutagekar, said the police. Investigators identified “Maharaj” as Pundalik Mutagekar and “Birje” as Praveen Pujari, who is also among those arrested. Among the accused, Mutagekar is a taluk president of Sri Ram Sena - Hindustan (SRS-H), a right-wing outfit active in Belagavi district. All other accused, except the parents and Qutbuddin Allabaksh Bepari, are either followers or members of the organisation. However, a senior police officer said there was no evidence, as of now, to link the offence to the affiliation of the members. Mediated a meeting Mr. Nimbaragi told journalists that Mutagekar and his followers had mediated a meeting between Arbaz and his mother, along with the Kumbar family members in Khanapur on September 26. The boy was asked to stop seeing the girl. Ramakant Konduskar, district president of the SRS-H, admitted that the accused are members of his organisation. “They have been agitating against interfaith affairs and marriages, but they will never kill anyone,” he told The Hindu . Breakaway faction For many years, Mr. Konduskar was the trusted lieutenant of Pramod Muthalik, the founder of Sri Rama Sene. After the duo developed differences, Mr. Konduskar broke away and formed his own organisation, calling it SRS-H. Mr. Konduskar has unsuccessfully contested two Legislative Assembly elections from Belagavi in the past. Meanwhile, Latif Khan Pathan, AIMIM State unit secretary, said they put off a demonstration scheduled for Friday in which their leader Asaduddin Owaisi was supposed to participate. “This was after the SP assured us of prompt action against the accused,” he said. He has demanded a ban on SRS-H and its affiliated organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/girls-parents-among-8-held-for-mans-murder/article36908737.ece
09 October 2021||CHINTOOR (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Konda Badi, a tribe’s temple of learning||Authorities of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA-Chintoor) have set up Konda Badi, a residential school that provides access to primary education for children of the Konda Reddy tribe of nine habitations, on the hills in East Godavari Agency. The Konda Reddy tribe is a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Andhra Pradesh. The school was opened at Kutooru Gatti habitation in Kunavaram mandal on Thursday to provide educational facilities to 149 families of the tribe living on the hills. This is the second Konda Badi in the Chintoor Agency. The first school was established at Maamilla Banda habitation last year. Until now, the Konda Reddy tribal children from the nine habitations used to walk for about one and half hour to reach their school down the hills, and it had led to increase in school dropouts. “Konda Badi is a residential school. It provides accommodation, food and education for the children, including the Out Of School Children. It offers education from class one to three,” ITDA Chintoor Project Officer A. Venkata Ramana told The Hindu . On Day One, 30 students enrolled themselves in the school. It has two teachers and each one attends the school every alternate day. The Village Volunteer is the in-charge of the school. Enrolment drive “We will visit every family in the nine habitations with at least 130 to 140 children in the school-going age to persuade them to send their children to the school,” added Mr. Venkata Ramana. The maximum number of families of a Konda Reddy tribal habitation on the hills does not exceed 25. Given the terrain, running the school is a Herculean task. For the Out Of School children, bridge courses are offered and later they would be admitted to nearby Ashram school to continue their education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/konda-badi-a-tribes-temple-of-learning/article36909259.ece

Addressing the media at the Nindra mandal headquarters, Ms. Roja said, as the two panels had come out with their respective manifestos, she would exercise her franchise in favour of the best one that would be useful to the movie artistes. “The MAA election campaign reached high-voltage proportion on the lines of a political election,” she said in a lighter vein.

With supporters of major political parties’ candidates turning up in large numbers, police had a tough time to streamline and stagger them for smooth conduct of the process. Representatives of suspended field assistants of MGNREGS gave tense moments to the police when they tried to file nominations as independent candidates in large numbers. While they accused the police of sabotaging their attempts to file nominations papers by “deliberately preventing them in the guise of rules”, the latter replied that they were “only enforcing the rules imposed by the Election Commission ”. After arguments with the police who barricaded the 100 yards stretch to Returning Officer’s office, they were finally allowed. A total of 61 candidates filed 85 nomination papers. With some of them filing multiple sets of papers, the total number of nomination papers touched 85. It is said the final tally of candidates in the fray would come down with some of them withdrawing from the contest and papers of some getting rejected during scrutiny. The 500 yard stretch of Huzurabad main road on Karimnagar-Warangal highway witnessed huge crowds with candidates of main political parties walking in with their top leaders and accompanied by activists. Ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party nominee Gellu Srinivas Yadav, who already filed his first set of nomination papers, was accompanied by Minister Harish Rao and nominated MLC P. Kaushik Reddy. Congress candidate Balmoori Venkata Narsinga Rao, who already filed one set of papers, marched in along with Congress leaders Ponnam Prabhakar and Damodar Raj Narsimha. Towards the end, Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Eatala Rajender arrived along with Union Minister for Culture, Tourism and N-E Development G. Kishan Reddy. Huge crowds gathered by the time Karimnagar MP and Bharatiya Janata Party state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar reached the place. BJP workers in large numbers tried to march along with their candidate raising slogans but police scuttled their efforts. With large number of nomination papers received, authorities had difficulty in clearing all of them quickly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/85-nominations-filed-for-huzurabad-bypoll/article36909105.ece

Mr. Owaisi said the management of projects going into the hands of river boards would harm the interests of the State in the matter of water utilisation in which Telangana was meted out with grave injustice for long, particularly in the combined Andhra Pradesh dispensation. He suggested the government to lead an all-party delegation to Delhi for meeting the Prime Minister and Minister for Jal Shakti to retain the State’s control over the projects. The Chief Minister said he had met the Prime Minister and Home Minister on the issue during his recent visit to Delhi and requested them to postpone the date of effect of project going under the control of the river boards.

09 October 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Elections are fought on ideology and not on emotions, says BJP||Ahead of the by-election to the Badvel (SC) Assembly constituency, the BJP has said that elections are fought on ideology and good governance and not on sentiments and emotions. The statement assumes significance in the backdrop of the YSRCP pitting D. Sudha, widow of incumbent MLA Venkata Subbaiah, whose death caused the by-election. BJP’s top brass, including national secretaries Sunil Deodhar and Y. Satya Kumar, State president Somu Veerraju and vice-president C. Adinarayana Reddy descended on Badvel in support of party candidate P. Suresh, who filed his nomination papers on Friday. Addressing the media later, the BJP leaders accused the YSRCP of cheating the people in the name of Navaratnalu. Calling the election a fight between “corruption-ridden YSRCP and the service-oriented BJP,” Mr. Veerraju appealed to the voters to wisely choose what they wanted. He wondered what development could the ruling party showcase in Badvel, which had always remained backward. In the same vein, Mr. Veerraju flayed the TDP for opting out of the race in the name of sentiment. “The Constitution has clearly stated the importance of contest during elections. Not contesting in favour of the family of the incumbent MLA is not an option. The BJP is firmly against family politics, and hence has chosen to be in the fray,” he said, adding that the JSP would be requested to campaign in support of the BJP candidate. The BJP leaders also advised the voters to decline the “alluring offers” likely to be made by the ruling YSRCP in a “bid to cover up its failures.” “The YSRCP will use its money bags, muscle power and official machinery to wreak havoc in the coming days. We request the voters not to succumb to such offers,” Mr. Veerraju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/elections-are-fought-on-ideology-and-not-on-emotions-says-bjp/article36909262.ece

09 October 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Paddy ryots to get compensation for failure of ‘Amulya’ variety||The State government has come to the rescue of the farmers who have cultivated Amulya paddy variety in East Godavari district this kharif season (2021-22) and are incurring loses due to the advanced flowering stage by 30 days when compared to the actual crop duration. “The government will ensure compensation for farmers by the respective seed companies. The government will also offer the financial aid to the farmers,” said Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu. The farmers complained that the Amulya variety seed was supplied to them by two companies – Mahendra Seeds and Warangal Seeds—and the variety cultivated in more than 6,000 acres in nine mandals reported advanced crop duration. Farmers of Kakinada Rural, Samarlakota, Peddapuram, Kirlampudi, Pithapuram, Gollaprolu, Uppada Kothapalli, Prathipadu and Sankavaram cultivated the variety. In response to the complaints, the State government constituted an expert team comprising the scientists from the Andhra Pradesh Rice Research Institute (APRRI) at Maruteru, Regional Agriculture Research (RARS) at Peddapuram, and the officials of Agriculture Department to study the variety. The expert team has submitted a report to the government this week, confirming the advance crop duration of the variety by 30 days when compared to the recommended crop duration of 140 days. Th team also estimated nearly 50% fall in the yield. The advanced flowering became a hurdle pertaining to early harvesting and transportation of the yield from the field. It is learnt that the farmers have voluntarily preferred the ‘Amulya’ variety. Mr. Kannababu on Thursday asked the Agriculture Department officials to identify the affected farmers. The farmers were told to go for the seed varieties being supplied through the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBK).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/paddy-ryots-to-get-compensation-for-failure-of-amulya-variety/article36909283.ece

09 October 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC quashes detention of Swapna under COFEPOSA||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Friday quashed the preventive detention of Swapna Suresh, accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (COFEPOSA) Act, 1974. The Bench comprising Justice A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Mohammed Nias C.P. passed the verdict on a petition filed by Kumari Prabha, mother of Swapna, seeking to produce the detenue now in the Women’s Prison and Correctional Home, Attakulangara, Thiruvananthapuram, challenging the preventive detention order. Despite the High Court verdict, Swapna will continue to remain in jail as she is yet to get bail in a case registered by the National Investigation Agency against her. The court, however, dismissed the petition filed by the mother of P.S. Sarith, another accused, against the preventive detention order.  The Bench observed that the omission to consider the Special Court’s order was fatal in the facts of the case. The order could have significantly affected the decision of the detaining authority on the issue of whether the detenue, already in custody, was likely to be enlarged on bail. The court added that rejection of the bail application by the Special Court considering the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case, together with the fact that no fresh bail application had been filed by the detenue till the date of the detention order ought to have engaged the attention of the detaining authority. The authority ought to have given reasons as to why, despite these facts, it felt that detention under the COFEPOSA Act was necessary. The court, therefore, held that detention was bad in the eye of law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-quashes-detention-of-swapna-under-cofeposa/article36908742.ece
09 October 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Govt. diverting funds meant for scholarships’||Former Tirupati MP Chinta Mohan has alleged that the current YSR Congress Party government was diverting all the Central funds meant for the SC/ST Corporations and for scholarships to 80 lakh students, including the SCs, STs. At a press conference here on Friday, the former MP set a deadline of November 4 (Deepavali) to the State government to provide financial assistance to people from the SC and ST communities for revenue-generating activities and transfer scholarship amounts to the students so that they could pursue their studies properly. “Congress will stage a protest if the YSRCP government fails to give the two-year dues to both the categories of socially disadvantaged people,” he said. Making a scathing attack on the BJP government for enormously increasing the prices of diesel and petrol, which have breached the Rs. 100 barrier, Mr. Chinta Mohan said 10 years ago when the Congress was in power at the Centre, the prices were very low and current rates represent a three-fold increase. These economic inequalities have gone to such an extent that for many earning Rs. 100 a day had become very difficult, while the haves were earning in crores, which could lead to unwanted repercussions in the society. About making Kurnool the Judicial Capital of Andhra Pradesh, he said it was not in the hands of the State government, but the A.P.

The accused identified as Damodar, working in the Raghavendra Mutt at Matralayam, was arrested on Friday on the charges of sexually harassing a minor. According to police, the family from Karnataka had a darshan at Guru Raghavendra Swamy temple on Thursday and stayed in a lodge near the mutt. Damodar, staying adjacent to the lodge, allegedly lured the minor on the pretext of buying her some snacks and took her to the room in temple quarters. When Damodar allegedly tried to sexually harass her, the girl screamed, which alerted other devotees, who rushed to the spot and rescued the girl. They then informed the police immediately about the incident and handed over the girl to her parents. The police took the accused into custody. A case under Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) and Section 354(A) of IPC had been filed based on the complaint lodged by the victim’s family members.

09 October 2021||Mangaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Boy accidentally shot at by father dies||The 16-year-old boy, who was hit by a bullet when his father Rajesh Prabhu opened fire at two of his employees on October 5, passed away in a private hospital here on Friday. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that the boy died at around 5 a.m. He was an SSLC student. The body was cremated at Boloor crematorium after autopsy at the Government Wenlock Hospital. His father, who was arrested on Thursday, attended the cremation with court’s permission. The police said that when Prabhu opened fire outside his logistics firm, Vaishnavi X’press Cargo Private Limited at Morgan’s Gate here, with a licenced weapon, he missed the target (his two employees). One of the bullets hit Sudheendra in the head. On the night of October 5, Prabhu complained of chest pain and was admitted to the private hospital where Sudheendra was undergoing treatment. After he was discharged on October 7, the police said, he was arrested for offences under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of Indian Penal Code, and Section 30 of the Arms Act. When he was produced in the II JMFC Court, his counsel filed an application seeking permission to admit his client to hospital for further treatment. The court granted permission and he was re-admitted to the private hospital. Earlier, on October 5, Prabhu and Sudheendra went to the office on learning that two of his employees had had a heated exchange of words with Prabhu’s wife Shantala over payment of Rs. 4,000. While Sudheendra is said to have slapped the workers, Prabhu reportedly opened two rounds of fire from his licenced 0.32 bore pistol. One of the bullets hit Sudheendra in the head.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/boy-accidentally-shot-at-by-father-dies/article36908748.ece
09 October 2021||NAGAPATTINAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Teacher wheels TV set to students’ homes in T.N.||A middle school teacher here has bought a flat-screen television set and fastened it to a wheelchair to take it around the streets to give children access to Kalvi TV, the government’s educational channel. The teacher found that at least 50% of the students of the Panchayat Union Middle School, Nimmelineppathur in Sirkazhi, did not have access to any educational material and decided to take matters into his own hands. A majority of the residents of Nimmelineppathur are migrant labourers who travel to other States for work. The remaining are farmworkers. Their children are left with their relatives when the parents go to work. In many houses, there is no television set, and the families that have one do not have the money to recharge or pay electricity bills. “Now that the COVID-19 lockdown has been lifted, the parents have all gone to work, leaving these children with no way to learn,” said S. Srinivasan, the teacher. He decided to purchase a television set and take it around to the students so that they can learn from their homes, or at a nearby place. The work began two months ago. After purchasing the parts separately and assembling them on his own, Mr. Srinivasan began wheeling it around Nimmelineppathur. The contraption consists of a television, a portable modem for internet connection and a USB drive with educational material stored in it. Mr. Srinivasan goes to one street a day and spends a few hours allowing the children to watch the videos played on Kalvi TV. He borrows electricity from the house near where he teaches — usually under a tree or a spot with shade where at least 30 students gather. “Sometimes there is no internet so the channel cannot be accessed. To avoid such a situation, I have downloaded the video classes, rhymes and other material into a pen drive,” he said. After the videos are played, he explains the material that was taught and provides clarifications. The cost of the rig is Rs. 28,000, which Mr. Srinivasan spent from his salary. He now plans to buy a battery to ensure that the TV set can be played without electricity and also digital tablets which he can use for teaching.  Now that the COVID-19 lockdown has been lifted, the parents have all gone to work, leaving these children with no way to learn S.

09 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala adds 7,000 deaths to COVID toll||The Health Department decided to add 7,000 deaths due to COVID-19, which occurred in the State from the beginning of the pandemic last year to mid-June 2021 and which had been ‘missing,’ to the current official list of deaths, Health Minister Veena George said in the Assembly on Friday. The Opposition and media had been clamouring for the State Government to come clean on the actual number of deaths. The allegation was that the State Government was wilfully keeping out hundreds of deaths from its official list for claiming that the State had the lowest mortality in the country. Several cases dropped It was pointed out that several deaths, which had occurred in the post-COVID continuum, after the patient had tested negative for COVID, had been dropped from the official list While the Minister had maintained that there was no wilful omission from the list , it was following the Supreme Court’s directive regarding compensation for COVID victims that the State was forced to go over the deaths once again. Though there was speculation that 5,000 to 13,000 deaths were missing from the list, the State Government had now confirmed the number of “missing” deaths as 7,000. Ms. George said these deaths were set aside because of incomplete documentation. Since June 16 this year, all COVID deaths were being reported directly from districts in an online portal. ‘Nothing to hide’ Ms. George said the State Government had nothing to hide and that the 7,000 “missing” deaths had surfaced following own inquiry after complaints. The districts have been directed to publish the list of these 7,000 deaths and these would be added to the current list of declared COVID deaths, which as on Friday, stands at 26,072. The State’s actual number of COVID deaths is likely to go up further now that the Centre has issued new guidelines that a person’s death, occurring within 30 days of him/her testing positive for COVID, should be treated as death due to COVID and given compensation. Ms. George said the Government had created an online portal where the public can check the list of deaths. From October 10, applications for issuing official COVID-19 death documents and for inclusion of any missing names would be accepted, either through the online portal or directly from primary health centres. Grievance redressal Every grievance would be redressed within 30 days and no families eligible for receiving compensation as directed by the Supreme Court would be left out, Ms. George said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-adds-7000-deaths-to-covid-toll/article36908749.ece

Addressing the mediapersons here on Friday, constituency in-charge K. Kiran Rayal accused the government of tacitly encouraging land grabbing by its own leaders, indiscriminate sand mining and clandestine transportation out of the bordering district into the neighbouring States. “The ruling party MLAs with no proven credentials are today making tall promises, hollow statements, abusive comments and using filthy language against Opposition leaders.

09 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu slams police for notices to TDP leaders||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Friday said it was not possible for the drug mafia in the State to establish direct links with the 'gangs' in Afghanistan without the support of “high and influential people” in the State. Speaking after formally welcoming the ruling YSR Congress Party leaders and activists from Kanigiri in Prakasam district who joined the TDP under the leadership of former MLA Ugra Narasimha Reddy, Mr. Naidu asked how was it possible for an ordinary person like Machavaram Sudhakar of Aashi Trading Company to open direct channels with the Afghan heroin mafia. “The investigating agencies should nab the bigwigs in the State who are behind the illegal activities of Sudhakar. The Andhra Pradesh mafia has emerged as a threat not just to the State but to the whole country,” he said. The TDP chief said that people gave “one chance” to the YSRCP believing in its election promises. But they were now vexed with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s “misrule fraught with corruption and anarchy”. He slammed the police for issuing notices to the TDP leaders, instead of nabbing the gangsters and mafia gangs. ‘Not afraid of suppression’ Referring to the notice served on former MLA Dhulipalla Narendra by the Kakinada police, the former Chief Minister said instead of “pleasing their political bosses, the police should explain what led to the burning of the boats under suspicious circumstances”. He said the TDP was not afraid of such suppression. He also slammed the government for imposing tax on garbage. Mr. Naidu said the Jagan Government had ruined the mega projects of Amaravati and Polavaram that could have changed the fortunes of the people of the State. The Chief Minister had destroyed the Rs. 2 lakh crore worth capital city project that Amaravati was and the crucial Polavaram project had not made any headway under the YSRCP rule, he said. Earlier, Mr. Naidu opened a grievance cell at the TDP central office for receiving bills pertaining to the Neeru-Chettu programme, pending for payment for last two and half years. He said the TDP would fight legally for payment of the nearly Rs. 1,277 crore pending bills across the State. Bills worth another Rs. 500 crore were also pending, for which the tokens were not generated so far, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-slams-police-for-notices-to-tdp-leaders/article36909402.ece

09 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VSP agitation will help save other PSUs, says Raja||The long-drawn struggle of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) workers assumes great significance “as saving VSP will pave the way for saving the other PSUs in the country,” CPI national secretary D. Raja has said. Mr. Raja was in the city on Friday to participate in the State-level conference of the party. The CPI leader called on the VSP workers who had been staging a relay hunger strike for nearly 240 days at Kurmannapalem here under the aegis of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee opposing the Cabinet decision on strategic sale of the plant. Addressing the workers, Mr. Raja lashed out at the “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-people policies” of the Modi government, and described it as a government “for the corporates and by the corporates” as it was bent on destroying the public sector, which he said was the “backbone of our nation.” ‘Modern temples’ Heavy industries had been set up during the tenure of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who had described them as “modern temples.” Similarly, public sector banks had been asked to advance huge amounts of loans to the corporate sector, and the private promoters were turning “wilful defaulters,” plunging the banks into losses, Mr. Raja observed. Recalling that the public sector banks were responsible for saving India during the global economic crisis in 2008, he said the Centre had recently announced the National Monetisation Policy, which could have disastrous consequences for the nation. Farmers’ stir in U.P. Referring to the alleged mowing down of farmers in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Raja said it was unfortunate that any form of dissent against the government was not being allowed. The farmers had been agitating for more than 10 months seeking repeal of the farm laws, but the Union government was not bothered, he alleged. Recalling his visit to the Gangavaram Port in the past, Mr. Raja alleged that the Centre was now in the process of handing it over to the Adani Group. Similarly, airports were being handed over to “crony capitalists,” Mr. Raja alleged. ‘Unity is need of the hour’ He called upon all political parties and trade unions in Andhra Pradesh to unite against the “disastrous policies of the Modi government,” which would spell doom for the nation. He was optimistic that the united struggle would make the Centre reverse its decision on VSP. Porata committee leaders D. Adinarayana, Mantri Rajasekhar, J. Ayodhya Ram, Gandham Venkata Rao, K. Satyanarayana Rao, A. Masen Rao, J. Ramakrishna, Gangavaram Gopi, and Neerukonda Ramachandra Rao, and corporator A.J. Stalin were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-steel-plant-agitation-will-help-save-other-psus-says-raja/article36908751.ece
09 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chances of third wave in the district not ruled out: experts||The COVID-19 positivity rate in the district is currently hovering around 1%. It has not yet come down to zero till date, as it had happened after the first wave, and still the daily cases are oscillating between 30 and 60 cases. But experts say that the possibility of a third is coming down, but not ruled out. According to the experts, the district is now entering the most critical phase with the festival season around. “This is the festival period and we have festivals of mass gathering coming up such as the Dasara, Deepavali and Christmas. The scenario is topped up with the marriage season and the winter setting in. If we can bring down the positivity rate or at least see that the present level is maintained, then we can say that the impending third wave is averted. That is why we cannot rule out the possibility of the third wave, till the festive season is over,” said District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. District Collector A. Mallikarjuna was also of the similar opinion. “We cannot rule out the occurrence of a third wave, but four aspects such as vaccination, awareness, preparedness and herd immunity, might be the negating factors. We have already vaccinated about 41 lakh people in the district, which includes 13 lakh who have taken both the doses. Our target is to complete vaccination for all the eligible people above 18 years before December,” he said. To boost up the testing facility, two RT-PCR labs have been set up in Anakapalle and Narsipatnam. “The labs are ready and both will deliver results as per the gold standards. We are awaiting the approval of NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) to get them operational,” said the District Collector. Each of the laboratories can conduct at least 1,000 tests per day and this apart the district has DRDL at KGH, which can perform over 5,000 tests per day. There are about five private laboratories with RT-PCR facilities in the district, apart from TrueNat and Rapid Antigen test kits. Keeping the possible third wave in mind and festive season, the district administration will be enforcing ‘no mask-no entry’ at RK Beach. In a day or two the order will be passed and people will not be allowed into RK Beach or any of the beaches without mask. “We already imposing fine of Rs. 100 on individual and Rs. 1,000 on establishments, if people are seen without masks at any public place and this will be strictly followed,” said the District Collector. 43 new cases The district recorded 43 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours ending Friday morning, taking the cumulative tally to 1,57,458. No COVID-19 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, hence the death toll stands at 1,090.

09 October 2021||HUZURABAD (Karimnagar District),TELANGANA||Parties plunge into campaigning||Leaders and candidates of main political parties plunged into Huzurabad by-poll campaign on Friday, right after filing nomination papers here. All of them were in election mood soon after the by-election became inevitable with Eatala Rajender resigning as MLA on this June 12. They did not waste a minute after their respective candidates filed nominations on the last day. Within minutes of its nominee Balmoori Venkat Narsing Rao completing nomination process, Congress party kicked off its campaign by holding a public meeting in Huzurabad town. TPCC president and Lok Sabha member A. Revanth Reddy started a blistering attack on both TRS and Bharatiya Janata Party accusing them of luring voters with liquor and money. He said his party delayed declaration of candidate’s name for the by-poll as part of an election strategy. “Our leaders never grabbed lands which we could sell for elections,” he said. The Congress State chief said his party nominee was a youngster full of fighting spirit for public cause. He described P. Kaushik Reddy, Congress nominee in Huzurabad in 2018 Assembly elections who joined TRS recently, as Kasab (alleged Pakistan terrorist). Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, who accompanied TRS candidate G. Srinivas Yadav while filing nomination papers, both BJP and Congress did not do anything to win trust of the people. He came down heavily on BJP candidate Eatala Rajender (who won Huzurabad seat in 2018 on Telangana Rashtra Samithi ticket) alleging that the latter betrayed the party that gave life and fame to him. Union Minister for Tourism and Culture and BJP leader G. Kishan Reddy predicted that “Eatala Rajender’s victory would begin the burial of KCR’s family rule”. Addressing a press conference after accompanying Mr. Rajender to file nomination papers along with party State chief Bandi Sanjay, he called upon party activists to “face all sorts of suppression to ensure Rajender’s victory”. Mr. Rajender appealed to NRIs of Telangana living in different parts of the world, artistes, intellectuals and educated persons to extend their help in emerging victorious in the by-poll. He asked people of the constituency to provide accommodation to persons coming for his campaign. “We all together will bury KCR’s arrogance”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/parties-plunge-into-campaigning/article36909104.ece
09 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Roads turn streams in just a few hours of heavy rain in city||Sudden, unexpected cloudburst during evening hours caught people unawares, and flooded the city and its streets on Friday. An otherwise hot and sultry day was rounded off with a heavy downpour, which began at around 8.30 p.m. and continued lashing various parts of the city for about an hour with unmitigated intensity. As is wont for the city, roads soon turned into streams causing traffic blockades everywhere. Vehicles stopped mid road, and commuters had a hard time wading through water. With the eastern part of the city hit badly, the highway near Chintalkunta was inundated, stalling the traffic between L.B. Nagar and Hayatnagar for a long time. Power cuts were rampant across the city, lasting for an hour or two. As per the data available from the automatic weather stations across the city, Lingojiguda in Saroornagar received the maximum rainfall at 13 centimetres in an hour.

09 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State eyes more French investments||Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao on Friday said that the State, whose able leadership, progressive policies and efficient bureaucracy has helped attract over $ 30 billion investment in 7 years since its inception, is keen on playing host to more French investments. Home to several French investments and facilities across varied sectors, the State would like to grow the engagement. In doing so, it would like to emerge as a gateway for mid-sized, small French companies into India, the Minister said, addressing the Indo-French Investment Conclave organised here by the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce & Industry (IFCCI). “What I am looking to do is provide entry point into India, gateway for the mid-sized, small French companies. You are the guys who are going to grow big, going to be the next Safran, Airbus and I would like to be part of that growth story,” he said, while highlighting policy initiatives of Telangana, especially the TS-iPASS, that allowed for self certification and extended time bound approvals. Noting that the State continued to grow fast and attracting investments on the back of its policies as well as advantages, including the strategic location, Mr. Rao said Hyderabad also made everyone feel at home. “No matter which part of India you are from, this is a melting pot, point of confluence where people can come happily, situate and find themselves at home,” he said, asserting how the State government treated investors as partners in progress. Ambassador of France Emmanuel Lenain said there is possibility of more business in Telangana given the State’s emphasis on promoting innovation and the advantages it offered to investors. French investment in India is growing, he said, adding that firms have invested € 10 billion and provided 2,50,000 jobs. Earlier, Deputy CEO of GMR Airports Antoine Crombez, while speaking on Telangana as an investment destination, said that Rs. 6,300 crore would be invested on Hyderabad airport expansion. The airport, which was initially designed to handle 12 million passengers per annum, will see the capacity increase to 34 million passengers post the expansion project. In February 2020, GMR Infra Limited had announced a strategic partnership with Groupe ADP of France for its airports business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-eyes-more-french-investments/article36909087.ece

09 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Man held for Rs. 22 lakh IT fraud||A 29-year-old man was arrested by the Cyber Crime police of Hyderabad city for fraudulently claiming the Income-Tax returns. The accused, Sashidhar Reddy, a resident of Doctors Colony, Visakhapatnam, hails from Janpalli village in YSR Kadapa district. On September 4, one Hanumantha Rao of Secunderabad lodged a complaint with police stating that he had filed Income tax returns for the financial year 2019-20 of his client Raghavendra Arehole, an NRI living in the United State of America. They have e-verified the same on December 14 last using Aadhaar based e-verification filed with a refund of Rs. 21,89,680. He has furnished his bank account details in the ITR as ICICI Bank’s Bund Garden branch in Pune. “While they were following up for the refund via NSDL website in the months of May and June, they came to know that the refund was processed and issued to the banker. However, as they did not get a refund to the ICICI bank account, they raised several grievance tickets in the Income Tax portal and finally to their surprise they came to know that the refund was already credited on June 16, to the Indus Ind Bank account, which was not updated by them,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said. Upon checking the portal, the complainant found that the bank account was updated in the IT portal and the profile details were also changed. Based on his complaint, a case was registered and Reddy was arrested and brought to the city, he said. Police seized two mobile phones, a laptop, and a portable internet router from his possession. Explaining the modus operandi, the officer said that Reddy gets the PAN and Aadhaar card details of NRIs from different sources and opens fake accounts on their names and claims the ITRs on their names and uses for his personal gain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/man-held-for-rs-22-lakh-income-tax-fraud/article36909080.ece
09 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Aid to tenant farmers only on humanitarian grounds: KCR||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the government was prepared to come to the rescue of tenant farmers considering their plight on humanitarian grounds. The Chief Minister reiterated that the government was committed to protect genuine farmers and the government had a clear policy with regard to tenant farmers. Tenancy was an agreement between the farmer and the tenant. Tenancy would not have continuity and it would not be possible to change the records every time there was change in the tenant. The government was not in favour of sacrificing the interests of genuine farmers in the name of tenants. Several changes were ushered in and some columns had been removed from the Dharani portal accordingly. Unlike in the past when officials of the rank of village revenue assistants created problems relating to farmers’ land holdings, the government had streamlined the entire processes by initiatives like Dharani. “Land rates in Telangana are increasing by the day. The government introduced Dharani to ensure transparency and it gave huge relief to farmers,” he said participating in a debate during the Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly on Friday. He said the government was firm on protecting the rights of genuine farmers on their lands and said it would not be averse to coming to the rescue of tenants and tribal farmers if they were in crisis by sanctioning Rs. 200 crore. In this context, he recalled how the government gave pattas on ROFR lands that benefitted over 3 lakh farmers across the State who were now getting assistance under Rythu Bandhu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/aid-to-tenant-ryots-on-humanitarian-grounds/article36909107.ece
09 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fasal Beema Yojana bogus: CM||Describing the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana of the Central Government as bogus, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said that there was a need for major reforms in the crop insurance schemes to ensure that farmers were benefited. “Fasal Bima Yojana being implemented by the Centre is bogus. The scheme is not scientific. How will the farmer benefit if area is taken as a unit in the insurance scheme,” he said. The Chief Minister took a dig at the Centre for not implementing farmer and farm-centric schemes that were recommended by experts like M.S. Swaminathan from time to time. Farmers too were not interested in taking insurance schemes as they were not getting any benefits even after payment of the premiums. “It is a peculiar situation. Implementation of crop insurance schemes comes up in every session of Parliament. The very system is wrong and there is a need for reforms in the process,” he said participating in the discussion on crop losses suffered due to recent rains which figured during the Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly on Friday. On PMFBY, he said the Centre had recently brought in amendments to the scheme and made it optional, not mandatory. Coupled with this was its refusal to procure foodgrains, paddy in particular, from the farmers. The Centre was entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining buffer stocks to meet the demand when States were faced with drought situation and the Food Corporation of India was set up for the purpose. “It is not time for blame game. The Centre made joining the PMFBY optional and it is also moving away from its responsibility of procuring food grain. I took the matter to the notice of the Ministers concerned during my recent visit to New Delhi,” he said. Responding to queries of members on the relief measures being taken for farmers who suffered crop losses during the recent heavy rains, he said the government had directed the District Collectors to prepare comprehensive reports on the losses in accordance with the norms. These reports would be sent to Centre once they were submitted requesting immediate assistance as well as financial support for long term needs. Floods in twin cities The Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao criticised the Centre for not responding to the State’s request to extend financial assistance to cover the losses caused due to flood in the twin cities last year. The State had prepared a detailed report on the losses to the tune of Rs. 8,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fasal-beema-yojana-bogus/article36909106.ece

This dry run will feature a “dummy” election using the cutting-edge technology, in which all the registered voters of the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) limits can participate, according to KMC sources. It forms the crux of the relentless efforts by the TSEC to harness cutting-edge technology to make elections more inclusive, accessible and voter-friendly for differently abled electors and certain other sections of voters. Meanwhile, the district authorities have drawn up a plan to publicise the “TSEC eVote” Android app to enable active participation of people from all sections of society in the dummy election (mock trial for e-voting) scheduled to be held on October 20. Those interested can register their names through the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based e-voting application till October 18, sources added. Collector V. P.

Even Industries Minister K. T. Rama Rao is lying in the Assembly. The minimum wage for labour should Rs. 21,000,” said trade union leader Chukka Ramulu while addressing a gathering. He has alleged the Union government has handed over the responsibility of recognising the trade union to the managements, which is most objectionable. He said that 12 hours of work per day is coming into force, instead of eight hours - which was achieved as a right after fighting for several decades.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Konda Polam’ movie review: Krish Jagarlamudi’s fable-like film starring Vaisshnav Tej and Rakul Preet Singh is musically and visually rewarding, but needed more depth||There’s something comforting and reassuring about fables that pack in life lessons through simple stories. It’s like a throwback to a time when life was less complicated. At the heart of director Krish Jagarlamudi’s Konda Polam (forest grazing) is a fable-like story, adapted from the Telugu novel of the same name by Sanupureddy Venkatarami Reddy. In the process of shepherding a huge flock of sheep into the hilly jungles to survive drought in the plains, a young man rediscovers himself and finds his purpose in life. The story is set in the arid Rayalaseema region, in the vicinity of Nallamala forest, though the film has been mostly filmed in Vikarabad and Ananthagiri hills owing to COVID-19 restrictions. Konda Polam draws our attention to a lesser-known fact — of shepherds in a village where water is a luxury, having to venture into the wilderness to find food and water for their flock of sheep. Krish leads us into this world through Kataru Ravindra Yadav (Vaisshnav Tej), born into a shepherd family but somewhat of an outsider, since he has had the privilege of being educated rather than being pulled into tending sheep. But Ravindra has been following the herd of another sort, becoming an engineer with the hope that he will get a well-paying job, while neither understanding nor having an aptitude for it. He ventures into the jungle, accompanied by his father (Sai Chand) and fellow villagers that include Obulamma (Rakul Preet Singh), with his eyes reflecting his inexperience and guilt in not being able to earn to ease the burden of his elders. Once the shrill initial excitement of some of the shepherds wears off and they venture deeper into the woods, there’s an effort to make Konda Polam an endearing regional The Jungle Book , if you will. There are no major surprises in the story. Since it unfolds as a flashback, we know the new responsibilities Ravindra is likely to take up and that the jungle has been a major influence on him. Threats from reptiles, tigers and smugglers are all part of the game. The grandeur of the tagline ‘an epic tale of becoming’, emerges mostly from M M Keeravani’s music and V S Gnanashekhar’s cinematography. The aural and visual landscape try to elevate a simple story. Once the lessons from the jungle are discussed, the adventures of the shepherds feel repetitive in the later potions. The duets and an underwhelming climactic portion also rob the film of its gravitas. Though the tale is well-intentioned and often compares the struggle for survival in the jungles to the survival of the fittest in concrete urban jungles, we don’t feel its impact. Vaisshnav Tej is effective in portraying the naivety required for his character. In the emotional portions, particularly the scene where Obulamma confesses her love to him, his lack of experience shows.

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||When ration ran dry for Delhi schoolchildren||Before the pandemic struck, 9-year-old Anamika was used to eating kadhi-chawal , aloo-puri or sambar-chawal for lunch every day as part of the government’s mid-day meal scheme at her Municipal Corporation of Delhi school in R.K. Puram. Since schools closed last March, however, regular meals have been hard to come by at her home in the nearby slum area of Motilal Nehru Camp. Anamika’s mother Prema trekked to the school several times, asking about the dry ration which had been promised in lieu of the mid-day meals, but received nothing for her daughter, who studies in Class V, or her son Arav, who studies in Class II, until July 2021, 15 months after schools were shut. Their story is not unique. The Delhi government did not lift any foodgrains allocated for the scheme for an entire quarter during the pandemic, affecting 16 lakh students in more than 3,000 schools, according to data provided by Central and State governments. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi-North, which runs 721 primary schools with over three lakh students, did not lift foodgrains for nine months last year, according to the minutes of a meeting held on June 29, 2021, between State and Central education department officials to consider the annual plan and budget for the mid-day meal scheme. According to the minutes, School Education Secretary Anita Karwal expressed “shock” and “deep concern for the children who were deprived of the benefit for three quarters of 2020-21” and warned the Delhi government that “this is a clear violation of the directions of the Supreme Court of India and amounts to contempt”. She observed “a sheer lack of management and coordination issue among all the implementing agencies”. Cash transfer Delhi government representatives informed the Centre that “after closure of schools due to pandemic, cost of foodgrains and cooking cost was transferred in the bank account of the beneficiaries [as a food security allowance] and later, dry ration kits were distributed. In North MCD though, tender of the suppliers had expired but still the dry ration kit was prepared with the help of Kendriya Bhandar and distributed in some schools, however, foodgrain could not be lifted,” according to the minutes. Data provided by the Delhi Directorate of Education in response to an RTI request filed by activist Anjali Bhardwaj in January 2021 shows that no foodgrains allocated for the mid-day meal scheme were lifted during April to June 2020. Another RTI shows that instead, a food security allowance of Rs. 5.22 per day for primary students and Rs. 7.83 for upper primary was transferred to children. From July to September 2020, Delhi picked up the full 10,454 tonnes of grains, but that dropped again to a deficit 2,913 tonnes for the next two quarters, the RTI showed. Education Ministry officials say that despite extensions to allow the Delhi government to pick up the grains it failed to lift last year, it has not yet done so. “One of the problems in Delhi is that they do not have a system of school-wise preparation of mid-day meals as in many States. Instead, it is all outsourced to contractors who directly pick up the allocated grains from the Food Corporation of India godowns, add needed pulses and vegetables, prepare the food at centralised kitchens and distribute to the schools,” explained a senior Ministry official. “During the pandemic, this system collapsed. But it is highly irresponsible that they have not managed to create an alternate system even after one year.”  “There are also structural problems within the Delhi school system. The AAP government runs schools mostly for upper primary students [Class VI-VIII], while most primary schools are run by the MCDs which are run by the BJP. But irrespective of the political differences among themselves, they have been utterly callous towards the children, and deprived them of their rights at a difficult time,” said the official. The Delhi government spokesperson did not offer a comment despite multiple calls and messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/when-ration-ran-dry-for-delhi-schoolchildren/article36908979.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protests, counter protests rock DU campus||Several students’ organisations staged protests on the Delhi University campus, which is yet to fully open after the COVID-19 lockdown, against the admission policy being followed by the university. While some groups were in support of the policy, others alleged “unreasonable admissions”. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS, demanded that the university’s admission process be stopped immediately and the authorities act upon the “unreasonable hike in cut-offs to do inflated scores”. The group sought that the university devise a mechanism of “moderation and normalisation” of marks for all State boards of the country The protests started after several candidates with perfect score from Kerala board sought admission to the university, filling seats at many colleges that released a cut-off score of 100%. Countering the arguments of ABVP, the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) said according to details shared by the university, only 5% of the total admissions after the first cut-offs constituted students from the Kerala board. “The good performance of Kerala student is due to their hard work as well as the constant effort by the State government to provide access to education even during the pandemic,” said Utkarsh, vice-president, SFI-Delhi. The protesters condemned the statement by a professor at Kirori Mal College, Rakesh Pandey — a member of RSS-affiliated NDTF — who, they alleged, has been instigating regionalism against students from Kerala by terming good scores “marks jihad”. The All India Students’ Association and the National Students’ Union of India also protested outside the Kirori Mal College. While AISA demanded the suspension of Mr. Pandey, the NSUI said they had met the principal of Kirori Mal College and handed over a memorandum demanding strict action against the professor. NSUI’s national secretary Nitish Gaur said the students from Kerala board had worked hard to get 100% marks and were being dragged into a conspiracy being propagated by right-wing professors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/protests-counter-protests-rock-du-campus/article36908968.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Live music takes a hit amid pandemic||With a looming threat of a possible third wave, social distancing norms and limited seating capacity, musicians and venue owners in the city are a worried bunch. Although live music is up and running, COVID-19 restrictions come as a roadblock for many. For 28-year-old Zeeshaan Nabi, member of a city-based band ‘Ramooz’, subsequent lockdowns have resulted in multiple live shows being cancelled. “In mid-2019, the band had moved to Kashmir to record its first studio album. However, they were stuck in the Valley due to restrictions imposed post the abrogation of provisions of Article 370. We returned to Delhi in November that year but managed to play only a couple shows, with limited capacity, after the first and second lockdowns were lifted. This has affected the creative process of the band, especially due to the financial constraints that the lockdowns have brought along,” said Mr. Nabi. The band is now nearing completion of its first studio album. However, it faces a dilemma due to the restrictions imposed on live performance gatherings. Sharing the same conundrum is 26-year-old Ahmad Hagroo, a city-based singer-songwriter, who has been struggling to secure live gigs. This has further resulted in financial constraints for Mr. Hagroo who now runs a cloud kitchen from his residence to make ends meet. “I have been performing since 2018 in and around Delhi. I was earning well until the pandemic hit and everything has changed since then. I had to turn to other sources of income and have recently started a cloud kitchen. The idea is to also invite people to dine-in with me on weekends and enjoy a performance alongside,” said Mr. Hagroo. Prior to the pandemic, independent music scenario in the city and other parts of the country witnessed a regular flow of events with live performances on a weekly basis. However, since the pandemic, the situation for artistes and venue owners remains dire. Venue owners in the city have also voiced their concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/live-music-takes-a-hit-amid-pandemic/article36908970.ece

This comes after the Transport Department gradually stepped up enforcement against vehicles without PUCs and those causing visible pollution, in the run-up to winter. Not having a valid PUC attracts a fine of Rs. 10,000, six months imprisonment or both. According to the Transport Department, an average number of 10,000 PUCs were issued on a daily basis between August 10 and September 1 this year. This number jumped to a daily average of 15,000 per day between September 2 and 18 following news reports related to pollution. “We have 56 dedicated enforcement teams which have been deployed to check PUCs of visibly polluting and overloaded vehicles. The department also started sending text messages to vehicle owners without valid PUCs to get them renewed,” said Ashish Kundra, Secretary and Commissioner, Transport. “As many as 12 lakh messages for renewal were sent to vehicle owners yesterday. In addition to continuing to send reminders, we will be intensifying our drive against invalid PUCs and polluting vehicles over the coming days,” Mr. Kundra added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rush-for-pucs-as-transport-dept-starts-anti-pollution-drive/article36908977.ece

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma passed the order, holding both the brothers, two of their employees, and a former court staff, Dinesh Chand Sharma, guilty under IPC Sections 201 (tampering of evidence), 120B and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant). Further, the court asked for the financial records of the convicts in order to pronounce the quantum of the sentence. The order on the sentence is likely to be announced on Monday.

Teams of I-T authorities have been raiding businesses, including sugar factories, and searching the houses of Mr. Ajit Pawar’s sisters in Kolhapur and Pune, as well as the Mumbai office of his son Parth Pawar. The raids have been on for nearly 30 hours. Speaking in Solapur at a rally of NCP workers and office-bearers, Mr. Sharad Pawar took a jibe at the Modi Government at the Centre, stating: “I heard that the Centre sent some guests [I-T authorities] yesterday to Ajit Pawar’s place [firms linked to the Deputy Chief Minister’s kin]…but we are never worried about such guests.” The NCP supremo reminded his party workers of the time in 2019 when, just ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly election that year, he had received a notice from the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Mr. Sharad Pawar had been named in a money laundering case by the ED in connection with the multi-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) scam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/not-worried-about-guests-at-home-sharad-pawar/article36908982.ece
09 October 2021||Kunduz,||Bloodiest assault after Taliban takeover||A suicide bomb attack on worshippers at a Shia mosque in the Afghan city of Kunduz killed at least 46 people on Friday, in the bloodiest assault since the Taliban government was formed. Scores more victims from the minority community were wounded in the blast, which has not been claimed. The extremist Islamic State group, bitter rivals of the Taliban, has repeatedly targeted Shias in a bid to stir up sectarian violence in Sunni-majority Afghanistan. A medical source at the Kunduz Provincial Hospital said that 35 dead and more than 55 wounded had been taken there, while Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hospital said 20 were dead and scores more wounded. Matiullah Rohani, director of culture and information in Kunduz for Afghanistan’s new Taliban government, confirmed that the deadly incident was a suicide attack and that 46 people had died and 143 were wounded. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had earlier said “an explosion took place in a mosque of our Shia compatriots” in Kunduz. Blast timing Residents of Kunduz, the capital of a province of the same name, said the blast hit a Shia mosque during Friday prayers, the most important of the week for Muslims. An international aid worker at the MSF hospital in the city said there were fears the death toll could rise even further. “Hundreds of people are gathered at the main gate of the hospital and crying for their relatives but armed Taliban guys are trying to prevent gatherings in case another explosion is planned,” he said. Graphic images shared on social media, which could not immediately be verified, showed several bloodied bodies lying on the floor. Pictures showed plumes of smoke rising into the air over Kunduz. A female teacher in Kunduz said the blast happened near her house, and several of her neighbours were killed. “It was a very terrifying incident,” she said. “Many of our neighbours have been killed and wounded. A 16-year-old neighbour was killed. They couldn’t find half of his body. Another neighbour who was 24 was killed as well.” Another video showed men shepherding people, including women and children, away from the scene. Frightened crowds thronged the streets. Important location Kunduz’s location makes it a key transit point for economic and trade exchanges with Tajikistan. It was the scene of fierce battles as the Taliban fought their way back into power this year. Often targeted by Sunni extremists who view them as heretics, Shia Muslims have suffered some of Afghanistan’s most violent assaults. Shias make up roughly 20% of the Afghan population. Many of them are Hazara, an ethnic group that has been heavily persecuted in Afghanistan for decades. The United Nations in Afghanistan said it was “deeply concerned by reports of very high casualties” in Friday's attack, calling it a “part of a disturbing pattern of violence”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bloodiest-assault-after-taliban-takeover/article36908385.ece
09 October 2021||Tokyo,||Kishida vows to lead with ‘trust’||In his first policy speech, new Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida promised on Friday to strengthen the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in case of another resurgence and revive its battered economy while bolstering defences against threats from China and North Korea. Mr. Kishida also spoke on Friday by telephone with Chinese President Xi Jinping and raised concerns about China’s escalating activities in disputed maritime territories and human rights problems in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region, he said. Tasked with the crucial mission of rallying public support for the governing party ahead of national elections expected October 31, Mr. Kishida promised to pursue politics of “trust and empathy”. He was elected by Parliament and sworn in Monday as Japan’s 100th Prime Minister, succeeding Yoshihide Suga, who left after only a year in office. Mr. Suga’s perceived high-handed approach in dealing with the coronavirus and insistence on holding the Tokyo Olympics despite rising cases angered the public and hurt the governing Liberal Democrats. “I will devote my body and soul to overcome the national crisis together with the people to pioneer a new era so we can pass a bountiful Japan to the next generation,” Mr. Kishida said. He promised to be more attentive to public concerns and needs, and prepare virus measures based on “a worst-case scenario”. That includes taking advantage of a drop in infections to improve crisis management before the weather turns cold, approving drugs for treatment of COVID-19 by the end of December and the digitalisation of vaccine certificates, Mr. Kishida said. “I’m determined to defend our land, territorial seas and air space, and the people’s lives and assets, no matter what,” Mr. Kishida added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kishida-vows-to-lead-with-trust/article36908687.ece
09 October 2021||MANILA,||Prize for ‘free, independent and fact-based journalism’||Journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their fight for freedom of expression in countries where reporters have faced persistent attacks, harassment and even murder. “Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, explaining why the prize went to two journalists. “Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time,” she said. The Nobel committee noted that Ms. Ressa in 2012 co-founded Rappler , a news website that has focused critical attention on President Rodrigo Duterte’s “controversial, murderous anti-drug campaign” in the Philippines. She and Rappler “have also documented how social media is being used to spread fake news, harass opponents and manipulate public discourse”. Mr. Muratov was one of the founders in 1993 of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta , which the Nobel committee called “the most independent newspaper in Russia today, with a fundamentally critical attitude towards power”. “The newspaper’s fact-based journalism and professional integrity have made it an important source of information on censurable aspects of Russian society rarely mentioned by other media,” it added. Ms. Ressa, the first Filipino to win the peace prize and the first woman to be honoured this year with an award by the Nobel committee, was convicted last year of libel and sentenced to jail in a decision seen as a major blow to press global freedom. She said she hopes the award will bolster investigative journalism “that will hold power to account.” Relentless campaign “This relentless campaign of harassment and intimidation against me and my fellow journalists in the Philippines is a stark example of a global trend that journalists and freedom of the press facing increasingly adverse conditions,” she told The Associated Press . She also pointed to social media giants like Facebook as a serious threat to democracy, saying “they actually prioritised the spread of lies laced with anger and hate over facts.” “I didn’t think that what we are going through would get that attention. But the fact that it did also shows you how important the battles we face are, right?” she said. “This is going to be what our elections are going to be like next year. It is a battle for facts. When you’re in a battle for facts, journalism is activism.” Government scrutiny Mr. Muratov said he would use his win to help independent journalists who have faced growing pressure from the authorities, including those whose organisations were declared “foreign agents” — a designation that threatens to bring more government scrutiny. “We will use it to shore up Russian journalism that has faced repressions,” he said in comments carried by a Russian messaging app channel. “We will try to help the people who have been designated as agents, have faced persecution and have been forced out of the country.” According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 17 media workers were killed in the Philippines in the last decade and 23 in Russia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/prize-for-free-independent-and-fact-based-journalism/article36908689.ece
09 October 2021||Warsaw,||Some EU rules go against Constitution: Poland top court||Poland’s top court on Thursday said that some EU treaty articles were “incompatible” with the Polish Constitution in a landmark ruling that could threaten the country’s EU funding and even put in question its membership of the bloc. The ruling is the latest twist in a long stand-off between Poland and the EU over controversial judicial reforms introduced by Poland’s governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party. In her ruling, Constitutional Court president Julia Przylebska listed several EU treaty articles that she said were incompatible and also said that the EU institutions “act beyond the scope of their competences” in the treaties. “Shame!”, “Traitors!” and “Welcome to Belarus!” shouted a group of around 30 protesters outside the court after hearing the ruling, some of whom waved European Union flags. “They’re taking us out of the European Union!” said Anna Labus, a pensioner who was in tears. But government spokesman Piotr Muller welcomed the ruling, saying that it confirmed “the primacy of constitutional law over other sources of law”. He added, however, that the ruling “does not affect any areas where the EU has competences delegated in the treaties” such as competition rules, trade and consumer protection. The dispute with Brussels has focused in particular on a new system for disciplining judges which the EU says is a serious threat to the independence of the judiciary in Poland. But there are other bones of contention, including the appointment of judges and the transfer of judges between different courts or divisions of the same court. Poland has said that the reforms are needed to root out corruption and has ignored an interim order from the EU court to suspend the judge disciplining system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/some-eu-rules-go-against-constitution-poland-top-court/article36908389.ece
09 October 2021||Washington,||‘U.S. special forces quietly training Taiwanese troops’||U.S. special operations forces have been quietly training Taiwanese troops for months, a move which China warned on Friday could cause “serious harm” to relations between Washington and Beijing. A contingent of around 20 special operations and conventional forces has been conducting the training for less than a year, the Pentagon official, who declined to be identified, said on Thursday, adding that some of the trainers rotate in and out. ‘High sensitivity’ Beijing opposes self-ruled Taiwan — which it views as its own territory to be seized one day, by force if necessary — having any official diplomatic exchanges and has aggressively tried to dissuade politicians from visiting in recent years. China reacted angrily to the report on Friday, with the foreign ministry warning that the U.S. should recognise the “high sensitivity” of the Taiwan situation and “serious harm” of its actions. Taiwan's Defense Ministry declined to comment, but Pentagon spokesman John Supple said that generally speaking, U.S. support for Taiwan’s military is gauged on its defense needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-special-forces-quietly-training-taiwanese-troops/article36908393.ece

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the deployment of two high-ranking commanders represented a worrying escalation in the situation. “Alarming reports indicate that there has been substantial deployment of heavy weapons and troops by the Myanmar military over the past few weeks,” spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva. The deployments have been to Kanpetlet and Hakha townships in Chin State; Kani and Monywa townships in the central Sagaing region; and Gangaw township in Magway region, she said. The internet has also been shut down, she added. Myanmar has been mired in crisis since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's government in February, sparking mass protests and a bloody crackdown. “We are gravely concerned by these developments, particularly given the intensifying attacks by the military that we have documented over the past month in these areas,” Ms. Shamdasani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-militarys-actions-alarm-un/article36908390.ece

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||An eye for an eye in southern Tamil Nadu||At around 8 a.m. on September 22, about a dozen daily wage earners, mostly women, sat under a neem tree in Nandavanampatti village in Dindigul district of southern Tamil Nadu. They had eaten their morning portion of pazhaya saatham (gruel made of leftover rice soaked in water overnight) with shallots and were getting ready to de-silt a tank under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). A 69-year-old woman, Nirmala Devi, was directing the labourers to quickly get to work without wasting time. A short while later, when Nirmala Devi — heavy, with a wide forehead, a nose pin and glasses — sat alone in the shade, four men armed with long knives rode towards her on two motorcycles. They dismounted the vehicles, strode menacingly towards her, grabbed her by her hair and assaulted her with the sharp-edged weapons. As the helpless farm workers watched the crime in horror from afar, one of the masked men beheaded Nirmala Devi, who had by then collapsed in a pool of blood. The murderers picked up her head and drove away. Aghast at this savagery, the workers fled to safety. For well over 30 minutes, Nirmala Devi’s torso lay there, the smell of death lingering in the sticky air. The village fell into a shocked silence. It wore a deserted look until senior police officers and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the crime. Armed police personnel were quickly deployed in the village. The police immediately launched a search operation. Special teams assisted by sniffer dogs spread out in different directions in search of the assailants and the victim’s head. About an hour later, Nirmala Devi’s head was found at the doorstep of Chidambaram Pasupathi’s house. Chidambaram Pasupathi alias Pasupathi Pandian, the founder-leader of a Scheduled Caste outfit, Devendrakula Vellalar Kootamaippu, had also been brutally murdered, on January 10, 2012. It did not take long for the police to join the dots and link her killing to a bloody revenge game that has been playing out in southern Tamil Nadu for decades. Nirmala Devi was named as accused number five in the murder of Pasupathi Pandian — a gangster of medium build with a head full of hair and a striking orange beard. Between 2013 and 2019, four of the 18 persons named as the accused in the case were killed by Pasupathi Pandian’s supporters in different parts of southern Tamil Nadu. Nirmala Devi was the fifth. A dynamic, dependable woman What is curious is that Nirmala Devi belonged to a Scheduled Caste, as did those who orchestrated her beheading. The widow of Perumal, a farm worker, Nirmala Devi had been living alone in Nandavanampatti for over a decade. Her elder son, aged about 45, is in the defence service and her younger son, about 40 years old, lives in another village. Like any other Scheduled Caste inhabitant of Nandavanampatti, Nirmala Devi also depended on farm work for sustenance. The villagers described her as an active, dynamic woman. A former Panchayat ward councillor, she would travel everywhere on a two-wheeler. She would visit the Dindigul Collectorate to help people in her village apply for and receive pension and get other assistance from the government, said villagers. Days after her killing, the tension was still palpable in Nandavanampatti, where Dalits and members of other communities live. The villagers seemed suspicious of strangers and refused to share their personal details, including their names. “She would help us in times of need. It is horrible that her killers beheaded her and took away her head [as a trophy],” said one of Nirmala Devi’s neighbours, a woman, who was unable to come to terms with her death. One villager said Nirmala Devi’s death had left a void in the village. She could be depended on during any emergency, he said. Villagers said Nirmala Devi would mobilise workers from hamlets to do MGNREGS work. She would then get a commission from these workers from their earnings. She was called a mesthri – a supervisor or a person who coordinates with workers for a job. She would also lend money to villagers as soft loans. The interest she earned from this helped her live comfortably, they said. Just a few hours before she was murdered, Nirmala Devi had listed the names of people who wanted to work under the rural employment scheme, a police officer said. These interested villagers had provided their thumb impressions or signatures on a piece of paper, to serve as proof of their working for wages. They will now be cited as prosecution witnesses in her murder trial, the officer said. Tit-for-tat killings The accused in Pasupathi Pandian’s murder are supporters of Subash Pannaiyar, a Nadar, an intermediate caste in Tamil Nadu. The rivalry between Pasupathi Pandian and Subash Pannaiyar dates back to the early 1990s, to Thoothukudi district, located about 210 kilometres south of Nandavanampatti village in Dindigul. Pannaiyars are traditionally landlords. Over two decades ago, Subash Pannaiyar’s grandfather, Sivasubramanian Nadar alias Sivasubramanian Pannaiyar, was an influential landlord in Moolakkarai in Thoothukudi. He owned hundreds of cultivable acres of land in the coastal district and enjoyed the following of the Nadar community. It was a property dispute involving Sivasubramanian Pannaiyar and a bank manager named Rajagopal that led to the first clash between the Pannaiyars and Pasupathi Pandian. Pasupathi Pandian, who was already facing criminal charges then, intervened on behalf of Rajagopal. The matter reached a flashpoint when the senior Pannaiyar’s son, Asupathi Pannaiyar, was killed in January 1993. Following his father Asupathi’s death, Subash Pannaiyar took over as landlord. He and his first cousin, N. Venkatesa Pannaiyar, the founder of the caste outfit Akhila India Nadar Pathukappu Peravai, sought to take revenge on Pasupathi Pandian, but they were unsuccessful. Soon after surviving the attack by the Pannaiyars, Pasupathi Pandian and his supporters murdered Subash’s grandfather Sivasubramanian Pannaiyar in 1990. They later killed two witnesses to this murder. In 2003, Venkatesa Pannaiyar was shot dead by the police in an ‘encounter’ in Chennai, triggering a massive political row. His death led to anger among many Nadars. This prompted then Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M. Karunanidhi to field Venkatesa Pannaiyar’s wife Radhika Selvi in the 2004 Lok Sabha election. Selvi went on to become Union Minister of State for Home in May 2007 in the Manmohan Singh government. According to the police, Pasupathi Pandian fled Thoothukudi district in 2006 after the Pannaiyar gang killed his wife Jascinta Pandian, an advocate. She was accompanying Pasupathi Pandian, who was on his way to Thoothukudi along with his accomplices to appear before a court in connection with a case against him, when a bomb was hurled at the car. The gangster promptly took refuge in Dindigul after his wife’s killing. There he met Nirmala Devi, who also belonged to a Scheduled Caste. Nirmala Devi and a few others helped Pasupathi Pandian identify a housing plot in M.N. Nagar, Nandavanampatti, where he built a house. Pasupathi Pandian’s patronage saw Nirmala Devi’s fortunes improve. Thanks to this acquaintance, Nirmala Devi managed to build a modest house for herself. Others who helped the Devendrakula Vellalar Kootamaippu founder also prospered. In Dindigul, Pasupathi Pandian was always surrounded by his supporters. “Whenever he travelled, he was surrounded by his men who were always armed,” said a retired police officer, who had served in the district till 2015. However, on the night of January 10, 2012, Pasupathi Pandian’s men left him to go elsewhere on work. The gang leader met a gory end when armed men arrived at his house and slit his throat. Soon after the police began their investigation into the murder of Pasupathi Pandian, Subash Pannaiyar and 17 others were named as the accused in the First Information Report. Nirmala Devi allegedly took money from the Pannaiyar gang to pass on information to them on Pasupathi Pandian’s movements, which led to his death. Though caste bonds are strong in rural Tamil Nadu, in some cases such as this, currency helps forge a deeper bond. Pasupathi Pandian’s supporters have been thirsting for revenge since his death, said the police. They have been carefully planning and meticulously eliminating their targets, as Nirmala Devi’s killing suggests. Subash Pannaiyar miraculously escaped an attempt on his life in March 2016 when country bombs were hurled at him by a gang of at least 50 members during a visit to his farm. At that time, Arumugasamy, a supporter of Subash Pannaiyar, was beheaded, and his head was placed under a roadside banner carrying Pasupathi Pandian’s photo, on the Thoothukudi-Tirunelveli highway. The police have arrested three persons in connection with Nirmala Devi’s murder. Five others have surrendered before a judicial magistrate court in Tiruchi, 100 km from Dindigul. The cycle of revenge murders Leading psychiatrist C. Ramasubramanian explained that a lack of closure and the inability to accept the sudden and planned death of a loved one leads to a thirst for revenge. When a person represses their anger, it is often impossible for them to deal with that emotion, he said. “Having seen or heard about the manner in which their loved ones died really affects the person,” he said. Even if the accused get arrested, it doesn’t provide closure for the affected families if the murder was gruesome, he said. “And the act of revenge passes on sometime even to the next generation and beyond.” The police in southern Tamil Nadu have been updating their records to note down the multiple lives that have been claimed on either side of this gang rivalry. The conflict assumed a caste angle over the years between sections of the Nadars and the Devendrakula Vellalars. On many occasions, it ballooned into a law-and-order problem with supporters of these gangs taking to the streets and damaging public property. But unlike the other caste conflicts in southern Tamil Nadu, which are fanned by political parties representing one community or the other, this conflict between the Nadars and the Devendrakula Vellalars has largely played out due to the intense rivalry between the two gangs. The police have been rattled by Nirmala Devi’s murder and the string of unrelated killings that came on its heels. Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu has asked all district police and commissionerates to form special teams to deal with rowdy elements and gangsters. He asked them to follow murder cases as old as 10 years and prepare fresh dossiers on gangsters likely to be involved in retaliation. The details of such gangsters, with their photographs, will be uploaded in a special app, he said. The police force launched ‘Operation Disarm’ to conduct storming operations at caste-sensitive locations across the State. They did not lose sight of the fact that the gruesome crimes took place just as the State was preparing for its two-phase rural local body polls in nine districts, including two in the south. The second phase of polling is scheduled on Saturday. They arrested 3,325 suspects wanted in various murder cases and seized hundreds of lethal weapons including firearms. The officers have also been asked to closely follow murder cases pending in courts and work towards the conviction of perpetrators. The police are unsure whether Nirmala Devi is the last victim of this gang rivalry between the Pannaiyar and Pandian clans. A retired Deputy Superintendent of Police, who had served in southern districts, said that her murder may not be the last in this bloody saga. In some instances, the revenge murder is executed decades later, he said. “Revenge murders,” he said, “rarely cease.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-eye-for-an-eye-in-southern-tamil-nadu/article36908384.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Reflections on the ‘quasi-federal’ democracy||Events coinciding with the jubilee of India’s Independence draw attention to the federal structure of India’s Constitution, which is a democratic imperative of multi-cultural India, where the constituent units of the sovereign state are based on language, against competing identities such as caste, tribe or religion. This built-in structural potential for conflict within and among the units, and that between them and the sovereign state, need imaginative federal craftmanship and sensitive political management. The ability of the Indian Constitution to keep its wide-ranging diversity within one sovereign state, with a formal democratic framework is noteworthy. Possibly, with universal adult suffrage and free institutions of justice and governance it is nearly impossible to polarise its wide-ranging diversity within any single divisive identity, even Hindutva; so that, despite its operational flaws, the democratic structure and national integrity are dialectically interlinked. But its operational fault lines are increasingly denting liberal institutions, undermining the federal democratic structure as recent events have underscored. Some fault lines First, the tempestuous Parliament session, where the Rajya Sabha Chairperson broke down (in August 2021), unable to conduct proceedings despite the use of marshals; yet, the House passed a record number of Bills amidst a record number of adjournments. Second, cross-border police firing by one constituent State against another, inflicting fatalities, which also resulted in retaliatory action in the form of an embargo on goods trade and travel links with its land-locked neighbour. Such unfamiliar events of federal democracy are recurrent in India, except their present manifest intensity. Legislative disruption was described by a Union Law Minister (while in Opposition) as a ‘legitimate democratic right, and duty’. In the 1960s, the Troika around Lohia claimed its right to enter Parliament on the Janata’s shoulders to exit on the Marshals; posters with labels such as ‘CIA Agent’ were displayed during debates; ‘suitcases’ were transferred publicly to save the government; occasionally, “Honorable Members” emerged from debates with injuries. This time, in the “federal chamber”, “Honorable Members” and Marshals are in physical contact — both claiming ‘casualties’ — official papers vandalised and chairpersons immobilised. Even inter-State conflict has assumed a new dimension. Key changes Such empirical realities have led scholars to conceptualise India’s “Post-colonial democracy”, and federalism, differently from their liberal role-models. Rajni Kothari’s “one party dominance” model of the “Congress system” has now been replaced by the Bharatiya Janata Party; Myrdall’s “soft state” is reincarnated in the Pegasus era with fake videos and new instruments of mass distraction and coercion. Galbraith’s “functioning anarchy”, now has greater criminalisation in India’s democracy, which includes over 30% legislators with criminal records, and courtrooms turning into gang war zones; it is now more anarchic, but still functioning, bypassing any “Dangerous Decade” or a “1984”. Federal theorist K.C. Wheare analyses India’s “centralized state with some federal features” as “quasi-federal”. He underscores the structural faultlines of Indian federalism not simply as operational. So, while many democratic distortions are amenable to mitigation by institutional professionalism, Indian federalism, to be democratically federal, needs institutional amendment despite being a “basic structure”. Wheare’s argument merits consideration. Many deficits Democratic federalism presupposes institutions to ensure equality between and among the units and the Centre so that they coordinate with each other, and are subordinate to the sovereign constitution — their disputes adjudicated by an independent judiciary with impeccable professional and moral credibility. But India’s federal structure is constitutionally hamstrung by deficits on all these counts, and operationally impaired by the institutional dents in the overall democratic process. Like popular voting behaviour, institutional preferences are based either on ethnic or kinship network, or like anti-incumbency, as the perceived lesser evil, on individual role-models: T.N. Seshan for the Election Commission of India, J.F. Ribeiro for the police or Justices Chandrachud or Nariman for the judiciary. India’s federal structure, underpinned on the colonial ‘1935 Act’ which initiated ‘provincial autonomy’, attempted democratising it by: renaming “Provinces” to autonomous “States”; transferring all “Reserved Powers” to popular governance; constitutionally dividing powers between the two tiers; inserting federalism in the Preamble, and Parts 3 and 4 containing citizens’ “Fundamental Rights” and “Directive Principles”; but nothing about States’ rights, not even their territorial boundaries. This has enabled the Centre to unilaterally alter State boundaries and create new States. The Indian Constitution itself has been amended 105 times in 70 years compared with 27 times in over 250 years in the United States. With ‘nation-building” as priority, the constitutional division of power and resources remains heavily skewed in favour of the Centre; along with “Residual”, “Concurrent” and “Implied” powers, it compromises on the elementary federal principle of equality among them, operationally reinforced by extra-constitutional accretion. While the judiciary is empowered to adjudicate on their conflicts, with higher judicial appointments (an estimated 41% lying vacant), promotion and transfers becoming a central prerogative, their operations are becoming increasingly controversial. Structural conflicts The story is not different for the “all India services”, including the State cadres. What is operationally most distorted is the role of Governors:  appointed by the Centre, it is political patronage, transforming this constitutional authority of a federal “link” to one of a central “agent” in the States. Thus, the critical instruments of national governance have been either assigned or appropriated by the Centre, with the States left with politically controversial subjects such as law and order and land reforms. Thus, most of India’s federal conflicts are structural, reinforced by operational abuses. Yet, there is no federal chamber to politically resolve conflicts. The Rajya Sabha indirectly represents the States whose legislators elect it, but continue even after the electors are outvoted or dismissed; with no residential qualification, this House is a major source of political and financial patronage for all political parties, at the cost of the people of the State they “represent”. Possibly, this explains its continuity. Constituting roughly half the Lok Sabha, proportionately, it reinforces the representative deficit of Parliament, which, through the Westminster system of ‘winner-take-all’, continues to elect majority parties and governments with a minority of electoral votes. The second chamber is not empowered to neutralise the demographic weight of the populous States with larger representation in the popular chamber; it cannot veto its legislations, unlike the U.S. Senate. It can only delay, which explains the disruptions. Joint sessions to resolve their differences are as predicable and comical as the “voice votes” in the Houses. India’s bicameral legislature, without ensuring a Federal Chamber, lives up to the usual criticism: “when the second chamber agrees with the first, it is superfluous, when it disagrees, it is pernicious”. Historically, party compositions decide when they agree or disagree. Whenever any party with a massive majority in any state finds itself marginalised in the central legislature, it disrupts proceedings, just as popular issues not reflected in legislative proceedings provoke undemocratic expressions and reciprocal repression. Such examples abound in India’s “quasi- federal” democracy till now. Lessons to learn Empirical and scholarly evidence suggest Wheare’s prefix about federalism arguably applies to other constitutional goals (largely operationally), while the federal flaws are structural, reinforcing conflicts and violence, endemic in the distorted democratic process. It is a threat to national security by incubating regional cultural challenges to national sovereignty, and reciprocal repression. We might learn from the mistakes of neighbouring Sri Lanka and Pakistan rather than be condemned to relive them. India’s national security deserves a functional democratic federal alternative to its dysfunctional “quasi-federal” structure, which is neither federal nor democratic but a constitutional “basic structure”.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Infusing public health into Indian medical education||The country has witnessed the menace of two COVID-19 waves and stares at a third. While COVID-19 has been presented as an overarching public health calamity, the influence of medical doctors in the health policy response to COVID-19 has been particularly profound. This is symptomatic of our long-standing tendency to confound medicine with public health which permeates even the highest policy-making echelons. If anything, both the scope and consequence of medicine in the overall health of the population is significantly limited. COVID-19 entails that this fact leaves the libraries and academia, and manifests as tangible policy measures that help consolidate public health in the country. Distinct specialty, stagnation In the 1950s, a global consensus and a concomitant national consensus on the importance of socially-oriented physicians in population health resulted in the establishment of community medicine as a distinct medical specialty, both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Vast swathes of the community medicine curriculum are devoted to tackling major public health challenges through a plethora of vertical disease control programmes which have always driven the national public health discourse. The larger medical curriculum has remained more or less stagnant since post-Independence. Similarly, hardly any attempt has been made to reform the community medicine curriculum, from one that primarily provides technical inputs to technocratic health programmes — to one which can also take on the larger questions related to health policy and health systems, and inculcate critical thinking along lines that are divergent from clinical medicine. Multidisciplinary science Some experts have advocated the establishment of public health departments in medical schools, inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic. Community medicine, while frequently equated with public health, fails to embrace multiple facets of the multidisciplinary assemblage of competencies that is public health. Juxtapose the community medicine curriculum with that of any of the few bastions of socially-oriented public health courses, and the distinction becomes readily apparent. But proponents of community medicine have not been in denial of this essential distinction — eventually, community medicine is a medical specialty while public health is a multidisciplinary science. Since public health is a multidisciplinary science, why do we emphasise instilling public health competencies in medicine, and not so much for other allied fields such as engineering or anthropology? The pragmatic answer is that medical doctors, de facto , are likely to continue to be the most influential players in public health policy at least in the foreseeable future. This makes it imperative that medical doctors imbibe multidisciplinary public health thinking right since their formative days. Recent medical curricular reforms in India have laid a stress on inculcating clinical empathy, early clinical exposure, and at least ritualistically, on greater community exposure. The Cuban example However, none of these confers the competencies necessary to critically assess the larger public health and health systems landscape of the country. For a medical curriculum to be steeped in clinical medicine and not inculcate a broader public health orientation is least desirable where health policy is largely shaped by doctors. At the postgraduate level, re-emphasising multidisciplinary public health principles would be equally important to ensure that we create not just community medicine technocrats but also well-rounded advocates of health system reform. While health-care reform is a complex process with numerous interacting elements, the role of formative medical education in it is quite often underrated. Countries such as Cuba demonstrate how a medical curriculum attuned to public health can strongly influence the whole philosophy of health-care provision in a country.  Despite the considerable overlap between them, the non-substitutability of community medicine and public health cannot be ignored, at least in the current Indian context. Community medicine will always defend its exclusivity as being a fundamentally medical specialty meant only for doctors, and public health courses will rightfully need to be open to students from diverse backgrounds. Looking ahead A middle ground can be struck by upgrading community medicine to ‘community medicine and public health’ both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This will involve revamping the community medicine curriculum through incorporation of or emphasising those areas of public health which are presently left out or under-emphasised, such as social health, health policy and health systems. At the same time, representation of experts other than doctors and from fields allied to public health will be essential in the refurbished ‘community medicine and public health’ departments.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Grim turn||The killings of seven civilians in Srinagar in six days mark a grim turn in the situation in the Kashmir Valley. This vicious, mindless violence against commoners, owned up by a group that calls itself the Resistance Front — believed to be a shadow organisation of the Pakistan-based LeT — is yet another reminder of the pathological hatred transnational radical Islamism inspires. The victims include local Muslims who were branded traitors, but the targeting of the Hindu Pandit and Sikh minority communities is unmistakable. Srinagar’s prominent Kashmiri Pandit chemist, Makhan Lal Bindroo, whose decision to stay on through the violent 1990s was seen as a positive omen by the displaced community, was gunned down. The killers used epithets such as ‘RSS stooge’, ‘police informer’ and ‘traitor’ for the victims. Majid Ahmad Gojri and Mohammad Shafi Dar were killed on October 2. On October 7, a Sikh principal and a Kashmir Pandit who had returned to the Valley after taking up a job under the Prime Minister’s special job package for migrant Pandits, were gunned down. Islamist terrorists have sought an ethnic cleansing of the Valley for long. The Pandits had to leave in large numbers in 1990 following violence. After 1994, attacks on minorities became episodic, but not without periodical outrages such as the Wandhama massacre, when 23 Pandits were shot dead in January 1998 and the Chittisinghpura massacre, in which 35 Sikhs were killed in Anantnag in March 2000. The wave of violence is taking place against the backdrop of an uptick in tourist inflow to the Valley and the Centre’s push to promote a raft of development schemes. The administration is also encouraging the Pandits to return. A nine-week-long outreach of the Centre in J&K where Union Ministers are visiting remote districts, including those closer to the LoC, is under way. Union Home Minister Amit Shah could make a visit later this month. Strict directives were issued to unfurl the national flag in all government buildings, including schools, on August 15. There is also a higher level of intolerance by the administration, which does not spare even the political activities of mainstream parties. There is an aggressive drive too to punish government staff suspected to be separatist sympathisers. Civilians are soft targets for the terrorists in this milieu. According to police figures, J&K saw 28 civilian killings, surpassing the 22 casualties of security personnel so far this year. Of the 28 killings, four were local Hindus, one Sikh, two non-local Hindu labourers and 21 local Muslims; 23 were political workers, with most from the BJP. No society can tolerate such violence. But while pursuing terrorists, the administration should also engage with political parties and civil society organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/grim-turn/article36908371.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Simple, but brilliant||This year’s Nobel Prize for Chemistry is for an efficient, “precise, cheap, fast and environmentally friendly” way to develop new molecules using a simple yet novel concept of catalysis — asymmetric organocatalysis. It was awarded to German scientist Benjamin List of the Max Planck Institute and Scotland-born scientist David W.C. MacMillan of Princeton University who independently developed the new way of catalysis in 2000. They came up with “a truly elegant tool for making molecules — simpler than one could ever imagine”. Since then, the process they evolved has led to a “gold rush” in the catalysis field. The multitudes of new organocatalysts developed have helped drive a variety of chemical reactions, in turn accelerating pharmaceutical drug research. The asymmetric organocatalysts have allowed researchers to efficiently produce new molecules with complete certainty of the 3-D orientation or handedness. Molecules naturally present and those synthesised can exist in two forms — right-handed and left-handed, and their properties very often vary depending on their handedness. In the 1950-60s, thalidomide was widely used to treat nausea in pregnant women, but caused severe birth defects. It became clear that the right-handed molecule was highly toxic. But asymmetric organocatalysts allowed the production of molecules of the desired mirror image form. While using other catalysts that require isolation and purification of each intermediate product — leading to loss of substance at every stage — asymmetric organocatalysts allow several steps in molecule production to continue without interruption, minimising waste. In 2001, the three scientists who first developed asymmetric catalysts won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. But such catalysts often use heavy metals, making them expensive and environmentally harmful. There were other challenges too — a high sensitivity to oxygen and water. This meant that industrial use made the process expensive. Many enzyme catalysts too are asymmetric and are not sensitive to oxygen and water. But they are very often much larger than the actual target medicine and can take a longer time to do their job. Instead of using enzymes which normally contain hundreds of amino acids, this year’s laureates developed a carbon-based catalyst made from a single, circular amino acid. Since these catalysts are asymmetric, only molecules of a single handedness are produced. If Benjamin List used a single amino acid proline to perform a certain bond-forming chemical reaction, W.C. MacMillan demonstrated that many modified amino acids could asymmetrically produce another bond-forming reaction. The circular-shaped amino acid the laureates used ensured that only one mirror image of the molecule could be produced. This year’s Prize underlines the often-ignored message — great discoveries can come even from simple ideas which are often overlooked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/simple-but-brilliant/article36908372.ece
09 October 2021||MUMBAI,||RBI suspends GSAP, holds interest rates||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday said it was halting its bond buying under the G-Sec Acquisition Programme (GSAP) for now, with Governor Shaktikanta Das stressing that the measure had succeeded in ensuring adequate liquidity and stabilising financial markets. “Coupled with other liquidity measures, it facilitated congenial and orderly financing conditions and a conducive environment for the recovery,” Mr. Das said after announcing the Monetary Policy Committee’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged and retain an ‘accommodative’ policy stance. “The total liquidity injected into the system during the first six months of the current financial year through open market operations (OMOs), including G-SAP, was Rs. 2.37 lakh crore, as against an injection of Rs. 3.1 lakh crore over the full financial year 2020-21,” he noted. “Given the existing liquidity overhang, the absence of a need for additional borrowing for GST compensation and the expected expansion of liquidity in the system as Government spending increases in line with budget estimates, the need for undertaking further G-SAP operations at this juncture does not arise,” Mr. Das added. The RBI, however, remained ready to undertake G-SAP as and when warranted by liquidity conditions, and would also continue to flexibly conduct other liquidity management operations including Operation Twist (OT) and regular open market operations (OMOs). Stating that the growth impulses seemed to be strengthening, supported by ebbing of infections, the robust pace of vaccination, expected record  kharif foodgrains production, the government’s focus on capital expenditure and buoyant external demand, Mr. Das said the inflation trajectory was also turning out to be more favourable than anticipated. Lowers inflation outlook The RBI retained its growth forecast for this fiscal at 9.5% and cut its projection for average inflation for the full year to 5.3%, from 5.7% earlier, even as it flagged core inflation that ‘remains sticky’. Elevated global crude oil and other commodity prices combined with an acute shortage of key industrial components and high logistics costs, were adding to input cost pressures, it added. “Headline inflation continues to be significantly influenced by very high inflation in select items such as edible oils, petrol and diesel, LPG and medicines,” the RBI Governor said. ‘Rate hike by FY22-end’ “Like many other central banks, the RBI is signalling a gradual move towards ‘normalising’ its monetary policy as the economy emerges from the shadow of the second wave,” Crisil Research said in a report. “We expect this normalisation to continue in the coming months and a hike in the repo rate by 25 basis points by fiscal 2022-end, assuming strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation risks,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-suspends-gsap-holds-interest-rates/article36908352.ece

Mr. Gadkari further said if electric vehicles expand to 40% in the two-wheeler and car segments and close to 100% for buses by 2030, India would be able to cut crude oil consumption by 156 million tonnes, worth Rs. 3.5 lakh crore. “There is an immediate need to decarbonise the transport sector and make it sustainable from the economy, ecology, and environmental point of view, he said, addressing an event organised by FICCI virtually. “The government intends to have EV sales penetration of 30% for private cars, 70% for commercial vehicles, 40% for buses and 80% for two- and three-wheelers by 2030,” he added. The Road Transport and Highways Minister pointed out that in the EV mission, NITI Aayog has inspired 25 States to come up with EV policies, out of which 15 have already announced State EV policy. Mr. Gadkari said it was his dream to make India’s automobile sector number one in the world in the next five years. The Minister also asserted that there was no shortage of lithium ion, which is used in making batteries for EVs, in India. He said a potential pilot project is being planned to install an electric highway between Delhi-Mumbai expressways which will facilitate the movement of heavy-duty trucks and passenger buses on electricity. To fulfil everyday transport needs of a large population, he said his Ministry is focusing on the development of efficient and affordable public transport systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/aim-to-have-30-of-2030-car-sales-as-evs/article36908357.ece

However, the win wasn’t enough to keep its title campaign alive as Mumbai Indians failed to make it to the Playoffs as Kolkata Knight Riders qualified as the fourth team on net run rate. MI knew that it was virtually a mission impossible to progress to the playoffs as it had to bat first and win by at least 170 runs. While Rohit Sharma won the toss to achieve the first objective, Ishan and Suryakumar’s whirlwind knocks ensured Mumbai piled up 235 for nine, the highest total of IPL 2021. Near-impossible task However, despite the torrid season SRH has had, restricting it to below 64 was a near-impossible task for MI. Once Jason Roy and Abhishek Sharma got off to a quick start, the writing was on the wall for MI. The Sunrisers’s start was nowhere close to the opening flurry by Ishan, with Rohit being awestruck at the other end. The PowerPlay saw 14 fours and two sixes, with Rohit contributing only three of them. While Ishan ensured that his fifty versus Rajasthan Royals three nights ago wasn’t a fluke, dominated the first half of the innings with audacious strokeplay, Suryakumar took over the mantle in the latter half.

09 October 2021||TURIN,||France pulls off stunning comeback win||World champion France recovered from two goals down to beat Belgium 3-2 in a thrilling Nations League semifinal on Thursday with a last minute strike from Theo Hernandez securing a place in Sunday’s showpiece match against Spain. In a crazy end to the game, Belgium thought it had won the pulsating contest minutes earlier but Romelu Lukaku’s late effort was ruled out for offside by VAR. Yannick Carrasco fired Belgium ahead in the 37th minute, cutting in front from the left flank and then surprising Hugo Lloris, firing past the wrong-footed French goalkeeper at the near post. Three minutes later Lukaku doubled the lead with a superbly taken goal, turning sharply to loose his marker Lucas Hernandez and than blasting a thunderous drive past Lloris from a tight angle. Fantastic trio The 2-0 scoreline at the interval was somewhat harsh on France who had played some attractive football, with Kylian Mbappe and Karim Benzema linking up well with Antoine Griezmann in the three-pronged attack. It was Benzema who brought France back into the game in the 62nd minute, brilliantly twisting and turning to find space to drill home a shot from the edge of the box after excellent work from Mbappe. Mbappe, who had not scored in his last six internationals, then equalised with a penalty after German referee Daniel Siebert went to the pitch-side monitor before ruling that Youri Tielemens had caught Griezmann’s foot as he challenged him. VAR denies Lukaku France was on top and searching for the winner but three minutes from the end of normal time Lukaku looked to have won it for Belgium, steering home a cross from Carrasco, but the goal was ruled out by VAR for offside. Paul Pogba then hit the top of the post with a curling free-kick before Les Blues grabbed victory with a 90th minute strike. Mbappe and Griezmann lined up down the right, the overlapping Benjamin Pavard fired in a low cross which an off-balance Toby Alderweireld could only get a slight touch on, diverting the ball to Theo Hernandez who set himself before beating keeper Thibaut Courtois with a pinpoint low drive. “We were unlucky in the first half. We sat back a little too much,” said France manager Didier Deschamps. “The result shows the character of the team. We were here to play the final and here we are,” added Deschamps.  The result: Belgium 2 (Carrasco 37, Lukaku 40) lost to France 3 (Benzema 62, Mbappe 69-pen, T.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Bharat smashes a last-ball six as Royal Challengers leave Capitals stunned||Srikar Bharat sealed a last-ball thriller with a six as Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Delhi Capitals by seven wickets in an IPL encounter in Dubai on Friday. With 19 needed from 12, Anrich Nortje bowled a sensational 19th over, going for just four. RCB needed 15 off Avesh Khan's final over and Bharat took RCB over the line with an unbeaten 52-ball 78. He was ably supported by Glenn Maxwell, who got his fourth fifty in five innings. The RCB chase got off to the worst possible start when Nortje removed Devdutt Padikkal and Virat Kohli early. With RCB 11 for two after three overs, AB de Villiers was promoted to No. 4. But the South African couldn't make the most of the move, falling for a run-a-ball 26 to Axar Patel and leaving RCB 104 to get from the last 10. With the asking rate climbing past 11, Maxwell was dropped twice, by Shreyas Iyer and R. Ashwin, off Axar. Meanwhile, No. 3 Bharat reached his 50 off 37 as RCB brought the equation down to 46 in 24 balls. Maxwell and Bharat scored 15 and 12 off Rabada and Khan in the 17th and 18th overs. It was a timely assault. Earlier, Kohli won the toss and inserted Delhi. Maxwell got the new ball, probably to get the better of left-hander Shikhar Dhawan. But the move did not reap the desired results as Dhawan took 15 off his eight balls. Maxwell's three overs in the PowerPlay went for 29. The DC openers did not let the tempo drop after the PowerPlay, going after Yuzvendra Chahal and collecting 20 off his first two overs. RCB's wait for a breakthrough ended in the 11th over when Harshal Patel had Shikhar Dhawan caught. Harshal is now two wickets short of the highest tally for an edition — 32 by Dwayne Bravo (2013). At the other end, Shaw fell two short of his fifty, caught off Chahal. Rishabh Pant followed suit, caught behind off Dan Christian.

However, RCB kept up the pressure as Mohammed Siraj removed Shreyas for an 18-ball 18.

09 October 2021||JAMSHEDPUR,||Anshu displays grit, courage||Twenty-year-old Anshu Malik walked away from the World wrestling championships in Oslo (Norway) with a lot of pain on her right shoulder, but won hearts with her grit and courage. Taking on a former World champion and two-time Olympic medallist was never going to be easy, but Anshu, despite picking up an ankle injury in the quarterfinals and also nursing an elbow injury, fought valiantly against Helen Maroulis of the USA to take a 1-0 lead before losing the 57kg final ‘by fall’. As she headed back home on Friday with her hand in a sling, her father Dharamvir Malik, a former wrestler, was proud of Anshu’s achievement. “She did well, she will learn and improve. The main job now is to see a doctor and examine the seriousness of her injury,” Dharamvir said. With her silver medal, Anshu has gone a step ahead of five other Indian women — Alka Tomar (2006), Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari (2012), Pooja Dhanda (2018) and Vinesh Phogat (2019) — who had secured bronze medals in the elite event. At Olso, Sarita Mor joined the list with a bronze in the 59kg section. Third Indian Anshu, a cadet World champion and a junior Worlds silver medallist who graduated to the top level seamlessly, was the third Indian to reach a Worlds final after 2010 champion Sushil Kumar and 2018 silver medallist Bajrang Punia. “After the Olympic loss, I advised her to believe in karma. Her elbow injury got aggravated in the selection trials and it was a really tough month. Anshu trained (under the guidance of coach Jagdeesh Sheoran at the Nidani village in Jind district, Haryana) despite tremendous pain,” said Dharamvir. In a video tweeted by United World Wrestling, Anshu said, “I am extremely delighted. I didn’t want to repeat the disappointing performance I put up at the Olympics. Before every bout I thought this is my last bout — now or never,” said Anshu, the reigning Asian champion. The Indian women’s team’s chief coach Kuldeep Malik hailed Anshu’s feat. “This performance will give her a lot of confidence for future events, including the Olympics,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/anshu-displays-grit-courage/article36908759.ece
09 October 2021||JAMSHEDPUR,||M.P. and Haryana triumph||A young Madhya Pradesh side pipped an accomplished Jharkhand outfit 5-4 via shoot-off to claim its maiden recurve women’s team title at the 40th NTPC National archery championships here on Friday. Madhya Pradesh, consisting of Amey Rai, Vitasha Thakur and Soniya Thakur, shot closer to the centre in a 28-28 shoot-off score line after tying 4-4 with the host, comprising India team regulars Komalika Bari and Ankita Bhakat and Dipti Kumari, in the final. Tense victories via shoot-offs over Punjab (5-4, 26-24) in the quarterfinals and Rajasthan (5-4, 26-25) in the semifinals prepared the Madhya Pradesh archers — who are products of the Madhya Pradesh Archery Academy in Jabalpur — to hold their nerve in the most crucial moment of the final. “It is a proud moment for us. All these girls are between 16 and 20 years of age and have proved themselves at junior level events. This is their first big win at the elite level,” said M.P. coach Richpal Singh Salaria. Haryana, consisting of Akash Malik, Sachin Gupta and Basant Kumar, defeated a talented Maharashtra side, including World youth championships team gold winner Parth Salunkhe, Yashdeep Bhoge and Om Vithalkar, 5-1 in the final to take the recurve men’s team crown. In the individual ranking round, Jayanta Talukdar, returning to a competition after recovering from COVID-19, scored 680 points to bag the top spot among men. B. Dhiraj (678) and Salunkhe (673) took the second and third spots respectively. Atanu Das (660) was 13th. Deepika Kumari gathered 665 points to emerge as the top-ranked woman. She was followed by Komalika (655) and Simranjeet Kaur (649).    Recurve Team results: Men: Final: Haryana bt Maharashtra 5-1; Third place: Jharkhand bt Rajasthan 6-0.   Women: Final: Madhya Pradesh bt Jharkhand 5-4 (28*-28); Third place: Rajasthan bt Maharashtra 5-3 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mp-women-triumph/article36908760.ece
09 October 2021||Aarhus (Denmark),||Indian shuttlers seek redemption||India will look to their stars — Saina Nehwal and the pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy — to recover quickly recover from the Sudirman Cup drubbing and produce a better show at the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals beginning here on Saturday. India cut a sorry figure at the Sudirman Cup mixed team championships in Vantaa, Finland losing to China and Thailand to be knocked out of the tournament last week. Reinforced However, with Saina, Chirag and Satwik back in the team, India can produce a strong performance in the event, where 16 top teams from five continents do battle. In the Thomas Cup, India is in Group C alongside China, the Netherlands and Tahiti, while the women are alongside Thailand, Spain and Scotland in Group B of the Uber Cup. The men open against the Netherlands and the women against Spain. Alongside B. Sai Praneeth and former World No. 1 K. Srikanth, are Sameer Verma and Kiran George in singles. Chirag, Satwik, Dhruv Kapila, M.R. Arjun, Krishna Prasad and Vishnu Vardhan make up the doubles squad. The men have not reached the knockout stage in the last 11 years but will fancy their chances this time.  The women’s team has won bronze twice — 2014 and 2016. But winning a medal will be tougher this time, especially without the services of double Olympic medallist P.V. Sindhu, who excused herself following a hectic Tokyo Games campaign. Assisting Saina, will be Malvika Bansod, Aditi Bhatt and Tasnim Mir. Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy lead the challenge in the company of the young pairs of Tanisha Crasto and Rutuparna Panda and Gayatri Gopichand and Treesa Jolly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-shuttlers-seek-redemption/article36908884.ece

The third season of the women’s Hockey Pro League begins on October 13 with Olympic and world champion the Netherlands taking on Belgium.

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Daksh to meet Rushil in final||Top seed Daksh Prasad set up a title clash with second seed Rushil Khosla in the under-16 boys’ event of the National sub-junior tennis championship at the DLTA Complex here on Friday. It was as much a test of endurance for the players as a test of skill, as the successful players had to play both the quarterfinals and semifinals the same day. Daksh spent a lot of time on court, first in a teaser against Jaishnav Shinde who missed chances to force a third set, and later against Navya Verma who succeeded in extending the fight to three sets. In contrast, Rushil dropped just three games in the semifinals against Suresh Keerthivassan and five against Tarun Korwar earlier.  In the under-16 girls’ event, Sonal Patil beat Madhurima Sawant 7-5, 6-0 in the semifinals after outplaying Riya Sachdeva for the loss of three games in the quarterfinals. Riya was quite exhausted, and had earlier lost the under-14 quarterfinals in three sets to Ikaraju Kanumuri. In the final, Sonal will challenge second seed Suhitha Maruri who has dropped only 14 games in all in four rounds.  The results: Under-16: Boys: Semifinals: Daksh Prasad bt Navya Verma 6-3, 3-6, 6-3; Rushil Khosla bt Suresh Keerthivassan 6-1, 6-2; Quarterfinals: Daksh bt Jaishnav Shinde 6-3, 7-6(9); Navya bt Tejas Ahuja 6-2, 3-6, 6-2; Suresh bt Rethin 7-5, 6-4; Rushil bt Tarun 6-3, 6-2.

09 October 2021||KOCHI,||Kozhikode ends a 34-year wait||It’s tough to select a football team in a district that’s crazy about the sport. And when the 20-member Kozhikode team was finalised for the 57th Kerala State senior inter-district football championship, there were many unhappy faces. “More than 700 boys came for the selection trials. And after we made the team, some players did not get a chance and everybody blamed us,” Kozhikode coach Wahid Muhammed Sali told The Hindu at the Maharaja’s Stadium here on Friday evening. “After that, my players and I, we took a decision that we would win the title. By God’s grace, we did it.” The Kozhikode boys made the district proud by winning the State senior title on Friday with a 4-2 tie-breaker victory over Thrissur that ended a 34-year wait for the trophy. The teams were level 1-1 at the end of the regulation period. And Kozhikode’s hero was its young goalkeeper Muhammed Fayiz who stunningly saved three of Thrissur’s four attempts in the tiebreaker. Kozhikode looked a solid side and took the lead in the third minute. It began with P.N. Noufal running towards the box from the left but he was brought down by Thrissur’s K.P. Srath and Kozhikode got an early freekick. T.P. Amal, who took kick, floated it into the box nicely. Goalkeeper K. Abhijith rushed out but he could only wave air. A Thrissur player tried to kick the danger away but it was a weak attempt and as the ball rose, an opportunistic Muhammed Sanish headed it in. Thrissur’s equaliser came off a corner kick and Muhammed Shafi scored with a beauty from 30 yards out that just went out of the reach of goalkeeper Fayiz. And then came the dramatic tiebreaker.  The results:   Final: Kozhikode 4 (K.K. Mohammed Sanish 3; in tiebreaker: M.A. Suhail, K.P. Abdul Sameeh and P. Abijith) bt Thrissur 2 (Mohammed Shafi 34; in tiebreaker: K.M. Rijas) via tiebreaker.   Third place: Malappuram 1 (Nandu Krishna 69) bt Kannur 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kozhikode-ends-a-34-year-wait/article36909116.ece
09 October 2021||Carrara,||India looks to fire on all cylinders||Bolstered by Jemimah Rodrigues’ return to form, India will look to come out all guns blazing in the second women’s T20 International against Australia on Saturday after rain played spoilsport in the opening game here. Criticised for regular failures and after losing her place in the 50-over side, Jemimah made a sensational comeback with an unbeaten 49 off 36 balls in the first T20I. Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma have been in good form, having played pivotal roles in the drawn Test and given India a rollicking start in the first T20. Harmanpreet Kaur also joined the team in the first game after missing the ODI leg and the Day/Night Test owing to a thumb injury. Her presence makes India a formidable batting unit. Thursday’s game was washed out and Harmanpreet & Co. will look to win the next two T20s to end the tour on a high. It’s also a fine opportunity for the young duo of Yastika Bhatia and Richa Ghosh to shine in the middle order. Veteran seamer Shikha Pandey will bear the onus of getting early wickets. Australia, on the other hand, boasts of a number of quality all-rounders. Captain Meg Lanning has plenty of options and will hope the young stars will deliver. The hosts also have plenty of experience in Ellyse Perry, Alyssa Healy, Ashleigh Gardner and Beth Mooney.  The teams (from):   India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Smriti Mandhana (Vice-Capt.), Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Sneh Rana, Yastika Bhatia, Shikha Pandey, Meghna Singh, Pooja Vastrakar, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Poonam Yadav, Richa Ghosh (wk), Harleen Deol, Arundhati Reddy, Radha Yadav and Renuka Singh.   Australia: Meg Lanning (Capt.), Darcie Brown, Maitlan Brown, Stella Campbell, Nicola Carey, Hannah Darlington, Ashleigh Gardner, Alyssa Healy, Tahlia McGrath, Sophie Molineux, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Georgia Redmayne, Molly Strano, Annabel Sutherland, Tayla Vlaeminck and Georgia Wareham.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Came up short setting a total, says Fleming||After becoming the first team to qualify for the playoffs, Chennai Super Kings lost its last three league matches heading into the knockouts and coach Stephen Fleming said it is a cause for concern. Tricky proposition “You have to be concerned when you lose three games in a row. Batting first, [it’s] interesting coming to grips in setting a total. It has been tricky going around the venues to try and find the target score. There has been a challenge to find the tempo when you are batting first to get a competitive score on board and we have struggled to do that,” said Fleming. There has been a lack of runs from the middle-order which hurt the team against Punjab Kings in its final league match. “We could not find a method to get any fluency into our batting. “Right from the start, trying to find the best way to take the bowling on but it was very good and [pitch] was probably a bit slow and a little variable. “Getting the pace of the wicket and trying to find the tempo to create a score, we just came up short. It was one of those days, a stunted effort in the first innings,” explained the former New Zealand skipper. “The confidence and method we are using, we just need to tune that up in the next couple of days,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/came-up-short-setting-a-total-says-fleming/article36908768.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Russell may be back for play offs’||David Hussey, Kolkata Knight Riders’ mentor, feels all-rounder Andre Russell is close to being match-ready ahead of the Eliminator against Royal Challengers Bangalore on October 11. “He had a fitness test on Wednesday,” Hussey said. “I think he is maybe a game away so I think he will be pushing hard to get back in for the final [playoffs], which will be a huge boost not only for us but the competition. He is world-class, and he provides lots of entertainment.” Russell missed KKR’s last game against Rajasthan Royals in Sharjah on Thursday, which Eoin Morgan’s men won by 86 runs; their second-biggest win in terms of runs. It also helped Kolkata seal a place in the playoffs; a remarkable turnaround for a side that had just two wins out of seven when the IPL was suspended midway earlier this year. Meanwhile, Royals skipper Sanju Samson praised Rahul Tewatia for his 36-ball 44, but rued the lack of partnerships. “Sharjah is his (Rahul Tewatia) favourite ground, he enjoys batting here. We could have a recent [decent] partnership with him. We could have had a close match...,” Samson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/russell-may-be-back-for-play-offs/article36908769.ece
09 October 2021||JAMSHEDPUR,||Ladakh makes its debut in Nationals||Ladakh has reached a sporting milestone by making its debut in the National championships here. Prior to this, Ladakhi archers’ participation, as part of Jammu and Kashmir, in the National championships was minimal. Gulzar Ahmed Khan, a former archer and manager of the Ladakh team, hopes participation in the elite event will promote the sport in the Union Territory. “Archery and polo are the traditional sports of Ladakh. It is in our blood. In 2014, we started recurve and compound archery — watching it on YouTube. Stanzin Doller, our only NIS diploma-holder coach, has overseen our preparations for some time. “We got affiliation in 2020. We held preliminary trials in Kargil and Leh and a final selection trial. We got about a week for practice, then flew in here,” a proud Ahmed Khan told The Hindu . He underscored the challenges. “Equipment is expensive, but the authorities have promised to start a scheme with a 75% subsidy on equipment. “Also, we come from a cold region. If we get 10-15 days practice ahead of a big event, then our boys will do well. We just need to be informed a little earlier,” he said. Compound archer Stanzin Jigdal said, “It is great to participate here. Hopefully, this will inspire others.” Coach Doller, who picked up archery while at college in Chandigarh and competed in the Nationals, wanted her trainees to excel at international events. “There were no coaches in Ladakh, that’s why I did NIS (diploma). For the last two years I have been training kids and para-archers at my academy. “My parents ask, ‘Why do you do something without being paid?’ With progress, there will be more coaches. I want my kids to do what I could not,” said Doller.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ladakh-makes-its-debut-in-nationals/article36909179.ece
09 October 2021||HYDERABAD,||Happy and satisfied, says Harika||It was a memorable double for 30-year-old Dronavalli Harika — being a member of the Indian women’s team which won the silver at the recent FIDE World women’s team chess championship at Sitges (Spain) and also bagging an individual silver on the top board by remaining unbeaten. Harika said it was one of the most satisfying performances in her career, especially as it came after a long break in the international circuit. The Indian women’s team included R. Vaishali, Tania Sachdev, Mary Ann Gomes and Bhakti Kulkarni. “I am happy and satisfied. Winning a team medal in the Women’s Olympiad or World team’s has been one of my long-standing dreams,” Harika told The Hindu . “I first played in an Olympiad in 2004 and since then it has been a roller coaster ride. “On numerous occasions, we were close but somehow never achieved a podium finish,” she said. “I have been longing for this moment and I am extremely proud that we won the first ever silver for Team India and I hope this historic occasion is the start of many to come. I would rank this amongst my best results ever. “From an individual perspective, I am happy to come out undefeated and win the silver on Board 1,” she said. Kunte’s role Harika said coach and captain GM Abhijit Kunte took a lot of important decisions alongwith the other coach Shyam Sundar. “In every round someone or the other stood up and scored crucial point. Off the board, we shared a very good atmosphere which was largely helpful in achieving this historic result. “ I hope this will inspire many more to dream big in the world of chess,” said Harika, who is now preparing for the online Super League to be held from October 11 to 17 and the FIDE Grand Swiss from Oct. 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/happy-and-satisfied-harika/article36909071.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Madappa pips Joshi at the post||When it mattered, Viraj Madappa held his nerve and holed the birdie-putt to carve out a memorable one-stroke victory over fellow overnight leader and practice-partner Khalin Joshi in the Rs. 70-lakh Tata Steel PGTI MP Cup golf tournament at the Delhi Golf Club course here on Friday. The thrilling win was worth Rs. 11,31,550 for Madappa who moved to the third place on the Order of Merit, behind leader Karandeep Kochar and S. Chikkarangappa. Joshi, who started the day with an ‘eagle’ and led for the better part of the final round, received Rs. 7,81,550. Rashid Khan, playing a group ahead of the final group, shared the lead with Khalin at 14-under after the latter’s bogey on the 14th hole. Soon thereafter, Rashid dropped his first stroke of the day on the 15th followed by a double-bogey on the final hole and eventually took the third place that fetched him Rs. 4,38,550. For the second successive round, Madappa stole Joshi’s thunder. After Joshi broke away with an ‘eagle’ on the 515-yard par-5 opening hole and found pars on the rest of the holes on the front nine, he was wary of Rashid’s birdie blitz. All this while, Madappa had two bogeys and two birdies on the first nine.  The drama unfold on the back nine, leader Joshi (-15) and Madappa (-13) birdied the 10th hole. Then came Joshi’s first bogey, on the 13th and Madappa’s par closed the gap between them. The turning point proved to the par-5 14th hole where the lead changed hands as Madappa’s birdie coincided with Joshi’s second successive bogey. In fact, both hit the bushes but Madappa was lucky to get a free-drop since his stance was on the cart-path. On the last two holes, Madappa and Joshi found a bogey and a birdie that meant the title was decided without a playoff.  Final scores: 274: Viraj Madappa (71, 67, 66, 70); 275: Khalin Joshi (69, 66, 69, 71); 277: Rashid Khan (67, 73, 68, 69); 279: Yuvraj Singh Sandhu (69, 75, 66, 69); 280: M.

But when young goalkeeper Muhammed Fayiz came for the Ernakulam District trials for the State senior football championship, the selectors were not impressed. “He didn’t get in the Ernakulam District team and a day later, he came for the Kozhikode trials. It was my and our goalkeeping coach’s decision to pick him,” said Kozhikode coach Wahid Muhammed Sali. The Ernakulam reject turned out to be the hero of Kozhikode’s triumph at the Kerala State senior championship here on Friday evening, stopping three of Thrissur’s four attempts in the tiebreaker. “Somehow, I got them. This is the first time I’m performing like this in the tiebreaker,” the 18-year-old Fayiz, who is doing his second year BA Economics at the Maharaja’s College here, told The Hindu on Friday evening. Fayiz, from Thamassery in Kozhikode, took to football at the SEPT Academy in Thiruvambady and is now with Kochi’s Golden Threads FC and is a part of the Kerala Sports Council’s Sports Academy at Panampilly Nagar here. “Since I’m an under-21 player I had a better chance to play in the Kozhikode team,” said Fayiz.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Always there for bhakthas||Parvathi, Ambika, Tripurasundari, Kamakshi, Visalakshi, Durga, Adi Parasakthi — many are the names Lord Siva’s Consort is known by, said M.A. Manickavelu, in a discourse. Lalitha Sahasranama gives us thousand names of the Goddess. Each devotee may have a favourite name by which he addresses Her and prays to Her. No matter by what name Her devotees call out to Her, She is always there for them. She even helps when we have not explicitly asked Her for assistance, for She knows our needs. There is a story about an old woman who went to have darshan of the Goddess in Kanyakumari. It was dark, and she did not know the way. Ambika came in the form of a little girl bearing a lamp, and guided the old woman. Kamban who wrote Kamba Ramayanam and Ottakoothar who wrote Thakka Yaga parani, would write at night. Ambika would hold a lamp, in whose light they would write. The Nayanmar Sundarar married Sangili Nachiar in Thiruvottriyur with Lord Siva as witness. Sundarar promised Sangili that he would never be separated from her. But he wanted to have darshan of the deity of Thiruvarur — Tyagarajaswami. So he broke his promise to her, and as a result he lost his eyesight. But his bhakti towards Lord Siva and his attachment to the Lord were legendary. Neither the Lord nor His consort would let him down. He had been punished for not keeping his word to Sangili Nachiar, but he was not totally forsaken by the Lord or the Goddess. From Thiruvottriyur to Thiruvenpakkam, near Kanchipuram, the Goddess of Thiruvenpakkam, known as Minnal Oli Ambikai, guided Sundarar. He regained vision in his left eye in the Ekambareswara temple in Kanchi, and then proceeded to Thiruvarur, where he got back his vision in the other eye too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/always-there-for-bhakthas/article36908724.ece

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Indra Nooyi: ‘An economist, not a feminist’||In 2009, Indra Nooyi found herself caught in a funny game of tug of war. As the global business icon stood between US President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting, they both claimed her as one of their own! A daughter of Chennai who moved to the US to pursue an education and career, Nooyi, now 65, became the longest-serving — and most visible — CEO of PepsiCo, which she ran from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, she championed healthier product offerings, pushed for sustainability, including waste and water reduction, and sought greater workplace diversity. Reflections on her personal and professional journey now inform her new book, My Life in Full , a memoir-meets-manifesto for work-life inclusion. Nooyi describes it as a personal story, a business story, and a story about her hopes for the future of work. “I want to advance the care discussion, figure out how to convene the right people. [I also want] to give back as much as I can, whether it is mentoring the young generation or working with entrepreneurs,” she tells The Hindu Weekend in an interview. The book is a riveting read, and particularly engaging in the parts where she explains her career trajectory, from BCG’s Chicago office to PepsiCo. She also opens up about herself, her dreams for cricket, and why dressing right is a powerful tool. (In the book, she recalls how she bought an ill-fitting dark blue polyester outfit to “fit in”, but it backfired. A friend then advised her to wear a sari the next time because if people “won’t hire you for who you are, it’s their loss”.) Today, Nooyi serves as an independent director on the board of the International Cricket Council, the first woman to do so. She also sits on Amazon’s board, teaches at the prestigious US Military Academy at West Point, and continues to advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Edited excerpts:   What prompted you to write this memoir? When I retired after 12 years as CEO of PepsiCo, I wanted to work on issues supporting women advancing in the workplace. When I stepped down, people kept asking me, ‘Why isn’t a woman replacing you?’. They never ask a man that question! There’s a tremendous burden on women in terms of how to handle work and family pressure. My lawyer and publisher came to me and said, ‘I think people want to hear your life story... how you stayed married for 41 years, have two kids, and advanced to becoming CEO. That story gives authenticity to whatever you are going to propose’. That’s how this book came about. Other books by male business leaders hardly touch on work life balance. When is that going to change?  How about right now? We have to start the conversation by saying we are not talking about females, we are talking about family. Talking about families is an economic issue. The economy grows when everybody can be deployed to help grow the economy. I think we have to bring men to the table to talk about how, collectively, we are going to address this issue. You write that ‘women’s choice to work outside the home is integral to their well-being’. Yet the reality of many women’s lives makes it hard to manage.  There’s no question that I had a good family support structure. And when they weren’t there, I created a support structure. Many people cannot afford that. I think about the nurses, front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic — many women who had children at home. They had no predictability, no flexibility in their work hours. And we never sat down for a moment and talked about how they were going to handle childcare, eldercare? The one good thing that came out of the pandemic is that we have to think about work flexibility in a much more expansive way. How would you envision changing this lack of a support structure?  This is where I think governments, corporates, NGOs, and communities have to come together. I was looking at the anganwadi structure in India. The thought behind it is very good, but the execution needs to improve. Now, we should think not about anganwadi 2.0 but 4.0. Redesign that structure, train the people, pay them so they can work there and take kids till age five so that they could go to school after that. This could be absolutely frame-breaking for India at a point when women are doing really well in schools and colleges. Somebody once told me the biggest emerging market opportunity within the United States and within India is women. So I am approaching this an economist, not a feminist. How did you navigate the internal politics in a major organisation like PepsiCo?  The time that I came into the workforce, there were hardly any women. What I experienced, however, was a lot of support. People said, ‘Hey, if she’s made it this far there must be something good about her’. But I also sensed [the question], ‘A woman of colour, sitting in the boardroom. Who is she?’. And, along with that, came certain behaviours you could say are just not acceptable. So, I had to perform better than anybody else to be seen or noticed or respected. The most important piece of advice I would give people: understand the politics in the organisation, and stay the hell out of it. Do you think with the pandemic, the idea of care and gender roles is evolving?  I think work flexibility has to become the norm. Some mix of work at home, remote work and in the office will become common. We have to be careful not to create two classes of citizens [though] — the men who come to work and the women who work from home and, therefore, are pushed down or treated differently. You introduced mentoring [women] at PepsiCo. How do companies foster such programmes?  If we frame this as a strictly women’s issue, people go, ‘There they go again the women!’ This is not a female issue, it’s an economic issue, a family issue, a future of work issue. The future of work is about caregivers — about teachers, nurses and doctors. It’s about women coming into the workforce in large numbers. The whole care structure is not going to work without women in our systems. How are we going to support all these women? We are all social beings and we have to figure out how to create social networks outside of digital social networks. From your days at BCG, wearing saris to work, till now — where your trademark scarf and stylish short hair are admired — you describe your sartorial transformation as giving you confidence.  The workplace is a competitive place. What you want to do is take away any negative attention on the way you dress. In each country or economy, dress appropriately for that place. In my case, I was in long skirts and misshapen clothes. So, [I would] overpower the dressing issue with my competence. I was always over prepared. When you come to a workplace, it’s not a social place. Dress appropriately and let the work speak for itself. Your drive comes across throughout the book. Even as a young girl, you formed a band and started a women’s cricket team. Is that an innate personality trait?  I am wired differently. It feels like I have to do something all the time to break boundaries. The world has so much to teach you. Go out and seek that knowledge.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Cartoons underground||The location of the two-decade-old Indian Institute of Cartoonists (IIC) is surprisingly modest. It is almost like a meeting spot for a secret group. A few metres into Midford Garden Road near Trinity Circle in Bengaluru is Midford Garden House, with a board that says ‘Indian Cartoon Gallery’. If you miss the little red arrow mark on the board that points to the basement, you would probably look for the gallery in the other areas of the building. There are no visitors at the gallery, hosting IIC’s 172nd exhibition. There are 58 cartoons, by professionals and amateurs from India, on display. Looking at them, one wonders if this underground club-like setting is appropriate in a way. For, no one and nothing is spared from criticism and ridicule. The government, the Opposition, the Goods and Service Tax, Donald Trump, Rajinikanth, and of course, the more topical novel coronavirus. “This is a free space for cartoonists across all ages and levels to display their works,” says V.G. Narendra, who started IIC in 2001. Narendra, 73, started reading newspapers in his late teens. Growing up in Dharwad, he read the Kannada dailies more than the English ones. More than the articles, the cartoons caught young Narendra’s attention. “They were entertaining and humorous but also gave an idea about what is happening in the society. I used to look forward to them every day.” Soon, he started drawing them. A few got published in the local dailies. Narendra wanted cartooning to be more than just a hobby. So, after his graduation in BSc Physics in 1969, he left for Mumbai. He found a job at the Free Press Journal , where R.K. Laxman and Bal Thackeray had worked. His work caught the attention of the legendary cartoonist Shankar Pillai, who ran Shankar’s Weekly . Pillai employed and mentored him. He worked for the publication for two years until the Emergency in 1975 forced it to shut down. After returning home the following year, he founded the Karnataka Cartoonists Association. He wished for a national-level organisation for cartoonists. “The artists had the Lalit Kala Akademi. The writers had Sahitya Akademi. So, why not something similar for cartoonists?” He discussed this question with Mario Miranda, one of the country’s best-known cartoonists and illustrators. With his guidance, Narendra started IIC in 2001. S.M. Krishna, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, gave Rs. 5 lakh for a two-day national convention and exhibition. Over a hundred cartoonists across the country participated in the event. IIC, however, had no premises until Ashok Kheny helped it get the 5,000 sq ft Midford House basement. So, where did it operate from until then? “My two-bedroom house in Nandini Layout,” jokes Narendra. He is grateful that IIC now has its own premises. Over the last 20 years, it has organised over 170 exhibitions.  IIC will organise an exhibition from October 23 to November 16 to mark the 100th birth anniversary of R.K. Laxman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cartoons-underground/article36909239.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Meet the millets||Whatever rice and wheat can do, millets can do better as revealed by cookies, savouries and all manner of munchies. With the United Nations declaring 2023 as the Year of Millets earlier this year, pearl, foxtail, amaranth, broomcorn and buckwheat are back in the news. Widely used in India and popular as bajra, kakum, rajgira, chena and kuttu, millets are not just a passing fad. Indian, Chinese and Egyptian civilisations used these cereals 6,000 years ago, and the Vedas make a mention of a tribal girl feeding Lord Muruga a meal of foxtail millet and honey. Once a staple in almost every region, the cultivation of millets went into decline in India due to a host of factors, including colonisation and changed cropping patterns. “There was a time when rice was served only during festivals and only the very rich could afford to eat it regularly,” says Mahesh Basavanna, CEO and founder of OrgTree in Mandya, Karnataka. He says, “Despite having to be hand pounded, millets were the only cultivable option for thousands of years in the rain-fed Aravallis. The government supply of rice, which was easier to cook, slowly edged out other millets, except for ragi.” Presently, Kiru by OrgTree manufactures millet-based food products such as cookies, crunchies and energy bars. In 2015, Kiru teamed up with 400 farmers for a direct supply of millets, eliminating the middlemen. “Their women work in our factories which has also resulted in an increase in the income levels of their households. Almost 80% of our raw material comes from the farmers directly and 80% of our employees are women,” he says. “As a crop, millets do not need a lot of attention and can greatly boost the village economy as they can be grown on non-arable land,” says N.S. Krishnamoorthi, founder of Prem’s Graama Bhojanam — a restaurant in Chennai  known for its millet-based and farm-fresh menu. The lockdown proved to be a blessing in disguise for Mahesh. He says, “We used to supply to corporates and SAP labs, which halted work due to COVID-19. We had to adapt and come up with a product that could be retailed and since April we have seen a marked improvement in sales.” Slurrp Farms also saw a rise in sales during the lockdown last year. “Our sales have grown three times in the past year. More people are reading labels these days, but apart from wanting to try out healthy alternatives, many were finding their way around a kitchen for the first time,” says Meghana Narayan, one of the founders of the Gurugram-based Slurrp Farm which has a range of millet-based breakfast cereals, dosa and pancake mixes as well as munchies. “When my daughter was born, my grandmother roasted six to seven different grains and ground them into a fine powder for porridge. We have a heritage of millet and porridge eating culture across India,” says Meghana. As young mothers, Shauravi Malik and Meghana were very conscious of the dietary needs of their little ones. “Suddenly it seemed all the products out there contained maida , sugar and hydrogenated fats. Having children is a game-changer and we wanted to ensure ours had the best in terms of nutrition and taste.” As best friends, the duo always wanted to get into business together. “Millets were not our immediate answer; we were looking for better, healthier alternatives. With Slurrp we were not inventing new products; we were bringing existing ones in a format that were easy for mothers to put on the table, without having to think twice about nutritional content.” Having launched in early 2017, Meghana says there has been a steady increase in sales. “Though our target audience might be children, young adults also enjoy the convenience of opening an instant pancake pack.” Mahesh believes the awareness of millets and not the products is key in helping consumers opt for a healthier lifestyle. According to Devaraddi Agasanakoppa of KNS organic farm in Gadag, Karnataka, the region of north Karnataka regularly consumed millets such as jowar, bajra and ragi. “The year-on-year growth in these places has been around 7%-9%. However, with growing awareness in cities, the demand has gone up to 12% to 15%, with some metros showing up to a 20% increase in the past decade,” he says, adding that during the pandemic the demand for millets, cold pressed oils and jaggery further shot up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/meet-the-millets/article36909161.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Hey, like me!||For nearly 10 years, I have been an avid Facebook user enthralling my 11.3 followers on a daily basis with my unique brand of wit and wisdom. Yet, I don’t seem to understand how the platform works. And it’s frustrating. Readers, please help. Locked profile friend requests How does one get to do both, lock one’s profile and seek friendships? Is that okay on social media? Because if one did it in real life, it would be the equivalent of the disembodied voice in the dark alley going ‘pssst, hey, pssssst, you, come here, I say, yes, you only in green shirt and pink pants with the funny hair’ and actually expecting you to walk up to that pitch-black corner behind the dumpster, step over that dead bandicoot, stick out your hand and say ‘Hey, human, beast or alien, I’m totally not creeped out by this at all. So glad to meet you.’ My request to all those sending me locked profile friend requests, kindly message me your business plan. Do you just want to continue lurking but as a friend? Do you desire me because I’m Telugu? Is it to ask me if Serendipitesh Devulapalli of Little Rock, Arkansas, is my cousin-sister’s co-brother? Are you hoping I’ll become your fan? Do you think I’ll immediately help have your article published in The N ew Y ork T imes ? Is it to send other folk on my friends’ list — especially the women — friend requests? Do you need me to promote your Ayurvedic upholstery business? Have you gone off your medication? Let me know so I can ready my tariff. Invite to like Isn’t liking and disliking a kind of voluntary thing? And, in real life, don’t we like people only after we get to know them and they behave in a likeable manner? So how is it that I get notifications on a daily basis from complete strangers — who’ve never once interacted with me — inviting me to like their eco-friendly cucumber jewellery business or their organic bullets for small-calibre guns enterprise? In real life, do these people tap random folks on the shoulder, and go ‘Hey, I invite you to touch me inappropriately.’ Would they be okay if the invitee RSVP-ed with a punch in their kisser? Cross-legged pose Ladies, sorry, but you’ve been totally had by a top-notch prankster. I speak of the fashion guru who’s perpetuated this myth that when you pose for pics that you want to upload, the cool, sophisticated, slimming way to do it is by crossing your legs while standing. Sorry. That just looks like the photographer stopped you as you were rushing to the loo and insisted you pose for a pic. Any time I see a pic like this, instead of seeing poised, elegant women having a cool night out, I am reminded of that scene from The Party where Peter Sellers has to go, and is thwarted at every step, and pretends he’s appreciating the music being played by the band as his bladder is about to give up. So unless that’s the look you're going for, dear ladies, perhaps best to desist. Photo with birthday boy Finally, when did this kind of a birthday greeting become a thing? How loserly is that? Years ago, when their teacher asked them what they would be when they grew up, did these serial photo wishers go ‘Teacher, teacher, when I grow up, my life’s ambition is to be that guy who regularly posts pics of himself standing with whosever’s birthday it is that day.’ Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/hey-like-me/article36908556.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||How the river runs through it||“The environment is everyone’s business,” says documentary filmmaker Shridhar Sudhir, and few would disagree. Speaking to us ahead of the second edition of the All Living Things Environmental Film Festival (ALT EFF), where his 2021 documentary, Moving Upstream: Ganga , will be screened, he says this is an event that ‘engages the public on the environment and social issues of our time’. Contrary to the Ganga’s stereotypical association with religion, often the central focus of films on the subject, his film  traces Siddharth Agarwal’s (an aerospace engineer from IIT, Kharagpur) 3,000-kilometre walk from Ganga Sagar in West Bengal to Gangotri, the source of the river. “It was not about looking at the Ganga in isolation,” says Sudhir, adding, “The exclusivity that the paradigms of religion, spirituality and mythology lend to the river makes it the perfect segue into the plights that plague all rivers. In fact, a good case is made for all other rivers when one understands how harshly the narratives of development and urbanisation treat the ‘holiest’ of them.”  Of climate change and students   OtherIndian titles at the virtual ALT EFF 2021 — set to feature 44 films from 31 countries across 10 categories — include For the Stripes , Elephants in my Backyard and Coral Woman , among others. Festival director and co-founder, Kunal Khanna, says the festival opened for submissions in March and the final programme was decided on July 31. “During these 4.5 months, our programming team watched close to 130 submissions,” he says, sharing popular themes included climate change, biodiversity, food systems, conservation and social justice. The films were selected based on their “originality, emotional impact, relevance, and production quality”, continues Khanna, whose picks for this year are American documentaries YOUTH v GOV , To Which We Belong , and Moti Bagh from India. Addressing the newly-launched ‘Student Films’ category, he says the aim was to encourage youngsters to “seek out and bring to the fore said conversations, and in turn inspire to weave these discussions into mainstream cinema through their careers in film and storytelling”. One of ALT EFF’s aims is to highlight not just stories of hope, but how humans are tackling the problem at hand with innovations. “India especially lacks opportunities for young filmmakers covering the environmental theme and we aim to fill this gap with the new section,” he says. Next year, they aim to achieve their original vision of a physical festival in the heart of the biodiverse Western Ghats, adds co-founder Neha Shrestha.  What comes after   Arefreshing addition to India’s cinematic festival landscape that usually promotes commercial films or art-oriented projects, ALT EFF is a good platform to bring about environmental consciousness. “The goal is to do more than to make pretty pictures — to drive meaningful change,” says Micheal Snyder, international award-winning photographer and filmmaker, who is on the jury this year. Looking forward to Moti Bagh , Fat Kathy , and The Last Hop(e) , he says virtual film festivals pose an amazing opportunity to reach audiences all over the world. “I am excited for what comes after the films: what people do and say next, as it is these conversations and actions that are the critical component of environmental filmmaking.” Snyder, who has directed films in the Arctic, the Amazon, and the Himalayas, believes in the power of storytelling to drive impact around environmental issues. “As they [eco-issues] are often very abstract and seemingly impersonal, we have to find a way to make them personal. Filmmaking, particularly one that focusses on the story of a character who is directly dealing with these issues, has the potential to do this in a way that few other art forms can,” he concludes.  ALT EFF is on until October 17 at alteff.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/how-the-river-runs-through-it/article36908534.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Walking tall in an ocean plastic gown||Usually, the phrase ‘sustainable chic’ isn’t used in the context of an eveningwear brand. It loosely implies ethically-sourced, organic, breathable fabrics. Designer Gaurav Gupta, however, is attempting to redefine the lexicon of sustainability at the ongoing FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week, with his Lakmé Absolute Grand Finale outing tomorrow — a drive-in, physical show. Kareena Kapoor (“a self-made artiste with a sense of humour,” according to Gupta) will be the showstopper. “With ‘#Redefine’, I am challenging how people look at sustainability, which is always viewed as either daywear or organic. I make sculpted couture evening gowns; hence, I wanted to make sustainability sexy,” he says. What inspired the designer to embrace a path of eco-conscious couture? “When I was diving in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands earlier this year, the amount of plastic I saw in the ocean and on the beaches was just shocking. It’s different when you see it digitally, and a completely moving visual when you see it in person,” he recalls.  Keep the dialogue going  Of late, several labels have been trying to go partly or fully sustainable in their practices. A few months ago, on World Oceans Day, designer duo Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja announced their sustainable swimwear range, manufactured from fabrics derived from recycled ocean waste. Internationally, luxury watch brands such as Breitling and Ulysse Nardin have put plastic ocean waste to good use as cases or straps. So, did Gupta have a sustainable model while conceptualising this line? “I am not claiming to be fully sustainable, and I don’t think any brand in the world can claim this,” he points out. “As long as there’s some point of consumerism, it isn’t sustainable. And sustainability is relative — if certain brands use it as a marketing tool, it’s their situation. But consumers today are very aware and [in the long run, such strategies] won’t take the brands anywhere. Meanwhile, the dialogue on sustainability has to go on.” Glamour with heart For Gupta, his sustainable journey started a while ago when he’d visit his factory and see plastic covering every garment. “We started working on it three to four years back. It took us some time to find the right resources [Waste2Wear] to make jacket covers from ocean and landfill plastic,” says the designer, who tries to incorporate eco-friendly practices in his everyday life, by using his electric car and saying no to plastic bags. Now, he has extended it to his garments too — with fabric from EcoKaari. For him, the 48-piece evening wear collection is a statement — with couture, demi-couture, and ready-to-wear. When quizzed about the fact that sustainability escalates price points, he says, “I do couture and demi-couture, and I use luxury fabrics [this collection also includes silver and gold lamé, sequins, jersey, and neoprene]. Here, I have literally taken plastic from the ocean or land, woven it into my fabric, and draped it as a glamorous gown. That’s a direct way — both artistic capability and thought process come into play here. Pricing has more to do with material cost and labour hours, but sustainability needn’t always be expensive. For me, it’s about finding the right resource.” #Redefine could well be the first of many sustainable lines to come from Gupta’s stable. Also, keeping in mind recent developments in Indian fashion, is he considering corporate investment? While he doesn’t mind considering it, he states that “it requires a lot of planning and strategy, and, right now, I am happy with where I am”.  Watch Gaurav Gupta’s show tomorrow at 9.30 pm.

What if we told you they come as eco-cool sling bags, fanny packs and back packs? Friday’s Sustainable Fashion Day at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week saw three-year-old Goa-based brand Bandit unveil its Shourai Collection. Shourai means ‘the future’ in Japanese, explains founder Satyajit Vetoskar, also the winner of this year’s Circular Design Challenge 3.0 (a platform to showcase innovative ideas using materials from diverse waste sources). And soon, the futuristic collection will add ponchos, messenger bags and yoga mat bags — all made with their trademark tarp. Bandit sources its tarp from ISO-9001 certified factories that export the material. “Very often what we buy is considered ‘waste’ because their clients have issues with colour or the warp. We use the colours we get, and therein lies the beauty because you will never find the same product again with us,” says the designer and architect, who holds a Masters in Industrial Design.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/wearing-a-billboard/article36908553.ece

And who doesn’t like a good revenge story, especially if the protagonist is a woman who chooses to eschew moral codes and laws for justice? The streaming platform’s latest title, My Name , promises to be an edgy, high-octane drama. It tells the story of a high school student — bullied and ostracised for being a gangster’s daughter — who later becomes the sole witness of her father’s murder. Driven to seek revenge, she puts herself in the line of fire. Helmed by Kim Jin-min — known for the critically-acclaimed Extracurricular (2020) — the eight-episode crime thriller brings together actors Han So-hee, Park Hee-soon and Ahn Bo-hyun.  So-hee’s transformation   Thepetite actor may not come across as your classic action hero at first glance, but she admits to training hard in martial arts and gaining over 10 kilos of muscle weight to headline My Name as Yoon Ji-woo. In the drama, her character gets help from her father’s close friend Mu Jin (Park Hee-soon), who also heads the biggest drug cartel. The actor reveals that Charlize Theron’s action scenes in Atomic Blonde and Old Guard inspired her, but she also looked within for references. “My character Ji-woo is a lot like me — we are driven to get to our destination once we have set a goal for ourselves.”   The Godfather effect   Meanwhile,co-star Hee-soon describes his character Mu Jin as a “very complex man”. “There are not many movies or shows I could refer to for the role of a drug lord, so I had to rely on classics such as The Godfather over and over again,” he says.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Indra Nooyi: ‘An economist, not a feminist’||In 2009, Indra Nooyi found herself caught in a funny game of tug of war. As the global business icon stood between US President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting, they both claimed her as one of their own! A daughter of Chennai who moved to the US to pursue an education and career, Nooyi, now 65, became the longest-serving — and most visible — CEO of PepsiCo, which she ran from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, she championed healthier product offerings, pushed for sustainability, including waste and water reduction, and sought greater workplace diversity. Reflections on her personal and professional journey now inform her new book, My Life in Full , a memoir-meets-manifesto for work-life inclusion. Nooyi describes it as a personal story, a business story, and a story about her hopes for the future of work. “I want to advance the care discussion, figure out how to convene the right people. [I also want] to give back as much as I can, whether it is mentoring the young generation or working with entrepreneurs,” she tells The Hindu Weekend in an interview. The book is a riveting read, and particularly engaging in the parts where she explains her career trajectory, from BCG’s Chicago office to PepsiCo. She also opens up about herself, her dreams for cricket, and why dressing right is a powerful tool. (In the book, she recalls how she bought an ill-fitting dark blue polyester outfit to “fit in”, but it backfired. A friend then advised her to wear a sari the next time because if people “won’t hire you for who you are, it’s their loss”.) Today, Nooyi serves as an independent director on the board of the International Cricket Council, the first woman to do so. She also sits on Amazon’s board, teaches at the prestigious US Military Academy at West Point, and continues to advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Edited excerpts:   What prompted you to write this memoir? When I retired after 12 years as CEO of PepsiCo, I wanted to work on issues supporting women advancing in the workplace. When I stepped down, people kept asking me, ‘Why isn’t a woman replacing you?’. They never ask a man that question! There’s a tremendous burden on women in terms of how to handle work and family pressure. My lawyer and publisher came to me and said, ‘I think people want to hear your life story... how you stayed married for 41 years, have two kids, and advanced to becoming CEO. That story gives authenticity to whatever you are going to propose’. That’s how this book came about. Other books by male business leaders hardly touch on work life balance. When is that going to change?  How about right now? We have to start the conversation by saying we are not talking about females, we are talking about family. Talking about families is an economic issue. The economy grows when everybody can be deployed to help grow the economy. I think we have to bring men to the table to talk about how, collectively, we are going to address this issue. You write that ‘women’s choice to work outside the home is integral to their well-being’. Yet the reality of many women’s lives makes it hard to manage.  There’s no question that I had a good family support structure. And when they weren’t there, I created a support structure. Many people cannot afford that. I think about the nurses, front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic — many women who had children at home. They had no predictability, no flexibility in their work hours. And we never sat down for a moment and talked about how they were going to handle childcare, eldercare? The one good thing that came out of the pandemic is that we have to think about work flexibility in a much more expansive way. How would you envision changing this lack of a support structure?  This is where I think governments, corporates, NGOs, and communities have to come together. I was looking at the anganwadi structure in India. The thought behind it is very good, but the execution needs to improve. Now, we should think not about anganwadi 2.0 but 4.0. Redesign that structure, train the people, pay them so they can work there and take kids till age five so that they could go to school after that. This could be absolutely frame-breaking for India at a point when women are doing really well in schools and colleges. Somebody once told me the biggest emerging market opportunity within the United States and within India is women. So I am approaching this an economist, not a feminist. How did you navigate the internal politics in a major organisation like PepsiCo?  The time that I came into the workforce, there were hardly any women. What I experienced, however, was a lot of support. People said, ‘Hey, if she’s made it this far there must be something good about her’. But I also sensed [the question], ‘A woman of colour, sitting in the boardroom. Who is she?’. And, along with that, came certain behaviours you could say are just not acceptable. So, I had to perform better than anybody else to be seen or noticed or respected. The most important piece of advice I would give people: understand the politics in the organisation, and stay the hell out of it. Do you think with the pandemic, the idea of care and gender roles is evolving?  I think work flexibility has to become the norm. Some mix of work at home, remote work and in the office will become common. We have to be careful not to create two classes of citizens [though] — the men who come to work and the women who work from home and, therefore, are pushed down or treated differently. You introduced mentoring [women] at PepsiCo. How do companies foster such programmes?  If we frame this as a strictly women’s issue, people go, ‘There they go again the women!’ This is not a female issue, it’s an economic issue, a family issue, a future of work issue. The future of work is about caregivers — about teachers, nurses and doctors. It’s about women coming into the workforce in large numbers. The whole care structure is not going to work without women in our systems. How are we going to support all these women? We are all social beings and we have to figure out how to create social networks outside of digital social networks. From your days at BCG, wearing saris to work, till now — where your trademark scarf and stylish short hair are admired — you describe your sartorial transformation as giving you confidence.  The workplace is a competitive place. What you want to do is take away any negative attention on the way you dress. In each country or economy, dress appropriately for that place. In my case, I was in long skirts and misshapen clothes. So, [I would] overpower the dressing issue with my competence. I was always over prepared. When you come to a workplace, it’s not a social place. Dress appropriately and let the work speak for itself. Your drive comes across throughout the book. Even as a young girl, you formed a band and started a women’s cricket team. Is that an innate personality trait?  I am wired differently. It feels like I have to do something all the time to break boundaries. The world has so much to teach you. Go out and seek that knowledge.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Nothing to hide||The elephant is out of the womb, the room, and gambols through our chat. Kalki Koechlin brought her book, her trademark vivacity and honesty to our call. Oh, and her uke too. She played us a lullaby in French. Koechlin is an actor, celebrity, award-winner, activist, writer, and a mum. Yet another celeb-turned -author?A-listers have been jumping on the book-writing bandwagon of late — Soha Ali Khan with Kunal Khemu, Karan Johar and Jugal Hansraj… Lots about tots. Why do we need another one? Burps, lack of libido and incontinence, to start with. This is a book with all the warts and bumps. Koechlin, 37, kept a diary when she was pregnant. Her musings, rants, poetry, cravings, all made it into this memoir (as personal essays and think-pieces), with Valeriya Polyanychko’s wacky illustrations focussing on the many versions of Koechlin’s baby bump, protesting vaginas and raging breasts.  The Elephant in the Womb is not medical guidance or prescription, says the actor, on a video call for The Hindu Weekend . She calls it the ‘giant experience’ of motherhood. “I wanted everyone to know about the hard parts… and that we’re not alone.” So read this if, like me, you’re frustrated with balancing the ‘mother-instinct-myth’ on that wobbly high pedestal to which we guiltily cling. Read it because there’s a star who lets us in behind the makeup. She gets real and raw: the beached-whale body, the post-partum slump, the perineal tear, the ‘awe of this new soul’ as well as “the other side... you want your life back”.  Hard truths   Atthe risk of irking the fandom, here’s a disclaimer. This book is written from a place of privilege: Koechlin’s words. Don’t expect to have the same experience, don’t even expect to agree with it all. It brings these elephants marching out of the room: the taboos, the forbidden topics, the hush-hush not-polite-conversation. “Most young women in their 20s I know have had an abortion and not talked about it. I understand privacy, but I think you need the support around. When you have a surgery on your knee, you call your family to come and pick you up. When you have an abortion, you come home alone. And that’s tragic,” says Koechlin. Both our chat and the book are about what she advocates widely: choice. Personal freedom. That the woman decides what birth she has — “Shouldn’t she be the one making the decision when she’s risking her life to do it?” — and about how she raises her child. The actor says she chose to follow her mother in the natural birthing process (her maman had three home births), but not in discipline. “I’m trying to sift the good and the bad. My parents were from a generation where it was fine to slap a child. Guy [Hershberg] and I are trying to find other ways to give Sappho [her 20-month-old daughter] discipline. We believe violence leads to violence,” she says. Hershberg, her partner, an Israeli classical musician, has his own hilarious chapter in the book, involving monkeys and dragons — but it’s very much about how different a father’s perspective on parenting is. Or is it?  Why sideline parenting?   Finally,acutely aware of not disappointing her multitude of fans, we steered the conversation around to Bollywood. She’s busy shooting again; I asked her about her identity, how she saw herself, and how the film fraternity now sees her. She wishes there were more support. “As a community, if we did talk about our problems with our work people, we’d probably be more productive in the long run,” she says. “Society sees parenting as something done on the side, while actually it’s the centre of humanity, it’s the future generation, the continuation of the species — and it’s sidelined.” As cinema turns to more feminist themes on screen, what about reality? Is someone out there listening? “One day, Sappho can look at this book and know what I went through.” And Koechlin, how your “little flea, wiggly worm, yellow thing” little elephant will trumpet that day.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Nothing to hide||The elephant is out of the womb, the room, and gambolled through our chat. Kalki Koechlin brought her book, her trademark vivacity and honesty to our call. Oh, and her uke too. She played us a lullaby in French. Koechlin is an actor, celebrity, award-winner, activist, writer (Wiki does a better job of this), and a mum. Yet another celeb-turned -author?A-listers have been jumping on the book-writing bandwagon of late — Soha Ali Khan with Kunal Khemu, Karan Johar and Jugal Hansraj… Lots about tots. Why do we need another one? Burps, lack of libido and incontinence, to start with. This is a book with all the warts and bumps. Koechlin, 37, kept a diary when she was pregnant. Her musings, rants, poetry, cravings, all made it into this memoir (as personal essays and think-pieces), with Valeriya Polyanychko’s brilliant, wacky illustrations focussing on the many versions of Koechlin’s baby bump and other lumps, protesting vaginas and raging breasts.  The Elephant in the Womb is not medical guidance or prescription, says the actor, on a video call for The Hindu Weekend . She calls it the ‘giant experience’ of motherhood. “I wanted everyone to know about the hard parts… and that we’re not alone.” So read this if, like me, you’re frustrated with balancing the ‘mother-instinct-myth’ on that wobbly high pedestal to which we guiltily cling. Read it because there’s a star who lets us in behind the makeup. She gets real and raw: the beached-whale body, the post-partum slump, the perineal tear, the ‘awe of this new soul’ as well as “the other side... you want your life back”.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Hey, like me!||For nearly 10 years, I have been an avid Facebook user enthralling my 11.3 followers on a daily basis with my unique brand of wit and wisdom. Yet, I don’t seem to understand how the platform works. And it’s frustrating. Readers, please help. Locked profile friend requests How does one get to do both, lock one’s profile and seek friendships? Is that okay on social media? Because if one did it in real life, it would be the equivalent of the disembodied voice in the dark alley going ‘pssst, hey, pssssst, you, come here, I say, yes, you only in green shirt and pink pants with the funny hair’ and actually expecting you to walk up to that pitch-black corner behind the dumpster, step over that dead bandicoot, stick out your hand and say ‘Hey, human, beast or alien, I’m totally not creeped out by this at all. So glad to meet you.’ My request to all those sending me locked profile friend requests, kindly message me your business plan. Do you just want to continue lurking but as a friend? Do you desire me because I’m Telugu? Is it to ask me if Serendipitesh Devulapalli of Little Rock, Arkansas, is my cousin-sister’s co-brother? Are you hoping I’ll become your fan? Do you think I’ll immediately help have your article published in The N ew Y ork T imes ? Is it to send other folk on my friends’ list — especially the women — friend requests? Do you need me to promote your Ayurvedic upholstery business? Have you gone off your medication? Let me know so I can ready my tariff. Invite to like Isn’t liking and disliking a kind of voluntary thing? And, in real life, don’t we like people only after we get to know them and they behave in a likeable manner? So how is it that I get notifications on a daily basis from complete strangers — who’ve never once interacted with me — inviting me to like their eco-friendly cucumber jewellery business or their organic bullets for small-calibre guns enterprise? In real life, do these people tap random folks on the shoulder, and go ‘Hey, I invite you to touch me inappropriately.’ Would they be okay if the invitee RSVP-ed with a punch in their kisser? Cross-legged pose Ladies, sorry, but you’ve been totally had by a top-notch prankster. I speak of the fashion guru who’s perpetuated this myth that when you pose for pics that you want to upload, the cool, sophisticated, slimming way to do it is by crossing your legs while standing. Sorry. That just looks like the photographer stopped you as you were rushing to the loo and insisted you pose for a pic. Any time I see a pic like this, instead of seeing poised, elegant women having a cool night out, I am reminded of that scene from The Party where Peter Sellers has to go, and is thwarted at every step, and pretends he’s appreciating the music being played by the band as his bladder is about to give up. So unless that’s the look you're going for, dear ladies, perhaps best to desist. Photo with birthday boy Finally, when did this kind of a birthday greeting become a thing? How loserly is that? Years ago, when their teacher asked them what they would be when they grew up, did these serial photo wishers go ‘Teacher, teacher, when I grow up, my life’s ambition is to be that guy who regularly posts pics of himself standing with whosever’s birthday it is that day.’ Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/hey-like-me/article36908607.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||How the river runs through it||“The environment is everyone’s business,” says documentary filmmaker Shridhar Sudhir, and few would disagree. Speaking to us ahead of the second edition of the All Living Things Environmental Film Festival (ALT EFF), where his 2021 documentary, Moving Upstream: Ganga , will be screened, he says this is an event that ‘engages the public on the environment and social issues of our time’. Contrary to the Ganga’s stereotypical association with religion, often the central focus of films on the subject, his film  traces Siddharth Agarwal’s (an aerospace engineer from IIT, Kharagpur) 3,000-kilometre walk from Ganga Sagar in West Bengal to Gangotri, the source of the river. “It was not about looking at the Ganga in isolation,” says Sudhir, adding, “The exclusivity that the paradigms of religion, spirituality and mythology lend to the river makes it the perfect segue into the plights that plague all rivers. In fact, a good case is made for all other rivers when one understands how harshly the narratives of development and urbanisation treat the ‘holiest’ of them.”  Of climate change and students   OtherIndian titles at the virtual ALT EFF 2021 — set to feature 44 films from 31 countries across 10 categories — include For the Stripes , Elephants in my Backyard and Coral Woman , among others. Festival director and co-founder, Kunal Khanna, says the festival opened for submissions in March and the final programme was decided on July 31. “During these 4.5 months, our programming team watched close to 130 submissions,” he says, sharing popular themes included climate change, biodiversity, food systems, conservation and social justice.  Addressing the newly-launched ‘Student Films’ category, he says the aim was to encourage youngsters to “seek out and bring to the fore said conversations, and in turn inspire to weave these discussions into mainstream cinema through their careers in film and storytelling”. One of ALT EFF’s aims is to highlight not just stories of hope, but how humans are tackling the problem at hand with innovations. “India especially lacks opportunities for young filmmakers covering the environmental theme and we aim to fill this gap with the new section,” he says. Next year, they aim to achieve their original vision of a physical festival in the heart of the biodiverse Western Ghats, adds co-founder Neha Shrestha.  What comes after   Arefreshing addition to India’s cinematic festival landscape that usually promotes commercial films or art-oriented projects, ALT EFF is a good platform to bring about environmental consciousness. “The goal is to do more than to make pretty pictures — to drive meaningful change,” says Micheal Snyder, international award-winning photographer and filmmaker, who is on the jury this year. Looking forward to Moti Bagh , Fat Kathy , and The Last Hop(e) , he says virtual film festivals pose an amazing opportunity to reach audiences all over the world. “I am excited for what comes after the films: what people do and say next, as it is these conversations and actions that are the critical component of environmental filmmaking,” concludes Snyder, who has directed films in the Arctic, the Amazon, and the Himalayas.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Walking tall in an ocean plastic gown||Usually, the phrase ‘sustainable chic’ isn’t used in the context of an eveningwear brand. It loosely implies ethically-sourced, organic, breathable fabrics. Designer Gaurav Gupta, however, is attempting to redefine the lexicon of sustainability at the ongoing FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week, with his Lakmé Absolute Grand Finale outing tomorrow — a drive-in, physical show. Kareena Kapoor (“a self-made artiste with a sense of humour,” according to Gupta) will be the showstopper. “With ‘#Redefine’, I am challenging how people look at sustainability, which is always viewed as either daywear or organic. I make sculpted couture evening gowns; hence, I wanted to make sustainability sexy,” he says. What inspired the designer to embrace a path of eco-conscious couture? “When I was diving in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands earlier this year, the amount of plastic I saw in the ocean and on the beaches was just shocking. It’s different when you see it digitally, and a completely moving visual when you see it in person,” he recalls.  Keep the dialogue going  Of late, several labels have been trying to go partly or fully sustainable in their practices. A few months ago, on World Oceans Day, designer duo Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja announced their sustainable swimwear range, manufactured from fabrics derived from recycled ocean waste. Internationally, luxury watch brands such as Breitling and Ulysse Nardin have put plastic ocean waste to good use as cases or straps. So, did Gupta have a sustainable model while conceptualising this line? “I am not claiming to be fully sustainable, and I don’t think any brand in the world can claim this,” he points out. “As long as there’s some point of consumerism, it isn’t sustainable. And sustainability is relative — if certain brands use it as a marketing tool, it’s their situation. But consumers today are very aware and [in the long run, such strategies] won’t take the brands anywhere. Meanwhile, the dialogue on sustainability has to go on.” Glamour with heart For Gupta, his sustainable journey started a while ago when he’d visit his factory and see plastic covering every garment. “We started working on it three to four years back. It took us some time to find the right resources [Waste2Wear] to make jacket covers from ocean and landfill plastic,” says the designer, who tries to incorporate eco-friendly practices in his everyday life, by using his electric car and saying no to plastic bags. Now, he has extended it to his garments too — with fabric from EcoKaari. For him, the 48-piece evening wear collection is a statement — with couture, demi-couture, and ready-to-wear. When quizzed about the fact that sustainability escalates price points, he says, “I do couture and demi-couture, and I use luxury fabrics [this collection also includes silver and gold lamé, sequins, jersey, and neoprene]. Here, I have literally taken plastic from the ocean or land, woven it into my fabric, and draped it as a glamorous gown. That’s a direct way — both artistic capability and thought process come into play here. Pricing has more to do with material cost and labour hours, but sustainability needn’t always be expensive. For me, it’s about finding the right resource.” #Redefine could well be the first of many sustainable lines to come from Gupta’s stable. Also, keeping in mind recent developments in Indian fashion, is he considering corporate investment? While he doesn’t mind considering it, he states that “it requires a lot of planning and strategy, and, right now, I am happy with where I am”.  Watch Gaurav Gupta’s show tomorrow at 9.30 pm.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||K-drama’s new avenger||As Netflix’s bloody survival series, Squid Game ,  continues to break viewing records across the world, it is apparent that OTT viewers are developing an insatiable appetite for the crime and thriller genre. And who doesn’t like a good revenge story, especially if the protagonist is a woman who chooses to eschew moral codes and laws for justice? The streaming platform’s latest title, My Name , promises to be an edgy, high-octane drama. It tells the story of a high school student — bullied and ostracised for being a gangster’s daughter — who later becomes the sole witness of her father’s murder. Driven to seek revenge, she puts herself in the line of fire. Helmed by Kim Jin-min — known for taut thrillers such as Time Between Dog and Wolf , and the critically-acclaimed Extracurricular (2020) — the eight-episode crime thriller brings together actors Han So-hee, Park Hee-soon and Ahn Bo-hyun. Describing the series as “an intriguing revenge story”, the director says, “Though vengeance is a widely used theme, dominated mainly by men, I thought watching a female character on her journey to avenge her father’s death will be thrilling”.  So-hee’s transformation   Thepetite actor may not come across as your classic action hero at first glance, but she admits to training hard in martial arts and gaining over 10 kilos of muscle weight to headline My Name as Yoon Ji-woo. In the drama, her character gets help from her father’s close friend Mu Jin (Park Hee-soon), who also heads the biggest drug cartel. The actor reveals that Charlize Theron’s action scenes in Atomic Blonde and Old Guard inspired her, but she also looked within for references. “My character Ji-woo is a lot like me — we are driven to get to our destination once we have set a goal for ourselves.”          The Godfather effect   Meanwhile,co-star Hee-soon describes his character Mu Jin as a “very complex man”. He says it was tough to play such a role on-screen. “There are not many movies or shows I could refer to for the role of a drug lord, so I had to rely on classics such as The Godfather over and over again,” he says. Incidentally, it was the idea of working withdirector Jin-min that drew the third actor in our interview, Ahn Bo-hyun ( Itaewon Class ), to this project. Playing the brusque detective Pildo investigating drug cartels, Bo-hyun says he had to work on looking the part physically. “He upholds his values and ethics, and I tried to find similarities between the character and myself to make him as real as possible.” My Name will stream on Netflix from October 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/k-dramas-new-avenger/article36908629.ece

What if we told you they come as eco-cool sling bags, fanny packs and back packs? Friday’s Sustainable Fashion Day at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week saw three-year-old Goa-based brand Bandit unveil its Shourai Collection. Shourai means ‘the future’ in Japanese, explains founder Satyajit Vetoskar, also the winner of this year’s Circular Design Challenge 3.0 (a platform to showcase innovative ideas using materials from diverse waste sources). And soon, the futuristic collection will add ponchos, messenger bags and yoga mat bags — all made with their trademark tarp. Bandit sources its tarp from ISO-9001 certified factories that export the material. “Very often what we buy is considered ‘waste’ because their clients have issues with colour or the warp. We use the colours we get, and therein lies the beauty because you will never find the same product again with us,” says the designer and architect, who holds a Masters in Industrial Design.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/wearing-a-billboard/article36908606.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Fashion’s wild side||Six years after transitioning to a vegan lifestyle, entrepreneur Kunal Avanti launched I Am Animal, a PETA-approved apparel brand, to commemorate World Animal Day, October 4. Avanti’s first collection for the athleisure label comprises T-shirts, joggers and hoodies crafted in Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified fabrics. Designed in collaboration with Mumbai-based design school, Istituto Marangoni, it features earthy shades. “One of them, the savanna burn, draws inspiration from the darvaza crater that's been burning for decades in the Turkmenistan desert. The idea was to create a burnt orange shade to reflect the fury of nature,” he says. As for the brand’s sustainability features, he says the elastic in the joggers is made of natural latex, they use seed paper tags, and a part of their sale proceeds go to 4-5 sanctuaries across India, like the Kalote Animal Trust in Maharashtra.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Catch the rainbow||From jewelled timepieces worn as pendants or brooches (let’s not forget the miniature minute repeaters from the 1890s) to the Royal Oak Concept Flying Tourbillon in 2018, Audemars Piguet has given women due attention. So this tidy collection of six new Royal Oak Concept Flying Tourbillon models shouldn’t come as a surprise. The flying tourbillon addresses the effect of gravity and ensures accuracy, but this time the brand brings in haute joaillerie as well. Brilliant- or baguette-cut gemstones are to be expected — four models make the most of graded blue sapphires, while two of them check the rainbow box that most luxury (and fashion) watch manufactures seem to favour these days. The latter, with around 3.5 carats of gems, include rubies, tsavorites, emeralds, topaz, tanzanites and amethysts. The invisible gem setting for each of the two timepieces with 208 baguette-cut graded blue sapphires amounted to 150 hours! The open-worked barrel of hand-wound Calibre 2951, visible at 11 o’clock, directs attention to the watch’s power source. The flying tourbillon makes its rotation at 6 o’clock and is also set with brilliant-cut gemstones. At a gender-fluid 38.5 mm, it hugs the wrist, and the 18 carat white gold case (there is a pink gold option too) can take this complicated timepiece through any event, day or night. Water-resistant to 20 m with case thickness of 11.6 mm. More details will follow an in-person check of the timepieces.  Pricing from approximately CHF 211,700 to CHF 440,100. This collection can be requested at Audemars Piguet boutiques. Two of the watches, in white and pink gold, and covered in baguette-cut blue sapphires, will be available only in 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/catch-the-rainbow/article36908602.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Indra Nooyi: ‘An economist, not a feminist’||In 2009, Indra Nooyi found herself caught in a funny game of tug of war. As the global business icon stood between US President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting, they both claimed her as one of their own! A daughter of Chennai who moved to the US to pursue an education and career, Nooyi, now 65, became the longest-serving — and most visible — CEO of PepsiCo, which she ran from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, she championed healthier product offerings, pushed for sustainability, including waste and water reduction, and sought greater workplace diversity. Reflections on her personal and professional journey now inform her new book, My Life in Full , a memoir-meets-manifesto for work-life inclusion. Nooyi describes it as a personal story, a business story, and a story about her hopes for the future of work. “I want to advance the care discussion, figure out how to convene the right people. [I also want] to give back as much as I can, whether it is mentoring the young generation or working with entrepreneurs,” she tells The Hindu Weekend in an interview. The book is a riveting read, and particularly engaging in the parts where she explains her career trajectory, from BCG’s Chicago office to PepsiCo. She also opens up about herself, her dreams for cricket, and why dressing right is a powerful tool. (In the book, she recalls how she bought an ill-fitting dark blue polyester outfit to “fit in”, but it backfired. A friend then advised her to wear a sari the next time because if people “won’t hire you for who you are, it’s their loss”.) Today, Nooyi serves as an independent director on the board of the International Cricket Council, the first woman to do so. She also sits on Amazon’s board, teaches at the prestigious US Military Academy at West Point, and continues to advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  Edited excerpts:  What prompted you to write this memoir? When I retired after 12 years as CEO of PepsiCo, I wanted to work on issues supporting women advancing in the workplace. When I stepped down, people kept asking me, ‘Why isn’t a woman replacing you?’. They never ask a man that question! There’s a tremendous burden on women in terms of how to handle work and family pressure. My lawyer and publisher came to me and said, ‘I think people want to hear your life story... how you stayed married for 41 years, have two kids, and advanced to becoming CEO. That story gives authenticity to whatever you are going to propose’. That’s how this book came about. Other books by male business leaders hardly touch on work life balance. When is that going to change?  How about right now? We have to start the conversation by saying we are not talking about females, we are talking about family. Talking about families is an economic issue. The economy grows when everybody can be deployed to help grow the economy. I think we have to bring men to the table to talk about how, collectively, we are going to address this issue. You write that ‘women’s choice to work outside the home is integral to their well-being’. Yet the reality of so many women’s lives makes it hard to manage both.  There’s no question that I had a good family support structure. And when they weren’t there, I created a support structure. Many people cannot afford that. I think about the nurses, front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic — many women who had children at home. They had no predictability, no flexibility in their work hours. And we never sat down for a moment and talked about how they were going to handle childcare, eldercare? The one good thing that came out of the pandemic is that we have to think about work flexibility in a much more expansive way. How would you envision changing this lack of a support structure?  This is where I think governments, corporates, NGOs, and communities have to come together. I was looking at the anganwadi structure in India. The thought behind it is very good, but the execution needs to improve. Now, we should think not about anganwadi 2.0 but 4.0. Redesign that structure, train the people, pay them so they can work there and take kids till age five so that they could go to school after that. This could be absolutely frame-breaking for India at a point when women are doing really well in schools and colleges. Somebody once told me the biggest emerging market opportunity within the United States and within India is women. So I am approaching this an economist, not a feminist. How did you navigate the internal politics in a major organisation like PepsiCo?  The time that I came into the workforce, there were hardly any women. What I experienced, however, was a lot of support. People said, ‘Hey, if she’s made it this far there must be something good about her’. But I also sensed [the question], ‘A woman of colour, sitting in the boardroom. Who is she?’. And, along with that, came certain behaviours you could say are just not acceptable. So, I had to perform better than anybody else to be seen or noticed or respected. The most important piece of advice I would give people: understand the politics in the organisation. Stay the hell out of it. The minute you start to play the politics, it’s a slippery slope. Don’t do that. The incident of you returning home to share the news of becoming president of PepsiCo, only to have your mother ask you to go fetch milk went viral. As you write, ‘women have to leave their crowns in the garage’ — how do we challenge these notions?  I think we have to talk about both [men and women] leaving their crowns in the garage. In the home, we are all members of a family, members of a co-operative trying to create harmony, bringing up the next generation, taking care of the elderly. When we give birth to a girl child, we never start by saying, ‘Oh my god, I’ve given birth to a life-long unpaid labourer’. We say we give birth to this beautiful child. We want her to dream, to soar. Instead what do we do? We relegate many women to life-long unpaid labour. Do you think with the pandemic, the idea of care and gender roles is evolving?  I think work flexibility has to become the norm. Some mix of work at home, remote work and in the office will become common. We have to be careful not to create two classes of citizens [though] — the men who come to work and the women who work from home and, therefore, are pushed down or treated differently. You introduced mentoring [women] at PepsiCo. How do companies foster such programmes?  If we frame this as a strictly women’s issue, people go, ‘There they go again the women!’ This is not a female issue, it’s an economic issue, a family issue, a future of work issue. The future of work is about caregivers — about teachers, nurses and doctors. It’s about women coming into the workforce in large numbers. The whole care structure is not going to work without women in our systems. How are we going to support all these women? We are all social beings and we have to figure out how to create social networks outside of digital social networks. From your earliest days at BCG, wearing saris to work, till now — where your trademark scarf and stylish short hair are admired — you describe your sartorial transformation as giving you confidence.  The workplace is a competitive place. What you want to do is take away any negative attention on the way you dress. And that goes to dressing inappropriately or so badly that you draw derision. In each country or economy, dress appropriately for that place. In my case, I was in long skirts and misshapen clothes. I look back at some of my pictures and think ‘Oh my God’. Every time I would look around, I would feel inappropriately dressed for that group. So, [I would] overpower the dressing issue with my competence. I was always over prepared. When you come to a workplace, it’s not a social place. Dress appropriately and let the work speak for itself. Your drive comes across throughout the book. Even as a young girl, you formed a band and started a women’s cricket team. Is that an innate personality trait?  I am wired differently. It feels like I have to do something all the time to break boundaries. The world has so much to teach you. Go out and seek that knowledge.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Nothing to hide||The elephant is out of the womb, the room, and gambolled through our chat. Kalki Koechlin brought her book, her trademark vivacity and honesty to our call. Oh, and her uke too. She played us a lullaby in French. Koechlin is an actor, celebrity, award-winner, activist, writer (Wiki does a better job of this), and a mum. Yet another celeb-turned -author?A-listers have been jumping on the book-writing bandwagon of late — Soha Ali Khan with Kunal Khemu, Karan Johar and Jugal Hansraj… Lots about tots. Why do we need another one? Burps, lack of libido and incontinence, to start with. This is a book with all the warts and bumps. Koechlin, 37, kept a diary when she was pregnant. Her musings, rants, poetry, cravings, all made it into this memoir (as personal essays and think-pieces), with Valeriya Polyanychko’s brilliant, wacky illustrations focussing on the many versions of Koechlin’s baby bump and other lumps, protesting vaginas and raging breasts.  The Elephant in the Womb is not medical guidance or prescription, says the actor, on a video call for The Hindu Weekend . She calls it the ‘giant experience’ of motherhood. “I wanted everyone to know about the hard parts… and that we’re not alone.” So read this if, like me, you’re frustrated with balancing the ‘mother-instinct-myth’ on that wobbly high pedestal to which we guiltily cling. Read it because there’s a star who lets us in behind the makeup. She gets real and raw: the beached-whale body, the post-partum slump, the perineal tear, the ‘awe of this new soul’ as well as “the other side... you want your life back”.  Hard truths   Atthe risk of irking the fandom, here’s a disclaimer. This book is written from a place of privilege: Koechlin’s words. Don’t expect to have the same experience, don’t even expect to agree with it all. It brings these elephants marching out of the room: the taboos, the forbidden topics, the hush-hush not-polite-conversation. “Most young women in their 20s I know have had an abortion and not talked about it. I understand privacy, but I think you need the support around. When you have a surgery on your knee, you call your family to come and pick you up. When you have an abortion, you come home alone. And that’s tragic,” says Koechlin. Both our chat and the book are about what she advocates widely: choice. Personal freedom. That the woman decides what birth she has — “Shouldn’t she be the one making the decision when she’s risking her life to do it?” — and about how she raises her child. The actor says she chose to follow her mother in the natural birthing process (her maman had three home births), but not in discipline. “I’m trying to sift the good and the bad. My parents were from a generation where it was fine to slap a child. Guy [Hershberg] and I are trying to find other ways to give Sappho [her 20-month-old daughter] discipline. We believe violence leads to violence,” she says. Hershberg, her partner, an Israeli classical musician, has his own hilarious chapter in the book, involving monkeys and dragons — but it’s very much about how different a father’s perspective on parenting is. Or is it?  Why sideline parenting?   Finally,acutely aware of not disappointing her multitude of fans, we steered the conversation around to Bollywood. She’s busy shooting again; I asked her about her identity, how she saw herself, and how the film fraternity now sees her. She wishes there were more support. “As a community, if we did talk about our problems with our work people, we’d probably be more productive in the long run,” she says. “Society sees parenting as something done on the side, while actually it’s the centre of humanity, it’s the future generation, the continuation of the species — and it’s sidelined.” As cinema turns to more feminist themes on screen, what about reality? Is someone out there listening? “One day, Sappho can look at this book and know what I went through.” And Koechlin, how your “little flea, wiggly worm, yellow thing” little elephant will trumpet that day.     Published by Penguin Random House India,   the book is priced at Rs. 399 and is available on   leading e-commerce sites and book stores.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Hey, like me!||For nearly 10 years, I have been an avid Facebook user enthralling my 11.3 followers on a daily basis with my unique brand of wit and wisdom. Yet, I don’t seem to understand how the platform works. And it’s frustrating. Readers, please help. Locked profile friend requests How does one get to do both, lock one’s profile and seek friendships? Is that okay on social media? Because if one did it in real life, it would be the equivalent of the disembodied voice in the dark alley going ‘pssst, hey, pssssst, you, come here, I say, yes, you only in green shirt and pink pants with the funny hair’ and actually expecting you to walk up to that pitch-black corner behind the dumpster, step over that dead bandicoot, stick out your hand and say ‘Hey, human, beast or alien, I’m totally not creeped out by this at all. So glad to meet you.’ My request to all those sending me locked profile friend requests, kindly message me your business plan. Do you just want to continue lurking but as a friend? Do you desire me because I’m Telugu? Is it to ask me if Serendipitesh Devulapalli of Little Rock, Arkansas, is my cousin-sister’s co-brother? Are you hoping I’ll become your fan? Do you think I’ll immediately help have your article published in The N ew Y ork T imes ? Is it to send other folk on my friends’ list — especially the women — friend requests? Do you need me to promote your Ayurvedic upholstery business? Have you gone off your medication? Let me know so I can ready my tariff. Invite to like Isn’t liking and disliking a kind of voluntary thing? And, in real life, don’t we like people only after we get to know them and they behave in a likeable manner? So how is it that I get notifications on a daily basis from complete strangers — who’ve never once interacted with me — inviting me to like their eco-friendly cucumber jewellery business or their organic bullets for small-calibre guns enterprise? In real life, do these people tap random folks on the shoulder, and go ‘Hey, I invite you to touch me inappropriately.’ Would they be okay if the invitee RSVP-ed with a punch in their kisser? Cross-legged pose Ladies, sorry, but you’ve been totally had by a top-notch prankster. I speak of the fashion guru who’s perpetuated this myth that when you pose for pics that you want to upload, the cool, sophisticated, slimming way to do it is by crossing your legs while standing. Sorry. That just looks like the photographer stopped you as you were rushing to the loo and insisted you pose for a pic. Any time I see a pic like this, instead of seeing poised, elegant women having a cool night out, I am reminded of that scene from The Party where Peter Sellers has to go, and is thwarted at every step, and pretends he’s appreciating the music being played by the band as his bladder is about to give up. So unless that’s the look you're going for, dear ladies, perhaps best to desist. Photo with birthday boy Finally, when did this kind of a birthday greeting become a thing? How loserly is that? Years ago, when their teacher asked them what they would be when they grew up, did these serial photo wishers go ‘Teacher, teacher, when I grow up, my life’s ambition is to be that guy who regularly posts pics of himself standing with whosever’s birthday it is that day.’ Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/hey-like-me/article36908664.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||How the river runs through it||“The environment is everyone’s business,” says documentary filmmaker Shridhar Sudhir, and few would disagree. Speaking to us ahead of the second edition of the All Living Things Environmental Film Festival (ALT EFF), where his 2021 documentary, Moving Upstream: Ganga , will be screened, he says this is an event that ‘engages the public on the environment and social issues of our time’. Contrary to the Ganga’s stereotypical association with religion, often the central focus of films on the subject, his film  traces Siddharth Agarwal’s (an aerospace engineer from IIT, Kharagpur) 3,000-kilometre walk from Ganga Sagar in West Bengal to Gangotri, the source of the river. “It was not about looking at the Ganga in isolation,” says Sudhir, adding, “The exclusivity that the paradigms of religion, spirituality and mythology lend to the river makes it the perfect segue into the plights that plague all rivers. In fact, a good case is made for all other rivers when one understands how harshly the narratives of development and urbanisation treat the ‘holiest’ of them.”  Of climate change and students   OtherIndian titles at the virtual ALT EFF 2021 — set to feature 44 films from 31 countries across 10 categories — include For the Stripes , Elephants in my Backyard and Coral Woman , among others. Festival director and co-founder, Kunal Khanna, says the festival opened for submissions in March and the final programme was decided on July 31. “During these 4.5 months, our programming team watched close to 130 submissions,” he says, sharing popular themes included climate change, biodiversity, food systems, conservation and social justice. The films were selected based on their “originality, emotional impact, relevance, and production quality”, continues Khanna, whose picks for this year are American documentaries YOUTH v GOV , To Which We Belong , and Moti Bagh from India. Addressing the newly-launched ‘Student Films’ category, he says the aim was to encourage youngsters to “seek out and bring to the fore said conversations, and in turn inspire to weave these discussions into mainstream cinema through their careers in film and storytelling”. One of ALT EFF’s aims is to highlight not just stories of hope, but how humans are tackling the problem at hand with innovations. “India especially lacks opportunities for young filmmakers covering the environmental theme and we aim to fill this gap with the new section,” he says. Next year, they aim to achieve their original vision of a physical festival in the heart of the biodiverse Western Ghats, adds co-founder Neha Shrestha.  What comes after   Arefreshing addition to India’s cinematic festival landscape that usually promotes commercial films or art-oriented projects, ALT EFF is a good platform to bring about environmental consciousness. “The goal is to do more than to make pretty pictures — to drive meaningful change,” says Micheal Snyder, international award-winning photographer and filmmaker, who is on the jury this year. Looking forward to Moti Bagh , Fat Kathy , and The Last Hop(e) , he says virtual film festivals pose an amazing opportunity to reach audiences all over the world. “I am excited for what comes after the films: what people do and say next, as it is these conversations and actions that are the critical component of environmental filmmaking.” Snyder, who has directed films in the Arctic, the Amazon, and the Himalayas, believes in the power of storytelling to drive impact around environmental issues. “As they [eco-issues] are often very abstract and seemingly impersonal, we have to find a way to make them personal. Filmmaking, particularly one that focusses on the story of a character who is directly dealing with these issues, has the potential to do this in a way that few other art forms can,” he concludes.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Walking tall in an ocean plastic gown||Usually, the phrase ‘sustainable chic’ isn’t used in the context of an eveningwear brand. It loosely implies ethically-sourced, organic, breathable fabrics. Designer Gaurav Gupta, however, is attempting to redefine the lexicon of sustainability at the ongoing FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week, with his Lakmé Absolute Grand Finale outing tomorrow — a drive-in, physical show. Kareena Kapoor (“a self-made artiste with a sense of humour,” according to Gupta) will be the showstopper. “With ‘#Redefine’, I am challenging how people look at sustainability, which is always viewed as either daywear or organic. I make sculpted couture evening gowns; hence, I wanted to make sustainability sexy,” he says. What inspired the designer to embrace a path of eco-conscious couture? “When I was diving in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands earlier this year, the amount of plastic I saw in the ocean and on the beaches was just shocking. It’s different when you see it digitally, and a completely moving visual when you see it in person,” he recalls.  Keep the dialogue going  Of late, several labels have been trying to go partly or fully sustainable in their practices. A few months ago, on World Oceans Day, designer duo Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja announced their sustainable swimwear range, manufactured from fabrics derived from recycled ocean waste. Internationally, luxury watch brands such as Breitling and Ulysse Nardin have put plastic ocean waste to good use as cases or straps. So, did Gupta have a sustainable model while conceptualising this line? “I am not claiming to be fully sustainable, and I don’t think any brand in the world can claim this,” he points out. “As long as there’s some point of consumerism, it isn’t sustainable. And sustainability is relative — if certain brands use it as a marketing tool, it’s their situation. But consumers today are very aware and [in the long run, such strategies] won’t take the brands anywhere. Meanwhile, the dialogue on sustainability has to go on.” Glamour with heart For Gupta, his sustainable journey started a while ago when he’d visit his factory and see plastic covering every garment. “We started working on it three to four years back. It took us some time to find the right resources [Waste2Wear] to make jacket covers from ocean and landfill plastic,” says the designer, who tries to incorporate eco-friendly practices in his everyday life, by using his electric car and saying no to plastic bags. Now, he has extended it to his garments too — with fabric from EcoKaari. For him, the 48-piece evening wear collection is a statement — with couture, demi-couture, and ready-to-wear. When quizzed about the fact that sustainability escalates price points, he says, “I do couture and demi-couture, and I use luxury fabrics [this collection also includes silver and gold lamé, sequins, jersey, and neoprene]. Here, I have literally taken plastic from the ocean or land, woven it into my fabric, and draped it as a glamorous gown. That’s a direct way — both artistic capability and thought process come into play here. Pricing has more to do with material cost and labour hours, but sustainability needn’t always be expensive. For me, it’s about finding the right resource.” #Redefine could well be the first of many sustainable lines to come from Gupta’s stable. Also, keeping in mind recent developments in Indian fashion, is he considering corporate investment? While he doesn’t mind considering it, he states that “it requires a lot of planning and strategy, and, right now, I am happy with where I am”.  Watch Gaurav Gupta’s show tomorrow at 9.30 pm.

What if we told you they come as eco-cool sling bags, fanny packs and back packs? Friday’s Sustainable Fashion Day at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week saw three-year-old Goa-based brand Bandit unveil its Shourai Collection. Shourai means ‘the future’ in Japanese, explains founder Satyajit Vetoskar, also the winner of this year’s Circular Design Challenge 3.0 (a platform to showcase innovative ideas using materials from diverse waste sources). And soon, the futuristic collection will add ponchos, messenger bags and yoga mat bags — all made with their trademark tarp. Bandit sources its tarp from ISO-9001 certified factories that export the material. “Very often what we buy is considered ‘waste’ because their clients have issues with colour or the warp. We use the colours we get, and therein lies the beauty because you will never find the same product again with us,” says the designer and architect, who holds a Masters in Industrial Design.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/wearing-a-billboard/article36908663.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Indra Nooyi: ‘An economist, not a feminist’||In 2009, Indra Nooyi found herself caught in a funny game of tug of war. As the global business icon stood between US President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting, they both claimed her as one of their own! A daughter of Chennai who moved to the US to pursue an education and career, Nooyi, now 65, became the longest-serving — and most visible — CEO of PepsiCo, which she ran from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, she championed healthier product offerings, pushed for sustainability, including waste and water reduction, and sought greater workplace diversity. Reflections on her personal and professional journey now inform her new book, My Life in Full , a memoir-meets-manifesto for work-life inclusion. Nooyi describes it as a personal story, a business story, and a story about her hopes for the future of work. “I want to advance the care discussion, figure out how to convene the right people. [I also want] to give back as much as I can, whether it is mentoring the young generation or working with entrepreneurs,” she tells The Hindu Weekend in an interview. The book is a riveting read, and particularly engaging in the parts where she explains her career trajectory, from BCG’s Chicago office to PepsiCo. She also opens up about herself, her dreams for cricket, and why dressing right is a powerful tool. (In the book, she recalls how she bought an ill-fitting dark blue polyester outfit to “fit in”, but it backfired. A friend then advised her to wear a sari the next time because if people “won’t hire you for who you are, it’s their loss”.) Today, Nooyi serves as an independent director on the board of the International Cricket Council, the first woman to do so. She also sits on Amazon’s board, teaches at the prestigious US Military Academy at West Point, and continues to advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  Edited excerpts:  What prompted you to write this memoir? When I retired after 12 years as CEO of PepsiCo, I wanted to work on issues supporting women advancing in the workplace. When I stepped down, people kept asking me, ‘Why isn’t a woman replacing you?’. They never ask a man that question! There’s a tremendous burden on women in terms of how to handle work and family pressure. My lawyer and publisher came to me and said, ‘I think people want to hear your life story... how you stayed married for 41 years, have two kids, and advanced to becoming CEO. That story gives authenticity to whatever you are going to propose’. That’s how this book came about. Other books by male business leaders hardly touch on work life balance. When is that going to change?  How about right now? We have to start the conversation by saying we are not talking about females, we are talking about family. Talking about families is an economic issue. The economy grows when everybody can be deployed to help grow the economy. I think we have to bring men to the table to talk about how, collectively, we are going to address this issue. You write that ‘women’s choice to work outside the home is integral to their well-being’. Yet the reality of so many women’s lives makes it hard to manage both.  There’s no question that I had a good family support structure. And when they weren’t there, I created a support structure. Many people cannot afford that. I think about the nurses, front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic — many women who had children at home. They had no predictability, no flexibility in their work hours. And we never sat down for a moment and talked about how they were going to handle childcare, eldercare? The one good thing that came out of the pandemic is that we have to think about work flexibility in a much more expansive way. How would you envision changing this lack of a support structure?  This is where I think governments, corporates, NGOs, and communities have to come together. I was looking at the anganwadi structure in India. The thought behind it is very good, but the execution needs to improve. Now, we should think not about anganwadi 2.0 but 4.0. Redesign that structure, train the people, pay them so they can work there and take kids till age five so that they could go to school after that. This could be absolutely frame-breaking for India at a point when women are doing really well in schools and colleges. Somebody once told me the biggest emerging market opportunity within the United States and within India is women. So I am approaching this an economist, not a feminist. How did you navigate the internal politics in a major organisation like PepsiCo?  The time that I came into the workforce, there were hardly any women. What I experienced, however, was a lot of support. People said, ‘Hey, if she’s made it this far there must be something good about her’. But I also sensed [the question], ‘A woman of colour, sitting in the boardroom. Who is she?’. And, along with that, came certain behaviours you could say are just not acceptable. So, I had to perform better than anybody else to be seen or noticed or respected. The most important piece of advice I would give people: understand the politics in the organisation. Stay the hell out of it. The minute you start to play the politics, it’s a slippery slope. Don’t do that. The incident of you returning home to share the news of becoming president of PepsiCo, only to have your mother ask you to go fetch milk went viral. As you write, ‘women have to leave their crowns in the garage’ — how do we challenge these notions?  I think we have to talk about both [men and women] leaving their crowns in the garage. In the home, we are all members of a family, members of a co-operative trying to create harmony, bringing up the next generation, taking care of the elderly. When we give birth to a girl child, we never start by saying, ‘Oh my god, I’ve given birth to a life-long unpaid labourer’. We say we give birth to this beautiful child. We want her to dream, to soar. Instead what do we do? We relegate many women to life-long unpaid labour. Do you think with the pandemic, the idea of care and gender roles is evolving?  I think work flexibility has to become the norm. Some mix of work at home, remote work and in the office will become common. We have to be careful not to create two classes of citizens [though] — the men who come to work and the women who work from home and, therefore, are pushed down or treated differently. You introduced mentoring [women] at PepsiCo. How do companies foster such programmes?  If we frame this as a strictly women’s issue, people go, ‘There they go again the women!’ This is not a female issue, it’s an economic issue, a family issue, a future of work issue. The future of work is about caregivers — about teachers, nurses and doctors. It’s about women coming into the workforce in large numbers. The whole care structure is not going to work without women in our systems. How are we going to support all these women? We are all social beings and we have to figure out how to create social networks outside of digital social networks. From your earliest days at BCG, wearing saris to work, till now — where your trademark scarf and stylish short hair are admired — you describe your sartorial transformation as giving you confidence.  The workplace is a competitive place. What you want to do is take away any negative attention on the way you dress. And that goes to dressing inappropriately or so badly that you draw derision. In each country or economy, dress appropriately for that place. In my case, I was in long skirts and misshapen clothes. I look back at some of my pictures and think ‘Oh my God’. Every time I would look around, I would feel inappropriately dressed for that group. So, [I would] overpower the dressing issue with my competence. I was always over prepared. When you come to a workplace, it’s not a social place. Dress appropriately and let the work speak for itself. Your drive comes across throughout the book. Even as a young girl, you formed a band and started a women’s cricket team. Is that an innate personality trait?  I am wired differently. It feels like I have to do something all the time to break boundaries. The world has so much to teach you. Go out and seek that knowledge.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Nothing to hide||The elephant is out of the womb, the room, and gambolled through our chat. Kalki Koechlin brought her book, her trademark vivacity and honesty to our call. Oh, and her uke too. She played us a lullaby in French. Koechlin is an actor, celebrity, award-winner, activist, writer (Wiki does a better job of this), and a mum. Yet another celeb-turned -author?A-listers have been jumping on the book-writing bandwagon of late — Soha Ali Khan with Kunal Khemu, Karan Johar and Jugal Hansraj… Lots about tots. Why do we need another one? Burps, lack of libido and incontinence, to start with. This is a book with all the warts and bumps. Koechlin, 37, kept a diary when she was pregnant. Her musings, rants, poetry, cravings, all made it into this memoir (as personal essays and think-pieces), with Valeriya Polyanychko’s brilliant, wacky illustrations focussing on the many versions of Koechlin’s baby bump and other lumps, protesting vaginas and raging breasts.  The Elephant in the Womb is not medical guidance or prescription, saysthe actor, on a video call for The Hindu Weekend . She calls it the ‘giant experience’ of motherhood. “I wanted everyone to know about the hard parts… and that we’re not alone.” So read this if, like me, you’re frustrated with balancing the ‘mother-instinct-myth’ on that wobbly high pedestal to which we guiltily cling. Read it because there’s a star who lets us in behind the makeup. She gets real and raw: the beached-whale body, the post-partum slump, the perineal tear, the ‘awe of this new soul’ as well as “the other side... you want your life back”.  Hard truths   Atthe risk of irking the fandom, here’s a disclaimer. This book is written from a place of privilege: Koechlin’s words. Don’t expect to have the same experience, don’t even expect to agree with it all. It brings these elephants marching out of the room: the taboos, the forbidden topics, the hush-hush not-polite-conversation. “Most young women in their 20s I know have had an abortion and not talked about it. I understand privacy, but I think you need the support around. When you have a surgery on your knee, you call your family to come and pick you up. When you have an abortion, you come home alone. And that’s tragic,” says Koechlin. Both our chat and the book are about what she advocates widely: choice. Personal freedom. That the woman decides what birth she has — “Shouldn’t she be the one making the decision when she’s risking her life to do it?” — and about how she raises her child. The actor says she chose to follow her mother in the natural birthing process (her maman had three home births), but not in discipline. “I’m trying to sift the good and the bad. My parents were from a generation where it was fine to slap a child. Guy [Hershberg] and I are trying to find other ways to give Sappho [her 20-month-old daughter] discipline. We believe violence leads to violence,” she says. Hershberg, her partner, an Israeli classical musician, has his own hilarious chapter in the book, involving monkeys and dragons — but it’s very much about how different a father’s perspective on parenting is. Or is it?  Why sideline parenting?   Finally,acutely aware of not disappointing her multitude of fans, we steered the conversation around to Bollywood. She’s busy shooting again; I asked her about her identity, how she saw herself, and how the film fraternity now sees her. She wishes there were more support. “As a community, if we did talk about our problems with our work people, we’d probably be more productive in the long run,” she says. “Society sees parenting as something done on the side, while actually it’s the centre of humanity, it’s the future generation, the continuation of the species — and it’s sidelined.” As cinema turns to more feminist themes on screen, what about reality? Is someone out there listening? “One day, Sappho can look at this book and know what I went through.” And Koechlin, how your “little flea, wiggly worm, yellow thing” little elephant will trumpet that day.     Published by Penguin Random House India,   the book is priced at Rs. 399 and is available on   leading e-commerce sites and book stores.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Get your home festival ready||It’s that time of the year again. Locked in by the pandemic for one-and-a-half years, the festive season is finally here to bring us some cheer. And as you scout for the perfect outfits for Dussehra, Diwali and the after-parties, perhaps it’s also time to pay some attention to your home, which has been your haven and sanctuary for the past few months. If painting the entire home (a Diwali tradition in most households) isn’t possible, you can think small. One wall? One wall isn’t much when it comes to revamping and redoing. But what can you do differently this season? Designers believe that every blank wall is a canvas and needs to be accented to make an impact. Playing with wall surfaces creates a layered look, one that appears dressier and more festive. How do you do it? Blending colour, texture, and tone can help create a centrepiece for the room of your choice. All you need to do then is play down the rest of the elements of the room, and voila, you have a brand new room ready to rock the festive season. Try one of these ideas to dress up your wall this festive season: Paint it a brand new colour Think beyond white and beige at this time of the year. It’s true that a neutral backdrop lets your furniture and furnishings take centre stage, but play new colour. A tropical blue with a hint of green, a deep coral, a dark grey or the extremely on-trend indigo…what will it be? Create innovative patterns An accent wall never fails to make an impression. Whether you choose to paint it a high-gloss colour, clad with brick or stone, or add wooden panels, accent walls are a style statement. Work them by ensuring that the wall you accent is the room’s natural focal point. This means arranging the furniture and other elements in harmony with the wall. Try out wallpaper This trend that was seen as dated is back, and in so many varieties that you’ll be spoilt for choice. Prints, patterns, colours, types and textures — make your choice carefully. Gingham checks would be ideal for a child’s room while gold-foil wallpaper in a deep colour would be perfect for an entryway. The living room could thrive with a theme that you love — florals, stripes, geometrics, and more. Only ensure that it complements the other elements. How about a tattoo Wall decals, murals and coverings completely change the look and feel of your space. The best part? There’s something for everyone — modern, contemporary, Parisian chic, glam, children and so on! Try a row of row of floor-to-ceiling trees silhouetted behind the couch, trompe l’oeil vases seeming to sit atop the console or a tree with birds in the children’s room. Say hi to stencils If you’re not willing to commit to a bold paint colour, why not play with stencils? The market offers plenty of intricate and stylish stencils that you can use to paint on your accent wall. It could either be tone-on-tone or you can use as a feature element in a bold colour. Txtures are cool Paint and paper, they’re both now available in unusual textures that you wouldn’t have thought possible a few years back. Vinyl, faux alligator, patent leathers, fur, metallic, grasscloth, glow in the dark…you can use them in the living room, powder room or a dark hallway. Play with Nature  Rustic-lookingreclaimed-wood walls can create a country or barn-house feel. But there are plenty of other options available, thanks to the numerous kinds of veneers available. You can also try creating bespoke walls from bamboo, cork, jute or coconut shells. Mother of pearl is expensive but creates a stunning accent wall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/get-your-home-festival-ready/article36908684.ece
09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Indian retail: back on track||To say that COVID-19 cast a shadow on the Indian retail sector is an understatement, and any hope for a swift comeback in 2020 fell flat. New mall completions — a lead indicator of the sector’s prospects — were phenomenal in 2019, with around 8.5 million sq.ft. added across the top seven cities. This was a staggering 73% growth over the previous year. However, with complete and then intermittent lockdowns from March 2020, buying stalled and construction also took a major hit. In addition, there were severe supply constraints as well as a shortage of semi-skilled and unskilled construction workers. As a result, new mall completions in 2020 dropped by 75% over the previous year, clocking in at approx. 2.1 million sq.ft. With the second COVID-19 wave receding gradually and the vaccination drive picking up pace, consumer confidence is once again heading northwards. Due to a substantial improvement in the general economic situation and employment scenario outlook, the future expectations index (FEI) of RBI’s latest Consumer Confidence Survey returned into the optimistic territory. Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail, says, “Improving consumer confidence and a resilient long-term retail growth story translates into higher shopping spending, which reflects in the mall space scheduled for deployment in 2021.” As per their research, approximately 4.5 million sq.ft. of new supply is planned for 2021. This new supply will be spread across tier I and tier II cities of India. “Tier I citieswill account for around 90% of the space. Approximately 85% of the upcoming malls are likely to be added in tier I cities, and 15% in tier II & tier III cities,” he adds. After a severely rough patch in 2020 due to the unprecedented lockdowns, the overall growth prospects for shopping malls remain intact. Key highlights: Organised retail penetration in India is less than 10% compared to the developed nations such as the US and UK at 85% and 80%, respectively. Per capita organised retail space in India is approx. 2 sq.ft. per person compared to the US at 23 sq.ft. per person and Dubai at 16 sq.ft. per person. India’s per capita income is $1,961 and has grown 12% in the past 5 years. City-wise stats  Noida in NCR has around 1.1 million sq. ft. of new space planned for 2021, across three malls. NCR — the region where the mall story kicked off in a big way more than a decade ago — is back in action with new malls planned for this year. Bengaluru is likely to witness new space completion of 1.22 Mn sq. ft., spread across two malls. This city is primarily driven by IT-ITeS companies whose business hasn’t been negatively impacted by the pandemic outbreak. As a result, the consumption pattern in the city is likely to improve in future periods. Mumbai is likely to add only 1.1 million sq. ft. of new space spread across three malls. The city has witnessed significant mall supply addition in the recent past and so it seems to be going slow for now. Also, COVID has rampaged the lives and livelihoods of many in the city and as a result, the real estate developers seem to be cautiously treading ahead. Lucknow and Amaravati are among the tier II cities which collectively have nearly 4.7 Lakh sq.ft. of mall space planned for 2021, across two malls. The road ahead “A pan-Indiacomparison of retail mall supply additions planned for 2021 depicts more than double growth over the previous year,” says Renjhen, adding, “The Indian economy is likely to regain its growth trajectory as the COVID-19 effect recedes. As per IMF estimates, India is likely to grow at 9.5% in FY22 - the fastest globally.” The Indian retail sector is witnessing accelerated organisation. As per industry estimates, organised retail is growing at a 20-25% CAGR per year, and the comeback of new retail mall supply bodes well for the sector. Overall, good times are ahead for Indian retail real estate after a subdued slowdown inorganically cast by the COVID-19 outbreak.

09 October 2021||October 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Grab your||Our seasonal guests have landed, in millions, after marathon flights across continents. Birds from 29 countries fly to India every year at this time, an annual ritual signifying the beginning of migration. The stint, a bird that weighs just about 20 grams, makes an astonishing journey covering 8,000 km from Siberia to Tamil Nadu’s Point Calimere. Forested areas of the Indian Peninsula are aflutter with warblers, a wispy olive green bird, that fly thousands of kilometres from the mountains of Central Asia. The bar-tailed godwits, after spending their summers in Russia, will soon embark on a long non-stop flight to spend the winters at shallow water bodies in Pulicat and Sholinganallur. As daylight shrinks and food supply dwindles at the breeding sites in the Northern Hemisphere, birds start migrating towards wintering sites in the South. “It’s a natural process of survival. They take nine flyways across the world and some unusual routes during this flight,” says S. Sivakumar, a scientist at the Bombay Natural History Society. He says, “The Central Asian Flyway covers 30 countries, including India. The black-headed, brown-headed and slender-billed gulls have arrived, mostly from Europe and Central Asia.”  Our special guests can easily be spotted perched on trees or at a wooded area, says Ashvin Viswanathan of Bird Count India, Bengaluru. Bird Count India supports listing and monitoring of birds across India. “Grey wagtails have arrived. I saw a blue-tailed bee eater (that breeds in North and central India) calling and migrating while heading South. Most birds migrate at night. When you go to a forest patch or a garden in the morning near your home, you will see a new bird every day as it rests there after flying all night,” he says. Many birders have observed unusual sightings. For example, Amur falcons made a stopover in Pune in huge numbers in January, and the red-necked phalarope, a pelagic bird showed up at Uppar Dam in Dharapuram, a non-coastal area during the last week of September. Birds have a few favourite places, says Ramakrishnan Aiyaswamy, a wildlife photographer in Bengaluru. “They choose their place based on the availability of food and how long they can stay there. They also have a plan B, and choose another water body in the nearby area if their original habitat is disturbed.” As long as the birds keep their date with migration, birders are happy as it indicates a healthy environment and a safe habitat. “We are waiting to meet the brown shrike that comes from the Mongolian region. Every year, we see two birds at our school campus in Valparai. It arrives by the first week of October. We see more than 30 migrant species here during the migration season,” says K. Selvaganesh, a birder and teacher at Valparai near Coimbatore. During this time, some birds called passage migrants, like the European roller, rufous-tailed scrub robin, and common white throat, migrate through Rajasthan, Gujarat and other parts of the Indian peninsula to cross the Arabian Sea. They move to Africa by mid-October to spend the winters there. “This time of the year is fascinating for bird watchers as a number of incredibly beautiful birds pass through the Indian subcontinent on their way to somewhere else. Birders in Delhi can now see the greenish warbler (from Europe), Blythe’s reed warbler (from Europe and Russia) and rusty-tailed flycatcher (from Kashmir and Himachal) passing through as the birds are heading southwards,” says Ashvin. The common stonechat, a chunky little bird from Siberia and Turkey, has arrived in Delhi, says Col. Pankaj Sharma (retd.), who runs Indian Birds on Facebook, the largest online community on birds in the Indian subcontinent that has 2.7 lakh members. “The bar-headed geese, northern shovellers, and pigtails from the ducks family will be arriving early as the wetlands are already full because of rains in September. I am waiting for the endangered steppe eagle to land from Europe. These birds can be sighted at the Aravalli Range of Gurugram, and in areas around Jhajjar district in Haryana.” Though birds have been carrying on these long trips for millions of years, Aravind says one can spot small changes in trends through eBird database and through sites like Migrant Watch. “Siberian Cranes, which are critically endangered, used to visit Bharatpur Sanctuary about 20 years ago, but we don’t see them now because that population which visited India seems to have gone extinct.” Charting new courses Ashvin, who has put together animation maps on migration based on data uploaded on citizen science platform eBird, agrees. “There is suspicion on how birds might be reacting to shifts in climate. Bird species like yellow-browed warbler and Richard’s pipit migrated to northeast India, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Now, they are landing in western Europe in a new migratory route. There is a documented change in pattern,” he says. Researches track birds using satellite tags and that reveals knowledge on individual birds and their migration routes. “We ringed northern shoveller at Manjeera Wildlife Sanctuary in Telangana, and tracked its flight all the way to Russia,” says Sivakumar. He says, “Migration is a long, exhausting journey. Global warming is real. Rains are inconsistent. Wetlands are drying up. At the world level, some changes have been noticed among the breeding ranges of birds already. We have to conserve our wetlands to ensure that food is available for the visitors. They can gain weight and fly back to their breeding ground on time and bring a healthy offspring.”     Chennai watchlist Terns and gulls can be seen at Pulicat lake. Whiskered tern is the most common migratory tern, and that can be seen atwe can find in multiple waterbodies in the city Caspian tern, which is the world’s largest tern, can be seen in many places around the city (like Sholinganallur, Pallikaranai, Adyar Estuary and even along the beaches atlike Besant Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur and so on) Brown-headed gull is the most common gull and can be seen at Adyar Estuary, Kelambakkam, and Pulicat Birds of prey — like marsh harriers, kestrels, short-eared owls, peregrine falcons and multiple species of eagles — can be found around Pallikaranai and Sholinganallur marshlands||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/grab-your/article36909160.ece
09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Giving ‘special push’ for ethanol as fuel: Gadkari||Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Friday said the government was giving a special push for ethanol as a fuel. “With 100% use of 20% blend of bioethanol, we will be able to save Rs. 30,000 crore on import of fossil fuel. Further, the use of ethanol blended petrol decreases emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides by 40%,” he stated. The government recently launched the Ethanol 20 programme, under which it aims to achieve 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. “Currently, the ethanol economy is Rs. 20,000 crore, which I am targeting to raise to more than Rs. 2 lakh crore. We are taking inspiration from countries like Brazil that have been using ethanol in their transport industry for more than 60 years. They have a compulsory blend of 27% ethanol in petrol,” he noted. Flex vehicles soon He reiterated that the government was planning to introduce flex vehicles soon. Such vehicles would be able to operate on 100% bioethanol or 100% petrol. The government had allowed the production of ethanol from surplus and damaged food grains such as rice, corn, in addition to sugar cane that will give additional income to farmers, he observed. Currently, the sugar industry contributed to 90% of ethanol demand as a blended fuel, but the government was making efforts to increase the contribution of food grain-based distillery, he asserted. “Our efforts are on for capacity expansion and establishing new distillery plants to fulfil the ethanol requirement as a blended fuel in the country,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/giving-special-push-for-ethanol-as-fuel-gadkari/article36908930.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Punjab will be free from stubble menace if AAP comes to power’||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday said Punjab, which generates around 20 million tonnes of paddy straw annually, will become free from stubble burning if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) forms the government in the State. The Assembly election in Punjab is slated for early next year. Mr. Rai said Delhi has provided a solution to the problem of stubble burning in the form of microbial solution Pusa bio-decomposer and it will be distributed for free in all Punjab districts like the AAP government has been doing here. “Punjab will become free from stubble burning if AAP forms a government in the State. We will rope in the district administrations in Punjab and spray Pusa bio-decomposer in fields for free like we have been doing in Delhi,” Mr. Rai said. “It's not so tough (spraying bio-decomposer on lakhs of acres of land). You only need the will power to do it. We will do it positively,” he asserted. This won't be as expensive as other measures being taken for crop residue management, the Minister added. Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15 as farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR. Ban defied Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting paddy and sowing wheat. The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn stubble. Bio-decomposer spray On October 5, the Delhi government started spraying Pusa bio-decomposer, a microbial solution that can turn stubble into manure, over 4,300 acres belonging to 844 farmers in Delhi. Last year, 310 farmers had used it on 1,935 acres of land. In Punjab, paddy is cultivated on 2.814 million hectares of land. According to officials, U.P. is using the bio-decomposer in 10 lakh acres of area, Punjab in five lakh acres and Haryana in one lakh acre of land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-will-be-free-from-stubble-menace-if-aap-comes-to-power/article36909170.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Commuting to school a risky path for kids||Numbering over 500 million according to the Census 2011, children below 18 years of age face a high degree of risk while commuting to and from school due to poor road planning, limited enforcement and poor traffic behaviour across 14 Indian cities, according to a study. The pandemic had added another layer of danger to these existing factors for school students and there was a need for safety policies for students at both the national and State level, the report observed. The study, titled ‘National Study on Safe Commute to School’, and carried out by the SaveLIFE Foundation and Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI) to highlight gaps in road safety for children, posited that although millions of students travel to school everyday, many schools do not provide the option of school-affiliated transport. Heavy toll This, even as over 30 children below the age of 18 died in road crashes every day, or over 11,000 in total during the year 2019, according to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). The Ministry’s data stated that 11,168 deaths of children aged below 18 years were recorded in 2019, registering an increase of 7.4% compared to 2018. The study, conducted after the outbreak of the pandemic, analysed responses from 11,845 respondents including 5,711 children of Classes VI to XII and 6,134 parents with children in Classes I to XII across 14 cities. The cities surveyed include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi, Jaipur, Jamshedpur, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, Pune, and Vijayawada. No option Almost half – that is 48% or 1,817 of 3,787 respondents surveyed – said they did not have the option of school-affiliated transportation; school buses were being utilised by a little over 33% or 3,948 of the total number of 11,845 respondents. The number of respondents utilising school vans and choosing to walk to school – 1,374 and 1,332 out of the total 11,845 respondents – constituted 12% and 11% of the total, respectively adding up to the same percentage as those using school buses. The largest number of respondents who, or whose children, commute to school by walking were found in Mumbai and Bengaluru. As many as 47% of the respondents commuting to school on a cycle stated that there are no separate cycle paths for their mobility implying that they have to move along with motorised traffic, which potentially exposes them to a greater risk of road traffic injury. This proportion is especially high in Vijayawada (87%), Patna (72%), and Delhi (63%). The maximum respondents to flag the non-availability of transportation facilities to and from school were from Ahmedabad followed by Chennai and Delhi. Lack of transportation A city-wise analysis revealed that in Delhi 59%, Ahmedabad 76%, Chennai 61%, Mumbai 53%, Pune 51%, and Vijayawada 56%, a majority of the children did not have any transportation facility in their school, followed by 47% in Jaipur and 46% in Bengaluru. When respondents who commute by walking were asked whether there were any alternate modes of transport, more than two-third or 67% of the respondents reported that there was no alternative available for them to commute to school other than walking. On the other hand, almost half – around 47% or 2,579 of the 5,489 respondents using school transport – admitted that their school vehicles were not equipped with seat belts, as many 30% of the children surveyed said they witnessed a crash during their commute to school and 6% of them were involved in a road crash or a near-miss situation during their commute to and from school. When asked about the impact of the crash, most parents across cities (74%) reported that their child did not have any injury – the percentage being highest for Bengaluru (100%) and lowest for Chennai (33%). It was also revealed that 4% of the parents in Chennai and 5% of the parents in Jaipur stated that their child had died due to the road crash. The report was in favour of policies for ensuring safe school transport at both the national and the State level to issue guidelines for schools, parents and road authorities to follow, so that risks to road safety are mitigated during school commute. As the pandemic still looms large, the policies should be inclusive of the sanitisation and social distancing requirements to prevent the risk of contracting COVID. The policies should also contain guidelines for all modes of commute, the report stated. Safety policy “As of date, over 25 States and Union Territories have announced the reopening of schools. While there is a vaccine for COVID, the vaccine for child deaths on our roads is really our collective action,” said SaveLIFE Foundation Founder & CEO, Piyush Tewari. “Our findings through this report have once again emphasised that the right to safe commute to school is as important as the right to education itself. A comprehensive national and State school transport safety policy can ensure that,” he added. Manu Saale, Managing Director and CEO, MBRDI said, “The findings from this study show unequivocally the rising need for road safety in the country. We hope that this study will help all stakeholders further extend our vision of zero casualties to all modes of road transport.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/commuting-to-school-a-risky-path-for-kids/article36908986.ece
09 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||Dalit Sikhs to challenge eviction move||The Dalit or Mazhabi Sikhs of the Harijan Colony adjoining Iewduh, the commercial hub of Meghalaya capital Shillong, would be challenging the government’s bid to take possession of their land after evicting them. After a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said the government was set to take possession of the Harijan Colony land within a week by following “due procedures”. The employees of the Shillong Municipal Board residing at the Harijan Colony would be relocated to the staff quarters on the premises of the board’s temporary office in another area of the city, he stated. The 2-acre Harijan Colony, also known as Punjabi Lane or Sweepers’ Lane, has about 350 families living in two-storey hovels flanking a 300-metre lane. Only a few families have members as employees of the municipal board. The Harijan Colony was at the centre of a conflict following a quarrel between some locality women and a bus driver on May 31, 2018. An exchange of words snowballed into a communal clash with local tribal youths laying siege to the colony for a few days, forcing the authorities to clamp an indefinite curfew. One of the reasons for the violence was a bid to shift the colony and make room for a commercial complex. The Cabinet discussed the report that the High-Level Committee, set up on June 4, 2018 to find a feasible solution for the relocation of the Harijan Colony, submitted to the government recently, Mr. Sangma noted. The discussion covered the genesis of the issue, challenges and the various events that took place during the committee’s three-year exercise. Tripartite agreement “The government and the Shillong Municipal Board have signed a tripartite agreement to take possession of the land from the Syiem of Mylliem and the government will do so within a week,” he said. Syiem is the customary head of a Khasi tribal administrative area. “We are not sure how the CM said they can take the land donated to us by the Syiem of Mylliem 200 years ago. In February 2019, the High Court of Meghalaya gave a judgment in our favour, establishing our right over the piece of land,” Gurjit Singh, general secretary of the Punjabi Lane’s Gurdwara Committee, told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dalit-sikhs-to-challenge-eviction-move-in-shillong/article36908980.ece
09 October 2021||PUNE,||Not worried about ‘guests’ at home, Pawar on I-T raids||As Income Tax Department raids on firms owned by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar’s relatives and aides continued for the second successive day on Friday, both Mr. Pawar and his uncle, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar mocked the BJP Government at the Centre by remarking that they were not worried by the “guests at their home”. Teams of I-T authorities have been raiding businesses, including sugar factories, and searching the houses of Mr. Ajit Pawar’s sisters in Kolhapur and Pune, as well as the Mumbai office of his son Parth Pawar. The raids have been on for nearly 30 hours. Speaking in Solapur at a rally of NCP workers and office-bearers, Mr. Sharad Pawar took a jibe at the Modi Government at the Centre, stating: “I heard that the Centre sent some guests [I-T authorities] yesterday to Ajit Pawar’s place [firms linked to the Deputy Chief Minister’s kin]…but we are never worried about such guests.” The NCP supremo reminded his party workers of the time in September 2019 when, just ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly election that year, he had received a notice from the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Mr. Sharad Pawar had been named in a money laundering case by the ED in connection with the multi-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) scam. At the time, Mr. Sharad Pawar, taking the ED head-on, had proposed to present himself before the agency’s Mumbai office, after which it conveyed that the NCP chief’s appearance would not be necessary. “I was neither part of the bank’s board of directors, nor had I ever taken a loan from there. Yet, I was slapped with an ED notice…but Maharashtra’s public thought the then ruling BJP crazy. So, even if such raids are being carried out against firms owned by Ajit Pawar or his relatives or some other person, the end reaction to all this will be manifested in the public’s ire,” said the NCP chief. Mr. Sharad Pawar further warned that the public would teach the BJP a lesson for shamelessly misusing Central agencies in such a reckless fashion. Meanwhile, Mr. Ajit Pawar, who was on his weekly tour of Pune district, alluded similarly to I-T officials as “guests” while stating that he would only speak on the affair once the authorities had departed. ‘No cause for fear’ “A number of ‘guests’ are at different homes… When they leave, I will say whatever I have to. I have already given my reaction yesterday, so there is no need to repeat myself and I urge people to stop shooting pointlessly in the clouds… There is no cause for fear. Everything will come out before the public in due course of time,” said the Deputy Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/not-worried-about-guests-at-home-pawar-on-i-t-raids/article36909172.ece
09 October 2021||Kolkata,||WB police put on alert amid terror threat during Durga Puja festivities||The West Bengal government has put the police on alert in view of the Durga Puja festivities in the State, citing terror threats. Issuing a set of guidelines, Chief Secretary H.K. Dwivedi asked officials to ensure that communal harmony is maintained in the State. All community puja committees were asked to engage an adequate number of volunteers in the pandals to keep vigil on the movement of suspicious persons and inform the police in case of any emergency. CCTV cameras and watchtowers were made mandatory for large puja pandals, as per the guidelines. The police were put on alert in view of the prevailing threats from divisive and terrorist groups to destabilise peace and harmony, leading to law and order problems during the ensuing festivities, it said. Mr. Dwivedi asked all the departments concerned to ensure that communal harmony is maintained in the State during the Durga Puja festival. “Special attention should be given to areas having mixed population and thickly populated areas as well as isolated places and vulnerable or sensitive regions," the guidelines said. The government also asked community puja committees to fix the date and time of immersion in consultation with the local police. This year the State has allowed immersion of idols from October 15 to 18. “Steps should be taken so that the festivities do not result in annoyance to local residents and people of other communities,” the guidelines said. The usual restrictions on the use of loudspeakers should be strictly followed, it said. “’The State Home Department must be informed of any untoward incident during the festivals forthwith," it added.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/wb-police-put-on-alert-amid-terror-threat/article36908961.ece

Mr. Gadkari added that while the speed limits for the National Highways should be at least 100 km per hour on four-lane roads, the limits for two-lane roads and city roads should be 80 km per hour and 75 km per hour respectively.

09 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||I-T raids detect Rs. 250 cr. in undisclosed income||The Income-Tax (I-T) department has detected undisclosed income to the tune of Rs. 250 crore during the searches against two groups operating in the Northeast and West Bengal. One group was engaged in the business of cement manufacturing, while the other was into executing railway contracts in Assam, Mizoram and other parts of the Northeast. The agency carried out searches on 15 premises of the suspects in Kolkata, Guwahati, Rangia, Shillong and Patna. With respect to the group that was into cement manufacturing, the I-T department found that it had generated unaccounted income by indulging in out-of-books sales and booking bogus expenses. The unaccounted income was laundered back into the business through shell companies. Several paper companies run by the group used to provide accommodation entries to its flagship concern to project the transactions as authentic. During the searches, the agency also found evidence indicating that bogus unsecured loans were given, commissions were shown to have been paid and bogus share premium were received via shell companies, which accounted for an unaccounted sum of Rs. 50 crore.  In the case of another group, the agency seized papers indicating undisclosed investments in land parcels and properties, involving over Rs. 110 crore. Details pertaining to cash transactions amounting to more than Rs. 13 crore in the sale of properties were also being examined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/i-t-raids-detect-rs-250-cr-in-undisclosed-income/article36909166.ece
09 October 2021||New Delhi,||Special push for ethanol as a fuel, says Gadkari||“I am giving a special push for ethanol as a fuel,” Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said on Friday. “With 100% use of 20% blend of bio ethanol we will be able to save Rs. 30,000 crore on import of fossil fuel. Further, the use of ethanol blended petrol decreases emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides by 40%,” Mr. Gadkari said at a FICCI event on alternative fuels. The government has launched the Ethanol 20 programme under which it aims to achieve 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. “Currently, the ethanol economy is Rs. 20,000 crore which I am targeting to raise to more than Rs. 2 lakh crore. We are taking inspiration from countries like Brazil which have been using ethanol in their transport industry for more than 60 years. They have a compulsory blend of 27% ethanol in petrol,” the Minister added. Flex vehicles He also reiterated that the government was planning to introduce flex vehicles soon. Such vehicles would be able to operate on 100% bio ethanol or 100% petrol. The Minister said that the government has allowed the production of ethanol from surplus and damaged food grains such as rice, corn in addition to sugar cane which will give additional income to farmers. He said that currently sugar industry contributes to 90% of ethanol demand as a blended fuel, but the government is making efforts to increase the contribution of food grain-based distillery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/special-push-for-ethanol-as-a-fuel-says-gadkari/article36909173.ece
