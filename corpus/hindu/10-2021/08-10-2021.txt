08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC tells U.P. to file status report on Lakhimpur Kheri in 24 hours||The Supreme Court on Thursday gave the Uttar Pradesh Government 24 hours to file a status report identifying the accused in the First Information Report (FIR) registered on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, and whether they have been arrested or not. Instilling a sense of urgency in the Government, a Bench, led by the Chief Justice of India, also ordered the State to facilitate immediate medical care for the mother of a 19-year-old man who was among those killed in the incident. “While hearing this case now we got a message that the mother of one of people who died is in a state of shock over the loss of her son and needs immediate medical attention... We want you to get her admitted at the nearest hospital,” the court addressed Uttar Pradesh Additional Advocate-General Garima Prashad. ‘Extreme, unfortunate’ Ms. Prashad stated it would be done immediately while describing the Lakhimpur Kheri incident as “extreme, unfortunate”. The CJI said, “We also feel the same way.” The court observed that it was known that eight people had been killed, and they were farmers and a journalist. “We want to know who are the accused in the FIR and whether they have been arrested or not,” Justice Surya Kant, on the Bench, told the Government. The CJI said the status report should contain details of those killed. News reports said four of the deceased were farmers mowed down by a vehicle, which was part of the convoy of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs and BJP MP Ajay Kumar Mishra. Ms. Prashad said the government had constituted a special investigation team, and a judicial inquiry had begun. An FIR had been filed. The CJI said, “But the grievance here is your investigation is not proper.” He was referring to a letter from advocates Shivkumar Tripathi and C.S. Panda, based on which the court had taken cognisance of the incident. Ms. Prashad said the State would try to file a status report by Thursday, even as the court listed the case for Friday. Thursday’s hearing of the case before the CJI’s Bench comes just three days after another Bench had lashed out at farmers’ bodies, connecting their nearly year-long protests against farm laws to the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri. That Bench, led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, had said that “nobody takes responsibility” when incidents like Lakhimpur Kheri occured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-tells-up-to-file-status-report-on-lakhimpur-kheri-in-24-hours/article36889726.ece
08 October 2021||MYSURU,||Bommai: Will put Dasara fete on international tourism map||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday announced that the State Government would make all efforts to put Dasara celebrations on the international tourism map by developing a tourist circuit with Mysuru in the centre and launching an attractive tour package. Speaking after the inauguration of Mysuru Dasara-2021, or the Nada Habba on the premises of Sri Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills, he said Mysuru would be promoted and marketed, keeping Dasara in focus, and tourism activities would be conceptualised on the lines of tourism-centric events at international tourist hotspots like Paris and Rome. A Mysuru tourist circuit would be created in consultation with experts and people engaged in tourism promotion, he said, promising to celebrate next year’s Dasara in a grand manner if the pandemic fades away. This year’s celebrations have been scaled down in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inaugural event was limited to 400 people. Earlier, former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna inaugurated the festivities by lighting the traditional lamp and showering flower petals on the idol of the presiding deity placed in a silver chariot. In his inaugural address, Mr. Krishna urged Mr. Bommai to develop Mysuru as a key tourist destination by creating a package for tourists. “By Dasara 2022, a clear concept on projecting Mysuru and its tourism, focusing on the world famous Dasara, can be worked out. Though I don’t have a clear concept, you and your Cabinet colleagues can work out the concept and implement it by next Dasara,” he told the Chief Minister. He requested the Chief Minister to create a platform for tourists to experience Mysuru Dasara and tourist destinations such as Hampi, Belur, Halebid, Badami, Pattadakal and others. Mr. Krishna cited the example of Singapore which attracts lakhs of international tourists every year. Mysuru is a blessed place, and it has everything for making the city a major tourist destination. Dasara and the events associated with the festivities like wrestling are among the key attractions. Mr. Krishna recalled his association with Mysuru and the festivities since his childhood. “I have a close bond with Mysuru, as I completed my studies in the city. I used to go to Chamundi Hills and pray to the Goddess. I used to climb the steps of the hills,” he said. The former Chief Minister narrated the invaluable contributions of Mysuru maharajas and the Dewans who gave a special meaning to the celebrations. G.T. Deve Gowda, MLA, presided over the function. Chennamma, wife of Mr. Bommai was also present. Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar welcomed the guests. Pratap Simha, MP, Ministers B.A. Basavaraj, B.C. Patil, Shivaram Hebbar, R. Ashok, V. Sunil Kumar, and K.C. Narayana Gowda, and Tanveer Sait, S.A. Ramdas, L. Nagendra, and Harshavardhan, MLAs, were among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bommai-will-put-dasara-fete-on-international-tourism-map/article36889792.ece
08 October 2021||KALABURAGI,||Do not give political colour to Income Tax search: Somanna||Housing Minister V. Somanna tried to play down Income Tax raid on the residence and office of Umesh, who was the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s personal assistant while he was in office. “Carrying out raids is a normal and routine process that follows a private complaint,” he added. Refuting the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy’s allegations that internal conflict in the party [BJP] might be the reason for IT raids on Mr. Yediyurappa’s close aide, Mr. Somanna said that the raid is nowhere related to the party or its leaders. “It is not right to give political colour to it,” he added. Mr. Somanna exuded the confidence in the BJP winning both the Sindgi and Hangal Assembly constituencies in the by-polls scheduled on October 30. Reacting to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s statement on RSS, Mr. Somanna said that the RSS is a patriotic organisation that is safeguarding the country. The RSS has received appreciation for its service to the nation and Mr. Kumaraswamy should have thought for a while before making such statements. His remarks came in response to the recent comments made by Mr. Kumaraswamy who said that the RSS of today cannot be compared to the RSS of 40 years ago. Today, the RSS controls the BJP and its leaders, he had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/do-not-give-political-colour-to-income-tax-search-somanna/article36889998.ece
08 October 2021||MANGALURU,||Man arrested in shooting case||The Mangaluru South Police on Thursday arrested Rajesh Prabhu, owner of Vaishnavi X’press Cargo Private Limited, in connection with firing outside his office at Morgan’s Gate here on Tuesday evening in which his son was critically injured. The police had secured Mr. Prabhu for questioning soon after the incident. On Tuesday night, he complained of chest pain and Mr. Prabhu was admitted to a private hospital where his son Sudheendra had been admitted. After his (Mr. Prabhu’s) discharge on Thursday, the police said, Mr. Prabhu was arrested for an offence under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of Indian Penal Code and Section 30 of the Arms Act. When he was produced before the II JMFC Court, counsel for Mr. Prabhu filed an application seeking permission to admit his client for further treatment in hospital. The court granted permission and Mr. Prabhu was re-admitted to the private hospital. After two workers had a heated exchange of words with Mr. Prabhu’s wife Shantala over payment of Rs. 4,000 on Tuesday, Mr. Prabhu and his son came to the office. While Sudheendra is said to have slapped the two workers, Mr. Prabhu reportedly opened two rounds of fire with his licensed 0.32 bore pistol. One of the bullets which hit Sudheendra entered deep into his head. Sudheendra continues to be critical.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/man-arrested-in-shooting-case/article36890335.ece
08 October 2021||SRINAGAR,||Principal, teacher shot dead inside Srinagar school||The principal and a teacher of a government school in Srinagar were shot dead inside the school on Thursday. The killing comes just two days after three civilians, including well-known Kashmiri Pandit chemist Makhan Lal Bindroo of Bindroo Medicate, were killed in the Kashmir Valley. The Resistant Force (TRF), a militant outfit, has claimed responsibility for the school attack. The police said militants barged into the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Iddgah Sangam, in the old city and fired point-blank at the two, who died on the way to hospital. The victims were identified as principal Supinder Kour, 46, from Budgam’s Beerwah, and Kashmiri Pandit Deepak Chand, 38, who had migrated back to the Valley from Jammu. A teacher told The Hindu that they were sipping tea when they heard gunshots outside the principal’s room around 11.15 a.m. “We saw Chand falling outside the principal’s room,” the teacher said. A spree of killings by militants has left seven civilians dead in six days in the Valley, spreading panic among the minorities and non-local workers, at a time when Union Ministers are on a nine-week outreach programme in Jammu & Kashmir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/principal-teacher-shot-dead-inside-srinagar-school/article36889729.ece

Last year, C.N. Manjunath, cardiologist, inaugurated the celebrations. Defending choosing a politician for opening Dasara this year, Mr. Bommai said Mr. Krishna was a statesman. “My decision to invite him to Dasara was welcomed by all in the Cabinet. I think it had the approval of the people of the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/achievers-will-open-dasara-in-future-cm/article36890141.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC questions income limit for EWS quota||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the government to explain how it zeroed in on the figure of ‘Rs. 8 lakh’ as the annual income criterion to identify Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) among the forward classes of society for grant of 10% reservation in medical admissions under the all-India quota (AIQ). The Supreme Court’s query is significant as the One Hundred and Third Constitutional Amendment of 2019, which introduced the 10% EWS quota, is itself under challenge before a larger Bench. The amendment is under question for making economic criterion as the sole ground for grant of reservation benefits. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by NEET aspirants challenging a July 29 notification of the Centre announcing 27% quota to OBCs and 10% reservation to EWS in the all-India quota category. The three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud did not agree with the suggestion from Additional Solicitor General K.M. Natraj, appearing for the government, to leave the “larger” issue of what led to income criterion of Rs. 8 lakh for the Constitution Bench. Mr. Natraj said the three-judge Bench should confine itself to the limited problem of whether or not to stay the July 29 notification. “What is being referred to a larger Bench is the validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment, we are here confronted with the implementation of that Amendment… No, no Mr. Natraj, you have to tell us what exercise was done before Rs. 8 lakh was decided as the cut-off,” Justice Chandrachud said firmly. The Bench, also comprising Justices Vikram Nath and B.V. Nagarathna, asked the Centre to file an affidavit explaining the “basis” on which Rs. 8 lakh was arrived at as the economic cut-off to be applied uniformly across the country to identify beneficiaries for reservation under the EWS quota. “Tell us what is the basis of Rs. 8 lakh… You can’t just say it is a matter of policy… What is the indicia of backwardness for EWS which has been applied and what exercise has been done for arriving at this by the government,” Justice Chandrachud asked the government. Mr. Natraj responded that the Union Cabinet had decided on the Rs. 8 lakh criterion “with proper notings and everything”. “But everything has to be approved by the Cabinet. That is the Rules of Business. We are on something more fundamental… like what was the study done? You have to demonstrate what is the data before you, who carried out the study, what were the contemporaneous statistics which the government had borne in mind while deciding on Rs. 8 lakh as cut-off to be applied for EWS quota uniformly…” Justice Chandrachud said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-questions-income-limit-for-ews-quota/article36889727.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,||IIT-M study finds Cauvery in distress||A study done by researchers of the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras(IIT-M) has found that contaminants, including pharmaceutically active compounds, personal care products, plastics, flame retardants, heavy metals and pesticides, pollute the Cauvery. This underscores the need to regularly monitor the river and its tributaries for pharmaceutical contamination, the researchers said. The contamination is particularly serious because India is the second largest pharmaceutical manufacturer. Drug compounds, when released into waterbodies even in minuscule amounts, can harm human beings and the ecosystem in the long term, the researchers said, calling for upgrading wastewater treatment systems. The study also highlighted the need to assess the long-term impact of such contamination on human health and the ecosystem. The study was carried out with funding from the Water Technology Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and the Natural Environment Research Council in the U.K. The findings were published in an international peer-reviewed journal. A team of researchers from the IIT, led by Ligy Philip, who is the Nita and KG Ganapathi Institute Chair Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, quantified the seasonal distribution of emerging contaminants and pollutants in the Cauvery. The researchers monitored the water quality for two years to assess the seasonal variation of emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceutically active compounds. The team collected water samples from 22 locations along the entire stretch. The quality of water in the catchments was also monitored. It found that water quality and the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants were influenced by the monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/iit-m-study-finds-cauvery-in-distress/article36889795.ece

Sivankutty informed the State Assembly on Thursday. Replying to questions pertaining to reopening of schools against the backdrop of COVID-19, Mr. Sivankutty said the midday meals would be supplied by strictly adhering to the COVID-19 protocols. Panels to be set up Committees will be formed for supporting schools for arranging the meals with the help of Parent-Teacher Associations (PTA), people’s organisations and local bodies. The meals will be supplied depending on the situation in each school, he said. The State Government is well prepared for the reopening of schools after a long pandemic-induced hiatus. In the first two weeks, classes will be held till noon, including Saturdays. Each student batch will have classes consecutively for three days. Only 25% of the students in each class will be required to attend school if the strength of the school is 1,000 or above. As much as 93.9% of the teaching and non-teaching staff have received either both doses of the vaccine or the first jab.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/students-to-get-midday-meals/article36890070.ece

08 October 2021||Bengaluru,||I-T searches on contractors||Income Tax officials on Thursday launched massive search operations on alleged undisclosed income of Irrigation and Public Works contractors and a close aide of BJP leader and former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and his family. Coming just ahead of the bypolls to Hangal and Sindgi, it set off political speculation. The aide, an employee of BMTC, continues to be in the Chief Minister’s secretariat “on deputation”. While Mr. Yediyurappa refused to link the searches to politics or his family, some within the party fuelled the speculation. A.H. Vishwanath, BJP MLC, who had alleged fraud in awarding works worth Rs. 20,000 crore during the tenure of Mr. Yediyurappa, said it was testimony to the corruption that prevailed during Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure. Though nearly 30 contractors, including half a dozen big contractors, were covered in search operations, the search on the residential premises of Umesh, bus conductor/driver turned close associate of the Lingayat strongman, has gathered much attention. Mr. Umesh worked with BJP MLC Ayanur Manjunath, Mr. Yediyurappa’s sons Shivamogga MP B.Y. Raghavendra and party vice-president B.Y.

08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Intolerance and vandalism in Afghanistan of concern: India||Reports of intolerance and vandalism raise concerns across the world and in India, said a senior official here on Thursday. Addressing the weekly press briefing, Official Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the international community continued to insist that the Taliban should fulfil the goals outlined in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593, which expects the Taliban to form an inclusive government and foster freedom and diversity. “I would like to begin with UNSC Resolution 2593. This articulates and guides the collective approach of the global community towards Afghanistan. The resolution talks of ensuring that the Afghan territory is not used for terrorist acts, it talks of safe passage of Afghans and foreign nationals. The reports...of vandalism and intolerance obviously raise concerns, not just for us but across the world and it is important that the international community continues to insist on fulfilment of the goals outlined in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593,” said Mr. Bagchi in response to a question that asked for India’s response to reports of vandalism in a Sikh place of worship in Kabul. A team of Taliban vigilantes entered the main gurdwara of Kabul and removed CCTV cameras on Tuesday. They also detained the local guards of the shrine for some time. The reports from Kabul coincided with the news that Anas Haqqani, of Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network visited the tomb of Mahmoud of Ghazni who had invaded India and plundered the Somnath temple multiple times in the early medieval era. Mr /Haqqani had praised the Sultan for setting up an Islamic rule in the region. In response, Mr Bagchi reiterated that the the UNSC Resolution 2593 has asked Afghanistan to be shaped as a country that respects minorities and women. India continues to maintain ambiguity towards the Taliban and has not yet responded to the Taliban’s communication to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to restart air services to Kabul. Mr. Bagchi said there is no update yet on the request. “It’s a complicated and sensitive matter,” he said, explaining that the air service could not be dealt with separately from ties between India and Afghanistan. India had not been able to fly evacuation flights since the situation in the capital city of Afghanistan became unstable in late August. Many Sikh and Hindu citizens of Afghanistan remain in Kabul and other Afghan cities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/intolerance-and-vandalism-in-afghanistan-of-concern-india/article36889321.ece

The commission will complete its probe in two months. On Monday, a judicial probe was promised by the Yogi Adityanath Government to the families of the four farmers who were killed after they refused to cremate the bodies and parked them in glass enclosures at the site of the incident in Tikonia.

Police teams visited the site of the incident along with forensic teams and recovered two cartridges of a .315 bore firearm. The site was also searched with a metal detector on Thursday. The exact sequence of how the other four were killed is still unresolved.

We have to work together to ensure that COVID-19 doesn’t spread and peak again,” said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. “Citizens should not let their guard down as the COVID numbers could see an uptick in November and December due to the festive season in case we are not careful. The second wave of COVID-19 is not over, and the situation is plateauing with the country still reporting as high as 20,000 new infections daily,” he said. “We cannot take the current stable situation for granted. We have to be mindful of the fact that the pandemic is going on and can take an untoward turn if we are not careful,” Mr. Agarwal said. The Health Ministry said that Kerala continued to report 50% of the total COVID-19 cases in the country currently. The State has over 1 lakh active cases, and the number in four other States ranges between 10,000 and 50,000. Also, five States — Mizoram, Kerala, Sikkim, Manipur and Meghalaya — are reporting a weekly positivity rate of over 5%. Thirty-four districts across nine States and Union Territories are reporting a weekly positivity rate of more than 10%, according to the Health Ministry. Staying prepared Speaking about the country’s preparedness to tackle any upcoming surge, V.K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, said that 8.36 lakh hospital beds are currently available for COVID-19 patients, in addition to nearly 1 million isolation beds in dedicated care centres. He added that 4.86 lakh oxygen-supported beds and 1.35 lakh ICU beds are available. “We are prepared to face a daily surge of 4.5-5 lakh COVID-19 cases,” Dr. Paul said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/second-wave-not-over-health-ministry/article36889661.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maneka, Varun out of BJP national executive||Lok Sabha members Maneka Gandhi and her son, Varun Gandhi, were dropped from the BJP’s national executive, while Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Jyotiraditya Scindia were among those inducted into the 80-member decision-making body of the party that was announced on Thursday. The list was announced hours after Mr. Gandhi said via a tweet in the morning that the video of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, where a group of farmers was on Sunday allegedly mowed down by cars in Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra’s convoy, was “crystal clear”. “...Protesters cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer,” he tweeted. Seeks action On Monday, Mr. Gandhi wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath seeking action in the matter. BJP president J.P. Nadda appointed the 80 members, which included Prime Minister Narendra Modi; senior leaders L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi; and former party presidents and current Union Ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari. In a statement, the party said 50 special invitees and 179 permanent invitees, including Chief Ministers, Deputy Chief Ministers, national spokespersons, presidents of national wings and State unit leadership, would be part of the national executive committee. Meeting on Nov. 7? Since Mr. Nadda took over as party president in January 2020, this was the first appointment of the national executive by him. According to sources, a meeting of the national executive, which was last held in 2019 during Mr. Shah’s tenure as party president, could be held on November 7. Among those dropped from the nation executive were former Union Ministers Mahesh Sharma, Vijay Goel and C.P. Thakur; current Union Ministers Rao Inderjit Singh, Ashwani Kumar Choubey and Prahlad Singh Patel; and Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy. Some new entrants to the party had been included in the national executive, including Mr. Scindia and Dinesh Trivedi, a former Trinamool Congress MP who had joined the BJP in the run-up to the West Bengal Assembly election earlier this year. Prominent BJP campaigners and candidates in the Bengal election, including actor Mithun Chakraborty and Swapan Dasgupta, MP, had also been included in the national executive. Union Ministers G. Kishan Reddy, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Hardeep Singh Puri, V. Muraleedharan, Bhupender Yadav, Anurag Thakur, Meenakshi Lekhi and S. Jaishankar were also among those in the national executive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maneka-varun-out-of-bjp-national-executive/article36889334.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Girls can take RIMC test in Dec.||The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed girls to appear in the entrance examination scheduled for December 2021 for admission to the Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC). The exam is taken for entry to Class 8 at the RIMC. A Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul did not agree with the government’s proposal to allow girls to sit for the exam next June rather than on December 18, 2021. “Is it necessary to deny girls the opportunity to take part in the examination scheduled on December 18, 2021,” the court asked the government. It reasoned that if the government had not shied away from admitting girls into elite military institutions for a career in the armed forces, it should not have problems in making the necessary preparations for having them write the entrance exam in December 2021 itself. “The respondent [government] has walked a mile and should walk a step ahead,” Justice Kaul observed in the order. The court reasoned that if girls were allowed to take the exam in December, their intake into the RIMC would be in next June. On the other hand, the government’s proposal in an affidavit to have the girls skip the December exam and appear in the June exam would delay the actual entry of successful candidates into the RIMC to January 2023. ‘Advertise in two days’ The court said the government needed only to modify the entrance exam notification, without changing any of the dates, to inform that girls would be allowed to take the exam in December. It ordered the government to issue the advertisement within two days. Referring to an affidavit of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) detailing a two-phase plan authorising additional vacancies, along with other associated infrastructure and administrative support for girl students in the RIMC and Rashtriya Military Schools (RMS), the court asked whether it could not be “paced up to increase the number of entry of girls”. The hearing on Thursday served as a sequel to a September 22 hearing by the same Bench, which had pushed the armed forces to live up to its reputation as “the best response team we have” to stand up to an emergency, iron out creases and make history happen by allowing women to write the National Defence Academy (NDA) entrance exam in November 2021. Additional Solicitor-General Aishwarya Bhati said the government was not “running away” from its obligations to allow girls entry into the RIMC. “Initially, yes, there was some reluctance, but with My Lords’ advice we are going ahead with it. We are not shying away.” The military establishment was only seeking some time, she said. The process of intake into the RMS would begin with the academic session 2022-23, the court said, scheduling the case next to January 18, 2022. As per the proposed plan of the MoD, for entry into the RIMC in the first phase, the maximum capacity of students will be increased from 250 to 300 incrementally by inducting five girls for six months, and in Phase 2, the capacity will be increased from 300 to 350 to induct 10 girls every six months. At the end of this expansion, the RIMC will have 250 boys and 100 girls. The RIMC is located in Dehradun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/girls-can-write-military-college-exam-in-dec/article36889668.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cut fuel prices on all days of Navaratri, says Congress||In a unique form of protest against the Rs. 15 increase in the retail price of cooking gas, Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba on Thursday “worshipped” an empty cooking gas cylinder soon after addressing a press conference at the party headquarters on the issue of rising prices of LPG and other petroleum products. On Thursday, the retail prices touched a record high — a litre of petrol reached Rs. 103.24 in Delhi and Rs. 109.25 in Mumbai. In addition, a non-subsidised LPG cylinder in Delhi now costs Rs. 899.50. ‘Increased nine times’ At the press meet, Ms. Lamba demanded that the Union Government continuously reduce the prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol on all the nine days of Navaratri. The Congress spokesperson said petrol and diesel prices had been increased nine times between September 24 and October 7. “Since one woke up to the news of a Rs. 15 hike in LPG cylinders on the first day of Navaratri, I would request Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the price be reduced for all the days of Navaratri,” she said. Senior leader Digvijaya Singh, who heads a party panel on planning agitations, took to Twitter to target the government over the price rise. “Petrol and diesel prices continue to rise. Modi-Shah Government is taking money out of the pockets of the general public and filling their own treasury, only to further spend it on big corporate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cut-fuel-prices-on-all-days-of-navaratri-says-congress/article36889325.ece
08 October 2021||Kolkata,||Speaker approaches SC against HC order on Roy||West Bengal Assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee has approached the Supreme Court against the Calcutta High Court order on the disqualification of Mukul Roy. Mr. Roy, who was elected on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket in the Assembly election in May, rejoined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in June. He was later appointed Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, a post usually reserved for an Opposition legislator. The BJP approached the Speaker seeking Mr. Roy’s disqualification under the anti-defection law. Later, party leaders approached the High Court on the issue and the court directed the Speaker to decide on the disqualification by October 7. The court pointed out that in case the Speaker was unable to decide on the matter, it would take a call on the disqualification of Mr. Roy. On Thursday, when the matter came before the court, Advocate-General S.N. Mookerjee said the Speaker had moved the Supreme Court against the High Court order. The development in the case would have a bearing on the fate of legislators who had joined the ruling TMC after being elected from the Opposition parties. Since May 2021, four BJP legislators have switched sides and joined the TMC. Scores of legislators from the Opposition parties joined the party between 2011 and 2021 and not a single one of them has been disqualified for defection. Narada case hearing In another development, the High Court gave exemption to officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate from appearing before the Speaker in connection with the Narada case. The Speaker had summoned the officials on the ground that his permission was not taken before charge sheets were filed against the members of the House. The Central agencies had filed charge sheets against MLAs, including a few Ministers, in the Narada case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/speaker-approaches-sc-against-hc-order-on-roy/article36889327.ece
08 October 2021||LUCKNOW,||Ajay Mishra no stranger to controversies||The mowing down of farmers in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, in which his son, Ashish Mishra, is accused of murder, is not the first burning controversy in the life of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra. Before he entered State-level electoral politics, Mr. Mishra was in 2000 accused of murdering a youth leader of the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Tikonia. A local sessions court acquitted Mr. Mishra and three others in March 2004 in the murder case of Prabhat Gupta, alias Raju. A criminal appeal filed by Prabhat’s brother, Rajeev Gupta, is pending before the Allahabad High Court, which had in March 2018 reserved the judgment in the appeal. But since it could not be delivered later that year, Prabhat’s family prayed for it to be heard again. The last hearing in the case was on February 5, 2019. “If justice was prompt, then justice would not have deviated somewhere,” Mr. Rajeev, who was still pursuing the legal case, told The Hindu . On September 7, a month before the incident in Tikonia in which eight persons were killed, a Division Bench of Justices Rajan Roy and Suresh Kumar Gupta directed the Uttar Pradesh Government to submit a report and restore the security that was earlier granted to Mr. Rajeev till it disposed the writ petition filed by him, which was kept pending. Mr. Rajeev had approached the court alleging that he had faced a threat to his life, submitting that the accused in the murder case of his brother was not just an MP but also a Minister in the Government of India. Mr. Rajeev was the pairokar of one of the witnesses in the case, Sanjeev Gupta, who was also his brother. Mr. Rajeev had told the court that the district authorities in Kheri did not pay heed to his request for providing security and that he did not expect fair play as the accused was an influential Minister, according to the High Court’s order. Though the lower court acquitted Mr. Mishra, who was a vice-president of a district cooperative bank at the time the allegation against him was made, Mr. Rajeev maintained his charge 21 years after his brother was shot dead on July 8, and also claimed that there were several attempts made during this period to deter him from fighting the case. “My father died fighting the case. My brother was shot in his temple. Why else would we fight this case till today,” said Mr. Rajeev, who was now associated with Shivpal Yadav’s party. According to the FIR lodged in 2000 and the revision petition filed by his father, Santosh Gupta, in 2004 in the Allahabad High Court, it was alleged that Prabhat and Mr. Mishra had a rivalry over a recently held panchayat election. On July 8, 2000, when Prabhat was going to his shop from his house, he was fired at on his temple and between his chest and abdomen. Prabhat fell on the ground and died, said the revision petition. The family accused Mr. Mishra and three others. On October 5, while answering questions on his past record, Mr. Mishra said, “All cases against me had concluded in my favour.” He said the cases lodged against him in the past were “fake” and attempts to implicate him had “failed”. The local police had once also opened a history sheet in his name, but it was later quashed. On September 25, while warning protesting farmers to “mend themselves” or else he would not take more than two minutes to mend them himself, Mr. Mishra had also reminded them of his record before he was elected a public representative and added that he did “not run from any challenge”. It was this statement that allegedly triggered the protests by farmers on October 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ajay-mishra-no-stranger-to-controversies/article36889336.ece
08 October 2021||Chennai,||IIT-M study finds Cauvery affected by contamination||A study done by researchers of the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) has found that contaminants, including pharmaceutically active compounds, personal care products, plastics, flame retardants, heavy metals and pesticides, pollute the Cauvery. This underscores the need to regularly monitor the river and its tributaries for pharmaceutical contamination, the researchers said. The contamination is particularly serious because India is the second largest pharmaceutical manufacturer. Drug compounds, when released into waterbodies even in minuscule amounts, can harm human beings and the ecosystem in the long term, the researchers said, calling for upgrading wastewater treatment systems. The study also highlighted the need to assess the long-term impact of such contamination on human health and the ecosystem. The study was carried out with funding from the Water Technology Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and the Natural Environment Research Council in the U.K. The findings were published in an international peer-reviewed journal. A team of researchers from the IIT, led by Ligy Philip, who is the Nita and KG Ganapathi Institute Chair Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, quantified the seasonal distribution of emerging contaminants and pollutants in the Cauvery. The researchers monitored the water quality for two years to assess the seasonal variation of emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceutically active compounds. The team collected water samples from 22 locations along the entire stretch. The quality of water in the catchments was also monitored. It found that water quality and the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants were influenced by the monsoon. The levels were high after monsoon owing to the reduced riverine flow and continuous waste discharge.  The team’s risk assessment had shown that pharmaceutical contaminants pose medium-to-high risk to select aquatic life forms of the riverine system Researchers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pharma-waste-contaminates-cauvery-says-iit-m-study/article36889854.ece
08 October 2021||New Delhi,||No favouritism in admissions, says DU||As students from across the country knock on the doors of Delhi University (DU) for admission into its various undergraduate programmes, the university, in the absence of an entrance exam, is facing a challenge in admitting students from various school Boards solely based on cut-off percentages. Colleges such as Shri Ram College of Commerce, Ramjas College, Hindu College and Hansraj College that released a 100% cut-off for admission to some of its courses have seen general category seats fill up as students from the Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education have secured many of the seats with a best-four subjects’ score of 100%. The high number of candidates with a score of 100% coming from the Kerala Board have seen some student groups on the DU campuses start a protest demanding that the university bring about a “moderation” process to ensure that candidates from all Boards have an equal opportunity to secure admission at the university. “DU is bound to admit students satisfying all the eligibility criteria. It is a matter of shame that applicants are being discriminated against based on their Board,” said Akhil K.M. of the Student Federation of India, Delhi University.. Siddharth Yadav from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), which has been protesting at the admission office of the university, says that his organisation is demanding a process of “moderation” so that there is no regional skew in admissions. Cut-off lists The university said that in the first cut-off list, 60,904 candidates had applied. Of them, 46,054 were from the Central Board of Secondary Education. Delhi University Registrar Vikas Gupta said that as on Thursday, 31,172 candidates from the CBSE; 2,365 from the Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education; 1,540 from the Board of School Education, Haryana; 1,429 from the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations; and 1,301 candidates from the Board of Secondary Education Rajasthan, in addition to other State Boards, had successfully secured their admissions. The university added that being a prestigious Central University, it was its utmost responsibility to maintain justice and equity among all meritorious candidates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-favouritism-in-admissions-says-du/article36889666.ece

The auction was scheduled to end on Thursday, however, there were still some items out of the 1,348 mementos that were yet to be sold. A Culture Ministry official said bidding on some items was on as of Thursday night, but bidding on most items, including the sports gear used by Olympic and Paralympic athletes, had been closed in the evening.

08 October 2021||Ghaziabad,||RLD promises to put more money in farmers’ pockets||Launching Rashtriya Lok Dal’s election campaign for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections, party president Jayant Chaudhary on Thursday promised farmers of the State to double the amount they receive under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. “Farmers and labour should have the first right on the resources of the State. For beneficiaries of PM Samman scheme, the State will contribute Rs. 6,000 to be paid in one instalment on December 23, the birthday of Chaudhary Charan Singh.” Unlike the Centre’s scheme which pays Rs. 6,000 to eligible farmers in three instalments, Mr. Chaudhary said his party had created a separate category for small farmers on unirrigated lands. “Under the Chaudhary Charan Singh Krishak Samman scheme, they will receive Rs. 9,000 over and above the amount they get under the PM Samman scheme.” Launching the month-long Aashirwad Path from Noorpur (Hapur), the birthplace of former Prime Minister Charan Singh, and Khair (Aligarh), Mr. Chaudhary said the present schemes were not enough to help farmers lead a life of samman (dignity). “The government takes back double the amount it doles out by raising electricity and diesel prices,” he said. Taking on the government on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, Mr. Chaudhary said the present dispensation didn’t want to bow before the public, even after making mistakes. “When the PM visited Lucknow, we expected him to go to Lakhimpur Kheri also. When the Home Minister summoned his deputy to Delhi, we thought he would be shunted out but now it seems he has been allowed to brazen it out,” said Mr. Chaudhary. Recounting his experience of visiting Lakhimpur Kheri, Mr. Chaudhary, who was the first head of a notable political party to reach the district, said the incident was an eye-opener for farmer friends who supported the BJP. “The families of those mowed down are looking for your support in their fight against injustice.” He spelt out the names of four farmers and a journalist who lost their lives in the incident and urged the crowd not to forget them. Mr. Chaudhary said he had to change vehicles and routes to trick the police. “How could sharing the grief of a farmer whose 18-year-old son lost his life make me a law and order threat?” he asked. “The son of another deceased Nachhatar Singh is a constable in Seema Suraksha Bal. It pains me that such people are being dubbed as terrorists by a section of the media,” he added||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rld-promises-to-put-more-money-in-farmers-pockets/article36889911.ece
08 October 2021||kolkata,||Calcutta HC eases entry of visitors to Durga Puja pandals||The Calcutta High Court on Thursday modified its earlier orders restricting entry of visitors to Durga Puja pandals in view of improvement in COVID-19 situation and permitted all activities and rituals like 'anjali', 'arati', 'sindur khela' inside the marquees. The court made it clear that the relaxation will be subject to the maximum number of persons, which is allowed inside a puja pandal, and compliance with other conditions such as double vaccination and wearing of masks. Modifying earlier orders, a Division Bench comprising Justices I.P. Mukerji and Aniruddha Roy directed that with the said conditions being followed, “all activities and puja rituals like Anjali, Arati, Sindur Khela etc. are permitted inside the pandal”. The high court had in October 2020 ordered that in case of smaller pujas, a list for people entering the pandal each day of the four-day festival may include up to 20 names, but not more than 15 people in case of smaller pujas should get access to the pandals at any given point of time. It had directed that for the larger pujas, the charts may include up to 60 names, but at no point of time should the number of persons present within the pandals or the covered area be more than 45. In a petition seeking similar curbs for this year also in view of the Covid, the high court had on October 1 this year directed that restrictions imposed last year would apply during this year's Durga Puja celebrations as well. A plea to review the order was moved on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/calcutta-hc-eases-entry-of-visitors-to-durga-puja-pandals/article36890091.ece

In another development, the second meeting of the India-U.K. Joint Working Group (JWG) on cyber capacity-building was held on Thursday through videoconferencing. Separately, the Army said, the sixth edition of the India-U.K. joint company-level military training, Exercise Ajeya Warrior, had commenced at Chaubatia, Uttarakhand, and would culminate on October 20. On the naval exercise, a defence official observed that it was scheduled to be held in October third week, for which the modalities were being worked out. The triservice components were being finalised. U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to visit India coinciding with the exercise, it has been learnt. In July, India and the U.K. participated in a two-day bilateral Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with the Royal Navy Carrier Strike Group (CSG-21), led by HMS Queen Elizabeth , in the Bay of Bengal as the carrier was passing through. India and the U.K. are also in talks for a bilateral logistics support agreement.

08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm unions to meet today on U.P. violence||Amid growing frustration that the prime accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri case has still not been arrested four days after the incident, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) platform of protesting farm unions will hold its general body meeting at the Singhu border on Friday to decide on the next course of action. “October 12 is the antim ardaas [final rites] day for the martyrs of Lakhimpur Kheri. Unless our demands are met, unless the Minister of State Ajay Mishra is sacked and his son arrested, we will not hesitate to give a call for a major morcha to ensure justice for farmers. The specifics of the action will be decided on Friday,” said Abhimanyu Kohar, an SKM leader who belongs to the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh. Wider impact Apart from seeking justice for the Lakhimpur victims, farmer leaders were also preparing to discuss the wider impact of the incident on the movement. “This could be seen as a turning point for the struggle, just like the police killings of farmers at Mandsaur in M.P. in 2017,” said another leader. The immediate agenda of the meeting would be the deadline for arrests and the resignation of Mr. Mishra. “The fact that the police allowed the prime accused to go missing, and the fact that all of this is happening in the immediate family of a Minister for Home Affairs is unbelievable, and reflects the state of law and order in Uttar Pradesh and the country,” said a SKM statement. At the national level, farmer leaders dismissed the idea that Bharatiya Kisan Union leader (BKU) Rakesh Tikait, who was the face of the movement in western Uttar Pradesh, had accepted a weak compromise by allowing the angry crowds at Lakhimpur to disperse before arrests were made. “Tikait spoke on behalf of the SKM, and gave a deadline for action to be taken. We will not accept anything less than our demands. This propaganda pitting Tikait against Punjab leaders is the lies of the BJP trying to create a split on regional and communal lines,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the BKU’s Dakaunda faction. The SKM said the Uttar Pradesh Government’s decision to set up a one-member judicial commission consisting of a retired judge of the Allahabad High Court “does not inspire confidence”, and reiterated its demand for an inquiry headed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court into not just the incident itself, but the motives. It noted that the State Government’s notification, issued just before the Supreme Court’s suo motu hearing, did not mention the earlier threat issued by Mr. Mishra or mandate an inquiry into whether the incident was pre-planned with the aim of intimidating and quelling protesters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-unions-to-meet-today-on-up-violence/article36889338.ece

Meanwhile, NCP chief Sharad Pawar hit out at the I-T searches, remarking that the action reeked of “excessive use of power” and said that they were perhaps a reaction to his strong comments on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh, which he had likened to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Meanwhile, a press note issued by the I-T Department said that the total illicit transactions detected during the searches amounted to Rs. 1,050 crore. As per the note, authorities had “carried out a search operation that commenced since September 23 on a big syndicate involving certain businessmen/middlemen in Maharashtra and some persons holding public offices.” The release claimed that intelligence on this was developed over a six-month period. “In all, 25 residential and 15 office premises were covered under the search, while four offices were covered under survey,” said the note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-t-dept-officials-search-office-of-ajit-pawars-son/article36889329.ece

The three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud did not agree with the suggestion from Additional Solicitor General K.M. Natraj, appearing for the government, to leave the “larger” issue of what led to income criterion of Rs. 8 lakh for the Constitution Bench. Mr. Natraj said the three-judge Bench should confine itself to the limited problem of whether or not to stay the July 29 notification. “What is being referred to a larger Bench is the validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment, we are here confronted with the implementation of that Amendment… No, no Mr. Natraj, you have to tell us what exercise was done before Rs. 8 lakh was decided as the cut-off,” Justice Chandrachud said firmly. The Bench, also comprising Justices Vikram Nath and B.V. Nagarathna, asked the Centre to file an affidavit explaining the “basis” on which Rs. 8 lakh was arrived at as the economic cut-off to be applied uniformly across the country to identify beneficiaries for reservation under the EWS quota. “Tell us what is the basis of Rs. 8 lakh… You can’t just say it is a matter of policy… What is the indicia of backwardness for EWS which has been applied and what exercise has been done for arriving at this by the government,” Justice Chandrachud asked the government side. Mr. Natraj responded that the Union Cabinet had decided on the Rs. 8 lakh criterion “with proper notings and everything”. “But everything has to be approved by the Cabinet. That is the Rules of Business. We are on something more fundamental… like what was the study done? You have to demonstrate what is the data before you, who carried out the study, what were the contemporaneous statistics which the government had borne in mind while deciding on Rs. 8 lakh as cut-off to be applied for EWS quota uniformly…” Justice Chandrachud said. The Bench said even the 103rd Amendment had said “each State will define economic backwardness with reference to income”. The court said it had been left to each State. Nuanced analysis “Can you say Rs. 8 lakh everywhere qualifies as EWS or is there a need to have a more nuanced analysis to EWS of having different yardsticks to different parts of the country based on cost of living, HRA, etc,” Justice Chandrachud asked the government. Mr. Natraj conceded that economic parameters could change even within a single State. Earning capacity might differ from town to town within a State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-questions-income-limit-for-ews-quota/article36889330.ece

They were accompanied by Muslim colleagues. Several shops owned by members of minority communities also closed before the sunset in parts of Srinagar. “There is a deep sense of insecurity amongst the minority in Valley at the moment. Received frantic calls, fear in the voice sent shivers down my spine,” Peoples Democratic Party’s leader Mohit Bhan, a Kashmiri Pandit, said. A TRF spokesman, in a statement issued online, said, “Shaheed Gazi Squad carried out the attack. These teachers had on August 15 harassed and warned parents with dire consequences if any student did not attend the August 15 function. We want to make it crystal clear that outsider domicile holders, stooges and collaborators, whatsoever their religion, won’t be spared”. Director General of Police Dilbag Singh, who visited the spot, said, “This is an attempt to defame local Muslims of Kashmir. Killing innocent civilians, including teachers, is a move to attack and damage the age-old tradition of communal harmony and brotherhood in Kashmir. The police have got some clues and leads about the killers in the previous cases. The police will nab the killers very soon.” Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, who chaired a meeting of security officials, said, “The attacks are a part of a conspiracy in the backdrop of increasing tourist influx and planned industrial investment in Kashmir. A befitting reply will be given to the attackers. A befitting reply will be given to the perpetrators. The terrorists and their patrons will not succeed in disturbing peace, progress and prosperity of J&K.” J&K political parties and religious bodies condemned the growing incidents of civilian killings. Kashmir’s grand mufti Nasir-ul-Islam termed the killings “unfortunate”. “No religion allows the killing of innocent civilians. No one will be allowed to harm the communal fabric of Kashmir, which is intact since past so many decades,” he said. Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti said, “Disturbing to see the deteriorating situation in Kashmir, where a minuscule minority is the latest target. GOI [Government of India]’s claims of building a ‘Naya Kashmir’ has actually turned it into a hellhole.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/principal-teacher-shot-dead-in-srinagar-school/article36889331.ece

Mr. Gurnah left Africa as a refugee in the 1960s amid the persecution of citizens of Arab origin under President Abeid Karume’s regime in Zanzibar where he grew up, when the peaceful liberation from British colonial rule led to a revolution. He was only able to return to Zanzibar in 1984, allowing him to see his father shortly before his death. “I think its just brilliant and wonderful,” Mr. Gurnah told Reuters when asked how he felt to win the prize. “It’s just great – its just a big prize, and such a huge list of wonderful writers – I am still taking it in,” he said. “It was such a complete surprise that I really had to wait until I heard it announced before I could believe it.” Though Swahili was his first language, English became Mr. Gurnah’s literary tool when he began writing as a 21-year-old. He has drawn inspiration from Arabic and Persian poetry as well as the Koran, but the English-language tradition, from William Shakespeare to V. S. Naipaul, would especially mark his work, the Swedish Academy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tanzanian-novelist-wins-nobel-prize/article36889332.ece

The announcement was made as part of the revised British policy regarding international travel to the U.K. which will be continuously reviewed by health officials in London to track spike in cases of COVID-19 abroad. “No quarantine for Indian travellers to UK fully vaccinated with Covishield or another U.K.-approved vaccine from 11 October. Thanks to (the) Indian government for close cooperation over last month,” said High Commissioner Alex Ellis in an official announcement on social media. The development came hours after the Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi reiterated that the British travel restrictions on vaccinated Indian travellers are “discriminatory”. Deadlock resolved In a counter measure, India had imposed new travel restrictions requiring 10-day mandatory quarantine on U.K. passport holders, that came into effect on October 4. Both sides however maintained that talks were under way to resolve the deadlock over the U.K.’s disinclination to recognise vaccination certificates from India. The new notification that will come into effect on October 11 will reduce the Red List of the U.K. to seven countries, further opening up the British economy for global business and tourism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uk-to-drop-10-day-quarantine-for-indians/article36889715.ece

According to the agency, the funds in question involved the cash paid by bureaucrats for key postings under a certain Ministry and the cash transferred by the contractors for getting payments released. The I-T department has not disclosed the names of the individuals concerned. The operation was launched on September 23, based on the intelligence developed over the past six months. The agency covered 25 residential and 15 office premises. Surveys were also carried out at four offices. “Some suites in Oberoi Hotel in Mumbai, permanently rented by two of the middlemen and used for meeting their clients, were also subjected to searches. The syndicate, consisting of businessmen, middlemen, associates and persons holding public offices, used various code names in their records and, in one case, had backdated records by 10 years,” said the agency. The middlemen provided end-to-end services to corporates and entrepreneurs from land allotment to getting all governmental clearances. They also used angadiyas (couriers) for transferring funds. The seized documents included a summary of overall cash generated and disbursed, giving the particulars of the amounts received and receivable, each being more than Rs. 200 crore. A major part of the collected cash had been distributed among various persons. Some of the suspects had their own real estate and construction businesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-t-raid-detects-rs-1050-cr-transactions-in-maharashtra/article36889910.ece

A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said the petition might not be “judicially manageable” as it treads into the domain of policy of the Executive and the Reserve Bank of India. The court, however, allowed Dr. Swamy to make a representation before the RBI which may consider whether any of its guidelines need modification. “How can we frame guidelines for the ever-rising NPAs. RBI has issued guidelines from time to time. It is not possible for the court to tread into the domain of the Executive,” the court said. Dr. Swamy had urged the court to constitute a committee for framing guidelines to control the rise of NPAs. However, Justice Vikram Nath on the Bench, along with Justice B.V. Nagarathna, said the Union of India does anyway issue guidelines on the issue from time to time. Dr. Swamy said these guidelines does not bar the court from constituting a committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-not-to-intervene-in-plea-on-npas/article36889322.ece

The appointment is significant because it was speculated that the party may offer the post of AICC’s Gujarat in-charge to former Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Sachin Pilot and “accommodate” him. However, sources close to Mr. Pilot indicated that the former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister was reluctant to move out of his home State. Dr. Sharma’s appointment also comes ahead of the impending Cabinet reshuffling in the Ashok Gehlot government, in which some Ministers are expected to be dropped to accommodate Mr. Pilot’s loyalists.

08 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Upcoming bypolls a semi-final’||The growing differences between allies Janata Dal (United) and the BJP will force snap polls in Bihar, and the upcoming bypolls for two seats in the State are “merely the semi-final”, Lok Janshakti Party (Ramvilas) leader Chirag Paswan said at a press conference in Delhi. Mr. Paswan was addressing his first press conference after the Election Commission of India (ECI) formalised the LJP’s split. Mr. Paswan’s faction was now known as the Lok Janshakti Party-Ramvilas (LJP-R), and his uncle Pashupati Nath Paras’s faction was now called Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP). “Tell me one major policy decision on which JD(U) is ready to support the BJP? Wasn’t Nitish Kumar standing against the CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] and the NRC [National Register of Citizens]? And now what is happening on the caste census? How long can the two continue with such deep differences? Their differences will certainly lead to midterm elections,” Mr. Paswan said. The LJP(R) was contesting both the Bihar Assembly seats, Tarapur and Kusheshwarsthan, where bpolls were scheduled for October 30. The seat fell vacant because of the death of sitting JD(U) legislators. The LJP was a poor third in 2020 Assembly election in both these constituencies. ‘Both constituencies’ Mr. Paswan on Thursday said his party would win both the constituencies. The RLJP is not contesting these elections. “The 2020 mandate was definitely not for Nitish Kumar. Bihar voters hate Nitish Kumar and his way of governance via select bureaucrats. And I am a 100% sure that in both the seats, the JD(U) will not only lose, it will also be a distant third,” Mr. Paswan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-jdu-differences-will-force-snap-polls-in-bihar/article36889341.ece

08 October 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||I-T searches on aide of ex-CM trigger speculation||Income Tax officials on Thursday launched massive search operations on alleged undisclosed income of Irrigation and Public Works contractors and a close aide of BJP leader and former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and his family. Coming just ahead of the bypolls to Hangal and Sindgi, it set off political speculation. The aide, an employee of BMTC, continues to be in the Chief Minister’s secretariat “on deputation”. While Mr. Yediyurappa refused to link the searches to politics or his family, some within the party fuelled the speculation. A.H. Vishwanath, BJP MLC, who had alleged fraud in awarding works worth Rs. 20,000 crore during the tenure of Mr. Yediyurappa, said it was testimony to the corruption that prevailed during Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure. Though nearly 30 contractors, including half a dozen big contractors, were covered in search operations, the search on the residential premises of Umesh, bus conductor/driver turned close associate of the Lingayat strongman, has gathered much attention. Mr. Umesh worked with BJP MLC Ayanur Manjunath, Mr. Yediyurappa’s sons Shivamogga MP B.Y. Raghavendra and party vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra in the past. The searches are being conducted in Bengaluru, Bagalkot, and Bidar among other places. A few contractors are said to be linked to politicians in North Karnataka. According to sources, the searches are being conducted over contracts for canal, road, and bridge works, besides an airport contract given during Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure. The role that Mr. Umesh played in securing the tenders for the contractors and their associates is under the radar. “Though I-T searches on contractors are common, Mr. Umesh has emerged to be the focus of attention,” sources said. However, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “I-T searches keep happening. It will not have any impact on the bypolls,” he said, acknowledging that Mr. Umesh had worked with him when he was the Chief Minister. Mr. Raghavendra also acknowledged that he had worked with the family. “The I-T officials have just done their duty,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Vishwanath, who is at loggerheads with Mr. Yediyurappa over being denied Cabinet berth, claimed in Mysuru that I-T searches were in connection with illegalities in awarding tenders worth Rs. 20,000 crore. He claimed that Mr. Yediyurappa had to surrender his post because of such alleged corruption. Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said, “The searches on the aide of Mr. Yediyurappa could be linked to internal affairs of BJP. It could be to keep the leader under the party’s control.”  (With inputs from Hassan and Mysuru)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-t-searches-on-aide-of-ex-cm-trigger-speculation/article36889677.ece

The semi cryo-liquid oxygen (LOX) tank — the first developmental welded hardware — is a part of the SC120 stage intended for payload enhancement by replacing the L110 stage in existing Mk-III launch vehicle, said a release from HAL. Last year, HAL had delivered the biggest ever cryogenic liquid hydrogen tank (C32-LH2), four meters in diameter and eight meters in length, much ahead of contractual schedule. The propellant tank was handed over by M.K. Mishra, General Manager, Aerospace Division, HAL, to T.K.B. Kumaresh Babu, General Manager, LHWC, head of the resident team of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, ISRO. Till date, HAL’s Aerospace Division has delivered 244 propellant tanks and 95 water tanks to ISRO for the space programmes of PSLV, GSLV Mk-II and GSLV Mk-III of diameter 2.1, 2.8 and 4 meters, where the length of the tank varies from 2.5 meters to 8.0 meters. As a strategic reliable partner, HAL has been associating with ISRO for India’s prestigious space programmes for five decades. HAL has delivered critical structures, tankages, satellite structures for the PSLV, GSLV-Mk II and GSLV-Mk III launch vehicles. Various new projects are being taken up at HAL, for which installation and commissioning of unique infrastructure is nearing completion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hal-delivers-heaviest-propellent-tank-to-isro/article36889673.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Pending flood mitigation schemes may get a new lease of life||Come monsoon, several localities prone to flooding in the city’s western and northern parts may just escape inundation. A few long pending schemes may get a new lease of life as the Water Resources Department has proposed to bridge the missing links in surplus courses between waterbodies. The department plans to form a new channel to link surplus water from Paruthipattu lake, near Avadi, to the waterbody at Ayapakkam. Efforts are already on by the Highways Department to construct a drain along Poonamallee-Avadi High Road for about 600 m. An official of the WRD said, “The lake does not have a defined surplus course. This leads to waterlogging every time it fills up. We plan to form a new channel near Vasantham Nagar to carry 600 cubic feet per second (cusecs) of floodwater and connect it to the existing open channel that drains into the Ayappakkam Lake.” Widening the channel Similarly, inundation in localities around the Porur Lake was one of the major challenges. The width of the 1.5-km surplus course was inadequate and possessed missing links. The Rs. 30-crore project, which has been pending, is expected to be implemented by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Officials said besides the widening of the existing channel, a cut-and-cover drain would be created to carry about 1,000 cusecs of floodwater till the Manapakkam Channel and then to Adyar river. Once the work is completed, areas like Iyyapanthangal, Gerugambakkam, Srinivasapuram and Moulivakkam may get relief from chronic waterlogging. G. Natarajan, president, Mangala Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, said the obstructions in all minor channels around the Porur Lake should be removed. Desilting of the waterbody and widening and forming of new channels should be expedited, he added. The department plans to reinitiate projects to provide a permanent solution to inundation in Korattur and Madhavaram. These have remained on paper owing to land acquisition issues and challenges of urbanisation. The surplus channel from Korattur Lake to Retteri would need to be widened up to 40 m. “We need to discharge nearly 1,300 cusecs of floodwater to prevent spillover in neighbouring areas. A new channel will be constructed near Chennai Bypass Road after acquiring land as per the Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition Laws (Revival of Operation, Amendment and Validation) Act, 2019,” an official said. Another major project to bridge the gaps in the surplus course between Retteri and the reservoir at Red Hills has remained a non-starter for over two decades due to problems with land acquisition and compensation. “As there is no proper channel, surplus water from one of the weirs of Retteri flooded various areas, including Balaji Nagar and Arignar Anna Nagar. We plan to form an 80- m wide open channel and link it to the Red Hills reservoir surplus course, near Vadaperumbakkam. This new channel, that can carry up to 3,000 cusecs, would also take the flow from the Thanikachalam Nagar drain,” the official added. The projects in Korattur and Retteri are estimated to cost Rs. 120 crore and 80%-90% of the cost would go towards land acquisition. The WRD is waiting for funds for the projects, which are expected to be kick-started by January next year. It will implement temporary measures to control flooding and clean up minor channels in vulnerable areas this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pending-flood-mitigation-schemes-may-get-a-new-lease-of-life/article36889836.ece

On Friday, officials of the TNPCB and the Corporation will participate in a meeting to finalise strategies to promote cloth bags and paper bags. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the Corporation would have the TNPCB’s complete support. “Principal Secretary Supriya Sahu is conducting a series of meetings with the Plastic Manufacturers’ Association, asking them to seek out alternatives. We are also encouraging cloth bag manufacturers. We are putting constant pressure. The method is more persuasion than fining. We will ensure that society itself is involved in the entire process,” he said. Residents’ cooperation “The Corporation will take steps to ensure that traders do not sell their products in single-use plastic bags and instead encourage residents to either collect their goods in cloth or paper bags. This is because the disposal of plastics is a big environmental hazard,” Mr. Bedi said. On Thursday, Corporation officials conducted a raid in Pondy Bazaar and seized three bundles of banned plastic products. During the period between August 19 and October 6, the Corporation had seized 2.82 tonnes of banned plastics and imposed a fine of Rs. 6.92 lakh. The civic body has inspected 7,328 commercial establishments and seized plastic products during the period. Inspections will be intensified to persuade traders to stop using single-use plastics.  Issues pertaining to manufacturing of affordable cloth and paper bags are expected to be discussed at the meeting. The civic body will ensure that good quality cloth bags and paper bags are sold at affordable prices in the market, as an alternative to banned plastic bags.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-strategies-planned-to-rid-the-city-of-single-use-plastics-corpn/article36889820.ece

Findings released On Thursday, the Directorate released the findings of a re-survey. “Five districts in each upper/lower limit are resurveyed as a measure of reconfirmation. Our results are in confirmation with the latest Indian Council of Medical Research survey,” said T. S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. The seropositivity of Virudhunagar, which remained on top of the chart, rose from 84% to 88% following the re-survey. Tenkasi came in second with a seroprevalence of 83%, which was previously 78%. Chennai’s seropositivity remained unchanged at 82%. Madurai and Theni had a seropositivity of 79% and 76% respectively. Up in western districts In fact, the seroprevalence went up in some western districts that previously had the lowest levels. The seropositivity of Erode, which earlier found itself at the bottom of the table with 37%, rose to 70%, while Coimbatore had 71% (previously 43%) and Tiruppur had 70% (previously 46%). Officials attributed the increase to the exposure to infection and the ramping up of vaccination. Four districts reported a seropositivity of less than 60% — Perambalur (58%), Ariyalur (56%), the Nilgiris (55%) and Karur (51%). “We are moving towards a safer zone. The ongoing rapid vaccination through mega camps is helping us in moving fast,” Dr. Selvavinayagam said. Earlier, the State-wide serosurveys conducted by the Directorate found a seropositivity of 32% during October/November 2020 and 29% in April 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tns-overall-seroprevalence-is-70/article36889856.ece

08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||People gear up to travel during holidays||People in the city have begun planning for a four-day holiday at places such as Kolli Hills and Kashmir, by the end of next week. In the last few weeks, the number of enquiries for travel, both domestic and international, has touched nearly 50% of the pre COVID-19 levels, says travel and tourism experts. For couples planning for a honeymoon or an international holiday, Maldives seems to be a favourite destination, S. Jeyasekaran of Travel Agents Association of India says. “For three nights and four days, they have to shell out anywhere between Rs. 90,000 to a lakh and I see many of them are preferring this holiday spot. There are also a few who are travelling to Sri Lanka too. For those who want a beach holiday but can’t spend close to a lakh, then Andaman and Nicobar Islands is where they head to, as this will cost them close to Rs. 35,000 including air fare,” he adds. Up north, quite a lot of them want to fly to Kashmir, Leh and Ladakh next weekend or sometime this month before the peak winter sets in, he adds. Closer home, in the south, for those who are wary of taking flights but want to drive down with family for those four days, a host of options are present, says travel agents. Since far too many have to been to Puducherry and Mamallapuram, those travelling with friends or family or going trekking, want to explore new places, Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels says. “Apart from Yercaud and Yelagiri, Kolli Hills where people can visit waterfalls, Kotagiri for tea estate and Kodanad view point will be a nice option for a short stay. Valparai too has good hotels, and some beautiful place for those leisure stay,” he adds. Trekking enthusiasts have already made plans for this long weekend, Ronald Rajesh of Chennai Adventure Club says. “We are almost sold out for those four days. The places we will be covering include Parambikulam, Valparai, Masinagudi and Kotagiri. Those looking to go trekking can also explore Jawadhu Hills, Kalvarayan Hills and Yelagiri,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-gear-up-to-travel-during-holidays/article36889830.ece
08 October 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Businessman gets 2-year jail for fraudulent sale of land||A special court in Egmore has convicted and sentenced a businessman to two years’ imprisonment for selling 1.2 acres of land belonging to a partnership firm in Tiruvottiyur, by fraudulent means, 24 years ago. According to the prosecution, Sunil Kumar M. Thapadia, a native of Maharashtra and resident of Tiruvottiyur, was a partner of Sugenchand and Company. The firm owned 1.21 acres of land on the Tiruvottiyur High Road. Between October and November 1994, Mr. Kumar entered into an agreement with Nathmal Jain, another businessman, for the sale of the land, and registered general power of attorney in Jain’s favour. He also received a demand draft for Rs. 5.25 lakh. In 1995, Mr. Kumar cancelled the agreement and issued a public notice on the same. However, Jain entered into a criminal conspiracy with two other accused, R. Ulaganathan and E. Manoharan, with criminal intention to cheat Mr. Kumar. In 1997, the accused forged a general power of attorney as if it was executed by Mr. Kumar, in favour of Jain, with forged signatures. They sold the land to several people for Rs. 89.85 lakh, and executed sale deeds to them at the Sub-Registrar Office in north Chennai in 1997, said the prosecution. The VII Metropolitan Magistrate Court ordered an investigation by the Central Crime Branch (CCB), following a private complaint by Mr. Kumar. A charge sheet was filed by the CCB in 2001, and the case was transferred to the special court for CCB cases in Egmore in 2016. During the trial, both Ulaganathan and Manoharan died, and hence the charges against them abated. At the conclusion of the trial, Metropolitan Magistrate P. Nagarajan convicted Mr. Jain on charges, including criminal conspiracy and cheating by impersonation. Jain will have to undergo two years’ imprisonment, besides paying a fine of Rs. 9,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/businessman-gets-2-year-jail-for-fraudulent-sale-of-land/article36889860.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fire breaks out at shop in Tondiarpet||Fire and Rescue Services personnel on Wednesday extinguished a fire that broke out in a shop in Tondiarpet in an operation that lasted several hours. The fire broke out in the shop in Parameshwaran Nagar on Ennore High Road late on Wednesday. At 11.30 p.m., firefighters from Tondiarpet, Mint, Royapuram, Korukkupet and Esplanade were pressed into service. Police personnel used a public address system to ask nearby residents to come out of their houses. Since an underground oil pipeline passes near the accident spot, over 20 tanker lorries were used to drain oil from a nearby terminal to avoid further damage. A senior officer from Fire and Rescue Services said, “The fire broke out in the shop storing highly inflammable materials like paint and thinner. We used foam and water to bring the fire under control and put it out by morning.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fire-breaks-out-at-shop-in-tondiarpet/article36889822.ece

Subramanian said all minor deficiencies, pointed out by inspection teams, in the colleges in Namakkal, Ramanathapuram, Tiruppur and Tiruvallur had been rectified in the last 10 days. Recently, the Union Health Ministry had granted permission to admit 150 students each to medical colleges in Virudhunagar, Kallakurichi and the Nilgiris, and 100 each to the ones in Namakkal, Ramanathapuram, Tiruppur and Tiruvallur. He said the minor deficiencies pointed out in medical colleges in Dindigul, Krishnagiri, Nagapattinam and Ariyalur had also been rectified. “The Director of Medical Education is in Delhi with the reports. He will be meeting officials of the Union government to urge them to grant approval for the remaining seats that have been kept pending due to minor deficiencies. He will seek re-inspections for the colleges in Dindigul, Krishnagiri, Nagapattinam and Ariyalur,” he told reporters at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) on Thursday. He said under PM-CARES, PSA (pressure swing absorption) oxygen-generator plants had been sanctioned for 70 places in Tamil Nadu. The two plants set up at RGGGH were inaugurated by the Prime Minister on Thursday. He said the plants had a capacity to produce 64,900 l of oxygen a second. He criticised AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam for his statement that X-ray results were provided on paper instead of films at the Government Hospital, Kovilpatti, due to shortage of funds. The Minister clarified that providing results on films had been stopped at all places, and results were being shared digitally with the respective doctors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minor-deficiencies-in-new-medical-colleges-rectified/article36889842.ece

As many as 1,390 people tested positive on Thursday, taking the State’s tally to 26,74,233. Chennai continued to report the most number of cases at 173. Coimbatore followed with 145 cases, while there were 107 cases in Chengalpattu. In Erode, 85 people tested positive, while Thanjavur recorded 76 infections.

At present, the State has 16,513 active cases, of which Chennai accounts for 1,865 and Coimbatore 1,755. A total of 1,45,846 samples were tested, taking the total count to 4,80,36,604. Vaccination coverage Tamil Nadu’s vaccination coverage crossed five crore on Thursday. As of today, 5,01,30,323 people have received vaccines in government and private centres, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said after inspecting the State Vaccine Store. While 3,73,18,608 people have got the first dose (64%), 1,28,11,715 have got both doses (22%), the Minister said. The State currently has 50.12 lakh doses of vaccines in hand. If nearly six lakh people are inoculated in the next three days, around 44 lakh doses will be available for the fifth mega drive scheduled to be held on Sunday, he said. A total of 30,000 camps are being planned as part of the mega drive. He added that as per the third serosurvey, seroprevalence was over 80% in three districts — Virudhunagar, Tenkasi and Chennai — and less than 60% in Perambalur, Ariyalur, the Nilgiris and Karur. So, more vaccine doses have been allocated to the four districts to improve coverage, he said, according to a press release. During the day, 1,27,480 people were vaccinated. Among them, 79,349 people were in the 18-44 age group and 36,046 were aged 45 to 59.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-vaccination-coverage-crosses-5-crore-mark/article36889844.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Elevated level of HbA1c may be normal in older people: study||A pan-India study has found that high HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) levels may be normal in older people. The aim of the study, led by V. Mohan and his team of doctors from Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) and Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, was to check if HbA1C — a test of three months control of diabetes — increased with age even among individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). They obtained data on glycaemic parameters of different age groups — in adults aged 20 and above — from the Indian Council of Medical Research - India Diabetes study (ICMR-INDIAB). The researchers assessed the age-wise distribution of HbA1c among individuals with NGT confirmed by an oral glucose tolerance testing using the World Health Organisation criteria. The results were validated in another epidemiological study — CURES study — conducted in Chennai, according to a press release. The report was published in Acta Diabetologica, a journal that publishes reports of experimental and clinical research on diabetes mellitus and related metabolic disease. Dr. Mohan, chairman and consultant diabetologist, Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Research Centre and founder of MDRF, said advancing age was associated with increased prevalence of many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. “However, one needs to be careful while diagnosing type 2 diabetes in the elderly as many of them may have physiological changes in their ability to regulate blood glucose, implying that marginally elevated HbA1C levels need not always be indicative of pathology as it could be a normal age-related change in this population,” he said in the release. The researchers said that HbA1c levels increased steadily with age, he said. “This suggests that age-specific cut-offs should be used while utilising HbA1c to diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetes to minimise the risk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary initiation of treatment in elderly people who could have serious side effects if over treated,” he said. In INDIAB study, there was a 0.08% increase in HbA1c for every decadal increase in age. This increase was more significant in women — 0.10% in women versus 0.06% in men, and in the urban population. R.M. Anjana, vice-president of MDRF, said the conclusion from this study was that a HbA1c of 6.5% that would be considered as diabetes could be normal value in some older people. Laboratory should report age-adjusted normal values for all their lab tests, the study pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elevated-level-of-hba1c-may-be-normal-in-older-people-says-study/article36889858.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Those who enjoy urban life cannot oppose compost yards in parks, says HC||People who have benefitted over the years by the rapid strides made on the economic front and enjoyed the fruits of its boom by migrating to the urban and semi-urban areas have a duty towards addressing civic problems. They cannot object the establishment of micro-compost yards in public parks, when solid waste management (SWM) has become a global concern, the Madras High Court said on Thursday. A Full Bench of Justices R. Mahadevan, V. Parthiban and P.T. Asha said: “When every citizen is a waste generator, he/she cannot expect his/her waste to go somewhere else… The right to disown the waste generated by every citizen is no more available and such luxury is not to be made available any more in this era… Decentralisation of processing of waste is a civic imperative due to the alarming shrinkage of urban space.” Authoring the verdict for the Bench, Justice Parthiban wrote: “... whole-hearted participation of all citizens will only make the solid waste-management policy successful.” The first Division Bench, led by Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee, had referred the case to a Full Bench (comprising three judges) for an authoritative pronouncement. ‘Faulty implementation’ After analysing the issue threadbare, the Full Bench, in its 390-page judgment, concurred with the apprehensions of resident welfare associations that there was always the possibility of parks or play areas sliding and degenerating into squalid places if micro compost yards were not maintained properly. There would always be issues in the implementation of the SWM policy, they said. However, the visionary and futuristic policy could not be discarded apprehending faulty implementation, the Bench added. It directed the government to constitute committees at the State, district, municipal and panchayat levels, including local residents to ensure the proper upkeep and maintenance of the compost yards. The committees must be empowered to intervene and take remedial action, the Bench said. The judges directed the government to issue a comprehensive circular, incorporating all guidelines for the effective functioning of the committees and the sincere implementation of SWM Rules, 2016.

Annamalai said there would be intensified protests against the State government if it did not roll back in 10 days its decision to keep temples and other places of worship closed between Fridays and Sundays. Mr. Annamalai led a protest on Thursday outside the Kalikambal temple in the Harbour constituency. “They are trying to push their ideology into people’s personal space and our sacred temples in the name of COVID-19 control,” he said. The BJP leader said the Union government’s directive on keeping places of worship shut was only an advisory, and not an order. Mr. Stalin, when in the Opposition, had said that once the DMK comes to power, the government would frame its own COVID-19 rules and not be bound by the Union government’s directive. Mr. Annamalai said his party would approach the Madras High Court, seeking that a sitting Supreme Court or High Court judge oversees the process of the proposal to convert temple gold into gold bars, while saying that the State government cannot take such decisions. “Who makes that decision [to convert the gold into gold bars]? The trustees. Not the Chief Minister sitting in Fort St. George,” he said. He said as per the law that governed the HR&CE Department, the government had no control over the supervision of the daily running of temples. “There is a specific section that talks about touching temples’ gold,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reopen-temples-in-10-days-or-face-protests-bjp/article36889852.ece

The Water Resources Department (WRD) has chalked out the project to protect the waterbody from garbage dumping and encroachments. Earlier, residents of Kundrathur and Iyyapanthangal had complained about garbage being dumped in the lake. WRD officials said the boundary wall would be built for a length of 6-7 km similar to the one built along Cooum river, with gaps to allow inflow of floodwater into the lake. About 100 encroachments have been identified around the lake, and the process to resettle and rehabilitate them is under way. “We are following up with local authorities in Kundrathur to set up a treatment facility and plug sewage outfalls flowing into the lake through the Thanthikal Channel,” an official said. Residents demanded that the encroachments in the inlet channels be removed ahead of the northeast monsoon. G. Beem Rao, former Maduravoyal MLA and president of the Porur Lake Protection Committee, recalled his demand at the State Assembly to develop the lake as an eco-tourism spot with boating. Moreover, dedicated personnel should be deployed to monitor the lake and its channels. Local revenue authorities should take responsibility for fresh encroachments, Mr. Beem Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wrd-plans-to-build-a-wall-around-porur-lake/article36889833.ece

He said it should be done as early as possible since there were not many experts in the field of lexicography. In a letter to Tamil Development Minister Thangam Thennarasu, the MP said it should be done when the lexicographers were in good health. Pointing out that seven volumes were published between 1924 and 1939 under the editorship of S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, Mr. Ravikumar said the new project could not be implemented after release of two volumes because of funds crunch. “It will cost only Rs. 25 lakh per year and the amount is negligible when compared to the value it added to the language,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villupuram-mp-presses-for-tamil-lexicon-project/article36889857.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Govt. indulging in intimidatory tactics’||The AIADMK on Thursday accused the DMK government of creating obstacles for its workers carrying out the work for the rural local bodies elections. In a statement, AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami said the police had filed false cases against their party workers. At several places, the police were “intimidating” and “preventing” AIADMK members from doing the election work, they said. The two leaders called upon police officers to refrain themselves from such actions and urged the State Election Commission to ensure that the remaining phase of the elections is free and fair. In a separate statement, Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami, separately, flagged the issues of farmers such as difficulties in procurement and the reported shortage of urea. Moisture content Mr. Panneerselvam referred to the need for procurement of paddy having a moisture content of up to 22%, while Mr. Palaniswami complained that the DMK government had neither kept the required stock of fertiliser in advance nor distributed it to the districts that needed it. The former said it was the demand of farmers that the State Government procure the paddy ahead of getting the approval from the Union Government for increasing the moisture content to 22% from the permissible 17%. He sought the intervention of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-indulging-in-intimidatory-tactics/article36889846.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Shift statues to ‘leaders’ parks’, orders HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to identify suitable land to establish “leaders’ parks” in as many locations as required in Tamil Nadu. The court ordered that statues that pose a hindrance to traffic on public roads be shifted to such parks. Justice S.M. Subramaniam said the exercise of identifying land and statues that need to be relocated should be completed in six months. The cost of maintaining the statues in the parks must be borne by those who had obtained permissions to erect them in public places, he ordered. If such individuals or organisations refuse to pay maintenance costs, money should be recovered from them by invoking the Tamil Nadu Revenue Recovery Act, 1864. Further, only authorised statues must be relocated, and others should be dealt in accordance with law, he said. Petitioner’s case The orders were passed while disposing of a writ petition filed by advocate M. Veeraraghavan in 2014. The petitioner had challenged a notice issued by the then Arakkonam tahsildar to remove a statue of B.R. Ambedkar, which had been installed on government land without permission. In his verdict, the judge disapproved of the practice of belittling national leaders by identifying them with their caste or community. “Under no circumstances, can leaders be identified with their communities. Those leaders would have never thought of such ideas,” the judge said. The common man The judge went on to write in the verdict: “Common people are witnessing riots and law and order issues due to statues of leaders. Birth and death anniversaries of the leaders are celebrated in such a manner that it bothers people who wish to lead their lives in a peaceful manner.” Observing that it was the duty of the government to ensure peace at all times, the judge said unfortunately, parties in power often ended up erecting and maintaining statues of the leaders of their choice and neglect others, much to the chagrin of others. Stating that the common man gets frustrated due to such activities and violence due to the desecration of statues, the judge said the best way forward was to establish parks to educate people about national leaders and confine the statues to such parks. The parks might also attract tourists, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shift-statues-to-leaders-parks-orders-hc/article36889848.ece

Pointing out that the siting of the AFR was in violation of the Supreme Court’s directions, which had said that spent nuclear fuel should not be permanently stored within the Kudankulam site, he said the Union government was yet to evolve a plan for setting up a deep geological repository (DGR), as per the Court’s directions even after years.

08 October 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Improve cotton productivity and quality, says Union Minister||Textile sector stakeholders should work together to improve the quality and productivity of cotton in the country so that yield and profit margins improve for the farmers even as the prices remain competitive, said Union Minister for Commerce & Industry, Consumer Affairs & Food & Public Distribution and Textiles Piyush Goyal. Speaking at a virtual conference on “Cotton: Moving Beyond the Conventional Paradigms”, organised on Thursday by the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI), the Minister said cotton brings vibrancy, value and variety to textile production. It is sustainable for the ecology and economy. The Indian cotton sector supports 65 lakh farmers and lakhs of people in the allied sectors. The government has taken several steps in the recent months for the textile and apparel sector. India is now a net exporter of cotton. But, “We have to make rapid strides to improve quality and productivity (of cotton),” he said. The Kasturi Cotton brand has started getting global recognition. The world average yield is 757 kg per hectare and India should look at 800 kg per hectare. The trash content in Indian cotton is also 1.5 % to 3 % whereas trash content in the imported cotton is less than 1 %. So, the quality and productivity improvement in cotton requires focus so that cotton prices remain reasonable and competitive and farmers also benefit. The industry should work together to implement sustainable ways in cotton farming. Organic cotton has huge potential and “we should look for global dominance in this,” he said. The webinar was organised to coincide with the Global Cotton Day, Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav and CITI CDRA Golden Jubilee celebrations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/improve-cotton-productivity-and-quality/article36889871.ece

08 October 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||Tomato price shoots up to Rs. 30 per kg||Following drop in the arrival of tomato to the Nethaji Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market, the wholesale price of tomato has increased to Rs. 30 a kg while the vegetable is sold between Rs. 35 a kg to Rs. 45 a kg in retail. On an average 5,000 boxes, each weighing 15 kg, arrive from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Talavadi to the wholesale market in the city. Due to an increase in production, the wholesale price of tomatoes was more than Rs. 15 a kg in the past two months. After the start of the rainy season in the past three weeks, the arrival of tomatoes to the market dropped significantly leading to sharp increase in the price. Traders said that continuous rain had damaged the crops in the past one week leading to drop in arrival to the market. “The wholesale price was around Rs. 10 a kg last month. But now we sell it for Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 a kg”, they added. Traders said that it is normal that the price of tomato and other vegetables will shoot up in October and November as rain affect the crops. Many traders said that the quality of tomato is also poor due to rain and they expect the same in the coming weeks. In retail, fine quality tomatoes are being sold above Rs. 35 a kg while second quality tomatoes are sold at Rs. 25 a kg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tomato-price-shoots-up-to-rs-30-per-kg/article36889982.ece

Prabu Shankar has announced a prize scheme for those taking the jab. Washing machine, grinder, mixer grinder and pressure cooker are among the prizes lined up for the people. The district administration, which has taken a number of steps to accelerate the vaccination drive, has planned to conduct a mega drive on Sunday. To make it a grand success, Mr. Shankar said that prizes would be given to those getting vaccination on that day. The winners would be selected on a lot system. Washing machine would be the first prize. The second prize winner would get a grinder and the third prize would get a mixer grinder. Twenty-five persons would get pressure cookers. There are also 100 consolation prizes. Enumerators had been appointed to carry out door-to-door verification in different parts of the district to find out those who failed to get vaccinated in the earlier drives. They had been asked to bring as many persons as possible to the vaccination centres on Sunday. They would get an incentive of Rs. 5 per head. Moreover, the names of efficient enumerators would also be included in the prize scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/go-for-the-jab-take-home-a-washing-machine/article36889949.ece
08 October 2021||KASARAGOD,TAMIL NADU||‘Genetic proof for domestication of sheep’||Researchers at the Central University of Kerala (CUK) have found that domestication of sheep had taken place in the Indian subcontinent, especially in Indus Valley civilisation regions in the 6th or 7th millennium BC. The study, led by M. Nagarajan, Assistant Professor, Department of Genomic Science, CUK, found genetic evidence that sheep had been domesticated in the region in contrast to the general belief that they were domesticated then in West Asia alone, and that they had arrived in the Indian subcontinent through migration. Even though India ranks second in terms of sheep population, represented by as many as 44 well-described breeds, genetic diversity and phylogeography of Indian sheep breeds remained poorly understood, particularly the south Indian breed, Dr. Nagarajan told The Hindu . However, the study provided strong genetic evidence that the Indian subcontinent was one of the domestication centres of the lineage A sheep. When DNA sequences were compared with other breeds across the world, it was found that the Indian sheep haplotypes were unique and highly diverse. The high genetic diversity and statistical analysis suggest that sheep was domesticated in the country. “We are proposing that wild Sheep, O. vignei blanfordi in Mehrgarh [Pakistan], may be a potential progenitor of domestic sheep lineage, and detailed genome sequencing of this wild sheep may further contribute to our understanding of the genetics of domestic sheep,” said Dr. Nagarajan. He added that the study also found that the introduction of sheep ‘lineage B’ into the Indian subcontinent had been through sea route, and not from the Mongolian plateau, as proposed by researchers in China. Researchers also retrieved the mitochondrial DNA sequences of another 11 breeds for analysis, which further strengthened their study, Dr. Nagarajan added. He said among the south Indian breeds, except for Mandya, all others, notably Bellary, Coimbatore, Hassan, Katchaikatty Black, Nilgri, Ramnad White, and Vembur, were fully encompassed with lineage A, while Kenguri Kilakarsal, Madras Red, Mecheri, and Tiruchy Black breeds, had very low occurrences of lineage B mitochondria. In contrast, a majority of sheep belonging to Mandya and Sonadi breeds carried a relatively high frequency of lineage B. “Our study will be useful in understanding the history of agriculture in Indus Valley Civilisation,” Dr. Nagarajan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/genetic-proof-for-domestication-of-sheep/article36889678.ece
08 October 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||Kerala HC flays practice of nokkukooli||The Kerala High Court on Thursday lashed out again at the practice of demanding ‘nokkukooli’ by headload workers in the State. Justice Devan Ramachandran orally observed that he was disappointed that the practice still persisted despite a ban on such practice and repeated directives by the High Court. The court said it did not want to hear the word nokkukooli any more. The use of the word should be discontinued. The court added that investors were scared to invest in the State because of the militant trade unionism. Such a situation should be changed. If an employer did not engage a headload worker, he/she was supposed to approach the competent authorities under the Kerala Head Load Workers Act instead of resorting to violence. VSSC cargo issue The court reiterated its earlier observation that the obstruction caused by the headload workers to the unloading of materials at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram, had affected the collective reputation of the State. The court observed that nokkukooli still prevailed in the State and strong action should be taken against those who demanded it, irrespective of the colour of the party or union to which they belonged. The court made these observations when a petition by a hotel owner in Kollam seeking police protection for unloading building materials came up for hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-hc-flays-practice-of-nokkukooli/article36889679.ece

Radhakrishnan. He was addressing a protest organised by the party near Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple seeking permission for devotees to offer prayers in temples on all days of the week. Mr. Radhakrishnan said that fake secularism was being followed in Tamil Nadu. He appealed to Chief Minister M. K. Stalin to allow devotees in to temples on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. “The DMK should not commit a sin by denying Hindus their right to worship in temples,” he said. Taking credit of India coming out with COVID-19 vaccine and also exporting the same to other countries, he said that protecting human rights was also important along with saving human lives during the pandemic. Mr. Radhakrishnan said the DMK government should be thrown out for not respecting the sentiments of the people. The DMK was involved in anti-Hindu activities, he said. Party leaders P. Saravanan Mahalakshmi, K. K. Srinivasan, Maha.

08 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Case against former SPP||Vigilance and Anti-Corruption, Madurai, has registered a case against former Special Public Prosecutor P. Seetharaman, following an inquiry into allegations of having amassed wealth by misusing his position as a public servant. Vigilance officials said that he had acquired properties both movable and pecuniary resources and unlawfully enriched himself during his tenure as Special Public Prosecutor to the extent of Rs. 27,96,690 suspected to be disproportionate to his known source of income. He was appointed as Special Public Prosecutor (Bail) Essential Commodities and Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act Court in 2017. P. Seetharaman’s service was terminated in 2020 following the allegations. It was said that he failed to file the final reports before the special court within the mandatory period of 180 days and had allowed numerous accused in the Essential Commodities and Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act cases to be released on statutory bail. It was also said that he would receive a huge amount from these accused to not file the final report in the case before the special court. The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in 2020 had restrained him from continuing in the post and ordered a DVAC inquiry. Vigilance officials said that there were prima facie materials on record for taking up the case for investigation under the relevant Sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. An FIR was submitted to the Special Court for trial of cases under Prevention of Corruption Act, Madurai. A copy of the FIR was sent to the Superintendent of Police, Southern Range, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption for issuing authorisation to take up the investigation in the case and collect materials in the case.

08 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Two new PSA oxygen generator plants at GRH||District Collector S Aneesh Sekhar along with Member of Parliament Su Venkatesan inaugurated two pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generator plants at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on Thursday morning. The two 1,000 litres per minute (LPM) capacity plants are part of the series of PSA Oxygen Plants established in every State and UT under the PM CARES Fund. Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated 35 of them at a function in AIIMS, Rishikesh today. Synchronising with the main event, the Madurai units, located in the Speciality Block were launched. GRH Dean Dr. A. Rathinavel, Head of Anaesthesia, Dr. M. Kalyana Sundaram, who is the Nodal Officer for the Oxygen plants and MLAs Ko Thalapathi and P. Moorthi were also present at the inauguration ceremony. The two new oxygen generator plants will augment the availability of oxygen supply at GRH to 6,200 LPM capacity now. The hospital also has 20,000 litres of liquid oxygen tank available. “We do not expect any shortage of oxygen supply at the hospital for COVID-19 patients in future,” Dr. Sundaram said. The usage of PSA plants for medical need arose after the second wave of COVID-19 when the demand for oxyen-supported beds peaked and the supply fell short because during that time, the hospital was dependent only on liquid oxygen supply. Between June and now, the GRH has established two PSA generators in the old building, and three each near the trauma centre and the speciality block. Of varying capacities, from 200 LPM to 1,000 LPM, the plants have been sponsored by various associations and philanthropists. Three more are in the pipeline at it’s Thoppur centre, Dr. Sundaram said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-new-psa-oxygen-generator-plants-at-grh/article36890328.ece
08 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Passenger service resumes on Madurai-Rameswaram section||Even as Southern Railway has introduced unreserved express special train between Madurai and Rameswaram from Thursday, rail users want the railways to restore the two other passenger trains that were suspended. All three pair of passenger train services that were suspended in March 2020 were not restored for long. Following demand for resuming passenger train services between the two pilgrimage centres, the Southern Railway on Thursday introduced it as an unreserved express with Train No. 06654 Rameswaram - Madurai express special train leaving Rameswaram at 5.40 a.m. and reaching Madurai at 9.30 a.m. In the return direction, Train No. 06655 Madurai - Rameswaram express special train leaves Madurai at 6.10 p.m. and reaches Rameswaram at 10.05 p.m. “The train stops at all regular stoppages of the passenger train. However, the only difference is that of the fare,” said S. R. Senthilkumar, a regular train user from Paramakudi. “The fare between Paramakudi and Madurai was only Rs. 20 earlier. Now, it is Rs. 45. This would affect small traders who were heavily dependent on the passenger train services for their trade-related travel,” he said. Mr. Senthilkumar said that the present train timetable suits only those coming towards Madurai for their office, school/colleges and other work. However, those going towards Rameswaram from various stations enroute, are still deprived of the cheap and comfortable mode of transport. B. Jagadeesan, president of Ramanathapuram district Chamber of Commerce, said that even as the demand for additional train services has grown more, the introduction of only one train is a disappointment. “The trains are the most preferred mode of transport for the comfort, cheap fare and safety. Not only children, and the aged, but also patients going to Madurai wait for trains,” he said. It was also convenient for office-goers and students. “The crowd would be so high that even accessing the toilets would become difficult during festivals. We want the officials to restore all the trains and also operate special trains for festivals and holidays,” he said. Additional Divisional Railway Manager, T. Ramesh Babu, said that more trains can be introduced only if the State Government proposes them. The trains will halt at Pamaban, Mandapam, Uchipuli, Ramanathapuram, Sattirakudi, Paramakudi, Sudiyur, Manamadurai, Tiruppachetti, Tiruppuvanam, Silaiman, Madurai East Railway stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/passenger-service-resumes-on-madurai-rameswaram-section/article36890258.ece

Those who can’t afford wedding dresses can approach him and take any item for free. “And they don’t have to return it,” said Mr. Nassar. People from different parts of south India are approaching Mr. Nassar, both for donating their wedding dresses, and for borrowing dresses as well. “It came as a surprise to me when I learnt that most women seldom use their wedding dress after wearing it for a few hours during the function. When I asked them to donate it, the response was tremendous,” said Mr. Nassar. Hundreds have come forward to donate their wedding dress. He now has more than 1,000 dresses in his bank. They include saris, frocks, churidars, suits, and Sherwanis. They cost anywhere between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 50,000. “They don’t look like second-hand,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nassars-dress-bank-brightens-bridal-hopes/article36889682.ece

Speaking after the inauguration of Mysuru Dasara-2021, or the Nada Habba on the premises of Sri Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills, he said Mysuru would be promoted and marketed, keeping Dasara in focus, and tourism activities would be conceptualised on the lines of tourism-centric events at international tourist hotspots like Paris and Rome. A Mysuru tourist circuit would be created in consultation with experts and people engaged in tourism promotion, he said, promising to celebrate next year’s Dasara in a grand manner if the pandemic fades away. This year’s celebrations have been scaled down in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inaugural event was limited to 400 people. Earlier, former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna inaugurated the festivities by lighting the traditional lamp and showering flower petals on the idol of the presiding deity placed in a silver chariot. In his inaugural address, Mr. Krishna urged Mr. Bommai to develop Mysuru as a key tourist destination by creating a package for tourists. “By Dasara 2022, a clear concept on projecting Mysuru and its tourism, focusing on the world famous Dasara, can be worked out. Though I don’t have a clear concept, you and your Cabinet colleagues can work out the concept and implement it by next Dasara,” he told the Chief Minister. He requested the Chief Minister to create a platform for tourists to experience Mysuru Dasara and tourist destinations such as Hampi, Belur, Halebid, Badami, Pattadakal and others. Mr. Krishna cited the example of Singapore which attracts lakhs of international tourists every year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/call-to-develop-tourism-circuit-with-mysuru-as-hub/article36889686.ece
08 October 2021||Palani,TAMIL NADU||Keep temples open on all days: BJP||When the Tamil Nadu government has opened TASMAC outlets and liquor bars in the State, what has prevented the administration from opening temples on all the seven days, asked BJP leaders here on Thursday. Speaking at a protest meeting, the BJP functionaries led by senior leader H. Raja, Minority Wing leader Vellore Ibrahim, women’s wing state president Meenakshi Nitya Sundar and among others, demanded the government to open the temples on all the seven days. The government had ordered closure of all shrines on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays to prevent spread of COVID-19. Moreover, on auspicious days and festivals too, the temples were shut, which had disappointed the Hindus, the speakers said. In his address, Mr Raja said that in many shrines in Palani and Coimbatore region, the HR&CE officials had performed the “balalayam” but had not conducted “kumbhabishekam”. This was wrong as per the sastras. Hence, he urged the State to order the officials to carry out the kumbabishekams without any further delay. Many of the 38,661 temples were crying for proper upkeep. The State, instead of, closing the temples should take tangible steps which would help, keep them clean and live. The actions of the government to close down the temple, under the guise of COVID-19, had come as a big blow to the people. The BJP leaders also condemned the Viduthalai Chiruthai Katchi leader and MP Thol Thirumavalavan for his remarks against Hindu Gods. “Why did he visit Chidambaram temple”, they asked and demanded an explanation from the VCK leaders. Either, he stops making such remarks on his own, or the Hindus may be forced to stage demonstrations against him, they claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/keep-temples-open-on-all-days-bjp/article36889976.ece

08 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Dumping of waste in vacant lands irks Puducherry residents||Even though the garbage management situation has improved considerably over the years in Puducherry town and suburban areas, there still remain pockets across the city where dumping of waste in open places is rampant. Overflowing garbage bins and dumping of waste in vacant land are still prevalent in residential areas in Orleanpet, Kamaraj Nagar, Lawspet and Reddiayarpalayam areas. Ever since the waste bin kept by the municipality was removed, people started throwing waste in vacant spaces around the street corners, residents complain. “The conservancy workers clear the waste in the morning but by evening the land will be filled with garbage making it a perfect ground for street dogs to feed. Dogs from nearby streets come to our place to eat kitchen waste and leftover food items dumped there,” said R. Saroja, of Cholan Nagar. According to Arun, another resident, walking on the stretch has become difficult because of the foul smell emanating from the waste. “The municipality should identify a proper place and keep at least two to three bins for residents to dispose household waste items. Otherwise, people will use even other vacant plots to dump waste,” said Mr. Arun. If the absence of garbage bins was a problem in Cholan Nagar, residents in several parts face difficulties due to improper upkeep of bins. Residents want the municipality to make available more bins and place it in a proper manner so that they could not be displaced by stray animals. “In several places the bins are either not properly fixed on the ground or have been damaged. Stray animals pull the bins down to feed on the garbage. In our area, it has become a frequent problem. People will be forced to throw waste on the ground surrounding the bin,” said R. Jairaman, a resident of Saram. According to him, the best way to avoid such issues was to promote door-to-door garbage collection. “We have certainly come a long way in garbage management. Maybe we have not moved towards source segregation and processing of organic and inorganic waste in a big way but things are much better when compared to how it was five years ago. The government should create a massive awareness so that people segregate garbage at source and promote door-to-door collection,” Mr. Jayaraman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dumping-of-waste-in-vacant-lands-irks-puducherry-residents/article36890205.ece
08 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘DMK, Cong. have no right to question govt.’||The Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have no moral right to question the AINRC-led government on the local bodies poll issue, AIADMK secretary (East) A. Anbalagan has said. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, he said both the parties failed to take any concrete steps to conduct the poll during their last tenure. The Supreme Court had come down heavily on the previous government led by Congress for not holding the civic body polls. The former Chief Minister, V. Narayanasamy, has no right to speak on the polls as he failed to hold the election during his tenure, Mr. Anbalagan said. He also questioned the right of DMK convenor and Opposition leader R. Siva to issue statements on reservation for Backward Classes and Scheduled Tribes in local bodies poll. “Did Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin provide reservation for backward people in the local bodies poll?” the AIADMK leader asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-cong-have-no-right-to-question-govt/article36890207.ece
08 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘SEC, govt. responsible for uncertainty over poll’||Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has held the Puducherry Election Commissioner and the AINRC-led NDA government equally responsible for creating uncertainty over the conduct of the local bodies poll. In a video statement released to the media on Wednesday night, the senior Congress leader said that the State Election Commissioner, Roy P. Thomas, took a “unilateral,” decision to hold the local bodies poll in the Union Territory “without having proper consultation.” Several political parties had raised concerns about holding the poll immediately without rectifying the mistakes in ward allocation, including reserved constituencies, he said. “The Congress president too gave a written complaint on the way certain wards were allocated. But Mr. Thomas did not heed to the advice of the political parties,” the former CM said. The appointment of Mr. Thomas, he said, was itself done in an “illegal” manner by the former Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi. “We (previous Congress government) had challenged his appointment itself. The elected government was overlooked in the process and we questioned the appointment of an Indian Forest Service officer as SEC,” he said. Blaming Chief Minister N. Rangasamy for not making the right intervention in rectifying the anomalies in the poll process, he said though the government cannot interfere in the functioning of the SEC, the administration could intervene if officials erred in their decisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sec-govt-responsible-for-uncertainty-over-poll/article36890201.ece

M. Saleem in a statement on Thursday said the decision was a big blow to the social justice movement. “The government has done injustice to the youth belonging to both the communities by preventing them from getting represented in the local bodies,” he said. The AINRC and the BJP are never interested in providing a decentralised form of government, Mr. Saleem said.

08 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Jipmer opens research unit for clinical trials of new vaccines||Jipmer has established a research unit to undertake clinical trials of new COVID vaccines that are currently in development stage. This project is funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), an arm of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, through its “Mission COVID Suraksha” programme. According to a Jipmer press note, six COVID vaccines have received emergency use authorisation in India. However, there is a clear need to develop more vaccines not only to meet the global supply-demand gap, but also for improved features such as a greater effectiveness, fewer side effects and longer duration of protection. The other attributes researchers are looking for in new versions are the need for fewer doses (i.e. single dose), alternative routes of administration such as nasal spray or drops, and applicability to age groups where the current vaccines have not been shown to be safe and effective. Besides, new vaccines may be required in future if and when new variants of the virus emerge. Thus, efforts to develop new COVID vaccines are going on worldwide, with more than 120 vaccines being in various phases of clinical development. As new vaccines are developed, these will need to undergo clinical trials and the COVID Vaccine Trials Unit at Jipmer will play a role in such development. To ensure that clinical trials on new vaccines can be completed quickly, the unit is preparing an advance contact list of persons who may be interested in participating in clinical trials of new vaccines, the note said. In the nearly two-year period since the COVID pandemic began, the public at large had played a great role by adhering to the social distancing norms and precautions, and also by adopting vaccination in a major way. Interested citizens can help the cause by enrolling as volunteers for upcoming trials on new COVID vaccines. This includes those who have previously had COVID-19 or have already taken one or more doses of COVID vaccines, since some of the trials may include booster doses. Jipmer has posted a confidentiality-guaranteed survey for those interested for more information at https://bit.ly/3kAsD6q In its messaging for likely participants, Jipmer points to the persisting threat of the pandemic to disrupt lives and livelihoods and the opportunity of not needing to be a healthcare worker to fight COVID and instead helping the important cause by volunteering to participate in the vaccine trials. Jipmer is looking for participants residing within a 30-km distance from the campus. Apart from ensuring confidentiality of information shared by volunteers and vouching that it would not be used for any other purpose, the data would be maintained in institutional records for five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jipmer-opens-research-unit-for-clinical-trials-of-new-vaccines/article36889896.ece

08 October 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Damaged service road to be laid in a week||As the dangerously damaged service roads on both sides of the bridge under construction on the Tirunelveli – Thoothukudi National Highway at Pudukottai are causing accidents and altercations – even scuffle at times – steps have been taken to re-lay these roads. Moreover, all the potholes on the Tirunelveli – Thoothukudi four-lane will be closed within a week to make the stretch safer, Project Director, NHAI, Thoothukudi, Shankar, has assured. After the four-lane Tirunelveli – Thoothukudi National Highway was opened for traffic a decade ago, the NHAI decided to construct a bridge at Pudukottai to ensure safety of those who enter this hamlet. Even as construction of this bridge is consuming several months, the service roads laid on both sides of the roads are dangerously damaged and full of potholes to cause accidents everyday. “While the two-wheeler riders fall on the ground due to the deep potholes on these service roads, the car tyres become flat on hitting these pits. We witness at least ten accidents at this danger zone,” a shopkeeper having his shop near the service road says. When a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus was proceeding from Tirunelveli – Thoothukudi a few days ago, the driver of the car following the bus tried to overtake the passenger vehicle even as it was crossing this ‘danger zone’ late in the night. Since there is full of potholes for about a km on both sides of this bridge under construction at Pudukottai and the drivers of all the vehicles crossing this spot have to manoeuvre their vehicles with extreme caution, the TNSTC bus driver could not give way for the car. Agitated over this, the occupants of the car, including an advocate, picked up heated argument with the TNSTC bus driver after the bus reached the depot. In the melee, the driver was assaulted and admitted to the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital. When the TNSTC employees, condemning the attack on their colleague, started flash strike and the passengers waiting for the bus around midnight were left in the lurch. After prolonged talks with the protesting transport workers, the strike was withdrawn. “Even after this incident, the NHAI officials took no step for re-laying the service roads on both sides of the bridge under construction,” says a teashop owner having shop near the service road. Mr. Shankar assured that the contractor had been asked to re-lay the service roads at the earliest to make this zone safer. “Moreover, the potholes on both sides of this stretch between Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi will be plugged soon,” Mr. Shankar promised. When asked about the vehicles with fastag are being allowed via only one counter in the Vaagaikulam toll plaza, Mr. Shankar assured to look into the issue to make all the four counters as ‘fastag counters’. The service roads near the bridge under construction on Tirunelveli – Kanniyakumari National Highway at Ponnaakudi near Palayamkottai is also in the pathetic condition. When this issue was brought to his notice, Project Director, NHAI, Madurai, Mathivanan assured that he would take immediate steps for ensuring motorable the service roads near this bridge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/damaged-service-road-to-be-laid-in-a-week/article36890253.ece

Phanindra Reddy said on Thursday. The State, Mr. Reddy said, had received more than normal rainfall during the South West monsoon and the North East monsoon is also expected to bring in normal average rainfall. Precautionary measures were being taken in view of this and senior IAS officials have been nominated as monitoring officers and they have fanned out to the districts to review the measures. Mr. Reddy, who had been reviewing the monsoon preparedness in the core delta districts over the past two days, said that 98% of the desilting works had been completed in Tiruvarur. In Nagapattinam, 90% of the works had been completed and in Mayiladuthurai 80% work had been executed. The remaining works would be completed within a week, he said speaking to reporters after reviewing the monsoon preparedness in the respective districts. All the 12 cyclone shelters and five multi-purpose disaster relief centres in Nagapattinam district have been inspected to ensure that all necessary basic amenities were available there. This apart, there were 100 community centres, 73 marriage halls and 29 cyclone warning centres in the district. About 130 low lying/vulnerable areas have been identified in the district and contingency plans for evacuation, if necessary, were ready. About 215 women and 2,366 men have been identified as first responders, who would alert the officials in case of emergencies and also coordinate relief and rescue efforts, in the villages in the district. Tiruvarur In Tiruvarur district, 212 low lying areas have been identified. Eight zonal committees, each headed by officers in the rank of sub-collectors, have been constituted.

08 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Polytechnic colleges hit by pandemic-induced factors||Polytechnic colleges are struggling to bring about a momentum in teaching-learning process due to a laid-back attitude of students admitted over the last two years because of the impact caused by COVID-19. The quality of candidates was impacted due to the rather late start of the academic session last year. But this time around, the polytechnic colleges could not admit bright students due to reluctance of the heads of government schools to issue transfer certificates to those who had completed their Class X. “The government schools hurriedly admitted most of the students in Plus One before the start of the admission process in polytechnic colleges and hence the seats could not be filled this year as well on the basis of the academic performance in the strict sense of the term,” K. Vijaykumar, Principal, Seshasayee Institute of Technology, a government-aided polytechnic college, said. There have been instances of government schools awarding only borderline pass marks for students who were insistent on getting their transfer certificates for the purpose of seeking admission in polytechnic colleges. There was no way of determining the actual academic proficiency of the students for the second year in a row,” Mr. Vijaykumar said. Students are a demoralised lot since the normal practice in government colleges has been to award lesser than deserving marks to the students to shake them out of a sense of complacency such that they would be in a position to score well in Class X. The students themselves do not know where they stand academically, he said. Better than last year As for the admissions in government polytechnics, the trend has been noticeably better when compared to last year, according to M. Tamilselvam, Principal of Government Polytechnic College, Tiruverumbur. The admissions were better this year for first year as well as lateral entry in the second year for those who had completed two year ITI and Plus Two, though all the seats could not be filled, he said. Last year, the students from lower economic strata chose to supplement their family income by going to work. This time, the situation is far better since the admission counselling began early on, he said. In any case, the decline in admissions in government polytechnics that admit students in two shifts need not be unusual since the number of the institutions has grown exponentially. Unlike some years back when there used to be only 17 government polytechnics in the State, there are more than 50 now. The geographical catchment area has shrunk reflecting in the decline in admissions, Mr. Tamilselvam said.  There is no way of determining the actual academic proficiency of the students for the second year in a row K.

08 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Dilapidated school building poses danger to students||The dilapidated condition of a heritage building in Town Hall in Singarathope here, where the Government Higher Secondary School for Girls functions, is posing danger to the students. The school is functioning in a portion of the Rani Mangammal Mahal, which was built by Chockkanatha Nayak, the then ruler of Madurai. It was believed to have been constructed about 300 years ago when Tiruchi was part of the Madurai Nayaks. Established as a high school in 1974, it was upgraded to higher secondary school in 1997. It has a strength of 586 students. It serves to the economically weaker section on East Boulevard Road, Rockfort, Tharanallur, Varaganeri and neighbouring areas. Tiruchi Taluk Office (East), police station (Fort) and a registration office are also functioning in the remaining portion of the heritage building. According to sources, the school, which is just two years away from celebrating its golden jubilee, functions on 2671.4 square metre area, and is maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD). Cracks have appeared at various spots on the limestone masonry roof. Top layers of the walls and roof have fallen. Out of 12 classrooms, four are in a dilapidated condition, thereby posing danger to the students, teaching and non-teaching members. The collapse of the compound wall of the school in November last due to rain, which was also an age-old structure, has also added anxiety to the students. They express fear that the building is facing the danger of collapse if it rains heavily. It is alleged that there had been hardly any maintenance work on the building since the school was started. Sensing the danger, the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) of the school took up the issue with the Collector, Chief Educational Officer and the Public Works Department a few months ago. The CEO and the senior officials of the PWD visited the school and inspected the building recently. But it is alleged that no action has been taken to assure the safety of students. A representative of the PTA said that a portion of the building is in a perilous condition. A number of representations had been sent to various officials, seeking their immediate attention. If it remained unattended, it will pose danger to the users. When contacted, an official at the office of the Chief Educational Officer told The Hindu that the matter had been taken to the notice of the departments concerned. The concerns of the students would be addressed soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dilapidated-school-building-poses-danger-to-students/article36889948.ece
08 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Soothing music to calm you at traffic signals in Tiruchi||Soothing music is being played at traffic signals at major junctions in an initiative of the city police to alleviate stress of the road users. The initiative has been introduced at four locations so far, and will soon be replicated in some other spots in the city, officials said. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior city police official said that the Head Post Office signal on Bharathidasan Salai near Mutharaiyar statue, TVS Tollgate and Salai Road junction had been identified and instrumental music is being played through public address system, which the traffic police use to guide traffic flow. Popular numbers from films are among the tunes aired. Police personnel noticed that people waiting in signals were either stressed during rush hour or weary during the evening and decided to use the music system to motivate and enthuse them, the official said. Similar speaker systems are also being planned at 19 other locations in the city, they said, adding that the traffic signals in the city will not be places of stress, but that of relaxation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/soothing-music-to-calm-you-at-traffic-signals-in-tiruchi/article36889942.ece
08 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Virtual platform a godsend for educational institutions||Having derived the utility of online interface in academic events, higher educational institutions continue to leverage the virtual platform even in the post-pandemic phase. Teaching faculty at the forefront of organising academic workshops, seminars and conferences feel the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a positive outcome in that the impact of the events have risen even while entailing only a fraction of the expenditure that would have otherwise been incurred. “There have been several positives from the online events - we could approach experts in universities across the globe, who were eager to oblige; no need to worry about cost of accommodation, food and overheads of speakers. The only thing is required is that the experts could spare their time. Above all, online events are environment-friendly,” N. Sivakumaran, Professor, Department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, National Institute of Technology - Tiruchi, said. Be it faculty or students, availability of the recording of talks by experts in the digital format obviates the need for question and answer session. The talks are understood well through repeated viewing, Prof. Sivakumar said. The higher educational institutions are a relieved lot since they can save at least a few lakhs of rupees for every event. Usually, the per capita expenditure for participants is more for workshops and training programmes and less for seminars and conferences, senior professors say. “It is enough if the remuneration is paid to the main speakers and experts handling technical session. The necessity to spend on travel, accommodation, hospitality, seminar kits and bags does not arise,” S. Senthilnathan, Director, UGC-Human Resource Development Centre, and Professor, Department of Educational Technology, Bharathidasan University, said. “We, nevertheless, do come across some online participants expressing their desire for in-person interface though the academic events are planned meticulously and conducted professionally. Yet, the bottomline is the pandemic has brought about a positive paradigm shift,” Prof. Senthilnathan said.  We can invite experts from across the globe and no need to worry about their accommodation, food and overheads N.

08 October 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Palayamkottai union records lowest voter turnout||Like the Palayamkottai Assembly segment that houses literate population with relatively decent living conditions but constantly brings down the poll percentage in Assembly and the Parliamentary polls in the past, the Palayamkottai union has also brought down the district’s poll percentage in the first phase of the rural civic polls held on Wednesday. While a rural union like Cheranmahadevi, housing mostly beedi-rollers and farmhands, has recorded over 74% poll percentage, Palayamkottai union, situated on the border of Tirunelveli Corporation and has been provided with better basic amenities, had the voter turnout of just 65.95% . Interestingly, no panchayat union in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi district except Palayamkottai union has recorded the poll percentage less than 70. This is not the first time Palayamkottai has got this dubious distinction as its poll percentage in Assembly and the Parliamentary elections in the past was still lower – less than 60%. The Tirunelveli district recorded an overall poll percentage of 66.54 in the Assembly polls held in last April. While the affluent Palayamkottai Assembly segment registered a poll percentage of just 57.76, the rural segment of Ambasamudram recorded a decent percentage of 72.05, the highest among all five Assembly constituencies of Tirunelveli district. Other Assembly constituencies – Tirunelveli (66.90%), Nanguneri (68.60%) and Radhapuram (67.94%) – recorded a relatively decent poll percentage though not an impressive one. In the previous elections also – let it be 2011 Assembly election or 2016 Assembly polls - Palayamkottai Assembly constituency effectively played spoilsport in bringing down Tirunelveli district’s poll percentage. After registering a not-so-impressive poll percentage of 68.71% in 2011 Assembly polls, Palayamkottai’s figure fell sharply to just 59.90% in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. And, the poll percentage stood at 60% in the 2016 Assembly polls. The poll percentage, the constituency has recorded in the April 6 Assembly poll is the lowest in a decade as it has registered only 57.76%. Now, the Palayamkottai union has retained this ‘distinction’ once again by registering the lowest poll percentage of just 65.95% among all the 10 unions of Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts in the first phase of the rural civic body polls. In Tenkasi district, Keezhapaavoor union recorded the highest poll percentage of 75.24 even as all other unions – Alangulam, Kadayam, Melaneelithanallur and Vaasudevanallur – have registered 70-plus percentage voter turn-out in the first phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palayamkottai-union-records-lowest-voter-turnout/article36890249.ece

The search lasted for more than 10 hours between 6 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. During the search, DVAC seized documents, including bank passbooks and statements. Thursday's search was related to a case filed against P. Ashokan, former Controller of Examination, Thiruvalluvar University in Serkadu in Vellore and his wife S. Renugadevi, an assistant professor in a private college for women in Vellore, by the DVAC on October 4 in Vellore. They have been residing in Katpadi for the past few years. The DVAC teams were led by its inspectors S. Vijay and K. Vijayalakshmi, with four officials in each team. “The disproportionate assets amount to Rs. 53,50,818 earned between 2012 and 2016 when Mr. Ashokan was the controller of examination in the university. No valid documents exist to support this earnings during the period,” said a DVAC official. According to the First Information Report, Mr. Ashokan joined the government service in March 1993 as a lecturer in Thiru.Vi.Ka. Government Arts College in Tiruvarur. Between 1993 and 2007, he grew from lecturer to Associate Professor for Commerce in the college before becoming the principal for the Bharathiyar University Arts & Science College in Gudalur. He served as principal in the college up to 2012. After a short stint in Thiru. Vi. Ka. Government Arts and Science College in Tiruvarur, he became the Controller of Examination in Thiruvalluvar University in 2013. DVAC officials said the case relates to the wealth acquired by him in various places, including Vellore, Tiruvarur and the Nilgiris between 2012 and 2016. DVAC officials also searched Mr. Ashokan's house in Erukattur village in Tiruvarur. His father Packrisamy is a farmer and has owned agricultural land in the village for generations. Further investigation is on.

08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||All eyes on I-T raids because of political links||Income Tax searches on contractors executing public works is nothing new in the State, which has seen big searches in the past. However, what sets the search on Thursday apart is the apparent link it bears to a political family and its ramifications. Similar searches were conducted during the tenure of former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy too, and those searches had exposed the modus operandi of money changing hands between contractor lobby and sections of politicians. ‘Crucial link’ “Though a large number of contractors have been covered, the interest in Thursday’s I-T search seems to be revolving around the role of Umesh, a close aide of the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Contractors are a crucial part of the chain to reach him,” a top official in the State administration analysed. It is learnt that Mr. Umesh refused to sign the mahazar report at the end of the search on Thursday evening. Works under scrutiny Sources in the Public Works Department aware of the developments said that all works above Rs. 25 crore were being scrutinised by the Income Tax Department for possible evasion and to ascertain the modus operandi of money changing hands. Some contracts that were being scrutinised were also in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department, and tenders or contracts that had been awarded through informal channels in the department. “Big contracts are approved by the Irrigation Board chaired by the Chief Minister,” said a source. It is learnt that apart from nearly half a dozen big contractors and several other small contractors, the searches were conducted on the premises of those who supply construction materials such as cement and steel in which Mr. Umesh has had business interest. Sources said that at least two of the prominent contractors executing huge works are from Andhra Pradesh while many companies are based in Bengaluru and north Karnataka region. Despite efforts to seek an official reaction, Income Tax officials remained tight-lipped about the nature of the search operation and the nature of documents or properties that had been confiscated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/all-eyes-on-i-t-raids-because-of-political-links/article36889804.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘62.7% of people were exposed to COVID-19 post second wave’||A study conducted by a team of doctors from Bangalore Baptist Hospital has revealed a high seroprevalence of 62.7% in Bengaluru Rural district in July 2021  after the second wave. The team led by Carolin Elizabeth George, head of Community Health and Research Division at the hospital, conducted a cross-sectionalstudy in a representative sample to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection among unvaccinated population in the district post the second surge. The study, which has been sent for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, found that despite the advantages of low population density and well-ventilated rural landscapes, 62.7% of the population had been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The team conducted a house-to-house survey and collected samples of 831 unvaccinated adults in July 2021. “We estimated an overall prevalence of 62.7%, which is more than five times the seroprevalence of 12.4% found during a similar survey done on the same population during the first surge in October last year,” Dr. George said. The State’s second seroprevalence survey, which was carried out in 290 healthcare facilities spread across Karnataka from January 25 to February 18 this year, had found a prevalence of 20.3% in Bengaluru Rural. The State’s average seroprevalence was 15.6% then. According to the Baptist Hospital study, the case-to-undetected-infected ratio (CIR) was 1:8.65, which means that for every confirmed COVID-19 case, there were 8.7 cases not detected. This means when the district reported 59,112 confirmed cases, the reality was 5,11,722 cases. “This is of no surprise due to many reasons. Firstly, most of the people infected were asymptomatic and hence not detected. Secondly, the health-seeking behaviour of people in rural areas is generally poor compared to urban counterparts. Thirdly, the limited capability of the rural health system to identify COVID-19 infections. The CIR in the district was almost similar in the first (1:7) and second waves (1:8.65), though the caseload during the second surge was almost 10 times more,” he said. This shows that the district was able to ramp up the diagnostics to meet the increased testing demand during the surge crisis, the doctor explained. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) was 16.27 per 10,000 infections as of July 13, 2021, when compared to 12.38 per 10,000 infections as on October 22, 2020, during the hospital’s first study in the district. A history of at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19 or a positive COVID-19 test of self or a family member in the past was significantly associated with seropositivity. Dr. George said the findings were consistent with the preliminary reports of the fourth sero survey by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) that reported an overall national seroprevalence of 67.6%. This survey had found a seroprevalence of 69.8% in Karnataka in June and July 2021. To estimate the State’s seroprevalence, ICMR sampled three districts of the total 30 districts, and Bengaluru Rural was not part of the survey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/627-of-people-were-exposed-to-covid-19-post-second-wave/article36889779.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC to examine validity of making Kannada compulsory for UG courses||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday said that it would examine the constitutional validity of making Kannada a compulsory language for undergraduate courses in the State from the academic year 2021–22 on the pretext of implementing the National Education Policy (NEP)-2020. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Sachin Shankar Magadum indicated that it would hear on Friday the arguments on behalf of the State Government on a PIL petition filed by Samskrita Bharati (Karnataka) Trust and other educational institutions. The petitioners have questioned the legality of the Government Orders (GOs) issued on August 7, 2021, and September, 15, 2021, making Kannada one ofthe two languages to be compulsorily studied in degree courses irrespective of the languages they studied up to class XII, the state from which they hail from, and their mother tongue or the regional language. Pointing out that the NEP-2020 does not specify any mandatory language criteria for higher education courses, the petitioners have claimed that even the recommendations and report submitted by the task force and sub-committees on implementation of NEP-2020 did not contain any recommendation on making Kannada a mandatory language for degree courses. Contrary to NEP While the NEP-2020 purports to offer a choice-based system to promote inclusivity and access to education, the GOs issued in the guise of implementing NEP-2020 take away the choice-based credit system, it was claimed in the petition. The GOs would result in discrimination as they tend to equate the students from Karnataka and from outside Karnataka with the same credit system by obviously offering same credits for studying difficult or an easier syllabus depending upon their previous education. It would also result in loss of jobs for over4,000 teachers teaching languages such as Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc in Karnataka when students are forced to take Kannada as one of the languages, the petitioners stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-to-examine-validity-of-making-kannada-compulsory-for-ug-courses/article36889799.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||After two years, students to get second set of uniforms||After two years, students in government schools across Karnataka may finally get their second set of uniforms. They had received the first set of uniforms for the 2020-21 academic year from the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) only in January this year. While one set is provided by the DPI , the other is provided by the Samagra Sikshana Abhiyan (SSA). The SSA had recently issued a circular directing School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMC) to purchase material, stitch the uniforms, and distribute them to students from Classes VI to X as schools have started functioning for the full day. The SDMCs have been given the responsibility of choosing the colour of the uniform. The second set of uniforms were not distributed during the previous two academic years (2019-20 and 2020-21) because of paucity of funds and then the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the State Cabinet decided to procure uniforms for all school students and transferred the estimated cost to the SDMCs. But later, officials of the DPI issued directions to stop procurement as schools were suspended because of the pandemic. The SSA has said that only students of Classes VI to X will get the uniforms. Schools have been told that they can procure uniforms for students of Classes I to V only after physical classes resume for them. The cost of each set of uniforms is pegged at Rs. 250. It will be borne by the State and Union Governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/after-two-years-students-to-get-second-set-of-uniforms/article36889785.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||QR code system proposed to tackle illegal waste dumping||With work under way on the Rs. 160-crore ‘Citizens Water Way Project’ — which will see Bengaluru’s K-100 rajakaluve get a facelift — the civic body is turning to technology to tackle the indiscriminate dumping of waste into the major storm-water drain. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has proposed a QR code-based door-to-door garbage collection to be implemented in and around Rajendra Nagar slum in Koramangala on a pilot basis. Senior officials told The Hindu that each house will be assigned a QR code and a card with all the relevant details. Garbage collectors will have to scan the QR code while collecting waste, which will be transmitted to the smart control room. The K-100 drain is a major drain measuring 11.4-km in length, connecting the erstwhile Dharmambudhi Lake, where the Kempegowda bus station now stands, to Bellandur Lake. The government wants to develop the drain along the lines of the ‘Sabarmati River Waterfront’ project. This system is likely to be rolled out in a month. Civic officials are currently mapping houses near the drain, especially those in Rajendra Nagar slum in Koramangala, a locality that abuts the major SWD. “For the pilot, around 2,000 houses will be mapped. Once it is successful, the model will be scaled up and replicated in other parts of the city,” a senior official said. A few years ago, a similar pilot had been taken up in Yelahanka zone and implemented in one block with 500 houses. Though it was successful, it could not be implemented in other parts of the city. BBMP’s Joint Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) Sarfaraz Khan, who is spearheading the mapping of houses, told The Hindu that marshals were already working with communities living along the storm water drain and creating awareness about proper waste disposal and dissuading them from dumping any sort of waste into the drain. “Indiscriminate dumping of waste into drains is a major issue that needs to be addressed. The waste in the drains lead to blockage, affecting flow of water, which causes it to overflow and flood nearby localities,” he said. The BBMP has also been working with the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board to arrest the inflow of sewage and untreated effluents into the drain. Work on setting up a sewage treatment plant of five million litres per day capacity had already begun. The other major challenge before the civic body is clearing encroachments along the stretch, apart from tackling legal hurdles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/qr-code-system-proposed-to-tackle-illegal-waste-dumping/article36889771.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Reconsider action on hawkers’||Taking exception to the action taken by the police against hawkers using loudspeakers to sell their ware, MLA for Rajajinagar and former Minister S. Suresh Kumar has written to the City Police Commissioner to reconsider his decision. In his letter addressed to him on Thursday, Mr. Kumar said the police should consider the plight of vendors, who have already suffered serious losses during the lockdown, before taking such strict action. There should be a mechanism to hear the plight of vendors, he said, adding that the police should verify complaints and consider the pros and cons before taking action. Commissioner Kamal Pant said he would look into the issue and take steps keeping in mind both the plight of vendors and the complaints of people on the use of loudspeakers. The recent trend of hawkers using loudspeakers to advertise their ware had resulted in residents in many localities complaining about disturbance to students and senior citizens. The police subsequently started cracking down on the use of loudspeakers.  Ex-Minister takes exception to action taken by police against hawkers using loudspeakers to sell wares.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reconsider-action-on-hawkers/article36889787.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two held for stealing 30 tonnes of rice, filing false case||A truck owner has been arrested for allegedly colluding with the driver he had hired to steal 30 tonnes of rice that was to be transported to a customer in order to recover the losses he had incurred. He planned to sell over 1,200 sacks of rice, and also sold the truck to a junkyard in Salem, Tamil Nadu, before reporting the ‘theft’. The Bagepalli police, while probing the case, realised that the truck owner, Giddaiah, who runs Jai Maruthi Transport, had orchestrated the incident. On September 27, Giddaiah, along with his driver Pradeep, 28, walked into Bagepalli station and filed a complaint claiming that the truck and its contents had been stolen. In his statement, Pradeep claimed that he was transporting the load of rice from Raichur to Bengaluru, but some thieves drove off with the truck when he stopped for break near a temple at Bagepalli. The police registered an FIR. During the course of the investigation, they found evidence to show that Giddaiah had not been upfront with them. “The driver also was acting suspiciously. When we analysed his call record details, we found that he had been to Kurnool and Salem,” said a police officer. The police questioned Pradeep about his visit to Kurnool and Salem, but when he couldn’t give them coherent answers, they took him into custody, where he allegedly confessed to Giddaiah’s involvement. According to the police, Giddaiah had incurred huge losses because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising price of diesel, following which he took a Rs. 12 lakh loan. In order to repay it, he planned to sell the rice. He also organised for Pradeep to sell the truck to a junkyard owner in Salem and was getting ready to claim insurance for it. The police recovered the 1,216 sacks of rice which Pradeep had stored at a relative’s house in Kurnool. “The duo have been arrested for cheating and filing false case,” said the officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-held-for-stealing-30-tonnes-of-rice-filing-false-case/article36889793.ece
08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka borrows Rs. 2,000 cr. through RBI||Afterpostponing borrowings in the first two quarters, the State Government has raised two state development loans (SDLs) of Rs. 1,000 crore each through market borrowings in the third quarter of this financial year. The government raised both these loans on October 5. These market borrowings, known as SDLs, were raised through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). While the rate of interest on one loan (Rs. 1,000 crore) is 6.88% and another one is 6.93% and they were borrowed for 10 years and 11 years, respectively. While Karnataka raised these loans in July last year, this year it raised loans in October, which indicated improved financial position of the State in 2021–22. The State’s revenue collections through GST, sales tax, and excise have recorded improvement this year when compared with 2020–21. Despite economic recovery, market borrowings were inevitable since the government had to fulfil many commitments on payments of salaries, pensions, implementation of development projects, and other heads of accounts. On October 5, a total of 17 States, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh, which were impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns in different phases, borrowed Rs. 22,809.022 crore, the RBI said. Revenue shortfall Karnataka was expected to have a revenue shortfall owing to non-levying of fresh taxes in the 2021–22 Budget and disruptions in economic activity due to the pandemic in the first quarter of this fiscal year. In March 2021, the State had proposed to borrow over Rs. 70,000 crore (4% of the GSDP) during the current financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-borrows-rs-2000-cr-through-rbi/article36889809.ece

A Division Bench of acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the direction while hearing a PIL plea, filed in 2015 by Vijayan Menon and other residents of city, on the poor condition of roads. Earlier, the BBMP counsel told the court that the civic body was filling potholes on a regular basis and sought time to submit the status report as directed by the court earlier. The Bench was also informed that the BBMP had entered into an agreement with a single agency to fill up potholes and was undertaking filling work every day. However, the work is said to have slowed down because of the recent rains. Earlier, the counsel for the petitioner contended that the BBMP had not complied with several directions issued by the court, claiming that no indemnity bond was being taken from the contractors to make them responsible for substandard work and poor maintenance. Further hearing is adjourned till November 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ensure-quality-in-pothole-filling-exercise-says-hc/article36889768.ece

On Thursday, when they arrested the gang, which operated in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, the police had identified 12 babies. “However, we have obtained documents with the details of 28 children. We have stepped up investigation to trace the remaining 16,” said a police officer. The arrested accused — three men and two women — preyed on impoverished families in the three metros and convinced them to sell their babies for Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 80,000. They would then sale the babies for lakhs of rupees to childless couples using fake adoption papers. “We suspect that there are more people involved in the racket. Efforts are on to get information about them from the accused,” the officer said. He added that the police were also verifying the financial background of each of the accused in the hope that the information would shed more light on the extent of the network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/baby-sale-racket-police-yet-to-trace-16-infants/article36889770.ece

08 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Study highlights gaps in safe commute to schools||A national study on safe commute to school conducted by SaveLIFE Foundation and Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India has highlighted gaps in road safety for children. The authors considered responses of 11,845 people, including 5,711 children and 6,134 parents, across 14 cities in India, including Bengaluru. A little less than half (47%) of the respondents using school transport admitted that the vehicles were not equipped with seat belts. No helmet Around 34% of respondents using two-wheelers said that their children did not wear helmets. The study also said that 30% of children had witnessed a crash during their commute to school and 6% were themselves involved in a road crash or a near miss during their commute to and from school. More than half of the parents who participated in the survey reported that the school authorities had taken no action on the safety concerns which include overcrowding in school vehicles, congestion near the school, and overspeeding by drivers in the school zone. Collective action SaveLIFE Foundation Founder and CEO, Piyush Tewari, in a press release said, “As of date, over 25 states and Union Territories have announced the reopening of schools. While there is a vaccine for COVID-19, the vaccine for child deaths on our roads is really our collective action. Our findings through this report have once again emphasised that the right to a safe commute to school is as important as the right to education itself. A comprehensive national and state school transport safety policy can ensure that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/study-highlights-gaps-in-safe-commute-to-schools/article36889798.ece

08 October 2021||BENGALURU/HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||BJP picks Bhusanur for Sindgi, Sajjan for Hangal||The Bharatiya Janata Party high command has again sprung a surprise on selection of candidates by choosing Shivaraj Sajjan as the nominee for the byelection in Hangal Assembly constituency. Ticket was expected to be given to Revathi Udasi, daughter-in-law of the late C.M. Udasi, whose death necessitated the byelection. However, there is no surprise with respect to the choice for Sindgi constituency. The party has chosen Ramesh Bhusanur whose name had been doing the rounds for some time. The byelection in Sidagi is necessitated due to the death of MLA M.C. Managuli. Ms. Revathi Udasi’s name was among the several shortlisted by the BJP State core committee for the byelections. Not giving ticket to her is being interpreted in different ways in BJP circles. A section of party leaders feel that the parameters adopted for candidate selection was in tune with the norms of not encouraging dynastic politics. They point out that Ms. Revathi Udasi’s husband, Shivakumar Udasi, is a Member of Parliament representing Haveri. However, a prominent leader in the party State unit said Ms. Revathi Udasi missed out on the party ticket as there was a demand to field a local candidate from Hangal. “The party high command took a final call based on the native angle and hence she could not get the ticket,” he maintained. Udasi family is close to the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Meanwhile, with only one day left for filing of nomination papers, Congress and JD(S) candidates filed their papers with much fanfare on Thursday in both the constituencies. Polling will take place on October 30. Restrictions imposed The Election Commission of India has prohibited canvassing between 7 p.m. and 10 a.m. citing COVID-19 protocol. It has also said that the poll officials and personnel and poll agents of political parties deployed on the counting day should have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. And if they have received only one dose, then it is mandatory for them to produce RT-PCR negative report received not before 72 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-picks-bhusanur-for-sindgi-sajjan-for-hangal/article36889802.ece
08 October 2021||CHENNAI,KARNATAKA||Support Godavari-Cauvery link, T.N. tells A.P., Telangana||The Tamil Nadu Government has sought the support of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states for the Godavari (Inchampalli)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link project. A few weeks ago, a senior offical of the Tamil Nadu government wrote to his counterparts in the two southern States, urging the officials to give their consent to a detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the National Water Development Agency (NWDA). Stalin’s request Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, in his memorandum presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June, requested him to have the detailed project report (DPR) finalised, incorporating Tamil Nadu’s position, and enable the work to be taken up on a priority for the benefit of the southern States. Water Resources Minister Durai Murugan reiterated the request while meeting Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in July. The project envisages the diversion of 247 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) through the Krishna and Pennar rivers. This has been proposed to be carried out only during the south-west monsoon. Tamil Nadu has been allotted around 83 tmc ft, with the rest going to the other two States. Tamil Nadu has suggested that the Kattalai barrage be made the terminal point of the link, instead of the Grand Anicut. In view of the State being water-deficit, taking water to a higher contour will help to cover more needy areas than the existing arrangements and transferring water to the Vaigai and Gundar rivers. Krishna water allocation One of the reasons for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana not to be so keen on the project as Tamil Nadu is the non-finalisation of the Krishna water allocation, says a water expert, adding that this explains the need for Tamil Nadu to pressure them to give their consent. The National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has assessed that the allocation under the link project will take care of the future requirements of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana too, the expert adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/support-godavari-cauvery-link-tn-tells-ap-telangana/article36889796.ece
08 October 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Order to shut businesses for two days in Sringeri upsets locals||The Chikkamagaluru district administration’s order to close all business establishments in Sringeri Town Panchayat limits for two days from Thursday in view of President Ram Nath Kovind’s visit on Friday has upset local people. On Wednesday night, officials went around the town with a public address system appealing to traders to close their shops for two days. T. Leelavathi, Chief Officer of the panchayat, told The Hindu that the panchayat made the appeal on orders from the Deputy Commissioner. “The shops should remain closed for two days,” she said. The town has around 470 business establishments. This decision has attracted the wrath of the local people. Many entered into arguments with the officials. They are angry with the decision because they have already incurred losses due to the COVID-19 lockdown. R. Shabarish, a resident of Sringeri, said, “Where was the need to impose such restrictions on us? The President is visiting the temple. We welcome him and are happy about his visit. But, why should the administration force shopkeepers close their establishments for two days?” Helipad The residents are also angry about funds being spent on preparations for the President’s visit. Three helicopters would land in the town during his visit. Earlier, the administration had cleared Gandhi Maidan to park three helicopters. Temporary shops on the premises were asked to vacate. But now, the ground will be utilised to park only one helicopter. Additional money is being spent to create space at Koradakallu to park two helicopters. “When gram panchayats and town panchayats request for funds, the government refuses citing COVID-19. However, the government is spending huge sums on building helipads,” said Mr. Shabarish, who is also a member of Vidyaranyapura Gram Panchayat.  The President is visiting the temple. We welcome him and are happy about his visit. But, why should the administration force shopkeepers close their establishments for two days? R.

08 October 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||JD(S) has fielded Muslims to help BJP, says Siddaramaiah||Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah has said that the Janata Dal(Secular) is deliberately targeting the Congress while favouring the BJP. Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi on Thursday, he said that the Janata Dal(S) deliberately fielded minority candidates for the Hangal and Sindgi byelections. “We do not have any objection to fielding Muslim candidates. But the Janata Dal(S) did not fielded Muslim candidates where it was required. In Hassan, Mandya and other places, the Janata Dal(S) should have fielded minority candidates but it did not. Now, it has fielded Muslim candidates to help the BJP,” he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the Janata Dal(S), which has a foothold in the Old Mysuru region, is targeting the Congress, which too has strong presence in the region. He said that the RSS is nothing but a communal organisation which believed in dividing society for political benefits and it continued to instigate Hindus against Muslims. “The Congress does not support such acts. We respect all religions and communities. The BJP is nothing but a mask of the RSS and it just follows the direction of the RSS. We will win both the seats in the byelections,” he said. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is solely responsible for the soaring prices of essential commodities and fuel prices. And, in the State, the BJP government is engrossed in blowing its own trumpet, he quipped. To a query, he clarified that he had met party chief Sonia Gandhi for discussions on State politics and not on national politics. There was no discussion on national politics during the meeting and Ms. Gandhi “did not invite me for a role in national politics,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-has-fielded-muslims-to-help-bjp-says-siddaramaiah/article36890015.ece

08 October 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘People’s pockets are being emptied daily under double engine govt.’||Despite the claims made by the BJP about having a “double engine” government, there has been no development in the State and only people’s pockets are being emptied, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar has said. Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi on Thursday, Mr. Shivakumar said that he had very high expectations from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai that he will do much for the development of the State. But, he has not spoken anything yet on Mahadayi, Krishna, Cauvery and Mekedatu projects, he said. He said that under the “double engine” government, people’s pockets are being emptied daily and the government is not letting the public lead a normal life. “Now, people will teach the BJP a lesson in the elections,” he said. He, however, said that it was not right to say that the Hangal and Sindgi byelections results will be an indicator to the forthcoming Assembly elections. “The byelection is an opportunity for the general public to express their pain,” he said. He said that the BJP leaders were least bothered about the development of the State. “Although the BJP knew how to misuse administrative machinery, people’s verdict will be final. We have faith that the electorate will not yield to money power or any other pressure,” he said. Mr. Shivakumar said that earlier the Congress had extended support to the Janata Dal(Secular) for the sake of keeping secular forces together as per the direction of the party high command. On the Janata Dal(S) fielding Muslim candidates in both Hangal and Sindgi, he said that it was that party’s political plan and he will not comment on it. He said that he did not believe in the words of the BJP. That party leader Arun Singh used to say that B.S. Yediyurappa was working honestly and efficiently when he was Chief Minister. If that was the case, why was he asked to step down, he sought to know.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/peoples-pockets-are-being-emptied-daily-under-double-engine-govt/article36890014.ece

Kumaraswamy wondered why Mr. Siddaramaiah is bothered about his party’s decision. Mr. Kumaraswamy said that his party need not ask permission from Mr. Siddaramaiah or any other party to field candidates. What right Mr. Siddaramaiah has to comment on the selection of Janata Dal(S)candidates, he asked. He was speaking to media persons at Kalaburagi Airport on Thursday before leaving for Sindgi. Reacting to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s statement that the Janata Dal(S) is giving ticket to Muslim candidates to divide Congress votes, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that Mr. Siddaramaiah professes to have a secular character but has done nothing to unite secular forces and for the welfare of minorities, except appeasing them for their votes. Criticising Mr. Siddaramaiah for calling the Janata Dal(S) the B team of the BJP, Mr. Kumaraswamy asserted that the Congress was responsible for the BJP’s victory. “Mr. Siddaramaiah was never happy with the government formation under me; he plotted mass resignations by MLAs to topple the coalition government. If the BJP is in power in the State at present, it is because of the Congress and Mr. Siddaramaiah,” he reiterated. Replying to a question on Income Tax raid, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that the raid on B.S. Yediyurappa’s former personal assistant’s house and office might be due to internal conflicts in the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-has-done-nothing-for-minorities-or-to-unite-secular-forces/article36890010.ece

08 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Wadiyars continue a royal tradition||The private Dasara of the Wadiyars got underway within the palace premises on Thursday in continuation of a tradition inherited from the rulers of the Vijayanagar empire. Though the Dasara of the Wadiyars adds a slice of royal aura to the Nada Habba, it was devoid of any media glare in keeping with the imperatives of social distancing and minimising the crowd. Hence it was out of bounds to all but for a handful of people directly involved in the proceedings this year, as it was in 2020. The evententails performance of various rituals practised since the time of the Vijayanagar emperors. It is supervised by priests well-versed with the palace traditions.Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar – the titular king – takes part in the religious events and conducts the rituals daily during Navaratri. The history of the Mysuru Dasara is traced to Raja Wadiyar who on ascending the throne at Srirangapatna in 1610 CE ordained that Navaratri be celebrated on a grand scale. Hence the practices of the Wadiyars have a recorded history of at least 410 years which itself was a continuation of an earlier tradition observed by the monarchs of the Vijayanagar kingdom. Some of the time-honoured traditions have been systematised over the last few centuries and are observed in full but the ascending of the throne and conducting a durbar is only symbolic in the present times. But some of the practices that are part of the royal paraphernalia, including the procession of the caparisoned elephants within the palace precincts and the visits to the various temples as part of the rituals, are duly followed. The royal elephant, the royal horse, the camels and the palace staff go out in a procession from the Amba Vilas to the various temples within the palace premises after which they return from the Jayamarthanda Gate. Conjuring up images of an era long past, the processions, wrestling, cultural performances etc., have been described by the medieval travellers such as Abdur Razak, Domingo Paes, and Fernavo Nuniz who visited Vijayanagar at various times between the 15th and the 16th centuries. Domingo Paes from Portugal refers to the “great feast”, spread over nine days and this is implied to be a reference to Dasara while the Mahanavami Dibba excavated at Hampi is another pointer to the celebrations which were also described as a demonstration of strength and paying obeisance to the kings by their feudatories. The Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage has published a book on Mysuru Dasara and it states that the Wadiyars introduced some changes in the practices and blended their traditions with that of the Vijayanagar rulers while celebrating Navaratri. The murals in the Kalyana Mantapa of the Mysuru Palace also throw light on the past grandeur of Dasara glimpses of which come alive during the private Dasara.  The event entails performance of various rituals practised since the time of Vijayanagar emperors||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/wadiyars-continue-a-royal-tradition/article36890163.ece
08 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||A new era of development has begun in State: CM||Promising to give a clean administration, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday said a new era for development has begun under his regime and added that he had taken the pledge of giving an unblemished governance. “The launch of a CM dashboard is one such measure. It has helped me to review the progress of various departments and developments digitally. All pro-people programmes will continue with the support of my entire Cabinet and MLAs besides the officials. I believe in team work,” he said in Mysuru. In his address after the inauguration of Mysuru Dasara festivities atop the Chamundi Hills here, Mr. Bommai said Karnataka was recovering from the pandemic and the revenue shortfall that accompanied it. “While prioritising development amidst the pandemic, we are on the path of regaining financial stability,” he stated. Besides promising to announce new projects for Mysuru with the city being one of the most admired centres, Mr. Bommai said the expansion of Mysuru airport and its upgradation to the status of an international airport are among the proposals before the government. Referring to the work on replacement of obsolete crest gates at the KRS dam, Mr. Bommai said the work was sanctioned when he was the Minister for Water Resources. “Half of the work has been done and I have plans of inspecting the work soon. At the touch of a button, the crest gates can now be lifted, thanks to the technological interventions,” he explained. Mr. Bommai also said 11 major irrigation canals in Mysuru region had been modernised and they include the 650-year-old Madhava Mantri canal. “These canals irrigate around 97,000 acres of land and I have the satisfaction of modernising them, including the work on developing distributary canals for the VC canal. Water from the canal can now reach the last village of Maddur taluk for irrigation.” The Chief Minister also expressed his wish of launching a health insurance scheme on the lines of Yashaswini scheme for farmers which was introduced when S.M. Krishna was the Chief Minister. Yashaswini was one of the landmark schemes of Mr. Krishna, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-new-era-of-development-has-begun-in-state-cm/article36890159.ece
08 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘S.M. Krishna launched landmark schemes’||Political leaders heaped praise on former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader S.M. Krishna, who inaugurated the Dasara festivities atop Chamundi Hills on Thursday. In his address, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai recalled his association with Mr. Krishna to the days when his father (S.R. Bommai) was alive. “I have seen him closely.” He described the Yashaswini health scheme and the mid-day meal schemes are among the landmark schemes of Mr. Krishna’s governance. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, in his address, credited Mr. Krishna with laying the foundation for the growth of IT and BT sector in the State when he was the Chief Minister. That visionary step helped Bengaluru emerge as an IT capital, he claimed. Mr. Simha also credited Mr. Krishna with bringing reforms in the excise sector which increased the yearly revenue from Rs. 3,500 crore to Rs. 24,000 crore. “He was a visionary CM who focused on wealth creation. Bhoomi is one of the landmark projects besides the Yashaswini scheme for the cooperatives,” he said. The MP said Mr. Bommai seems to be treading in Mr. Krishna’s footsteps and has impressed the people with his style of functioning and development agenda. “Mr. Bommai is leading from the front which was seen in the last Assembly session and has all abilities to address situations like how Mr. Krishna handled during his tenure,” Mr. Simha said Mr. Simha also said Mr. Bommai will return to power as the Chief Minister in 2023 and will attend the Dasara inauguration. Chamundeshwari MLA G.T. Deve Gowda also complimented Mr. Krishna on his governance. He recalled the innovative schemes launched during Mr. Krishna’s regime, particularly the Yashaswini health scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sm-krishna-launched-landmark-schemes/article36890161.ece

He was speaking after inaugurating the 450-bed hospital of Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences. Pointing out that the area around the CIMS is densely forested and many of the people living in it are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the President urged the administration of CIMS and the State Government to take steps to make affordable healthcare available to them with the goal of providing universal healthcare for all. “This would be in tune with the true aim of the expansion of medical services in the country’’, he added. Speaking on the healthcare infrastructure the President said the Union Government had already increased the number of AIIMS from 6 to 22 and was opening medical colleges in every district. As new post-graduate colleges are coming up, the existing post-graduate institutes are also encouraged to become Centres of Excellence. “We need to take health services to the remotest corners of our country. We can hope to build an Atmanirbhar Bharat only when our technology, human resources and the access to both come together.’ Mr. Kovind appreciated the fact that CIMS was ranked third for the successful implementation of the Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka scheme in 2020-21 and added that in promoting access to healthcare, the students and administrators of this institute have a crucial role to play. He expressed confidence that the doctors, nurses and paramedics being trained here would serve the nation with a high degree of commitment and dedication and would bring glory to the profession and to the alma mater. Speaking about the impact of COVID-19, the President said the country faced a devastating wave of infections this year but the crisis also united all Indians in the fight against the invisible enemy. “The resurgence has largely abated, and this would not have been possible without the immense dedication of our medical fraternity’’, said Mr.Kovind. “Some sacrificed even their lives in the line of duty and our nation would forever be indebted to them.

He was speaking at a function in which President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the 450-bed hospital of Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences. Mr. Bommai said the hospitals will be come up in districts lagging in medical facilities and will help shore up the health quotient and infrastructure of the respective regions, and that it was in sync with the policy to have a hospital and medical college in every district. Noting that the patient-to-hospital bed ratio and patient-to-doctor ratio was discouraging compared to the WHO norms, Mr. Bommai said the State Government was committed to improving health infrastructure and the Centre was contributing towards the same. In case of medical facilities coming up at Yadgir, Haveri, and Chamarajanagar, the Centre had pitched in almost 60% of the cost, he added. In the last four years, the Centre sanctioned almost 150 medical colleges and hospitals across the country, the Chief Minister said. He said that in terms of vaccine administration, 80% of the population had received single dose while 30% had received both doses. By the end of December, the population of the State is expected to be fully vaccinated, he said and appreciated the Centre ensuring vaccine supply free of cost to meet the target. Mr. Bommai noted that Chamarajanagar district was endowed with rich natural resources and was the spiritual abode of saints but has the stamp of being backward on various parameters. “The government is determined to reduce the prevailing imbalance on all development parameters and ensure growth of the region,” he added. Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar waspresent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eight-hospitals-to-come-up-under-ppp-model/article36890164.ece

The court also directed the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to conduct a census of trees on the premises and the surrounding land, including the Chief Secretary’s official residence, National Gallery of Modern Art, and the seven bungalows of ministers, and submit a report to the court in three weeks. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the interim order on Thursday on an interlocutory application filed by Dattatraya T. Devare in a PIL filed by himself and the Bangalore Environmental Trust in 2018 on non-implementation of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976. Newspaper reports, relied on by the applicants, prima facie establish that there was a move to set up a club in the guest house built in 1850, the Bench noted while directing the applicant to implead the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a party to the proceedings as the guest house is a 150-year-old structure. Though the applicant had sought an interim direction to the government and its agencies only from taking any action which may result in felling or transplanting any trees in the Balabrooie campus without seeking prior leave of the court, the Bench expanded the scope of the plea while noticing that land adjoining the guest house and adjoining land have huge lung space. Also, the Bench directed the Horticulture Department to ensure that trees and plants on the guest house premises are properly taken care of and submit a report about green cover of the area to the court. The Bench took up the hearing on the application on a request by advocate Pradeep Nayak about the need to hear the matter on an urgent basis as it was pointed out in the application that several of the over 100-year-old trees have a root system spread over 40 feet, and are likely to be affected by the proposed move of the Karnataka Government to set up a recreational club for legislators. “These heritage trees act as lungs to the traffic around the heart of the city of Bengaluru and are, by themselves, large ecosystems. It has been noted by various eminent environmentalists in Bengaluru that these trees harbour over 50 rare bird species, and include ecologically important species like Banyan, Mohua and Cycas, and most of them are over 100 years old,” it has been stated in the application. Additional Advocate General Dhyan Chinnappa informed the bench that the Chief Secretary had instructed him that there is no plan to cut trees in the guest house while pointing out that there is no concrete plan or decision on using the premises to set up a club.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/balabrooie-high-court-directs-state-to-maintain-status-quo/article36889790.ece

A few contractors are said to be linked to politicians in North Karnataka. According to sources, the searches are being conducted over contracts for canal, road, and bridge works, besides an airport contract given during Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure. The role that Mr. Umesh played in securing the tenders for the contractors and their associates is under the radar. “Though I-T searches on contractors are common, Mr. Umesh has emerged to be the focus of attention,” sources said. However, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “I-T searches keep happening. It will not have any impact on the bypolls,” he said, acknowledging that Mr. Umesh had worked with him when he was the Chief Minister. Mr. Raghavendra also acknowledged that he had worked with the family. “The I-T officials have just done their duty,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Vishwanath, who is at loggerheads with Mr. Yediyurappa over being denied Cabinet berth, claimed in Mysuru that I-T searches were in connection with illegalities in awarding tenders worth Rs. 20,000 crore. He claimed that Mr. Yediyurappa had to surrender his post because of such alleged corruption. Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said, “The searches on the aide of Mr. Yediyurappa could be linked to internal affairs of BJP. It could be to keep the leader under the party’s control.”  (With inputs from Hassan and Mysuru)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/i-t-search-on-contractors-sets-off-speculation/article36889810.ece

Muhamma grama panchayat president Swapna Shabu inaugurated the initiative. The project is being implemented under the aegis of the Muhamma Lime Shell Cooperative Society. Clam collection, the main source of livelihood for several families on the banks of the lake, has declined in recent years due to a number of reasons such as pollution and climate change. Officials said clam seeds have been deposited as part of the Vembanad Lake conservation project. The multi-crore conservation project is aimed at the eco-restoration of the lake, a designated Ramasar site spanning several districts, through coordination of various departments and people's participation. Besides making the waterbody pollution-free, it envisages the conservation of fishery resources. Vembanad Lake is one of the most polluted waterbodies in the world.

On Tuesday, four persons, including P. Sajeevan, CPI(M) leader and former Panoor local secretary, suffered dog bites.

08 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Steady decline, but not a time to rejoice, warn health officials||Ernakulam district has witnessed a steady decline in COVID-19 cases over the past four weeks, even as health professionals cautioned against lowering the guard. An analysis of data on the past four weeks showed that the number of positive cases in the first week was 23,106. In the second week, it went up to 23,538 followed by a dip in the third week (19,873). The cases declined to 16,622 in the fourth week. Among the confirmed cases, the highest number was reported among the 19-44 age category followed by those figuring in the age bracket of 45-59. In the first week, 45.7% of the infected were those in the age group of 19 to 44. In the second week, it was 44.7%, followed by 44.5% and 43.2% in the third and fourth weeks respectively. Those in the age category of 45-59 constituted 21.8% of the infected in the first week. The corresponding figures in the second, third and fourth weeks were 22%, 22.4%, and 22.9% respectively. The number of children getting infected remained in the 18%-mark till the third week. It had a slight dip in the fourth week (17.8%). “The district is seeing a decline in the number of positive cases. Hospital admissions have also reduced by around 50%,” said Dr. M.I. Junaid Rahman, nodal officer for COVID-19 management of the Indian Medical Association, Kochi. However, Dr. Rahman advised stringent compliance with the SMS (social distancing, mask use, and sanitising) protocol to check a possible spike in cases. “With the relaxations, the chances of overcrowding remain high in various places. People should be careful to avoid it, especially in functions like marriage and while having food in eateries,” he said. Health officials said there would be a slight uptick in the test positivity rate, as the rapid antigen tests had been replaced by RT-PCR tests. Despite this transient rise in new cases, the declining trend will continue in the form of a slightly deformed wave, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steady-decline-but-not-a-time-to-rejoice-warn-health-officials/article36890326.ece
08 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Desperate migrants taking up work in hazardous environment||Driven to a state of desperation owing to joblessness in the wake of the pandemic, migrant workers in Ernakulam are increasingly taking up work in highly dangerous environment. The death of a 45-year-old worker from Andhra Pradesh after being crushed under a collapsed concrete slab at Kaloor on Wednesday was the latest in a spate of worksite accidents involving migrants in the district since the unlock after the second wave of the pandemic. While a migrant worker got crushed under a tree, which he was engaged to axe, at Mambra near Angamaly last week, another met with a similar tragic end in July after being crushed between a scaffolding and a collapsed concrete structure at the site of an apartment complex under construction at Panampilly Nagar. Both were from West Bengal. Fire officials said there was a clear oversight of safety precautions at the Kaloor worksite. “The huge concrete slab was propped up on three temporary iron rods that fell apart, crushing the workers engaged in widening the drain beneath. Either more iron rods should have been used for greater stability, or the slab should have been permanently fixed. The workers did not even have the customary helmets nor was there any space for them to take cover when the slab came down crushing,” said T.B. Ramakrishnan, Station Officer, Fire and Rescue Services station, Gandhi Nagar. That the victims were migrants meant it did not create the same hue and cry when local workers are involved. “The Kochi Corporation should share responsibility for the accident and violation of safety measures along with the contractor, since the work was for the civic body. Desperation to raise their families back home when work is hard to come by in the aftermath of the pandemic means migrant workers are now taking up even dangerous jobs despite not having the required experience. They are being exploited for work, which local labourers may turn down for safety reasons,” said Benoy Peter, executive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development. George Mathew, Progressive Workers Organisation, accused the government of both failing to provide worksite safety training to migrant workers and pay compensation. The Labour Department has initiated steps to provide compensation to the victim of the Kaloor accident under the Employees Compensation Act. “We will submit a report to the Alappuzha Industrial Tribunal,” said Feroz P.M., Labour Officer, Ernakulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/desperate-migrants-taking-up-work-in-hazardous-environment/article36890319.ece

Though not a usual destination thrown around in association with drug smuggling, the investigation team strongly suspects the contraband to have originated from Spain considering the infrastructure potential of the affluent European country for manufacturing drugs. Though the investigation team was confident that the consignment was procured from Triplicane area in Chennai, for a long time, Excise sleuths could not confirm whether the drug was locally manufactured or imported. That now seems to have settled for the time being. “We also suspect that the order for the drug and the plan for its smuggling were made in Sri Lanka,” said ECB sources. In another significant development, the drug, which was initially suspected to be MDMA, a premium variety, has turned out to be Methamphetamine, according to a chemical analysis report from the Regional Chemical Examiner’s Laboratory at Kakkanad. The ECB has so far arrested 12 persons in connection with the case. The custody of Susmitha Sujith, the 12th accused, was returned to the Principal Sessions Court, Ernakulam, on Thursday.

Harvester rates In view of the complaints, the Collector is slated to convene another round of meeting on Monday to fix the tariff of the machines in a uniform manner. She also directed the Agriculture Department to initiate advance steps to address the issues involved in completing the harvest in a time-bound manner. Beena George, Principal Agriculture Officer, said as many as 20 machines were available with the authorities for the current harvest season. The actual requirement for the season, however, was around 60 machines per day. “We will need at least eight machines at the beginning of the harvest. Steps have been taken to source machines from the private sector to meet the peak season requirement,” she said. More machines sought Farmers, however, said at least 100 machines would be required to complete the harvest in a time-bound manner. “While the government has fixed a rate of Rs. 1,850 per hour for its machine as against Rs. 2,000 by the private operators, the farmers are required to transport these machines on their own, which in turn, offsets the cost advantage in hiring government-owned machines,” said Aby Ipe, district general secretary of the Karshaka Congress. Meanwhile, farmers also pointed out that about 30 harvester machines under the government-owned Kerala Agro Industries Corporation Ltd. (KAIC) were lying idle due to lack of maintenance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/harvest-set-to-begin-in-kottayam/article36890121.ece

08 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Electrical resistivity study being done in Kuruvattur house||Electrical resistivity study is being undertaken in a house in Kuruvattur Grama Panchayat in Kozhikode district from where a tremor-like sound is being heard for the past three weeks. The study is being led by Bipin Peethambaran of the Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. Earlier, another team led by retired scientist G. Sankar had come to a conclusion that soil piping, the formation of underground tunnels due to subsurface soil erosion, could have led to the strange sound from the house of Thekke Marath Biju, near Poloor in Kuruvattur. The team had also sought a detailed survey, saying that land mining or the pressure from rocks beneath the surface could also be reasons. There are, however, no quarries within a two-km radius of this house. Fire force personnel and officials from the Department of Geology too had sought detailed studies to uncover the phenomenon. The residents claim that the intensity of the sound has been rising for the past few days. Now, the electrical resistivity study is done to determine the conductivity of the soil. Conductivity is the measure of a material’s ability to pass electric current. For this, current is induced in the soil using two electrodes. The electrical potential drop is then read using two other electrodes. The study is being done at four places around the house. It is expected to continue on Friday as well. Meanwhile, the authorities had asked the residents of the house as well as those in three other adjacent houses to temporarily shift to other places. The team is expected to submit a report in a week. After the residents expressed concerns about the sound, Minister for Forests A.K. Saseendran, who is also the MLA from the Assembly constituency, visited the house. The special team was deputed following Mr. Saseendran’s request to Revenue Minister K. Rajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/electrical-resistivity-study-being-done-in-kuruvattur-house/article36890077.ece

Anupama said options were to be entered as per the order of a candidate’s preference. The rank was merely a tool to understand his or her possibilities in the options submitted. A student need not know the rank to give options. Moreover, the engineering scores had been published earlier. The rank list was delayed owing to the CBSE improvement results declared on September 30. The Government did not want this delay to have a bearing on the time available to students to look up the options available. Allotment, she pointed out, is done only after the option registration process is completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/boys-grab-top-ranks-in-keam-entrance-exam/article36890130.ece

Rajeeve told the Assembly on Thursday that the Government was extending all possible assistance to the public sector Kerala Automobiles Limited (KAL) to pull the stricken company out of the red and put it back on the rails. Replying to a submission moved by K. Ansalan, Mr. Rajeeve said the Government had drawn up plans to transform KAL into a major manufacturer of electric three-wheelers. Outlining the details of the crisis caused by the accumulation of financial liabilities, he said the company had run up huge arrears on the EPF and gratuity payments to employees for years. The EPF authority had initiated attachment proceedings on the company’s bank and treasury accounts to recover arrears to the tune of Rs. 5.87 cr. Retiring employees were also not paid gratuity from 2013. The arrears on this count totalled Rs. 2.9 cr, the Minister told the House. Attachment proceedings Mr. Rajeeve said KAL also owed Rs. 15.96 cr on loan and interest payment to the State Bank of India (SBI) and a private financing company. The Neyyattinkara sub court had initiated attachment proceedings of the company’s property in a case filed by the financier, while the SBI had dragged KAL to the Debt Recovery Tribunal. The Minister informed the House that the Government had extended financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 35 cr. over the last five years to help KAL install new machines and manufacture electric three-wheelers. An additional amount of Rs. 6 cr was provided to the company as assistance to tide over the COVID-induced crisis. Besides this, an outlay of Rs. 10 cr was provided in the Budget for the development and production of electric vehicles. Mr. Rajeeve said the Government had also approved the setting up of a new unit of KAL at Kannur to augment the production at the Thiruvananthapuram-based unit.

08 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State waives application fee for public services||The Cabinet on Thursday decided to waive the application fee for various government services. It also decided to simplify application forms and limit them to a single page. The fee waiver is only for public services. The government has not set aside the application fee for commercial and financial services. The Cabinet also ordered the simplification of the process for issuing various certificates to citizens. It has also pushed for rendering public services online to save citizens the trouble of visiting government offices. Certificates issued to the public can be used for multiple purposes and will have one-year validity. Government officials cannot specify that a certificate can be used only for a single stated purpose any more. Cabinet also removed the bidding that either a gazetted officer or notary attests a certificate as the original. Citizens could attest to the documents they submit for official purposes themselves. However, notarisation or attestation by a gazetted officer will remain mandatory for the economically weaker sections and SC/ST certificates. Nativity certificate Citizens born in Kerala or those who have studied in the State for five years will be eligible for nativity certificate. The village officer concerned will continue to be the issuing authority of nativity certificates of Keralites born outside the State. The Cabinet said Aadhaar cards, the latest KSEB bill, KWA bill, BSNL landline bill or building tax receipt could be submitted in lieu of residency certificate. Those who do not have such documents could present an attestation issued by the local self-government institution concerned. A separate minority certificate is not required for persons whose religion has been entered into their SSLC certificate. Village officers and tahsildars should dispose of applications for minority certificates within five days of their receipt. Central government pensioners can use the digital biometric system for availing themselves of the services under the Jeevan Praman scheme. The biometric system is installed in banks and treasuries in the State. Those seeking “one and the same certification” need to have their application attested by a gazetted officer. Ration card, school leaving certificate, passport, Aadhaar care or birth certificate will suffice as their certificates. Similarly, a couple could prove intercaste marriage by presenting their SSLC certificates mentioning their caste along with the marriage registration certificate. They would not require a separate inter-caste or inter-religious marriage certificate to avail themselves of the benefits and protection due for such couples. Citizens without identification-proving documents can get an identification certificate if a gazetted officer endorses their claim on a photo-affixed petition. Caste certificate SSLC certificate mentioning caste can be treated as a caste certificate akin to the one issued routinely by the village officer or tahsildar. Home Department certification for those seeking to apply for jobs abroad will soon be made available online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cabinet-makes-certification-application-process-simpler/article36890071.ece

Thinkal menstrual cups will be distributed among 10,000 women in the coastal wards of Valiyathura and Shanghumughom and the urban wards of Peroorkada and Kowdiar under the city Corporation in the first phase of the programme. The project has been implemented in Alappuzha and Kochi earlier, but is being implemented on such a scale for the first time. “It is a pioneering initiative,” said HMA chief executive officer Anitha Thampi. Awareness generation with the support of medical professionals is also part of Thinkal so that women can understand what menstrual cups are, how they are used and their benefits. Generating awareness Another advantage, Ms. Thampi said, was that using the cups created awareness among women about their bodies, helping them overcome restrictions and making them feel more confident. Inaugurating Thinkal, Minister for Health Veena George said: “Menstrual cup is a game changer, especially in helping women travel freely during their periods. It is a much healthier option and is environment-friendly,” she said. Ms. George handed over the Thinkal M-cups to 10 women representing the four wards where the project is being implemented. “If 10,000 women use these cups continuously for five years, it will lead to a reduction of almost 200 tonne of sanitary napkin waste,” Ms. George said. Minister for Transport Antony Raju released an M-Cup awareness booklet by handing over copies to councillors of the four wards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-launches-menstrual-hygiene-initiative-thinkal/article36890352.ece

Rajeeve has said the cashew industries in the State is in a serious crisis and that the Government will have to take stringent measures to ensure that cashew factories under the Cashew Development Corporation and CAPEX were run professionally and profitably. Replying to a calling attention motion on the crisis in the cashew industries raised by legislator G. S. Jayalal in the Assembly here on Thursday, Mr. Rajeeve said the State set up the Kerala Cashew Board in 2017 after the Cashew Corporation and CAPEX were in dire straits financially, with either unable to take further bank loans. However, the situation now is such that the board is ending up in the same financial mess that CAPEX and the Cashew Corporation were in. The board is procuring raw cashew nuts and giving it free of cost to the Corporation and CAPEX for processing in its factories. But these two institutions are not giving any returns to the board. Mr. Rajeeve said that it was the unprofessional manner in which the Corporation and CAPEX were being run that had resulted in this crisis. The Government is in the process of drawing up a one-time loan settlement formula with banks for cashew factory owners in the private sector, which is expected to materialise within a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cashew-industry-in-the-red-rajeeve/article36890118.ece

08 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Wildlife attacks: Oppn. seeks enhanced damages||The United Democratic Front (UDF) urged the Government to enhance the compensation for victims of man-animal conflict. Seeking the leave of the House to introduce an adjournment motion for an emergency debate on the issue on Thursday, Congress legislator Sunny Joseph said a wild elephant had on September 26 stomped to death Justin, a rubber tapper, at Peravur. Justin’s wife was seriously injured and is on life support. As per the State’s compensation package, Justin’s family would receive not more than Rs. 10 lakh as ex gratia indemnity for the his death. His wife would receive a mere Rs. 2 lakh if she survives the attack. Farmers across the State lose crops to raiding elephants and boars. The Government’s compensation of Rs. 11,000 for a hectare of paddy lost to wild animals, or Rs. 330 for a rubber tree or Rs. 150 for a plantain barely sufficed to cover the farmers’ loss. Ideally, the Government should set up a tribunal to gauge loss of life, injury and destruction of property and decide an appropriate award. Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran said the Government would enhance the budgetary allocation for compensating victims of man-animal conflict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wildlife-attacks-oppn-seeks-enhanced-damages/article36890128.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A faithful but pointless effort||A sheer lack of excitement marks the act of driving through an overly familiar route, where one can navigate around every pothole and blind turn mechanically, without troubling the brain much. There is something similar about watching a remake, even if the original is one of the most exciting thrillers made in the country in recent years. Especially so, if the remake does not try too hard and settles to recreating scenes, almost as a carbon copier. In Andhadhun released in 2018, director and screenwriter Sriram Raghavan pulled out one trick after another from his bag to surprise the audience who assumes at every point that they have figured it all out. Ravi K. Chandran has the comfortable cushion of that inventive script while making Bhramam . Survival tool For musician Ray Mathews (Prithviraj Sukumaran), his 'blindness' is an effective tool for survival. When yesteryear star Udayakumar (Shankar) invites him to his house to give a musical as an anniversary surprise to his wife Simi (Mamta Mohandas), Ray does not have a clue what is in store. Mr. Chandran chooses to place Bhramam in Fort Kochi. Despite the place markers, it somehow does not feel like a film set in Kerala, in spite of certain references such as serial killer Jolly Joseph (Koodathayi case) and CID Ramdas getting thrown in. The failure to imbibe the soul of the place is also reflected in how it falls short of capturing the soul of the original film. This happens despite the film recreating almost every scene as such from the original, including the brilliantly written centre-piece sequence of a murder and its cover-up, all accompanied by some pleasant piano music. One of the more obvious ways in which the film falls short is in its performances. Tabu and Ayushmann  Khurrana had set the bar so high, revelling in the unpredictable and wicked characters given to them, that it is hard to match them. Gets right One thing Bhramam gets right is in using actor Shankar's own past as a film star to flesh out the character of Udayakumar, who often takes nostalgic trips to his days as an on-screen hero and scrolls through YouTube to see what the current generation talks about him. But, in the scheme of the film, this is just a minor detail. It is natural that one would think about the whole purpose of this remake, when there is no attempt to give a fresh or unique take. For someone who has already watched Andhadhun , the remake would be a pointless exercise in identifying all the shortcomings. But, for a viewer who has not watched the original, the script that is filled with surprises, can still make it an exciting watch, despite some obvious shortcomings. S.R.

The police said the investigating officer of the case from the All Women Police Station, Coimbatore Central, filed a petition before the Principal District Judge on Thursday seeking the custody of the accused, Amitesh Harmukh, 29. A senior police officer said the Additional Mahila Court on September 30 had ordered that the accused be handed over to the custody of the IAF. “The court handed over the accused to the IAF’s custody. The case has not been transferred to the IAF. The police are investigating the woman officer’s complaint. Now we are challenging the lower court’s decision on the custody of the accused,” said the officer. According to the officer, the plea challenges the custody of the accused which the IAF claimed under Section 124 of the Air Force Act, 1950, which deals with the ‘choice between criminal court and court-martial’. “The IAF is yet to form a court martial. Similarly, the police are yet to file a charge sheet in the case. The contention of the police is that it is premature to give the accused to the IAF’s custody,” the officer said. Another officer privy to the investigation said a bed sheet, which is suspected to have the semen stains of the accused, was sent to a government forensic lab for analysis. Witness gives statement As per the First Information Report filed by the police, the alleged incident took place at the room of the woman officer on the campus of the Air Force Administrative College, Coimbatore, on September 10. It says the accused trespassed into her room and committed the crime. The police said a woman officer, a batchmate of the survivor, on Thursday gave a statement before the Additional Mahila Court. She is one of the witnesses in the case, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tn-police-challenge-iaf-custody-of-officer-in-rape-case/article36889675.ece

Sources said the State government will ask fresh terms of reference to the existing Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal - II to reallocate water between Telangana and AP only after the copy was received. The government will not involve Karnataka and Maharashtra though the two States were also made party when the petition was filed in 2015. The Centre had offered to refer the request of Telangana to a water disputes tribunal if the State government had withdrawn its case in the Apex court. It was shortly after formation of the State in 2014 that the Telangana government had made out a case to the Centre seeking reallocation of water between the four States but there was no response for over a year. As a result, Telangana moved the court in 2015. Telangana had made a detailed case listing out the injustice to the region in water sharing in the combined State. It was highlighted that the new State had only 35 % share in water though the river flowed 68.5 % of its full course in Telangana. Of the total ayacut in the river basin in the combined State, Telangana’s share was 62.5 % and Andhra Pradesh had 37.5 % but enjoyed 65 % water share. The indifference of the Centre was brought to the notice of Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at the Apex Council meeting on river water disputes between AP and Telangana last year when the Minister expressed helplessness on referring the matter to the tribunal in view of the court case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ts-for-fresh-terms-of-reference-to-kwdt/article36890061.ece

08 October 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. initiatives brought SHGs out of the red, says Jagan||Sick self-help groups (SHGs) in the State have made a turnaround, thanks to a series of steps taken by the “women-friendly government” to free them from mounting debts in phases and revive economic activity, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said. Announcing the release of the second of the four-tranche financial assistance of Rs. 6,440 crore of the total Rs. 25,517 crore under YSR Aasara scheme here on Thursday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the government was committed to giving a fillip to the SHG movement. “The series of initiatives such as pacts with leading banks and FMCG firms, which include P&G, ITC, Reliance, HUL, Allana, Mahendra Group, Kheyti Group and Tanager, and providing technical, banking and marketing assistance and training facilities are aimed at bringing back smiles on the faces of SHG members,” he said. The amount would be credited to the bank accounts of the members between October 7 and 18, except in Kadapa district where the model code of conduct was in force in view of the Badvel byelection. “The SHGs in Kadapa district will get the financial assistance between November 6 and 15,” he added. The SHGs, which had been downgraded to ‘C’ and ‘D’ by the credit rating agencies during the TDP term, bounced back to Grade A, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. Interest-free loan “More than 3.05 lakh women are now able to run viable economic ventures getting an additional monthly income of Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 10,000, thanks to the hand-holding provided by the government,” he said. The interest-free loan scheme that had been scrapped by the TDP government was also revived, he added. The bank accounts of 98 lakh women had been credited with Rs. 2,362 crore under the ‘YSR Sunna Vaddi’ scheme. So far, more than 78 lakh women had received financial assistance of Rs. 12,759 crore, he said. Tie-up with Amul Making a particular mention of the tie-up with Amul, the Chief Minister said dairy farmers got an additional income ranging from Rs. 5 to Rs. 15 per litre of milk due to increase in competition among dairy majors. About 18.36% SHGs had become bankrupt during the TDP regime due to its failure to keep its poll promise of loan waiver, which forced the SHGs to pay about Rs. 3,036 crore as penal interest, he said. The non-performing assets of the banks had come down to 0.73%, thanks to the recovery rate of loans advanced to the SHGs going up to over 99.5%, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-initiatives-brought-shgs-out-of-the-red-says-jagan/article36889684.ece

08 October 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC to govt.: file counter on waiver of Governor’s sovereign power||The Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice N. Jayasurya, has directed the government to file a counter affidavit within seven days stating its position on the alleged waiver of the sovereign power of the Governor in the process of raising a loan of Rs. 25,000 crore through the AP State Development Corporation (APSDC) and other matters connected thereto. The court also sought clarity on the government’s stand on the validity of the agreements being entered into by it with the APSDC and the banks for availing loan facilities, mortgaging government properties such as the offices of District Collectors and MRO and college buildings, and the guarantee being offered for such loans. Appearing for the State, senior advocate Dushyant Dave maintained that the government neither violated the regulations of the RBI nor was the establishment of APSDC against Articles 21, 204 and 266 of the Constitution as claimed by the petitioners. He argued that the case was politically motivated as one of the petitioners, Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu, was an incumbent MLA of the TDP representing Visakhapatnam East constituency. Further, he insisted that banks were reluctant to give loans because of the representations being submitted by some “public spirited citizens.” The petitioner’s advocate, Y. Balaji, said the Governor’s sovereign power under Article 361 of the Constitution had been waived by the State government in giving guarantee to banks for the Rs. 25,000 crore loan raised by it. He asserted that the APSDC had no income, and therefore, there was every possibility of loans being taken through it turning into non-performing assets in the future. After hearing the matter, the court adjourned the case to October 21 while ordering that Mr. Dave and others file counters in one week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-to-govt-file-counter-on-waiver-of-governors-sovereign-power/article36890178.ece

A team from the city committee, led by secretary B. Ganga Rao, met the Commissioner on Thursday and submitted a memorandum to him on the issue. Mr. Ganga Rao said that the about 10,000 citizens had submitted their written suggestions and objections on the plan. The officials had informed that field-level enquiries were being made for the past two months, on the issues raised by the citizens. He sought that before the approval of the draft plan, discussions should be held on the objections and suggestions. The draft plan would be valid for the next 20 years. It covers an area of 4,873 square km and covers a population of 4.07 million. The density of population is 819 per km. This was more that the national density of 382 and the State density of 308 by about three times. It encompasses four municipalities, cities and 896 villages and 35 rural mandals. He sought that the objections and suggestions made by the people and the decision taken on them by the VMRDA should be kept in public domain. He said that since elections to the Gram Panchayats, Mandal and Zilla Parishads have also been held recently and the governing bodies have been elected to the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) and municipalities, the opinion of the elected representatives should also be taken. He noted that the zonal development plans were not approved. All these should be kept in public domain and the suggestions should be taken before finalising the draft. Mr. Ganga Rao said that the Commissioner had agreed to take the issue to the notice of the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/receive-feedback-from-people-again-on-draft-plan-cpim-urges-vmrda/article36890223.ece

The plant, established at a cost of Rs. 130 lakh, under the PM Cares Fund, has a capacity of 1,000 LPM (Litres Per Minute). The civil works were executed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and equipment provided by the Union government. Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s vision was to strengthen the healthcare sector in the State. The new facility would ensure availability of oxygen to 100 of the 300 beds at the chest hospital, eliminating the need to have separate oxygen cylinders. He said that people of East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts depend on Visakhapatnam city for their medical needs. Though the need for oxygen was not felt during the first wave of COVID-19, it was unfortunate that several deaths had occurred due to acute scarcity of oxygen during the second wave. While expressing hope that there would be no third wave, he said that the State government was prepared to deal with the situation. He appealed to the citizens to observe social distance, wear masks in public places and observe all COVID-19 protocols, without becoming complacent during the festival season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/muttamsetti-inaugurates-oxygen-plant-at-chest-hospital/article36890391.ece
08 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP indulging in double talk on mortgage of govt. land, says CPI(M)||The BJP leaders objecting to the ‘mortgage’ of government land and public assets in the city by the YSR Congress Party government to raise loans to fund welfare schemes, is ‘ridiculous’, says CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao. While condemning the State government for mortgaging public assets, he said in a statement on Thursday that BJP MLC P.V.N. Madhav, former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju and others condemning the move was absurd. The BJP government had put up public assets, worth Rs. 6 lakh crore, for sale. It had directed the State government to appoint Nodal Officers and train them to execute the sale. The Centre had also suggested to the State governments that they could sell lands in villages also apart from cities and towns, he said. The BJP leaders have lost the moral right to question such moves as the BJP government itself was encouraging the States to sell public assets, he said. He alleged that the ground has been prepared for the sale of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to a foreign company. It was like a case of the ‘pot calling the kettle black’, he said. Mr. Narasinga Rao called upon workers and all sections of the people to prepare for long-drawn struggles against the ‘anti-worker’, ‘anti-people’ and ‘pro-corporate’ policies of the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-indulging-in-double-talk-on-mortgage-of-govt-land-says-cpim/article36890387.ece

08 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Probe reveals mass trafficking of women from Bangladesh||Investigation into the international prostitution racket busted by the Hyderabad city police revealed a mass trafficking of women from Bangladesh to the country. The S.R. Nagar police who registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Foreigners Act and Passport Act against seven persons, including five women, were surprised to find that an international prostitution racket was running in their own backyard. Speaking to The Hindu, a senior officer in the West Zone said the victims, who were also accused of crossing the India-Bangladesh border and securing Indian documents illegally, came to Hyderabad from Kolkata via Mumbai. “After crossing the border with the help of their agents, the women board flights to Mumbai from Kolkata. From there, they are dispersed to Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Vijayawada and other southern cities,” he said. He said that four women and three men were arrested from a house in S.R. Nagar. “They were lured with money and brought illegally to India from Bangladesh by traffickers who pay them anywhere between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 30,000 per month,” he said, adding that a woman also works at a massage parlour in the city and from there she manages to ‘lure’ the clients. The prime accused in the city reportedly told police that in the past few months, he along with other agents trafficked hundreds of women to India. “It is a case of national interest as this gang alone managed to get a large number of women to Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and other cities from Bangladesh,” the officer said. On Tuesday, the sleuths of the Commissioner’s Task Force (North Zone) team led by inspector K Nageswar Rao apprehended seven persons, including six Bangladeshis and a trafficker from West Bengal. The accused, Khausurdas Nurmohmad Kholiba alias Khausurdas (35), Nahida Khausurdas Kholiba alias Nahida Khathuni (21), Kachi Musharef Sardar (32), Sume Biswas alias Nurjahan Khanam (24), Lata Shekh alias Lota Akter (25), Tisha Biswas alias Sufiya Begum (40), all native of Bangladesh, and Atiyar Mondal (37), trafficking agent from West Bengal. Police seized five Bangladesh National ID Cards, a Bangladesh Passport photocopy, four forged Aadhaar cards and 10 mobile phones. The accused Khausurdas Nurmohmad Kholiba and his wife Nahida Khausurdas Kholiba illegally entered India a few years ago stayed in Mumbai, and came to Hyderabad recently to organising prostitution with their fellow Bangladeshi women, Officer on Special Duty (Task Force) P. Radhakishan Rao said. “They were organising flesh trade in the city,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/probe-reveals-mass-trafficking-of-women-from-bangladesh/article36890051.ece
08 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||No end to woes of residents near Shukur Sagar lake||Amer Arif navigates his autorickshaw slowly from his marooned house to the main road on the edge of Shukur Sagar lake. As the vehicle lurches from side-to-side, it appears as if it will tumble into the water but manages to reach high ground. The road is actually a duckweed covered water channel after the recent flooding. “I start my day like this and repeat it in the evening. I have no choice as the rent here is Rs. 2,500. In other places, it is three times that,” says Mr. Arif, who has been living in the same house for three years. Last year, the family used a ladder to go in and out of the house after their courtyard remained under water for five months post heavy rains. For the second year in a row, the residents of houses abutting the Shukur Sagar lake have been forced to move to the houses of their relatives or friends. For Mohammed Salahuddin and his family, it is as if the water was chasing him. “After the water receded last year, we changed doors. Repaired furniture. Bought beds but again the water rose and flooded our house. My family moved to my in-laws’ place in Al Jubail Colony. That house also got flooded. Now, I am living with my relatives at Saidabad,” says Mr. Salahuddin, who drives a cab for a living. The ownership of his house is marked by the cellphone number on its freshly painted wall. Locked doors, scrawled cellphone numbers on walls and afternoon visits are the norm in the area. Rows of houses and streets have been deserted after the second round of flooding this year. “We barely make ends meet. This flooding and destruction have added to the cost. The government should build a 14-foot high embankment. Only then, we will feel safe,” says Mr. Arif. This disquiet about the lake level has forced the police to mount a 24-hour vigil on the sluice gate and the embankment on the Venkatapur side. “We are afraid someone may do some mischief and that’s why this picket has been posted,” informs a police official guarding the entrance to the road to the temple on the embankment. A few months back, an embankment was built on the western side to protect the localities but now the earthen work lies under water. With the creation of the post of special commissioner (lakes), the residents living on the edge of the Shukur Sagar lake as well as other water bodies can see some action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-end-to-woes-of-residents-near-shukur-sagar-lake/article36890035.ece
08 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CID probe into encroachment of wakf lands: CM||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has announced his Government’s resolve to institute an inquiry by the Crime Investigation Department into encroachment of wakf lands. “I will issues orders soon ordering a probe by the CID into Wakf lands issue,” the Chief Minister said. He was responding to a request made by the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen members during the debate on Palle and Pattana Pragati programmes in the Assembly on Thursday. He said the government had already taken several measures to protect wakf and endowments lands. These lands were frozen in the Dharani portal so that no transactions or registrations were allowed on these lands. The Chief Minister however rejected the request by members to give more time for the traders and workers at Gaddiannaram fruit market which was being vacated for the construction of a super speciality hospital there. Keeping in view the fact that there was need to improve hospital infrastructure in the State, the government had decided to construct three more hospitals on the lines of Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) in Gachibowli. The intention was to create hospitals with bed strength of around 6,000 to 8,000 with all the infrastructure and amenities like oxygen beds to cater to the needs of people. He recalled how the government had improved the infrastructure in the light of COVID-19 pandemic in the past few months and said from 7,000 beds with oxygen facility, the number had not gone up to 27,000 in different hospitals. Steps were taken to enhance oxygen generating capacity rather than depending on others for supply of cylinders and it would soon reach 500 tonne mark. Schemes like Mission Bhagiratha launched by the State Government received acclaim from different States as well as the Centre and it had brought down the spread of communicable diseases significantly. Nalgonda district which was known for its fluoride cases had now been declared fluoride-free district by the Centre after the launch of Mission Bhagiratha. “NITI Ayog was impressed by the one of its kind scheme (Mission Bhagiratha) so much that it recommended release of Rs. 24,000 crore for the scheme. The Centre, however, did not release any funds,” he lamented. The Centre had also in fact cut down the Finance Commission’s recommendation for release of funds for rural development by 25 per cent. As a result, releases to local bodies came down from Rs. 1,847 crore to Rs. 1,340 crore,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cid-probe-into-encroachment-of-wakf-lands-cm/article36890058.ece
08 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Four flyovers to come up near Uppal junction||GHMC is all set to begin construction of a set of flyovers near Uppal junction, as part of the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP). With the aim of easing congestion resulting from convergence of vehicle traffic from all sides, the GHMC is taking up construction of four flyovers near the junction. The structures are necessary also in view of the elevated corridor under construction by the Roads & Buildings department on behalf of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The four lane 6.25-kilometre long elevated corridor is being built from Narapally up to Uppal junction. Besides, the NHAI is also taking up another 1.5 kilometre flyover in Amberpet, which will facilitate unhindered flow of traffic arriving at the junction from the Ramanthapur side. The State government requested the NHAI, to no avail, to extend the elevated corridor over the Uppal junction, in order to avoid large amount of traffic getting dumped at the junction. “They didn’t agree. Instead, it has been agreed upon that the corridor will be left short of reaching Uppal junction, without construction of the down ramp. From there, GHMC will take up the portion up to Ramanthapur, where the ramp will be descended,” an engineer from GHMC informed. GHMC’s portion of elevated corridor will come to over a kilometre in length. This apart, two more flyovers are planned on the Inner Ring Road parallel to the Metro Rail corridor above the junction, with a length of 445 metres. The fourth flyover is planned with a steep curve, from Ramanthapur towards Uppal Stadium road, with a length of 440 metres. Though GHMC is the primary executing agency for all the SRDP components, work at the Uppal junction had been handed over to the HMDA initially upon instructions from Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao, as HMDA was the executing agency for constructing a walk way at the junction. While the elevated corridor work on the part of NHAI had been progressing at a rapid pace for the last two years, HMDA had not started the work. Concerned over the delay, Mr. Rama Rao reportedly asked GHMC to take over the works from HMDA, after which tenders have been called and works have been handed over. Officials say that the structures may take well over two years for completion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/four-flyovers-to-come-up-near-uppal-junction/article36890037.ece
08 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Akademi fraud mastermind got Rs. 20 cr.||A whopping Rs. 20 crore was swindled by the mastermind Chunduri Venkata Koti Sai Kumar, 49, in Rs. 64.50 crore Telugu Akademi fixed deposit fraud. Others who siphoned off a large amount of money are -- Chairman and Managing Director of A.P. Mercantile Cooperative Credit Society Ltd., Vijayawada, B.V.V.N. Satyanarayana Rao, and realtor Nandui Venkata Raman, 50, Rs. 10 crore and Rs. 7 crore, respectively. While Sai Kumar and Raman were partners in the fraud, Rao got the share for parking the money in his society by creating a fake account in the name of Telugu Akademi. In his remand report submitted to XII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad Central Crime Station, Assistant Commissioner of Police (WCO) K Manoj Kumar stated that based on their preliminary investigation, they found out how much amount all the accused shared between January 2021 and August 2021. He said that Union Bank of India chief manager Shaik Mastanvali Saheb and Canara Bank’s Santosh Nagar branch manager M. Sadhana received Rs. 2.5 crore and Rs. 1.99 crore respectively, on regular intervals. Absconding accused persons Krishna Reddy from Miyapur and Ramana Reddy got Rs. 6 crore each, Bhoopathi from Nagole got Rs. 2.5 crore, Padmanaban from Chennai and Yohan Raju from Vijayawada was given a share of Rs. 50 lakh each, and Mandan from Shiridi, Maharashtra, got Rs. 30 lakh from the fraud money. However, there was no mention of the amount received by Akademi’s Administrative Officer and in-charge accounts officer Segoori Ramesh, in the remand report. The ACP also informed the court that confessional statements of the accused were not recorded due to lack of time while the role of each person involved in the case is yet to be ascertained. “The amount distributed between the accused has to be recovered, and a few persons are still at large. And the bank statements of the accused are to be collected,” the officer stated in the remand report. Further, he requested the court to remand the accused in judicial custody for 15 days, so as to enable them to proceed further with the investigation as they might tamper with the evidence and that difficulties might further arise in the investigation. The investigation agency has to examine several documents from the office of APMCCS, UBI and Canara Bank to establish how the amounts have been transferred to Agrasen Cooperative Bank. The mastermind Sai Kumar, a realtor from the city, was previously involved in similar offences in Andhra Pradesh and Chennai. He withdrew the FDRs of AP Minority Welfare Society in 2012 and the case is being investigated by the Crime Investigation Department (CID). Sai Kumar was also accused in AP Housing Board Scam of nearly Rs. 6 crore and Rs. 25 crore FDR fraud of Northern Coal Fields in Chennai, both cases are being investigated by the CBI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telugu-akademi-fraud-mastermind-got-rs-20-crore/article36889929.ece

Reddy along with other accused was found to be using electronic chips to manipulate the discharge of fuel in a manner that less fuel was dispensed than what was shown on the display and receipt. Reddy was hired by the contractor who took Hakimpet TSRTC pump on lease. “They were causing loss of crores of rupees to consumers by delivering less fuel,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Balanagar zone) P.V. Padmaja said. The Special Operations Team of Balanagar Zone led by DCP G. Sandeep got inputs about the installation of chips (ICs), which were programmed with manipulated software in petrol stations with the connivance of the station management and causing heavy loss to the customers. Apart from Hyderabad and surrounding areas, the gang had manipulated pumps in Kamareddy, Khammam, Wanaparthy, Suryapet, Siddipet, and other districts in Telangana. The other arrested persons are MD Faizul Bari, 46, a mechanic from Jagathgirigutta, Kurade Sandeep, 38, from Alwal, MD Aslam, 29, from Chandrayangutta, Kalimera Narsinga Rao from Bhongir and petrol station owners/managers - Rangu Ramesh, 39, manager of IOC Hari Hara Bunk, Pudur, Beeravelli Maheshwar Rao, 49, a supervisor at GMR filling station, Mailardevpally, and Nagandla Venkatesh, 28, owner of two bunks at Jedimetla and Shamshabad. According to Ms. Padmaja, the first four accused worked as petrol bunk pump mechanics for a long time at various bunks and got themselves familiar with the machines. “Soon they became experts in the installation of manipulated chips in fuel-dispensing machines which delivers less petrol than the actual display and purchased the manipulated software from Jayesh of Surat in Gujarat and started programming the chips,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fuel-pilfering-gang-busted-eight-taken-into-custody/article36890044.ece
08 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Path-breaking intervention against child labour||It started off as yet another initiative launched by a new Collector but none would have realised that in 90-days a record breaking effort brought laurels to the agriculture-rich Nizamabad district. The successful intervention against child labour in Velpur mandal of the district by then Collector G. Asok Kumar has been showcased at every available forum including international platforms on how concerted efforts can bring the smiles back on the young children. Earlier this week, the path-breaking effort completed 20-years and still Velpur, a progressive agriculture village in Armoor sub-division stands out for making the mandal child labour-free. To commemorate the occasion, VV Giri National Labour Institute, under the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment is organising a workshop on Friday in Nizamabad. Dream come true Mr. Asok Kumar, presently Additional Secretary, Ministry of Jal Shakti, who was the Collector in 2001 said: “the successful drive against child-labour practices in Nizamabad were the outcome of a dream translated into action.” The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) of the Union Government had identified this district as a child labour- prone district and had started 34 NCLP schools in the district in 1994 itself. An intensive 90 days’ drive, starting from July 9, 2001, was taken up in the mandal under the leadership of the then Collector. On October 2, 2001 Velpur was declared as a child labour free mandal. All the 8057 children in the mandal were in schools. The village community played a key role. All gram panchayats passed formal resolutions banning child labour in all forms and undertook to send all children to schools. They decided to ostracize anybody who employs a child for work. 800 back in schools This included the 800 plus children brought back to schools and the nine mentally retarded children identified during the drive and admitted to an institution catering to them. The villagers not only wrote off almost Rs. 37 lakh, which were taken as loans keeping these children as guarantee and was due from their parents, but also provided books and dresses for these children to join the schools. About 1400 girls were studying in the 34 non-residential bridge schools of the project in the district in 2001. Mr. Asok Kumar said the close monitoring and daily feedback by the team in the field helped in making course corrections and changing strategies suited to various situations arising in the field on a day-to-day basis. These efforts culminated in making Veilpur a child labor free mandal—having ALL 5-15 year old children in schools, he said with a sense of satisfaction. Even after 20 years, the mandal is child-labour free and there is 100 per cent retention in schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/path-breaking-intervention-against-child-labour/article36890055.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao has said the Centre is attempting to usurp the powers of the States and asserted that he would fight with the Centre to safeguard the rights of the State. The Central Government which took away taxes collected by the State in the name of the Goods and Services Tax tried to include petrol and diesel prices under the GST regime. “The Centre however relented as the Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled States opposed the moves during the recent GST Council meeting held in Lucknow,” he said. He reiterated that the State was among the top four contributors to the GDP and the RBI itself had confirmed this. “More funds were going from the State to the Centre. What we get from the Centre is very less,” he said. He was replying to a debate on Palle and Pattana Pragati programmes that came up as short discussion in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. He asserted that the allocations from the Centre were part of the recommendations made by the Finance Commission. The Centre was not doling out any largesse on the State and it was discharging its constitutional obligations by releasing funds. “Such funds are our right and they will come automatically,” he said. He recalled how he submitted several representations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu, who was then Urban Development Minister, seeking funds for development of Hyderabad which was among the cities that were considered face of the country. “But there is no response from the Centre,” he lamented. Explaining the significant growth of agricultural produce in the State due to the proactive steps initiated by the government, Mr. Rao, however, lamented that the Centre was refusing to purchase foodgrains from the State. The government was waiting for response from the Centre in this regard and alternatives would be announced if the Centre did not relent from its stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-usurping-states-rights/article36890056.ece

He said that in the past few months, dozens of women were trafficked to Hyderabad and surrounding areas from Kolkata via Mumbai. Recently, three women came to the city to indulge in flesh trade. “Most of them come to India illegally, stay here for a few months and go back to Bangladesh after earning some money for the survival of their families, and come back again,” the officer said. It is also learnt that the organiser, who was caught by the Hyderabad police, migrated to India a few years ago and helped several people cross the international border illegally.

According to Association for Socio Economic Empowerment of Marginalised (ASEEM), which links people with welfare schemes, applicants have been facing problems in opening accounts that do not require a minimum monthly balance to be maintained. “Some public sector bank branches at Khairatabad, Rein Bazaar, Mandi Mir Alam, Chandulal Baradari and Punjagutta, were unwilling to open such accounts. Maintenance of accounts is a concern for banks but the RBI has issued instructions for opening of Basic Savings Bank Deposit accounts and they are free from minimum balance criteria. We have written a letter to the Lead District Manager (LDM) of SLBC, who has given us a positive response,” an office-bearer of ASEEM said. The LDM, in turn, escalated the issue to controllers, district coordinators and branch heads of bank branches. LDM S. Ravi Shankar Tagore said, “Now, there are no problems. Applicants can approach a customer service point for help.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/some-banks-unwilling-to-open-no-frills-accounts/article36890041.ece
08 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Developing urban areas as growth engines: KTR||Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao has said that the State Government focussed on development of urban areas treating them as growth engines of the economy. Urban areas which constitute only 3 per cent of the total area of the State were accommodating over 45 per cent population and contributing to 70 per cent of the GSDP. “Urban areas constitute 2,700 sq.km of the 1.12 lakh sq.km State area. But they are contributing the bulk of the GSDP,” he said. Accordingly, focus was on ensuring their accelerated development. Regarding the GHMC development, he said works like Strategic Road Development Programme, Central Road Maintenance Programme, construction of underpasses, elevated corridors and others were taken up to give facelift to the city. The Urban administration underwent a metamorphosis under the present government with the objective of making the cities and towns futuristic. “We have spent Rs. 67,500 crore on development. The change is visible. There is lot more to do,” he said. Participating in the debate on Palle and Pattana Pragati in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, he said while huge amounts were being spent on improving infrastructure, the government took steps to ensure that nalas network as well as sewerage treatment systems were strengthened. The State Cabinet had allotted Rs. 3,866 crore for ensuring that the solid and liquid wastes being generated were treated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/developing-urban-areas-as-growth-engines-ktr/article36890060.ece

08 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||2nd phase of engineering counselling after Dasara||The second phase of engineering counselling will begin only after Dasara, as officials are waiting for the counselling of students into NITs and IITs to begin first. “We will start the second phase of counselling only after at least two phases of JEE counselling are completed so that the seats are not wasted in the top colleges here,” a senior official said. Lot of students, particularly those in the top 2,000 ranks in EAMCET, leave the allotted colleges once JEE counselling begins. Most of these students get into some course in NITs or IITs. It makes sense to conduct second phase only after minimum two phases are over. Seats vacated by those opting for NITs and IITs would be open for candidates preferring local engineering colleges. The sliding in the second phase helps them to opt for a better college or the choice of their course. Unlike private colleges that have the option of filling vacant seats of convenor quota through candidates who are admitted through management quota, seats in government colleges go waste if candidates leave for IITs and NITs after the second phase. Government colleges lack the luxury of management quota and every year, a lot of seats in government colleges go waste. This year, nearly 34,000 engineering seats will be on offer in the second phase of counselling and this number will increase once the top students vacate their seats to move into IITs and NITs. About 18,000 seats remained vacant after the first round of allotment while another 15,000 did not report to the colleges even though seats were allotted to them. While toppers who are confident of securing a seat in IITs and NITs stayed away from reporting, some others not happy with the allotted colleges also preferred not to join.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/2nd-phase-of-engineering-counselling-after-dasara/article36890033.ece
08 October 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||HC permits minor’s pregnancy termination plea||A woman has right to make a choice to carry pregnancy. She also has a right not to carry pregnancy albeit subject to conditions and restrictions under Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act-1971. Making this observation, Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy of Telangana High Court passed an order permitting a 16-year-old to get her pregnancy terminated. The minor was impregnated by a member of her extended family. The accused emotionally abused and sexually exploited the minor. With the accused warning of dire consequences, the hapless minor did not reveal the sexual assault to her parents. He even threatened to kill her mother. The latter eventually approached the police who arrested him. Doctors of a private hospital who checked the minor said the gestational age of the foetus was 25 weeks based on foetal biometry. The minor and her parents approached a government hospital in Hyderabad for termination of the pregnancy as the minor was not in a position to bear the child physically, mentally and financially. The hospital authorities, however, rejected their request as termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks was not permissible by the Act. The minor, through her mother, knocked the doors of the HC by filing a writ petition seeking a direction to the hospital to terminate her pregnancy. A medical board, which examined the minor following the court instructions, said the minor was fit for termination of pregnancy. It noted that, however, she may have complications endangering her life if pregnancy was terminated. The judge observed that the courts were empowered to direct termination of pregnancy though the MTP Act prohibits it if foetus gestation period was more than 24 weeks. “If the petitioner was compelled to continue with pregnancy caused by rape, it would infringe her right to life guaranteed by the Constitution,” the judge said in his order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-permits-minors-pregnancy-termination-plea/article36890063.ece

08 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC sets aside JNTU-H affiliation regulation||The Telangana High Court had passed interim directions setting aside the regulations of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTU-H) that private engineering colleges should take permission from State government to start new courses or increase intake of students in courses. A Bench of Justices A. Rajasheker Reddy and T. Vinod Kumar of the HC issued the directions after hearing a batch of writ petitions challenging JNTU-H’s regulation no. 345556 filed by groups of 11 engineering colleges. The Bench also instructed JNTU-H to grant affiliation to the colleges which filed writ petitions. The JNTU-H’s regulations mandated that an engineering college, new or existing one, should secure a No Objection Certificate or permission from the State government to start a new programme. JNTU-H standing counsel V. Ramchander Goud argued that Section 20 of Telangana Education Act-1982 empowered State government to permit establishment of educational institutions. This included the power to accord permission to start new courses in an institution, he contended. He said that the State government was the competent authority to prepare a ‘perspective plan’ every three to four years by conducting survey for identification of locality-wise educational needs. The plan envisages guidelines to check mushrooming of sub-standard technical educational institutions, he said. Senior counsel S. Niranjan Reddy, appearing for the petitioners, contended that it was for the All India Council for Technical Education to take a call on commencement of new colleges or programmes in colleges in all parts of the country. State government had no role to play in the matter, he told the court. Citing the case of JNTU-H vs Sangam Laxmi Bai Vidyapeeth and others, the JNTU-H counsel said the Supreme Court upheld similar regulations of the university. It also upheld the power of State government to issue a NOC or permission to start a new college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-sets-aside-jntu-h-affiliation-regulation/article36890031.ece

In a packed schedule, starting with inauguration of a private multi-speciality hospital in the town, she visited the Indian Red Cross Society’s branch office, offered prayers at an ancient temple and in the capacity of Chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University, participated in various events, besides giving an ear to the grievances of voluntary and people’s organisations. Dr. Soundararajan praised IRCS Nalgonda for its humanitarian role during the pandemic. As the State president of IRCS, she remembered the selfless service of the branch and its manager V. Srinivasulu, who succumbed to the virus. Joined by Nalgonda MP Uttam Kumar Reddy and G. Amarender Reddy of IRCS, she inaugurated a seminar hall for the youth and flagged off a blood collection vehicle-cum-ambulance for the branch. The total addition was made at a cost of Rs. 17.86 lakh by the District Mineral Foundation Trust. At the 12th century Chaya Someswara Swamy Temple at Panagal, she was struck by the mysterious shade over the Shivalingam, an engineering marvel by the Kundur Cholas and the sculpture and artwork depicting scenes of Ramayana and Mahabharata. She visited the Mahatma Gandhi University at Anneparthi village and unveiled Gandhi’s statue and participated in Bathukamma with the faculty, launched a mega blood donation camp and later, chaired the executive council. According to a few members, the executive council was conducted without any agenda. The Governor asked academic administrators to impart quality higher education and make universities the centres of excellence.

08 October 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Mallannasagar oustees plan stir||Mallannasagar oustees are getting ready for another round of agitation as the officials are yet to keep the promises. The oustees of Etigaddakishtapur held a meeting at the newly established Mutrajpally Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony on Thursday and renewed their call to sort out all pending issues. The villagers shifted to the R&R Colony about four months ago and the officials had promised to clear all the dues, including funds for structures, front yards and back yards of houses soon after reaching the R&R Colony. In spite of their bitter experiences in the past, more than 90% of the villager shifted to the new colony as there was no other go. The officials had arranged transport to shift the villagers and some reluctant families who stayed put were shifted to the new colony by the officials at the last minute . “It is almost three months since we were shifted to the new colony. The officials who promised to release the pending amounts are now saying that there is no pending list and even if there is one, it will not be more than 15 persons whereas the list as per villagers contained the names of more than 200 200 people, including those above 18 years and single men and women. We even submitted the list to the officials, but they just brushed aside our demands. As there is no other way, we are getting ready for agitation,” said K. Pratap Reddy, village sarpanch, who was instrumental in getting the villagers shifted. He has also held discussions with sarpanches of Vemulghat, Pallepahad and Brahamana Banjerpally. Mr Reddy presided over Thursday’s meeting which was attended by large number of villagers. In 2016, the same villagers had attacked the house of Mr. Reddy alleging that he was hand in gloves with the ruling party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mallannasagar-oustees-plan-stir/article36890237.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Govt. embarked on systematic development’||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asserted that his government has embarked upon systematic and planned development of rural and urban areas to ensure their all-round growth. He criticized the previous governments led by the Congress and the TDP for neglecting the plight of the rural areas which threw the villages into chaos. “Neither was there a policy for the development nor commitment on the part of the previous governments in the united State. We have inherited the legacy and are working overtime to rectify the lapses that occurred during the previous Congress regime,” he said. Replying to a debate on Palle and Pattana Pragati programmes during a short discussion in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, the Chief Minister took a dig at the Congress for neglecting the rural areas in their 10-year tenure. The situation in the urban areas too was atrocious with storm water drains choked due to indiscriminate permissions given to layouts and other developments. “It is estimated that over Rs. 15,000 crore will be required for rectifying the situation,” he said. Drawing a comparison, he said the Congress had spent Rs. 4,195 crore on rural water supply during its 10-year rule while the TRS Government spent Rs. 36,000 crore in seven years. The same was the case with rural roads wherein the Congress took up works on road length of 13,835 km with a cost of Rs. 3,618 crore and the TRS government had developed 18,606 km roads with Rs. 8,536 crore. “The Congress spent Rs. 12,173 crore in 10 years on different works in rural areas. We have spent Rs. 58,303 crore and the development is visible,” he said. The State was number one in utilising NREGS funds while the Congress government had no idea of how to use the funds. “We have utilised the NREGS funds for development of public infrastructure and amenities which the Congress government had not even contemplated,” he averred. The Finance department was directed to release Rs. 339 crore – Rs. 227 crore for gram panchayats and Rs. 112 crore for urban local bodies and timely releases were made in spite of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in direct and indirect losses of Rs. 1 lakh crore to the State. The government had asked the Panchayat Raj and Tribal Welfare departments to prepare an action plan for developing all the amenities in dalit and tribal habitations and works would start soon in this direction. “I will myself monitor the progress of these works,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-embarked-on-systematic-development/article36890059.ece
08 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam eviction: file affidavit, Gauhati HC tells govt.||The Gauhati High Court on Thursday directed the Assam government to file a detailed affidavit on the September 23 eviction drive in Darrang district’s Dhalpur, resulting in clashes and the death of two persons, including a minor, in police firing. A video on the clashes showed a photographer appointed by the district administration stomping on the body of a man shot by the police. ‘This is a big tragedy’ Hearing a public interest litigation petition by Congress MLA Debabrata Saikia and a suo motu petition in connection with the eviction, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Soumitra Sakia said, “This is a big tragedy, very unfortunate. Those who are guilty, if at all must be punished, no doubt about that.” Seeking punishment on “one or two other incidents as well”, the Chief Justice remarked, “ Khoon zameen par gir gaya [blood has been spilt].” The Bench also asked if the State believed that the National Rehabilitation Policy was not applicable in Assam and directed it to file a detailed affidavit in the matter within three weeks. In his petition, Mr. Saikia said the people evicted from Dhalpur were from marginalised and socio-economically disadvantaged sections and forced to migrate due to repeated floods and erosion by the Brahmaputra since 1960. The court fixed November 3 as the next date of hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/assam-eviction-file-affidavit-gauhati-hc-tells-govt/article36889937.ece
08 October 2021||New Delhi,||No favouritism in college admissions, says DU||As students from across the country knock on the doors of Delhi University (DU) for admission into its various undergraduate programmes, the university, in the absence of an entrance exam, is facing a challenge in admitting students from various school boards solely based on cut-off percentages. Colleges such as Shri Ram College of Commerce, Ramjas, Hindu and Hansraj, which released a 100% cut-off for admission to some of their courses, have seen students from the Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education secure many of the seats with a best-four subjects’ score of 100%. The 100% disagreement The high number of candidates with a score of 100% coming from the Kerala board has prompted some students’ groups on DU campuses start a protest demanding that the university bring about a “moderation” process to ensure that students from all boards have an equal opportunity to secure admission at the university. Other students’ groups have alleged that some colleges are rejecting applications without stating any substantial reason or withholding applications arbitrarily stating “clarifications to be sought from the university” when it comes to students from other boards. “DU is bound to admit students satisfying all the eligibility criteria. It is a matter of shame that applicants are being discriminated against based on their board, while the hard work put in by the applicants from varying boards is the same,” said Akhil K.M. of the Students’ Federation of India, Delhi University. He added that the university must put in place a mechanism through which it can clarify its doubts regarding different boards, their syllabi, and mark distribution and calculation, rather than putting the applicants at stake as, in the past as well, students from other boards have faced similar issues. Siddharth Yadav from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), which has been protesting at the admission office of the university, said his organisation is demanding a process of “moderation” so that there is no regional skew in admissions and all candidates are given an equal opportunity to study at the Central University. “There has been an irregular spike in marks this year as compared to the previous years. Due to this high cut-off, only a few State board students, where results have been inflated, are able to take admission in the most reputed university of the country, which is quite wrong. The admission process should be done after normalisation of marks of all the State boards to bring them on a par with all other students,” Mr. Yadav said. ‘Equal opportunity’ Responding to allegations that candidates from particular boards were securing admissions, the university said that in the first cut-off list, 60,904 candidates had applied to various colleges. Of them, 46,054 were from the Central Board of Secondary Education. Delhi University Registrar Vikas Gupta said as on Thursday, 31,172 candidates from the CBSE; 2,365 from the Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education; 1,540 from the Board of School Education, Haryana; 1,429 from the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations; and 1,301 candidates from the Board of Secondary Education Rajasthan, in addition to other State Boards, had successfully secured their admissions. “Being a Central University, the University of Delhi equally and uniformly values the academic credentials of all the candidates, irrespective of their States and school boards. This year, too, equal opportunity was maintained by accepting applications based on merit only. The University of Delhi strongly refutes and condemns the falsity of news which is being circulated regarding favouring candidates from a few boards,” Mr. Gupta said. The university added that being a prestigious Central University, it was DU’s utmost responsibility to maintain justice and equity among all meritorious candidates coming not only from Indian States but also from abroad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-favouritism-in-college-admissions-says-du/article36889922.ece
08 October 2021||New Delhi,||21-day drive to clean Yamuna kicks off in city||The Delhi government on Thursday began a 21-day cleaning drive for a four-km-long stretch of the Yamuna near Sarai Kale Khan under the Centre’s “Clean India” programme. The government is using excavators and an amphibious machine to pull waste and hyacinths to the banks of the river. Rajendra Singh, who is dubbed “waterman of India”, is also part of the drive. “In the last 20 years, so much money has been spent to clean the river but Yamuna ma is still sick. People and authorities should come together to clean it,” Mr. Singh said. No safety gear On Thursday evening, about half a dozen workers were found cleaning the river, some waist-deep and other knee-deep in the blackish water, without any boots, gloves, or masks. Currently, the Yamuna is polluted and not even fit for bathing in the Delhi stretch, except for Palla, the point where the river enters the city, according to government data. District Magistrate (South-East) Vishwendra said the hyacinths in the river would be used to generate electricity. “Once we pull the hyacinths to the banks, we will let those dry. After that, we will supply them to a waste-to-energy plant to generate electricity. We are also involving citizens, volunteers from Nehru Yuva Kendras and NGOs in the process so that they will connect with the river and understand its current state. Once they come here and see it, they will own up the river,” Mr. Vishwendra said. Districts have been doing different programmes under the “Clean India” initiative since October 1, with an objective to involve citizens in waste collection and its disposal. The East district has conducted several plog runs and 2,275 kg waste has been collected, said the DM. In the North district, two waterbodies are being cleaned, a park is being beautified, and awareness programmes are being held.  Once we pull the hyacinths to the banks, we will let those dry.

08 October 2021||New Delhi,||IIT-Kharagpur student held for stalking Delhi schoolgirls online||A 19-year-old student of Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur has been arrested from Patna for allegedly stalking girls of a school in north Delhi, the police said on Thursday. A senior police officer said the accused, identified as Mahavir, was a voyeur and stalker. “He has a fetish to stalk girls. His motive was not to extort money but just to threaten girls to get himself added to their social media groups,” the officer said. On October 6, the Civil Lines police station received a complaint from a school that their female students were being harassed online after which an FIR was registered. “The complainant said that a person was stalking minor girls of the school online and also sending WhatsApp messages and calling teachers of the school from various international numbers and from numbers of students and teachers,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Sagar Singh Kalsi said. Mr. Kalsi said the stalker was entering online classes of the school and joining WhatsApp groups without the approval of the admin, and was changing group icons. “Several morphed nude and semi-nude photos of students were being circulated on social media platforms,” he said. The police questioned the girls and teachers and examined the WhatsApp groups to trace the stalker’s number. They also wrote to WhatsApp and Instagram to get details of the IP address after which a police team tracked the accused, who was residing in Patna’s Khajekalan, and arrested him. During interrogation, Mr. Kalsi said, it was revealed that Mahavir had been stalking and harassing a minor girl from this north Delhi school for the last three years when he was preparing for the IIT entrance exam in Kota. “He found the victim’s number on a social media platform and started pursing her. The girl, however, stopped talking to the accused after she realised that his intentions weren’t right. Though he didn’t stalk her directly thereafter, he started making contacts with her friends by posing himself as a girl who was a friend of the main victim,” a police officer said. After gaining trust of the girls, the accused threatened them that he would morph their pictures and circulate on social media if they didn’t help him get added to common WhatsApp groups and share links of their online classes. “He would then enter these online classes and bad-mouth the girls, including the main victim. That’s when the school approached the police,” the officer said. Investigations also revealed that Mahavir used applications to fake caller ID and a virtual number on WhatsApp for contacting girls and teachers of the school. “The accused used a voice changing app to hide his identity. He also used an app to morph photos of victims,” Mr. Kalsi said.

Justice Rekha Palli asked the Delhi government to “take steps to improve the working of the hospital”, while hearing the petition filed by Ashish Pandey, who was recently admitted to the hospital. “This is not the first time that we are hearing it... Some of this [allegations] must be true,” Justice Palli said, adding that “we are not out of COVID-19 crisis”. The court posted the case for further hearing on December 20. The plea alleged that no COVID-19 test was conducted on Mr. Pandey at the time of admission. It said there were two-three patients on each bed and up to three patients were taken to the ultrasound lab at a time. It also alleged that “each ward, having around 72 beds, had only two PG second-year doctors and one senior resident”, reflecting the shortage of doctors. It sought a direction to form a high-powered panel to look into the lapses and take action. The petition accused the hospital authorities of having a “ callous attitude”.

Mr. Suryan, who refrained from naming the “senior Sikh leaders”, asserted that the installation of the replica “is currently on hold” and that a decision would be made after the talks. Replica controversy A controversy had erupted over the replica with members of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee having dismantled the structure as it was against the beliefs of Sikhism. “We do not want to hurt the sentiments of any community. We will do what the majority asks us to do; we will follow the decision that they make,” said Mr. Suryan.

08 October 2021||New Delhi,||Security ramped up at Karkardooma courts||Even as the Delhi police have submitted their suggestions in an affidavit to the Delhi High Court to maximise security for both clients and lawyers inside all the seven district courts in the city, the Karkardooma court complex on Thursday saw a tight security cover with deployment of more paramilitary personnel on the premises. This comes two weeks after gangster Jitender Mann alias Gogi was shot dead by rival gang members, who posed as lawyers, inside the Rohini court. Riots cases However, a spot check by The Hindu revealed a few instances where clients and lawyers were allowed to enter the court without being frisked or asked for an identity card. The Karkardooma court complex presides over all the cases related to the north-east Delhi riots and has four specially constituted courts on its campus. According to the court employees, there are nine gates of which five are currently open for both lawyers and the public. While three to four paramilitary personnel, in addition to four Delhi Police officers, were guarding the main gate during the afternoon hours, those entering the premises were largely not being stopped or enquired about their whereabouts. Meanwhile, a large number of lawyers and court officials claimed that the Karkardooma court too had been a ticking time bomb till a few days ago with just about anyone being allowed to enter the premises. An advocate, who has been handling several Delhi riots cases, said since the cases pertained to two communities, security should have been strengthened long ago and not as the present knee-jerk reaction to Gogi’s murder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/security-ramped-up-at-karkardooma-courts/article36889920.ece

In the representation, the parents said that schools for younger children have been closed for over 550 days, which has resulted in not only learning loss but also caused immense harm to physical and mental health due to reduced physical activity and denial of social play. The parents said that experts have concluded that younger children are at much lower risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 but the DDMA has still not taken a call to open schools. They wrote, “We appreciate the DDMA’s concern for the safety of our children, however, we are also witness to adverse effects of long-term school closures.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/allow-limited-activity-in-schools-parents/article36889917.ece

08 October 2021||WASHINGTON,||Biden, Xi to hold virtual meet this year||U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed “in principle” to have a virtual meeting before the end of the year, according to senior U.S. administration officials. The decision came out of a six-hour meeting in Zurich late on Wednesday between U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Politburo member and top diplomat Yang Jiechi. The meeting had “a different tone from Anchorage”, reports quoted the officials as saying, referring to a stormy March meeting between Mr. Sullivan and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Chinese counterparts, Mr. Yang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, which was marked by public rancour. “Today really involved a genuine back and forth, which was quite welcome — a different tone than Anchorage, a different kind of feel in the ability to go back and forth than in Anchorage,” an official said, according to the Financial Times , which reported on the possibility of a Biden-Xi meeting. A virtual meeting means Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi will not meet in person at the G20 summit in Rome to be held at the end of this month. Mr. Xi is unlikely to travel to Rome, and the Chinese leader has not left China for more than 600 days, since the pandemic began. His last overseas visit was to Myanmar in mid-January 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be travelling to Rome for the summit. Asked to confirm if Mr. Biden would be meeting Mr. Xi virtually, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said there was agreement to continue the dialogue at a “very high level” and the details of what that meant were still being worked out. “We’re still working through what that would look like, when, and, of course, the final details. So we don’t quite have them yet,” she said. A White House readout of the meeting did not announce the virtual meet. Instead, it spoke of the importance of managing the competition between the two countries responsibly and of maintaining open lines of communication, following the September 9 call between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi. The Chinese Foreign Ministry’s readout also did not mention a leaders’ meeting, but offered a more positive take on the state of relations in comparison to the March meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. It said both sides “agreed to maintain regular dialogue and communication on important issues”. Beijing said the meeting was “constructive, and conducive to enhancing mutual understanding” and both sides agreed “to strengthen strategic communication, properly manage differences, avoid conflict and confrontation, seek mutual benefits and win-win results, and work together to bring China-U.S. relations back on the right track of sound and steady development.” Many differences Despite both readouts emphasising cooperation, it remains to be seen where the two sides will be able to bridge differences, on issues ranging from trade and technology to Taiwan. The two sides appeared to merely reaffirm their positions on those thorny issues. The White House said Mr. Sullivan “raised a number of areas where we have concern with the PRC’s actions, including actions related to human rights, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and Taiwan”. Just days ago, the U.S. criticised China for flying a record number of aircraft into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone and said America’s commitment to Taiwan was “rock solid”. Beijing hit out at the U.S. statement on Taiwan, calling it “irresponsible”. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Mr. Yang “expounded China’s solemn position on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang [Tibet] and human rights as well as maritime issues, urging the U.S. side to truly respect China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and stop using the above issues to interfere in China's internal affairs”. Both sides offered differing views on the relationship. While Mr. Sullivan said the U.S. would work closely with its allies and partners and engage with China at a senior level to “ensure responsible competition”, Mr. Yang told him China “opposes defining China-U.S. relations as ‘competitive’”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-xi-to-hold-virtual-meet-this-year/article36889316.ece

The National Seismic Monitoring Centre in Islamabad said the epicentre of the earthquake was near Harnai, which has a large number of coal mines, at a depth of around 15 kilometres. The quake affected Quetta, Sibi, Harnai, Pishin, Qila Saifullah, Chaman, Ziarat and Zhob in Balochistan. Most of the deaths and injuries were reported from the remote district of Harnai, where at least 13 people have died, according to officials. At least four people were killed when a coal mine in which they were working collapsed, Suhail Anwar Shaheen, the local deputy commissioner, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Disaster management officials said the death toll may increase. Earlier, Deputy Commissioner of Harnai district Sohail Anwar Hashmi had said that six children were among 22 dead.

Alain Richard, a former Defence Minister, arrived on Wednesday for a five-day visit despite repeated warnings from the Chinese Embassy in Paris. In a speech after he was conferred a top medal of honour by President Tsai Ing-wen, Mr. Richard said Taiwan’s de facto embassy in Paris has been doing “a very good job in representing your country”. France, like most countries, officially recognises China which claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing tries to keep the island isolated on the world stage and baulks at the use of the name Taiwan or any reference to it as a country. It has ramped up pressure on Ms. Tsai’s government since her 2016 election win and has aggressively tried to dissuade politicians from visiting in recent years.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Will a bad bank fix India’s broken banking system?||Last month, the Union government set up the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) under the Companies Act. It thus delivered on its promise to set up a ‘bad bank’ to clean up the balance sheets of commercial banks. Under the new set up, the NARCL will take over loans worth almost Rs. 2 lakh crore from the books of commercial banks at a mutually agreed price. The NARCL will pay 15% of the price of these loans upfront in cash to banks and then issue security receipts in lieu of the remaining amount. The NARCL will then try to resolve these bad loans in a time-bound manner with help from the India Debt Resolution Company Limited (IDRCL). In case the IDRCL is unable to sell these bad loans at a satisfactory price to make good on the security receipts, the Centre will step in and fund the gap, but within a budget limit of Rs. 30,600 crore. In a conversation moderated by Prashanth Perumal J. , Ajit Ranade and C.P. Chandrasekhar discusss the bad bank proposal. Edited excerpts: What is the need to bail out banks? Why not let banks recognise their losses and let insolvent banks fail? Ajit Ranade:First of all, this is a one-time, time-bound effort. The bad bank has been set up to remove bad assets from the balance sheets of banks and free up capital which will allow bank lending to grow. Credit growth is important for economic growth, and bank balance sheets are constrained by the presence of bad assets. So, one of the main objectives of the bad bank is to remove these assets from the balance sheets of existing banks and consolidate them within a bad bank. Meanwhile, the resolution and recovery process can continue. The proposed design of the bad bank separates the trustee part of the NARCL, where the assets will sit, from the the IDRCL, which will engage in the recovery and turnaround of bad assets. So, it’s a twin structure working to free existing banking capital to enable higher credit growth. C.P. Chandrasekhar:There are many reasons to bail out banks but two in particular are crucial. One is the fact that there are depositors involved here. If you allow banks to fail, depositors who operated under the presumption that the regulatory framework would protect their money would be undermined. Historically, we’ve found that central banks try to actually save banks, either by bailing them out or by amalgamating them with stronger banks, in order to be able to protect depositors. Two, there is a systemic problem. If a bank fails, and there is a sort of contagion effect, you could actually have systemic problems. Banks are the core of the settlements system and the credit pipe and allowing them to go down would be a problem. And finally, there is also the option of getting banks to write off these bad assets and then the government can recapitalise them. But that would deal a significant blow to the government’s finances. Isn’t there the risk of moral hazard linked with bailouts, which makes banks more complacent? CPC:You need to compare the risk to the system itself — the impact that bank failures would have on depositors and the social and political implications of it — with the moral hazard of bailing out banks. The more important problem is the systemic risk. But second, here we have a system in which banks are predominantly publicly owned. So, the problem is, in some sense, the result of the state allowing the use of banks for certain purposes. Why do you think the government has opted for a bad bank over directly infusing capital into banks? AR:These so-called bad loans have been completely 100% provisioned. However, the manpower of these banks is still spent on recovery and supervision. Now, it’s important that these loans be moved to a separate entity which is exclusively focused on recovery, so that the bank can then focus on its core business, which is business development, giving new loans, credit growth, etc. And it is not an exclusive ‘either... or’ for banks. For their growth, banks will need to be infused with additional capital to achieve the credit growth needed to get to 7-8% GDP growth. So, the government will continue to pour more capital into banks, while bad loans will be moved to a separate entity. CPC:I think we have to see this in the context of accumulated bad debt of banks being addressed over a period of time through various mechanisms. First, we had the Lok Adalats, then the debt recovery tribunal, and then the SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest ) Act, which is supposed to give creditors much more power to be able to recover debt. Then we had the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code). The understanding till recently was that the IBC would allow quick resolution, and the haircut that the banks would have to take would be relatively small. If you have a government that is committed to a conservative fiscal stance, then to think of going through a process in which these large amounts of accumulated debt will be cleared, which is essentially a process of partial write-off and recapitalisation, cannot be sustained if the haircuts are large. When IBC started, it appeared as if you’re going to get a pretty high rate of recovery. As we moved along, the rate of recovery began to decline quite sharply. So, the point is, by adopting a bad bank mechanism, the government seems to think it will be in a position to paper over this contradiction — the need to resolve the bad loan problem and its unwillingness to allocate significant amounts from its Budget. What is the need for a public bad bank when India already has a number of private asset reconstruction companies (ARCs)? AR:What the NARCL is doing is providing an asset resolution platform, which is for the banks and by the banks. There have been some 28-odd private ARCs, which have perhaps not performed. Under the bad bank, asset acquisition and trusteeship has been segregated from asset resolution. The primary purpose of the IDRCL is resolution through specialists who can salvage some value. Even if they can recover only 25%, that’s more than what the current record shows. The IDRCL will actually have incentive to resolve debts efficiently because of the profit-sharing arrangement. So, the incentives are aligned. CPC:The government has said that of the Rs. 2 lakh crore, it will be in a position to cover only as much as Rs. 30,600 crore. So, you’re going to be in a situation where the banks are still going to carry the burden and take a hit to their profitability. On the other hand, if you look at those who defaulted, a large number of them being big corporates, they are going to walk away with their debts resolved at steep discounts. Banks might be left with perhaps not new losses, but with losses nevertheless, which have already been provided for, whereas those who defaulted would be let off in terms of their assets not being seized in significant measure. AR:These are two different things. One is to go after the defaulters and the other is to recover the asset and salvage value from it. Corporates are not going to go scot-free. If there is an established criminal negligence or criminal activity, there is a separate process for that. Moreover, the bad bank is focusing the energies of banking personnel. The bad bank is not to be seen as a recurring thing wherein balances will keep moving from the existing banking balance sheets into this structure. If that happens, you are inviting the tendency of what we call moral hazard, as then there is no effort from the bank per se to try and recover. Do you think the bad bank, which is essentially owned by the troubled banks themselves, will have a different incentive structure to efficiently resolve loans? AR:The staffing, the pay scale, etc. in the IDRCL will be different. For example, when the State Bank of India (SBI) runs an asset management company, the AMC employees are not on the same pay scale as the SBI. So, we have to recognise that the incentives, pay structure, staffing, talent, and ultimately governance... that’s what’s going to matter. CPC:There is a lack of clarity about certain things. One is the discount which is going to be negotiated between the NARCL and the banks. Once the bad debt is moved on to the books of NARCL, it will be handed over to the IDRCL. Now, as in the case of private ARCs in the past, both these entities would also be charging a managerial fee. So, they’re going to cover a large part of their costs through the managerial fee charged to manage and dispose of these assets. What is going to be the incentive to try and get the maximum price possible from these bad loans is not really clear. AR:The difference is that in the case of the existing ARCs, there is no guarantee for the value that will be recovered from the security receipt. So, typically, the average purchase price of bad loans by existing ARCs is something like 36%, but there is no backing for the security receipts; these receipts may end up being of zero value. The actual recovery could be just one-fourth of the 36%, which is 9%. In the new structure, the average purchase price will be lower, but the security receipts for the remainder of the value will be covered by the government up to Rs. 30,600 crore. That in itself changes the incentives. Does the bad bank proposal actually address the root causes of the banking crisis or is this just a temporary band aid? AR:The fact is that over the last few years, the NPA ratio has been mounting and we’ve tried many things. We now need to bring the problem to manageable proportions. In that sense, the bad bank is taking a small chunk out of the overall NPAs. But NPAs will continue to grow. Bad loans are a function of business cycles — during down cycles, the bad loan ratio increases, but in up cycles, the bad loan ratio comes down. The idea is to keep it within manageable proportions. CPC:There is a structural issue involved here. As opposed to the 1980s and 1990s, an overwhelming share of defaulted debt in this round has been corporate debt. Why did this come about? Earlier, financing capital-intensive projects was seen as something which had to happen through the government’s budget or through development finance institutions specialised in development finance. There was also the idea that you could finance these investments through long-term capital available through an active bond market, which India does not have to a significant extent. The government decided that it cannot mobilise the resources to finance investments and decided to get financial institutions to set up commercial banks. Therefore, the burden of financing these investments was transferred by the state to the public banks. And banks are not supposed to do too much of this because there are significant liquidity and maturity mismatches. So, we got this problem because we have put the burden of finance of a certain kind on banks, which should not have been put on banks, which sometimes gets concealed by focusing on some frauds here and there.  The government will continue to pour more capital into banks while bad loans will be moved to a separate entity.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The Congress is at the crossroads||The judgment by contemporary writers of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s leadership is almost uniformly harsh and unforgiving. It is common to contrast the strength of the formal organisation and leadership of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with the deterioration and decay of the Congress party, especially the central leadership’s failure to reverse this downslide. The contrast between the Congress and the BJP is stark, not in terms of decision-making which is centralised in both cases, but in terms of overall political management. The Congress party faces three major challenges — it has to elect a leader capable of keeping the party united, reconstruct its organisational structure across the States, and project and propagate a clear alternative ideological narrative to the BJP. These challenges are more apparent after the 2019 debacle in the general election and the leadership vacuum following Mr. Gandhi’s resignation as president and the party’s abject failure to elect a president to replace him. Signs of changes The fallout of Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation as State Congress chief in Punjab almost 72 days after he was ‘undeservingly’ appointed to that post has exposed the fault lines in the party. While criticism by the media, the BJP and other Opposition politicians was on predictable lines, the absence of debate and consultation in the party regarding leadership change in Punjab just months ahead of the next Assembly elections (early next year) is a matter of wider concern. Even though there is no perceptible effort to rebuild the organisation and institute formal leadership at various levels, there is a noticeable effort to revive the party through ideological changes pushed by Mr. Gandhi. Ideologically, he wants to take the Congress in a left-of-centre direction. Despite reservations within the party and outside to his unremitting critique of the Prime Minister, Mr. Gandhi has readily advanced ideological criticism of the Hindu right at every juncture. Additionally, he has pointedly attacked cronyism, which according to him has favoured a few corporate entities. He has also taken up the welfare and economic concerns of the poor. The recent decision to induct two feisty critics of Hindutva, Kanhaiya Kumar and Jignesh Mevani, into the party’s fold is an indication of this shift. This shift follows from Mr. Gandhi’s widely reported statement in July to workers of his party’s social media department (in an online event), “There are many people who are not scared, but are outside the Congress. All these people are ours. Bring them in,” he had said, adding, “And those scared within our party should be shunted out. They are RSS people and they should go, let them enjoy. We do not want them, they are not needed. We want fearless people. This is our ideology. This is my basic message to you.” The left turn This is not the first time the Congress has turned leftward. Indira Gandhi through a series of measures after the 1969 split in the party, which later included the nationalisation of banks, abolition of privy purses and nationalisation of general insurance, dramatically appropriated the left platform. The second left turn happened under Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s leadership when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) which formed the government in 2004 with the support of the Left Front went on to implement the rural employment guarantee scheme and other rights based legislations. The circumstances that made these ideological shifts possible was the fact that Congress was in power in the Centre and in most States which enabled it to implement these policies. Effectively, the party has relied on the state to promote such policies. The third left turn is taking place under Mr. Gandhi when the Congress is in the Opposition, which makes the task more difficult except in these circumstances. To regain and reconfigure The current strategic shift indicates an attempt to regain ideological coherence and reconfigure the traditional social base of the party. Historically, as a party of consensus, the Congress had always come to power on a centrist platform reflecting its varied social base, including, most notably, its support from the lower sections of Indian society. Centrism and consensual politics, which explained its early success, do not seem to work in a divided polity. A party which once famously claimed to represent everyone seems to have lost the support of most groups in India’s deeply polarised polity. The party no longer enjoys Dalit support, competing for their vote with regional parties and the BJP; it has lost the support of upper castes who prefer to vote for the BJP; it has no support from the Other Backward Classes (OBC) except in some States such as Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh thanks to State leaders; and the Muslim vote has drifted to regional parties or whoever can offer an alternative to the BJP. The appointment of Charanjit Singh Channi, a Dalit, to replace Captain Amarinder Singh, a Jat Sikh, as Punjab’s Chief Minister or supporting OBC Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel over his rival T.S. Singh Deo in Chhattisgarh is an attempt to reconstruct its social base. It signals a message to the non-upper castes that they can hope to wield power through the Congress, which traditionally has had the upper castes dominate its leadership structure. This demonstrates once again the power of ideology as an instrument of political mobilisation. But appointment of people with appropriate credentials is not enough. The Congress has to spell out and narrativise the ideological change such as it is. Ideology and organisation, moreover, are interconnected; both need to be taken on board in the party’s overhaul. The ideological message needs to be communicated to the people. In the 2019 campaign for the general election, Mr. Gandhi pushed Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) — a minimum income guarantee scheme — but the party failed to communicate this scheme to the people; eventually it was overtaken by the PM Kisan scheme (or the Pradhan Mantri KIsan Samman Nidhi plan, a central scheme to augment the income of the small and marginal farmers) and the Balakot air strikes on targets in Pakistan (2019). Programmes versus reform In any case, radicalisation without institutionalisation is not sustainable. The strategic shift must involve a reordering of the institutional structures of the party. But very little has been done in the realm of organisational restructuring to broad-base the party and revive intra-party democracy. This is partly because the focal point of the leadership of the Gandhis was not and has not been on party building. Doubts about party regeneration in the past had led to a greater reliance on the government and welfare programmes for winning support than on reforming the party to mobilise the electorate. The response of the leadership to most fundamental issues was generally governmental rather than political. The lack of organisational heft was a severe limitation hampering its ability to reap the political dividends that could have accrued to the party from the unprecedented welfare spending by the UPA government. Organisational decline has impeded its capacity to engage with mass politics. This remains unchanged even when the party is in opposition. The faultlines Nearly two and a half years after its second consecutive defeat in parliamentary elections, the party still remains without a full-time president. That is the crux of the problem. It does not have a properly constituted Congress Working Committee (CWC) for institutionalised deliberations and decision-making. Even the Core Group formed by Sonia Gandhi in 2004 is invisible as power is concentrated in the Gandhi triumvirate. Rahul Gandhi is calling the shots without holding any formal position. Not surprisingly, many of the decisions taken today seem ad hoc and do not appear to be part of an overall plan on how to move forward. Yet, we cannot write off the Congress which has roots all across the country. The revised ideological line combined with an organisational revamp can bring the Congress back in the reckoning.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Seeding a data revolution in Indian agriculture||In June this year, two significant documents relating to the Indian agriculture sector were released. The first is a consultation paper on the India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture (IDEA) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (MoA&FW) and the second on Indian Agriculture: Ripe for Disruption from a private organisation, Bain and Company. The first talks about a digital revolution in the agriculture sector and later predicts a revolutionary investment growth in agri-logistics, offtake, and agri-input delivery by 2025; these are, surprisingly, highly complementary. The fact is that every segment of present-day life is data-hungry. The MoA&FW report describes creating data to fuel the growth predicted by Bain and Company. The forecast The Bain report is a data-based prediction on agri-business scenarios, anchored to the agricultural set-up at present and predicting its future trajectories in another 20 years. It includes targeting the production of alternative proteins, and food cell-based food/ingredients and initiating ocean farming, etc. The report has a ‘today forward– future back approach’ and predicts a drastic investment opportunity development by 2025. The agriculture sector (currently worth $370 billion), is estimated to receive an additional $35 billion investment. The two enabling conditions for such investment opportunities are the changes in the regulatory framework, especially recent changes in the Farm Acts and digital disruption. The report argues that benefiting from the huge investments into the agri-ecosystem, doubling farmers’ income targets can be achieved in near future. The idea of integration The IDEA-consulting paper is based on the Task Force and Working Group report constituted by the MoA&FW to design the blueprint of “digital agriculture” — which is similar to the digital disruption mentioned in the Bain report. Eventually, the farmer and the improvement of farmers’ livelihood is the aim of the IDEA concept and it is proposed to happen through tight integration of agri-tech innovation and the agriculture industry ecosystem to farming and food systems. To be precise, the IDEA concept profounds the creation of second enabling conditions (which is described in the Bain report). The IDEA principles explicitly talk about openness of data, which means open to businesses and farmers, indicating the kind of integration it aims at. Value-added innovative services by agri-tech industries and start-ups are an integral part of the IDEA architecture. Beyond the architecture, these services listed in the document (to be available on the platform) are equally important data for farmers and businesses. The Indian agriculture sector in future will encompass farm to fork and pave the way for a single national market with a national platform with better connection between producer and consumers. Through their work, the management experts, Parijat Jain, Prashant Sarin and Shalabh Singawne (the authors of the Bain report) have depicted the agriculture reforms announced by the union government as a game-changer in the agriculture sector. A thread of digital disruption The IT industry has opposition to IDEA mainly due to the ethics of creating a Unique Farmer ID based on one’s Aadhaar number and also the potential for data misuse. Beyond the news coverage about the prospects of achieving the goal of Doubling Farmers Income on which the present government has almost lost its hope, the Bain report has not been widely discussed — at least in the public domain. The assumptions used by authors of the Bain report, especially for its ‘future back approach’, need more or less focusing on widespread food production in controlled environments. No doubt, the emission, energy, and other resource footprints and sustainability issues around these techniques must be carefully studied to confirm the projected trajectory (which is not a part of the report). However, the report has convincingly demonstrated the business opportunity available in supply chains between farm to Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandi and mandi to the customer, which can be realised with the support of digital disruption and the latest agriculture reforms. Both these reports heavily rely on digital disruption to improve farmers’ livelihoods, without discussing how much farmers will be prepared to benefit from these newly emerging business environments. Hinting that the Union government is serious about this digital support to the agriculture sector — the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar, has emphasised the significance of the farmer’s database being prepared and has sought the support of States. An unconvincing ‘how’ However, the fact is that a majority of small and marginal farmers are not technology-savvy. That most of them are under-educated for capacity building is ignored amidst these ambitious developments. The Bain report relies on the general assumption that more investments into the agriculture sector will benefit farmers; ‘but how’ has not been convincingly answered. Similarly, how the technology fix will help resolve all the nine issues of Indian agriculture listed at the beginning of the report is unclear in the IDEA concept. Together, the two reports look forward to benefiting from the recent agriculture legislature changes without perceiving the capacity-building required at a farmer’s end. Politically, these two reports ignore the protest of farmers against the reforms without considering it as a barrier or risk factor resulting in a repealing of these new farm laws. Focus on the farmer While agreeing on the fact that a data revolution is inevitable in the agriculture sector, given its socio-political complexities, we cannot just count on technology fixes and agri-business investments for improving farmers’ livelihoods. There need to be immense efforts to improve the capacities of the farmers in India – at least until the educated young farmers replace the existing under-educated small and medium farmers. This capacity building can be done through a mixed approach – preferably building the capacities of individual farmers or coping with the new situation by establishing support systems, through FPOs and other farmers associations where technical support is available for farmers. Considering the size of the agriculture sector of the country this is not going to be an easy task but would need a separate programme across the country with considerable investment.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Stronger at the grassroots||The Panchayati Raj, first adopted by Nagaur in Rajasthan on October 2, 1959, has expanded vastly. There are now 2,60,512 Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) represented by about 31 lakh elected members across India. This system of local self-governance, where people in the villages participate in the decision-making process, is the backbone of democracy. The People’s Plan Campaign and Vibrant Gram Sabha Dashboard, rolled out this year, aspire to strengthen the Panchayati Raj system by making gram sabhas more vibrant. A bottom-up approach Unlike other disasters like earthquakes, COVID-19 is an unusual crisis as it is long-drawn and affects people everywhere. When the traditional top-down disaster response system was compromised during the bad months of the pandemic, it was PRIs that played a remarkable role. They helped reduce risks, responded swiftly and thus helped people recover quickly. The PRIs provided essential leadership at the local level. They performed both regulatory and welfare functions. For instance, during the nationwide lockdown, PRIs set up containment zones, arranged transport, identified buildings for quarantining people and provisioned food for the incoming migrants. Moreover, effective implementation of welfare schemes like MGNREGA and the National Rural Livelihood Mission quickened the pace of recovery while ensuring support to the vulnerable population. Gram sabhas act as a sounding board for diverse ideas and opinions. They provide a platform to build consensus and make resolutions in the community’s interest. During the pandemic,, gram sabhas resolved to adhere to COVID-19 norms. In addition, regular engagement with frontline workers like ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers through committees bridged the trust gap between the community and the officials. By representing diverse communities, PRIs mobilise them effectively. During the COVID-19 crisis, they organised community-based surveillance systems involving village elders, the youth and self-help groups (SHGs) to keep a strict vigil in quarantine centres and monitor symptoms in households. More recently, their role in mobilising citizens for COVID-19 vaccination is exemplary. Building capacity The Yokohama strategy during the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction in May 1994 emphasised that it is important to focus on disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness rather than disaster response alone, to reduce vulnerability. In this respect, certain initiatives can be taken to build the capacity of PRIs. One, it is crucial to include disaster management chapters in Panchayat Raj Acts and make disaster planning and spending part of Panchayati Raj development plans and local-level committees. This will ensure citizen-centric mapping and planning of resources. Various insurance products customised to local needs will build financial resilience of the community. Two, conducting regular location-specific training programmes for the community and organising platforms for sharing best practices will strengthen individual and institutional capacities. Assigning roles to individual members and providing them with the necessary skills can make such programmes more meaningful. Three, since the community is usually the first responder in case of a disaster, community-based disaster management plans would help. These would provide a strategy for resource utilisation and maintenance during a disaster. Such plans should tap the traditional wisdom of local communities which will complement modern practices. Moreover, financial contributions from the community should be encouraged through the establishment of community disaster funds in all gram panchayats. It is imperative to make disaster resilience an inherent part of the community culture now more than ever.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Killing the chills||The triumphs of science are best appreciated when they make human lives easier or safer, or simply, offer hope. The first ever World Health Organization (WHO)-approved anti-malaria vaccine must count among those triumphs. The approval marks a milestone in a timeline that records a long and laborious process to grapple with malaria, and somehow make it less of a killer. The vaccine that WHO has approved — RTS,S — has been used in pilot programme participants (children and infants) in Africa from 2015 after it got a nod for this specific use from the European Medicines Agency. This triumph comes at a time of great scientific endeavour, yes, but also notably at a time when it was feared that the progress against malaria was flagging. With this vaccine, which will significantly reduce the severity of cases and prevent deaths, hope has sprung anew that humankind might retard in its tracks a pathogen that has stalked sub-Saharan Africa and several other parts of the world for years now. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom rightly termed it as a historic moment, achieving a breakthrough not only for malaria control but also child health and science itself. The malaria vaccine, RTS,S, which has been in the making for nearly 30 years, acts against P. falciparum , believed to be the most deadly malaria parasite globally. As per WHO, in 2019, nearly half the world’s population was at risk of malaria, while most cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. There were an estimated 229 million cases in 2019, and malaria deaths stood at 4,09,000, with the WHO African region carrying a disproportionate burden — 94% of cases and deaths. Children under five are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria; in 2019, they accounted for about two thirds of all malaria deaths. WHO said it was making a recommendation for use based on the key findings of pilot projects implemented in child health clinics in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi over two years. Data and insights gathered from these studies showed that the vaccine was not only feasible to introduce but that it also improves health and saves lives. Remarkably, it facilitated equitable access to malaria prevention, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping reach even hitherto unreached populations. While further steps are taken to manufacture, fund and roll out the vaccine to nations affected by malaria, maintaining equity of access is key. Dr. Tedros emphasised in his press conference that as the work towards providing vaccination continues, nations may, by no means, relinquish their routine malaria prevention activities, including providing insecticide-treated bed nets. While the world now has a way to kill the rigors — the chills characteristic of the infection — the next step should be speedy and meticulous implementation of the scientific miracle from the lab to the field.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/killing-the-chills/article36889287.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Handling complexity||Bringing to a close speculation about the winner of the Physics Nobel prize this year, the Nobel committee decided to award a trio of researchers. One half went to Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University, U.S., and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany, for their work in climate science. In the long line of researchers who estimated the warming of the atmosphere due to gases in it, Syukuro Manabe’s modelling, in collaboration with others — and over decades — is a classic work that showed, even in the 1960s, that the atmosphere would undergo another 2.3° C warming with the doubling of carbon dioxide content. Klaus Hasselmann identified a way of treating the random noise-like variations of the weather, devising a method to generate useful “signals” on the scale of the climate. Of interest was the way these models could show the effect of human activities on the climate. The other half of the prize, to Giorgio Parisi from the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, is for developing a method to sensibly study complex condensed matter systems called “spin glasses” — an outstanding feat in both mathematical and physical innovation. The idea to break what is called “replica symmetry”, seen in a spin glass, in a consistent manner, which was his contribution, led to a method to study one of the simplest models of a genuinely complex system. His work has helped solve problems in mathematics, biology and neuroscience; for instance, how memory is stored in networks of nerve cells. What ties together the seemingly disparate works — the climate science work by Syukuro and Hasselmann on the one hand and theoretical condensed matter physics work by Parisi on the other — is that both describe complex physical systems. Physics is often thought of as a science of simple systems, and it is mostly celebrated and sometimes chided for this. Even rocket science, which inspires awe for its grandeur and accuracy, is mostly the study of so-called simple systems. Complexity arises when there are many, many interacting pieces in the system, with each moving in an independent way. The deceptively easy-looking problem of water rushing out of a tap is notoriously difficult to understand as to when it makes a transition from simple streamlined flow to a complex turbulent flow. The Nobel winners this year have handled such complex systems and developed tools to get meaningful, quantitative results out of them. Notable in this is the climate scientists’ work, which makes it obvious where science stands on the issue of global warming and estimates the human fingerprint on climate change. With the COP26 summit drawing close, the Nobel committee’s decision only underscores the need to take this into account.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/handling-complexity/article36889288.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Chou’s remark a step forward: PM||New Delhi, Oct. 7: The Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, has welcomed for what it is worth the reported remark of Mr. Chou En-lai to a group of visiting Americans in Peking that he was prepared to accept the Soviet and Indian assurances that the Treaty of Friendship signed by them was not directed against China. Asked to comment on the Chinese statement by the waiting pressmen on her arrival in Simla to-day for the AICC (R) session, Mrs. Gandhi simply said: “What can I say? Don’t you think it is a good thing? This is what we have been saying all along (that the Treaty was not aimed at any third country).” According to news agency reporting from Simla, Mrs. Gandhi was asked whether Mr. Chou’s statement would facilitate normalisation of Sino-Indian relations. She replied: “This is one small step forward. Only the future can say whether it would facilitate normalisation.” But the External Afffairs Minister, Mr. Swaran Singh, who returned this morning from United Nations was more guarded in his comment on the Chinese statement. With his characteristic caution, he tried to explain away his reticence with the remark that if Mr. Chou could take two months to react to the Indo-Soviet Treaty, there was no good reason why India should rush in with its reaction to what the Chinese had said about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/chous-remark-a-step-forward-pm/article36889298.ece
08 October 2021||Washington DC,||World Bank retains India FY22 GDP growth forecast at 8.3%||The World Bank has retained its June forecast for India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to grow by 8.3% in the current fiscal year, with the economy seen supported by an increase in public investment to bolster domestic demand and schemes like the production-linked incentive to boost manufacturing. Despite the ravages of the second COVID-19 wave, the economic impact of the pandemic had been “relatively small” this year compared with the hit in 2020, the bank said in a South Asia-focussed report titled ‘Shifting Gears: Digitization and Services-Led Development’ ahead of its annual meetings, which start next week in Washington. “Over the next two years, as the base effect fades, growth is expected to stabilise at around 7%, aided by structural reforms to ease supply-side constraints and infrastructure investment,” the multilateral lender said referencing last fiscal’s 7.3% GDP contraction. Downside risks in the medium term include uncertainty around asset quality deterioration due to the pandemic, slow recovery in the informal sector and higher-than-expected inflation, the bank said. Noting that accommodative fiscal and monetary policies globally had been key to mitigating the pandemic’s economic impact, the bank said it was time to start rethinking policies. “If you don't start now preparing for what we call the ‘new normal’, and there’s always a new normal after a major crisis, you might well be too late,” said Chief Economist for South Asia Hans Timmer. Learning from the crisis meant building social protection and adopting greener policies, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/world-bank-retains-india-fy22-gdp-growth-forecast-at-83/article36889280.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Government releases GST dues of Rs. 40,000 crore to States||The Centre released Rs. 40,000 crore to States and Union Territories on Thursday to help meet the shortfall in GST compensation cess collections, through back-to-back borrowings from the market. The Finance Ministry said this was part of the Rs. 1.59 lakh crore shortfall estimated in the Compensation Fund for States, to be raised via market borrowings, but indicated that total GST compensation to be paid in 2021-22 may exceed States’ actual dues for the year. An amount of Rs. 75,000 crore had already been transferred in July, leaving another Rs. 44,000 crore to be borrowed and disbursed over the rest of 2021-22. The balance amount would be released in due course, the Ministry said. ‘Over and above’ “This release is in addition to normal GST compensation being released every two months out of actual cess collection,” the Ministry said, adding that more than Rs. 1 lakh crore was also estimated to be released to States during the financial year, based on actual GST cess collections. Pending dues “The sum total of Rs. 2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in FY 2021-22,” it added, signalling that some of the pending dues from 2020-21 would be offset to that extent. “It is expected that this release will help the States/UTs in planning their public expenditure among other things, for improving, health infrastructure and taking up infrastructure projects,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/government-releases-gst-dues-of-rs-40000-crore-to-states/article36889266.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Auto retail sales decline 5% as two-wheelers, tractors drag’||Retail sales of automobiles declined 5% last month, pulled down by a double-digit slump in sales of two-wheelers and tractors. According to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), total retail sales in September were 12.96 lakh units compared with 13.68 lakh a year earlier. While two-wheeler sales fell 11.5% to 9.14 lakh units, tractor sales slid 23.9% to 52,896 units. Sales of passenger vehicles, however, climbed 16.3% to 2.33 lakh units. Likewise, commercial vehicle retail business grew 46.6% to 58,820 units, while sales of three-wheelers rose almost 51% to 36,612 units. When compared with September 2019, overall retail sales were lower by 13.5%, the federation said. “The two-wheeler category continues to play spoilsport as the entry-level segment is yet to witness healthy growth,” said FADA President Vinkesh Gulati. “Semiconductor shortage has also started impacting the 150+ cc segment,” Mr. Gulati pointed out. He added that the three-wheeler segment was showing clear signs of shift from ICE to EVs as the ratio had hit a 60:40 split. With the 42-day festival period beginning Thursday, the near-term outlook for the sector was mixed, FADA said. While dealers had raised inventory in the two-wheeler category, PV inventory was at the lowest for this year due to the chip shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/auto-retail-sales-decline-5-as-two-wheelers-tractors-drag/article36889271.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fitch cuts GDP growth to 8.7%, cites COVID impact||Fitch Ratings slashed its FY22 growth forecast for India from 10% to 8.7%, citing the severe second COVID-19 wave, which it said would ‘delay rather than derail’ economic recovery. Accordingly, it raised the growth forecast for FY23 to 10% from 8.5% estimated earlier. The ratings agency has also retained the ‘negative’ outlook on India’s sovereign BBB- rating, citing greater uncertainty over the country’s debt levels due to a sharp deterioration in public finances triggered by the pandemic shock. “India’s rating balances a still-strong medium-term growth outlook and external resilience from solid foreign-reserve buffers, against high public debt, a weak financial sector and some lagging structural factors,” Fitch said in its sovereign credit overview for the Asia-Pacific. The agency said higher public debt trajectories were the reason it had retained the ‘negative’ outlook for India as well as Japan and Australia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fitch-cuts-gdp-growth-to-87-cites-covid-impact/article36889264.ece

The survey, which was based on the responses of 3,881 professionals from July 31 to September 24, added that keeping pace with the times of change for the last 18 months had adversely affected the mental health of working professionals. When asked to share their primary reasons for work stress, the respondents cited ‘balancing work with personal needs’ (34%), ‘not making enough money’ (32%), and ‘slow career advancement’ (25%) as the top three reasons.  “These stressful times of change have impelled the need for greater flexibility and work-life balance among professionals,” said Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, LinkedIn. “But our survey reveals a wide gap between what employees need and what employers are offering to cope with stress,” he added. Mr. Gupta said while nearly half of (47%) employed professionals preferred to end work at reasonable hours, only about one-thirds (36%) were actually able to do so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/linkedin-survey-finds-55-professionals-are-stressed/article36889269.ece

Adarsh was in the race for the top spot after a strong start of two perfect rounds in the final, but was overtaken to the gold by Henry Turner Leverett of USA 32 to 28. It was a fine performance by Adarsh after the disappointment in the second stage of qualification when he could collect only 280 points as against 294 in the first stage. The Sidhu twins, Udhayveer and Vijayveer, also made the final but were placed fifth and sixth respectively. Trap team second There was another silver in the trap team event when Bakhtyaruddin Malek, Shardul Vihan and Vivaan Kapoor went down fighting 4-6 to Italy. India climbed further on top of the medals table with nine gold, eight silver and three bronze. USA followed a close second with six gold, eight silver and five bronze medals.  The results:   Junior men: 25m rapid fire pistol: 1. Henry Turner Leverett (USA) 32 (579); 2. Adarsh Singh 28 (574); 3. Laurent Cussigh (Fra) 24 (578); 5. Vijayveer Sidhu 13 (572); 6.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||KKR has one foot in playoffs||Kolkata Knight Riders is all but assured of a place in the top four after an 86-run win over Rajasthan Royals in Sharjah on Thursday. Needing 172 to win, RR quickly slumped to one for two. KKR opened the bowling with Shakib Al Hasan, who cleaned up Yashasvi Jaiswal in the first over before Shivam Mavi had Sanju Samson caught in the next. Lockie Ferguson, coming back after an injury, then removed Liam Livingstone and Anuj Rawat in his first over. Rajasthan, 17 for four after the PowerPlay, sank further when Mavi got rid of Shivam Dube and Glenn Phillips in the same over. Rahul Tewatia's power-hitting allowed RR some respite but it was too little too late. Mavi finished with four for 21. Earlier, Shubman Gill made a measured fifty. RR, which chose to chase, bowled pace right through the PowerPlay and denied the KKR openers a flying start through tight, accurate bowling. Slow surface On a slow surface, Samson used three quicks, who bowled 20 dots among them and conceded three fours and a six in the first six overs. KKR’s 34 for no loss was the second-slowest PowerPlay score batting first in Sharjah this season. The surface continued to prove difficult to score freely on as the innings progressed. The RR seamers took pace off the ball; the occasional cutters gripped. There wasn't a single over of spin in the first 10 overs. Venkatesh Iyer found his timing in the 10th over when he hit Jaydev Unadkat for two sixes. KKR was 79 for no loss after 10.4 overs when, after having done all the hard work, Venkatesh was clean-bowled by Tewatia. He was replaced by Nitish Rana, who hit Phillips for a four and a six before becoming the Kiwi’s first IPL wicket. Rana may have lasted just five balls, but his knock appeared to give KKR’s innings a spurt. The in-form Rahul Tripathi walked in at No. 4 and began by flicking Phillips through midwicket for four. After being dropped by Samson on five, Tripathi collected back-to-back boundaries off Dube. At the other end, Gill brought up his second successive fifty of the UAE-leg before Chris Morris got him for 56. Tripathi and Dinesh Karthik’s lusty blows at the death helped KKR reach the highest score in Sharjah this season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kkr-rides-on-gills-classy-knock/article36889702.ece
08 October 2021||New Delhi,||Viraj Madappa on fire||Viraj Madappa’s flurry of five birdies over the last six holes, coupled with overnight leader Khalin Joshi’s final-hole bogey, saw the two share the lead at 12-under 204 after the penultimate round of Rs. 70-lakh Tata Steel PGTI MP Cup golf tournament at the Delhi Golf Club course on Thursday. Playing two groups behind the leader group, Madappa signed off the day’s best six-under 66 with his seventh birdie. Khalin, leading by one stroke after the penultimate hole, dropped a shot on the par-5 18th after a wayward tee-shot for a 69 and let Madappa get a share of the lead. The duo is two strokes ahead of Angad Cheema who shot a 67. The day clearly belonged to Madappa. The Kolkata-based 23-year-old, who finished his second round of 67 with a double-bogey, took the turn at 35 after a ninth-hole bogey. But on the inward nine, Madappa sank four birdies on the trot from the 13th hole, and added another on the 18th to put Khalin under pressure. During his stupendous run on the back nine, Madappa missed eagle-putts on the two par-5s — 14th and 18th — from inside 12 feet. His longest birdie-putt came on the 15th where he got lucky from 30 feet. In fact, Madappa could have birdied the par-3 17th hole, too, but his putt lipped out. All this while, Khalin stayed in the lead. He fired four birdies against a lone bogey on the front nine. Coming in, he birdied the 10th to move to 13-under for the first time. His round’s second bogey, on the 12th, brought him back to under-12. A birdie on the par-5 14th, saw Khalin hold on to this one-stroke lead until he faltered on the final green.  The scores (third round): 204 - Viraj Madappa (71, 67, 66), Khalin Joshi (69, 66, 69); 206 - Angad Cheema (71, 68. 67); 207 - Kartik Sharma (70, 68, 69); 208 - N. Thangaraja (70, 67, 71), Rashid Khan (67, 73, 68); 209 - Manu Gandas (67, 70, 72), N. Dharma (71, 68, 70); 210 - S. Chikkarangappa (67, 70, 73), Mohammad Zamal Hossain Mollah (Ban) (74, 67, 69) and Yuvraj Singh Sandhu (69, 75, 66) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/viraj-madappa-on-fire/article36889761.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Rahul leads from the front for Kings||The strokeplay was iridescent. On a tricky pitch, K.L. Rahul struck the ball with grace, flow, timing and a refreshing sense of freedom. Gifted he is! The swing of the bat was as smooth as the willow striking the ball. The sphere streaked through the gaps, cleared the fence. The surface did not matter. Skipper Rahul’s astonishing 98 not out — he fittingly ended the match with a thumping six off Shardul Thakur — off just 42 deliveries with seven fours and a stunning eight sixes enabled Punjab Kings race past CSK’s 134 in only 13 overs with six wickets remaining in this IPL clash at Dubai. Rahul’s blistering display of ball-striking gave his team’s run-rate a boost and lent Punjab Kings a glimmer of hope before KKR’s win against RR ended it. For CSK, suffering a hammering, this was its third successive loss. Punjab lost wickets along the way — Mayank Agarwal was desperately unlucky to be adjudged leg-before to Thakur — but Rahul was in a different zone, striking Josh Hazlewood over his head and then pulling the Aussie for a six and a four. Rahul indeed was a one-man demolition army. Punjab was 51 for two after the PowerPlay, and Rahul’s contribution was 38. He continued in the same manner, clearing the fence effortlessly even as he stayed balanced. Fittingly, Rahul delivered the final blow. Earlier, even as wickets fell around him, opener Faf du Plessis [76 off 55] held the innings together, rotating the strike, striking the odd big blow. The Punjab Kings seamers employed the short-ball ploy capably and CSK, inserted, lost wickets on a pitch that was rather two-paced. Versatile left-armer Arshdeep Singh consumed the in-form Ruturaj Gaikwad on the pull with a mean lifter. Moeen Ali succumbed to a delivery of lift and movement from Arshdeep. CSK was 32 for three in the seventh over when Robin Uthappa pulled Chris Jordan to deep square-leg’s hands. And Ambati Rayudu’s attempted slash off Jordan proved fatal. M.S. Dhoni’s problems against the googly continued when Ravi Bishnoi castled the CSK skipper. The ball did not roll for CSK. Rahul was King!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-leads-from-the-front-for-kings/article36889692.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||MI has a mountain to climb||Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad have locked horns in the last game of the league stage twice in the last six IPL editions. While SRH will hope to reprise last season’s heroics at Sharjah, MI will be eyeing a repeat of the 2015 face-off at Hyderabad, on Friday night. With a spot in the playoffs on the line, Rohit Sharma will want his MI unit at its peak. The defending champion will be wary, however, of bottom-placed SRH, which has nothing to lose. And as it showed on Wednesday when it stunned Royal Challengers Bangalore, Kane Williamson’s side remains a dangerous opponent. In 2015, the last league game between these two teams was a virtual quarterfinal, with the winner set to enter the playoffs. SRH wilted under the pressure and MI advanced in style. In 2020, David Warner and Wriddhiman Saha stitched together an unbroken 151-run opening partnership to guarantee SRH’s spot in the playoffs; MI had already made it and the loss proved inconsequential to it. Cut to Friday in Abu Dhabi, and SRH has nothing tangible to play for this season. Its players, however, have the opportunity to make a case for their retention. For MI, on the other hand, the outcome of its topsy-turvy campaign this year will rely on what it does in its last league clash. The five-time champion’s wobbly middle-order will have to come good for it to have any chance of again making its presence felt at the business end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/reigning-champ-mi-faces-crunch-time/article36889694.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s time to experiment and stay fresh for the playoffs||Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Delhi Capitals (DC) will be keen to iron out any chinks ahead of the playoffs when they meet in Dubai on Friday. The defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Wednesday means RCB's chances of a top-two finish are all but over. The result also meant DC was assured of a top-two spot. The success of Avesh Khan has allowed DC to split the pace duo of Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada and target batters through various passages. In T20 cricket, AB de Villiers has scored 77 runs against Axar Patel in 72 balls and has been dismissed once. The Capitals will look to hold their left-arm spinner back for de Villiers. Among DC batters, Shimron Hetmyer has been explosive. He has been the anchor when wickets have fallen quickly, and the aggressor when the asking rate has gone up. Shreyas Iyer, Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw have added heft. The destructive ability of Rishabh Pant makes DC more enterprising. Fixing the batting order should be high on RCB's agenda. The move to send Dan Christian at No. 3 against SRH failed. Bizarre decision However, more bizarre was the decision to send its best finisher AB de Villiers at 6, below floater Srikar Bharat. In the end, de Villiers faced only 13 deliveries and had six runs to get off the last two balls but couldn't pull it off. De Villiers shouldn't be batting lower than No. 5. Their bowling looks in excellent shape. Harshal Patel has 29 wickets so far this season. Only Dwayne Bravo (32) and Kagiso Rabada (30) have taken more wickets in an IPL season. After a lean first half, Yuzvendra Chahal has rediscovered his guile. This augurs well for RCB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-time-to-experiment-and-stay-fresh/article36889697.ece

08 October 2021||Milan,||Spain canters into the Nation’s League final||Spain brought Italy’s record 37-match unbeaten run to an end on Wednesday with a 2-1 win to reach the Nations League final. Ferran Torres’ first-half brace won the Final Four clash for Spain at the San Siro. Lorenzo Pellegrini pulled a goal back with seven minutes left but the European champions failed to complete what would have been a memorable comeback. Italy, which beat Spain in the Euro 2020 semifinals, had to play over half the match with 10 men after Leonardo Bonucci was sent off in the 42nd minute for elbowing Sergio Busquets in the face during an aerial challenge. The match was played in a strange atmosphere as AC Milan fans in the stadium harangued Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma throughout his return to the San Siro following his move to Paris Saint-Germain.  The result:   Semifinal: Italy 1 (Pellegrini 83) lost to Spain 2 (F.

08 October 2021||JAMSHEDPUR,||FIH awards the result of team’s hard work, says Reid||Encouraged by the clean sweep of International Hockey Federation (FIH) awards, the men and women hockey players are keen to carry forward their good work in the Tokyo Olympics and achieve more glory in upcoming events. Men’s team chief coach Graham Reid, who will also coach India in the Junior World Cup in Bhubaneswar next month, said the awards were the result of the team’s hard work. “It is a reflection of the work done in the last two years. An Olympic medal after 41 years has woken a lot of people to hockey again,” said Reid, who bagged the Best Coach award, during a virtual press conference on Thursday. Sidestepping the controversy surrounding the awards, Reid said, “We have nothing to do with how we are chosen.” Reid looked forward to his assignment with the juniors. “It is exciting looking for new talent. Expectation is there but five years is a long time in junior hockey. We won in 2016 does not mean we will win in 2021.” Asian Games a priority Listing upcoming elite men’s assignments, including the Asian Champions Trophy in December and Pro League and Asian Games next year, Reid said the Asian Games would be important as the winner would qualify for the Paris Olympics. P.R. Sreejesh, who was chosen Best Goalkeeper (men), said the Olympic bronze medal had given more responsibility and it would be important to “refocus and get the rhythm back” for future events. Harmanpreet Singh and Vivek Sagar Prasad, who got Best Player and Best Rising Star respectively among men, expressed happiness.  Recalling how the news of FIH awards was broken to the team in a dramatic manner at the camp in Bengaluru, Best Goalkeeper (women) Savita Punia said the team would be eager to continue with the good work and get results in big events. “We celebrated after the Olympics (fourth place finish). But there is responsibility to do well in the Asia Cup, a World Cup qualifier, and the Asian Games, an Olympics qualifier. From Rio to Tokyo, there was a big difference in mindset and self-confidence. “The (sense of) responsibility of each player has increased. Every week we have leadership groups,” said Savita, who requested coach Janneke Schopman to resume the camp as soon as possible. Along with Savita, Gurjit Kaur (Best Player, women) and Sharmila Devi (Best Rising Star, women) welcomed the seamless transition from Sjoerd Marijne to Janneke. “It is good that Janneke will continue to work with us. She was equally involved in coaching. She worked on the mental side as well. She told us that it was normal to have pressure before big matches and that was a big change. Earlier, we did not talk about that,” said Savita.  There is responsibility to do well in the Asia Cup, a World Cup qualifier, and the Asian Games, an Olympics qualifier Savita Punia||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fih-awards-the-result-of-teams-hard-work-says-reid/article36889286.ece
08 October 2021||JAMSHEDPUR,||Revival of National-ranking tournaments planned by AAI||With the aim of grooming youngsters for the 2028 and 2032 Olympics, the Archery Association of India (AAI) plans to revive National-ranking tournaments. The AAI has set a goal of making the up-and-coming talent war-ready by exposing them to tournaments round the year. Olympic performance “Cadet archers get just one event a year. Efforts have begun to restart National-ranking tournaments so that they get more events. More exposure on the domestic circuit will help us identify more new faces,” High Performance Director Sanjeeva Singh told The Hindu on the sidelines of the National championships. “India has been knocking on the doors of the Olympics for a long time. The next target for us is reaching the semifinals, which are medal matches. In the World championships, we need to go one step up as we have not won a gold medal yet,” said Singh, an Arjuna and Dronacharya award winner. Sports science “Sports science is going to play a key role. We have already started using it. We are focusing on lower heart rate, better structure (perfect T-structure which ensures better transfer of power on the arrows), high draw strength and good height to identify and groom talent. “Advanced countries like Korea, Germany, Italy and Turkey are focusing on bio-mechanics and using different software to ensure that every time an archer shoots, the body angle remains correct and the scoring is optimised. If angles change, then it impacts the shots,” he said. Setting the ambience The AAI is trying to put in place podium settings for top domestic events, including the National championships here. “You see many events like this in Korea. Such a setting creates the ambience of a big event. When archers shoot on a podium in domestic competitions, they don’t get overawed at bigger international events,” said Singh. The recurve competitions of the National championships begin on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/revival-of-national-ranking-tournaments-planned-by-aai/article36889740.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Riya Sachdeva outwits Saina Deshpande||Riya Sachdeva saved a bunch of match points from being down 1-5 in the second set to outwit Saina Deshpande 3-6, 7-6(5), 6-2 in the under-16 girls’ pre-quarterfinals of the National sub-junior tennis championship at the DLTA Complex here on Thursday. Cheered strongly by the fellow trainees of the National Tennis Centre, Riya was quite steady with her strokes in taking the punch out of her opponent’s game. Saina had beaten the top seed in the second round, but could not wriggle out of the clutches of Riya this day, after a vibrant first half. “I was impressed with Riya’s ability to fight right till the end. For a 14-year-old, she showed maturity to change her game when what she was comfortable playing, did not work. It was the second match for her after a short gap. It is all a learning experience,” said National coach Zeeshan Ali, who watched the whole match. In the quarterfinals, Riya will take on Sonal Patil who was brilliant in taming fifth seed Abhaya Vamuri for the loss of five games. Riya will also play the under-14 quarterfinals against Ikaraju Kanumuri. In the under-16 boys’ section, Tarun Korwar overcame Omar Rehan Sumar 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 in an entertaining contest.

08 October 2021||KOCHI,||We don’t have proper second string team to send to CWG: Baskaran||The real reasons for Hockey India’s decision to withdraw the men’s and women’s teams from next year’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham may be caught in a bit of a haze. But Olympic gold medallist V. Baskaran believes that Graham Reid, the Indian men’s team’s head coach, had a big say in the matter. “If you look at it, Reid now calls the tune because he has delivered a bronze at the Olympics. So, I think HI has decided to go with him,” said Baskaran, the captain of the triumphant Indian team at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, in a chat with The Hindu . The hockey champion of the Asian Games at Hangzhou (China, Sept. 10-25) will directly qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics and the problem is the Commonwealth Games (July 28-Aug. 8) take place just a month before that in Birmingham.  “I also feel that we have to focus on the Asiad as it is an Olympic qualification event. “We lost in the last Asian Games (India won bronze in 2018 at Jakarta) and we struggled for one and half years to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. We had to travel a lot and do a lot of things. Weak competition “We can win it this time because Pakistan is not good, Korea is nothing much. If we win the Asian Games, we will have the same core group and can make the boys better for the 2023 World Cup in India. I think Reid is focusing on filling the vacuum left by players like Rupinder Pal Singh, V.S. Sunil and Birendra Lakra who retired recently, and on qualifying for Paris.” But won’t the Commonwealth Games, which includes world’s top 10 teams like Australia, England, New Zealand and Canada, offer a wonderful preparation for the World Cup in Bhubaneswar in early 2023? Can’t we at least send a second string team for the Commonwealth Games? “We have suffered a lot at the Commonwealth Games. Because, there they will give us four continuous games and the competition will be very high. “If the development team goes also, it is not going to learn much,” explained Baskaran. Another issue is that India does not have a proper second string. “The problem of not having a development team now is because of COVID. There may be players but how will you prepare them. In 2016, our Junior World Cup team was good (India won the title), but the pandemic has taken its toll. No talent identification “For the last two years, there was no talent identification, no Khelo India, no Junior Nationals, no Nationals. The problem is, who will we send as the goalkeeper. Sreejesh and Krishan Pathak are seniors (and with the Asiad probables). “So, I’ll agree 80% with the decision of not sending a team to the Commonwealth Games.”  If we win the Asian Games, we will have the same core group and can make the boys better for the 2023 World Cup in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-proper-second-string-team-to-send-to-cwg/article36889898.ece
08 October 2021||Chennai,||Vijay, Mukund not among probables||Big names Murali Vijay and Abhinav Mukund, both internationals, are not among the 41 cricketers (21 among them probables) picked for all forms of cricket by the Tamil Nadu selectors this season.  The Hindu has learnt from reliable sources that the 31-year-old Abhinav (320 Test runs and 10,258 First Class runs) has indicated to the TNCA that he is relocating to Mumbai where his wife is now working. Abhinav, it is understood, wants to focus on commentary and coaching. It is unclear at this stage whether he wants to continue his career as a cricketer. He last represented the State in 2020. The 37-year-old Vijay last played for CSK in 2020, and for the State in 2019. The technically pleasing opener (3,982 Test runs and 9,205 First Class runs) has, like Abhinav, not played any form of cricket lately, whether it is TNPL, TNCA first division league, or the VAP Trophy. Last year he wrote to the selectors that he was not available and has not played any cricket after that. It is believed Vijay suffers from vaccine hesitancy and mentally does not want to be a part of a ‘bubble’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vijay-mukund-not-among-probables/article36889817.ece

The rescheduled Thomas and Uber Cup Finals, the men’s and women’s team tournament respectively, will be held from October 9 to 17 at Aarhus, Denmark. “Two weeks before going for Sudirman, I pulled my Abs and I decided to skip the Sudirman Cup. But I am now fit and really looking forward to the Thomas Cup Finals,” Chirag, one half of the world No. 10 pair, said. “We have strong doubles pairs, not only strong singles players this time. So we can win a medal as well. We are definitely in for a medal. Last team champion that we played, it was Asian Team championship and we ended up with a bronze, so I feel we have the team to win a medal,” he said. “Looking at the draw, we should reach the quarterfinal first and then step up our game to go for medal.” Chirag said. “Till the last moment I was supposed to go, but there are three more tournaments after Sudirman Cup, so playing five weeks without practice would not make any sense, I could have aggravate the injury. So decided to focus on Thomas Cup.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-have-the-team-to-win-a-medal-chirag/article36889755.ece
08 October 2021||MUMBAI,||Yalvigi complains to MCA against Kiran Powar||Anand Yalvigi, a Mumbai senior selector, has complained to Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president Vijay Patil, against Kiran Powar, players’ representative in the apex council, for threatening to select certain players and using foul language. In an email to Patil on Thursday, accessed by The Hindu , Yalvigi has alleged Powar of attempting to pressurise the selectors to pick certain players from “his club Goregaon Sports Club” for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. “His tone and language was atrocious and unparliamentary. He threatened all the selection committee members of dire consequences if the player is not selected. It was shocking and disgraceful to see a former player use such language and pressurise a senior selector of Mumbai,” Yalvigi wrote in the email.  “Such calls are disturbing and demotivating. If such things continue, I can only say ‘God help Mumbai Cricket’. I sincerely hope such things shouldn’t be tolerated and strictest action should be taken to avoid any further embarrassment, Yalvigi concluded. “I have spoken to all my colleagues and they are of the same opinion too. Looking forward to your support and intervention at the earliest, sir.” Neither Patil nor Powar responded to attempts made to reach them for their views on the subject. The senior selection panel and the apex council have been at loggerheads since last season. After the curtailed 2020-21 season, all members except chief selector Salil Ankola had complained to former MCA chief Sharad Pawar against office-bearers for trying to influence selection. All selectors, barring Ankola, were replaced for the forthcoming season. But Yalvigi’s email has reopened the pandora’s box ahead of the season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/yalvigi-complains-to-mca-against-kiran-powar/article36890349.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Holder lavishes praise on Umran and bowlers||Sunrisers Hyderabad’s West Indian all-rounder Jason Holder heaped praise on his side’s bowling unit for its superlative effort in defending 141 and securing a four-run win against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. “Over the years, Sunrisers has had a good trend of bowling well at the death… and good bowling in general. And it showed,” Holder said after the match. “Siddarth Kaul was outstanding. The young Umran [Malik], myself and Bhuvneshwar finished it off quite well.” Holder was mighty impressed by the young tearaway speedster Umran, who conceded just 21 runs from four overs, including a brilliant first spell of 3-0-10-1. “He is consistent in training and has given us quite a hard time as he is very difficult to get hold of,” said Holder, with a smile. “As you have seen, he is deceiving quite a lot of batters.” “It’s good to see his control as well. A lot of bowlers who bowl fast may seem erratic but Umran has grouped some good deliveries together.” Turning point Mike Hesson, RCB’s Director of Cricket Operations and Head Coach, felt that Glenn Maxwell’s run out with 50 runs still to get was the turning point. “Considering he was scoring at over 10 runs an over and seemed the only batter who had some fluency, he was the man who we wanted at the crease,” Hesson said. “But we left too much to do towards the end and weren't good enough at key moments.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/holder-lavish-in-praise-of-umran-and-bowlers/article36889700.ece

Dhoni has no doubt that he would be seen in yellow even in 2022 but at this point, he does not know whether that colour would be that of Chennai Super Kings. “Well, you can see me in yellow next year. But whether I will be playing for CSK? There are a lot of uncertainties around it for a simple reason that we have two new teams coming up,” said Dhoni, referring to the IPL’s expansion into a 10-team competition from next season. “We don’t know the retention policy. We don’t know how many foreigners, Indian players we can retain, the money cap that every player will be cutting from the kitty. So there are a lot of uncertainties. “Unless the rules are in place, you can’t really decide that. So we will wait for it to happen and hopefully it will be good for everyone,” he added. The comment is bound to create a flutter as earlier this week, while interacting with fans during the 75th year celebrations of India Cements, Dhoni dropped hints he will be playing for CSK next season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhoni-not-sure-if-it-will-be-csk-yellow-next-season/article36889699.ece

08 October 2021||Bengaluru,||Abhimanyu Mithun calls it a day||Fast bowler A. Mithun announced his retirement on Thursday. “Cricket is a universal game and I believe in finishing at the highest level. So I had to take this decision and seek better opportunities for myself and my family around the world. I am also clear in my mind that Karnataka has abundant fast bowling talent and they would miss out on opportunities at the right time if I prolong my career,” Mithun stated in a letter. The Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) clarified that Mithun will be withdrawn from Karnataka’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy 50-over probables lists. A tall, well built pacer, Mithun represented India in four Tests and five ODIs. He picked up four for 105 in the first innings of his Test debut, against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2010. Despite the early international success, Mithun could not find a permanent spot in the Indian team. He last wore the India cap in an ODI against West Indies, at Chennai in 2011. Mithun enjoyed a rewarding 13-year domestic career with Karnataka. Alongside Vinay Kumar and S. Arvind, Mithun formed a match-winning pace attack. If Vinay and Arvind foxed batters with guile, Mithun rushed in at full tilt to generate good pace and awkward bounce on flat pitches. He took 338 wickets in 103 First Class matches, with 12 five-wicket hauls and two 10-wicket match hauls. In 96 List A outings, Mithun recorded 136 scalps. He was a handy lower-order bat, often using the long handle to good effect. He was an integral part of the Karnataka team which racked up trophies in the previous decade. “It has been my honour to have played for Karnataka and win so many trophies for my state,” Mithun stated. The 31-year-old represented Royal Challengers Bangalore, Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL. Mithun is expected to relocate to the United Kingdom with his family. His wife, Rayane Hardy, is a UK citizen. “We, at KSCA, respect his decision, and would like to place on record his invaluable contribution to the State of Karnataka and the country. His exploits on the field will be etched in the annals of Karnataka’s cricketing history. We wish him the very best in his future endeavours, and are indeed hopeful that he will continue to contribute to Karnataka cricket in various other capacities post his retirement,” the KSCA stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/abhimanyu-mithun-calls-it-a-day/article36889752.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Lessons from Nature||Nature affords many lessons to us, which we often fail to grasp. Whether it is rain or a pleasant breeze, it is for all. No discrimination is shown by Nature. A man who deserves to be admired is one to whom generosity towards all comes easily, said Malayaman, in a discourse. Pari, Pegan, Kari, Ai, Adhiyaman, Nalli and Ori were kings of the Sangam age, who covered themselves with glory, through their virtuous conduct. Sangam era works like Sirupanatrupadai and Purananuru sang their praises. There were also other kings known for being generous, like Nannan, Kumanan and Nalliyakodan, who lived 2000 years ago in Tamil Nadu. Pari used his royal chariot to support a jasmine creeper. Pegan gave his royal cloak to a peacock dancing in the rain. Adhiyaman gave to poet Avvaiyar a gooseberry believed to confer longevity on anyone who consumed it. Tamil literature lauds selfless people. The Jain work Naladiyar says that he who only cares for his body is worthless. Only a person who helps others reaches heaven. Thiruvalluvar used examples from Nature to show the ways in which we can be generous. There are people who inherit property, accumulated over generations. But they do not hoard their wealth, but give gladly to others. Thiruvalluvar compares them to public tanks, which are useful to everyone in a village. A mango tree’s fruits drop to the ground, thereby benefiting many creatures. A man who earns wealth through his hard work, but gives a portion of his money to others, is like a mango tree. Every part of a neem tree has medicinal value, and the tree lets people use its bark, leaves, flowers and fruits. A man worthy of respect uses his wealth for others. Such people are compared to neem tree by Thiruvalluvar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/lessons-from-nature/article36889662.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||When they see us||You cannot go a whole day without hearing about Squid Game , the new Korean survival-horror fest that has people looking at children’s games in a whole new way. Directed and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the series on Netflix follows a number of people with heavy debts competing against each other in a series of seemingly innocent games for cash prize. But the rug gets pulled out from under them when they realise they are not just playing for money, but for their lives — losers get killed instantly in these games. Despite the bone-chilling displays of manipulation, peer pressure, and straight-up gaslighting seen throughout, the concept has enthralled millions around the world; people are recreating games such as Red Light, Green Light and the Dalgona cracking challenge. The cosplay world is already teeming with recreations of the pink overalls-suited soldiers, the Front Man with his geometric mask and, of course, the massive singing doll with swivelling eyes. Sameer Bundela, an award-winning cosplayer in Mumbai, is excited about the potential of Squid Game in this space. Often opting for sinister and complex characters, he appreciates the eye for detail. He particularly praises New York-based cosplayer M4stiff (pronounced ‘mastiff’) for her recreation of the singing doll; she donned a wig with the high-cut bangs and two ponytails, along with the orange tunic and yellow T-shirt teamed with knee-high socks and black shoes. But M4stiff took it to a sinister level with blackout contact lenses to mimic the soulless look of the doll that creeped everyone out. The giant robotic doll is featured in the first game of the series, as the host of Red Light, Green Light. The game is fairly common; you run towards a safe finish line while the host’s head is turned away. When they turn back towards the players, whoever is still moving is out. But in Squid Game context, ‘out’ means dead; and the doll’s eyes — which are actually cameras — swivel about to scan players’ body movements and the hidden rifles around the area shoot them if they move. Not just fun games US TikToker, TheBlondeJon, and his friends recreated the Red Light, Green Light game in an empty canal, complete with bright-coloured overalls, masks and paintball guns that were not fired but just aimed at the still-moving players. The video has got more than one lakh views across various platforms. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, Dhruv Viswanathan and his friends have summer plans to play the game. “I am reuniting with some old college friends, and we will play the game at our farm house next May. We plan to play the doll’s song on a loudspeaker and use water balloons filled with red water on those who still move, just to recreate the experience without hurting anyone. We have made a WhatsApp group just for that. We have already ordered overalls and masks from abroad which will take time to come,” he says. Would it even be a Squid Game cultural wave without the mention of ppopgi , aka honeycomb toffee or Dalgona? Jeon Minpyo, manager of Nowana, a family-run Korean restaurant in Auroville, recently started offering the Dalgona candy challenge to customers. In the series, the contestants are tasked with carefully cutting out a traced shape from a Dalgona candy disc — if contestants broke into the shape, they are killed. Of course, at Nowana, there are no such repercussions, says Minpyo with a laugh. “It took a lot of trial and error to get the consistency right, so we spent a whole day perfecting the ratios! If a customer succeeds, they get to take one home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-they-see-us/article36889521.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||How’s that!||“ Agathe Agathe Aithu !! (‘It will happen, it will happen, it hashappened!!’ in Kannada)” began a tweet from the official handle of German Women’s Cricket last August. Their captain had just accomplished a feat that no other woman in international cricket has: four wickets in four balls in a T20 International. As the lower-ranked Austria floundered at 40/3 in 14 overs, chasing 198 at the Seebarn Cricket Centre, she wrecked them further in the next over with a four-wicket maiden. In the 18th over, the medium-pacer picked up one more to finish with an astonishing bowling figure (three overs, two maidens, one run, and five wickets). Whoever was tweeting from the German Women's Cricket team account wanted to pay Anuradha Doddaballapur a little tribute in her mother tongue. More accolades awaited Anuradha. She led the team to a commanding 5-0 series win that witnessed a slew of records: two hat-tricks, first T20I century, first T20I five-for, and an unbeaten opening partnership across all T20Is. Another 5-0 win over France this year extended the team’s T20I winning streak to 14. The hitherto little-known German cardiovascular scientist was getting interview requests for an accomplishment in a game, which for her is a “serious hobby”. But cricket captured her interest before science.  Getting into the game   Anuradha grew up in Basavanagudi, a residential locality in South Bengaluru. Like many middle-class fathers of that time in Bengaluru, hers too was a keen follower of cricket. A youngster from her city named Rahul Dravid was already making his presence felt in international cricket. Anuradha was more drawn to a cricketer from another country. The fearsome fast bowler from South Africa: Allan Donald. On a Sunday morning from Frankfurt, where she lives now, she reminisces about her childhood during the ‘90s over the phone. Dosas from Vidyarthi Bhavan and CTR. Traffic-free roads. Despite her fondness for Donald, Anuradha bowled leg-spin in her initial days. She also recalls what she calls the “moment of reckoning” in her cricket career. “I was in Class VII at Bishop Cotton Girls’ school and a classmate who was playing for Karnataka then told me about an Under-16 trial. I dialled home from one of those one-rupee coin-operated phones and told them I would be late.” A few weeks later, Anuradha made her debut for the Karnataka U-16 side. Some of her teammates like Veda Krishnamurthy, Vanitha VR, Nooshin Al Khadeer, Karuna Jain and Mamatha Maben went on to play for India. She, too, could have had she chose to focus more on her “serious hobby” than her burgeoning interest in science. The following for women’s cricket in India was almost absent then. It was not a great career choice. So, in 2008, she moved to the UK for a Masters in Medical Genetics at Newcastle University. Three years later, she was in Frankfurt for a PhD in Cardiovascular Biology at the Goethe University. She is now a postdoctoral research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research. What if women’s cricket in India had the following it has now? Would she have chosen cricket over science? Anuradha pauses before saying, “I think I would have still gone to the UK. I might have taken a little longer to decide.”  Making a mark away   Though she chose science over cricket for her profession, she never let go of the game. It had become a part of her life. In her three-year stay in England, she played for Newcastle University, South North Cricket Club and Northumberland women’s county side. At least England was a cricketing nation and it was not too difficult to find women who played cricket. Frankfurt, where she moved to in 2011, was another story. It did not have a women’s team. So she did what she did as a young girl in Basavanagudi; play with the boys. It was awkward for the men who played against the Frankfurt Cricket Club (FCC). “They were surprised to see a woman bowling to them. And, I do not think they were very pleased when they got out,” she adds, laughing. Despite getting the better of the guys, Anuradha had an idea to start a women’s team for FCC in 2015. There was a problem — there were hardly any players to pick. Right, so there is not a team to pick; so, let us build one, thought Anuradha. She took up coaching, did a certified course and started teaching the basics to novices. Eight months into 2015, she put together a women's team. Six years later, she won the top-division tournament, German Women’s Bundesliga with them for the first time. She came. She saw. She found no team; so created one. And, she conquered. She has been a part of the German side since 2013. She has played 18 T20Is, including the one that prompted the team’s Twitter handle to tweet in Kannada. Germany was ranked outside the top-40 in the ICC T20I rankings when T20I status was granted in 2018 to all international games. They are 24th now. Anuradha would have liked to lead them to a World Cup participation. It would take several years of constant progress for Germany to get there. Anuradha, 34, might not be playing then, but would like to see the next generation of players getting there. The requirement of resilience. That is what, according to Anuradha, ties cricket and science together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/hows-that/article36889559.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Grab your||Our seasonal guests have landed, in millions, after marathon flights across continents. Birds from 29 countries fly to India every year at this time, an annual ritual signifying the beginning of migration. The stint, a bird that weighs just about 20 grams, makes an astonishing journey covering 8,000 kms from Siberia to Tamil Nadu’s Point Calimere. Forested areas of the Indian Peninsula are aflutter with warblers, a wispy olive green bird, that fly thousands of kilometres from the mountains of Central Asia. The bar-tailed godwits, after spending their summers in Russia, will soon embark on a long non-stop flight to spend the winters at shallow water bodies in Pulicat and Sholinganallur. As daylight shrinks and food supply dwindles at the breeding sites in the northern hemisphere, birds start migrating towards wintering sites in the South. “It’s a natural process of survival. They take nine flyways across the world and some unusual routes during this flight,” says S Sivakumar, scientist at Bombay Natural History Society. He adds, “The Central Asian Flyway covers 30 countries including India. The black-headed, brown-headed and slender-billed gulls have arrived, mostly from Europe and Central Asia.”  Our special guests can easily be spotted perched on trees or at a wooded area, says Ashvin Viswanathan of Bird Count India, Bengaluru. Bird Count India supports listing and monitoring of birds across India. “Grey wagtails have arrived. I saw a blue-tailed bee eater (that breeds in North and central India) calling and migrating while heading South. Most birds migrate in the night. When you go to a forest patch or a garden in the morning near your home, you will see a new bird every day as it rests there after flying all night,” he adds. Many birders have observed unusual sightings. For example, Amur falcons made a stopover in Pune in huge numbers in January, and the red-necked phalarope, a pelagic bird showed up at Uppar Dam in Dharapuram, a non-coastal area during the last week of September. Birds have a few favourite places, says Ramakrishnan Aiyaswamy, a wildlife photographer in Bengaluru. “They choose their place based on the availability of food and how long they can stay there. They also have a plan B, and choose another water body in the nearby area if their original habitat is disturbed.” As long as the birds keep up the date with migration, birders are happy as it indicates healthy environment and a safe habitat. “We are waiting to meet the brown shrike that comes from Mongolian region. Every year, we see two birds at our school campus in Valparai. It arrives by first week of October. We see more than 30 migrant species here during the migration season,” says K Selvaganesh, a birder and teacher at Valparai near Coimbatore. During this time, some birds called passage migrants, like the European roller, rufous-tailed scrub robin, and common white throat, migrate through Rajasthan, Gujarat and other parts of the Indian Peninsula to cross the Arabian Sea. They move to Africa by mid-October to spend the winters there. “This time of the year is fascinating for bird watchers as a number of incredibly beautiful birds pass through the Indian subcontinent on their way to somewhere else. Birders in Delhi can now see the greenish warbler (from Europe), Blythe’s reed warbler (from Europe and Russia) and rusty-tailed flycatcher (from Kashmir and Himachal) passing through as the birds are heading southwards,” adds Ashvin. The common stonechat, a chunky little bird from Siberia and Turkey, has arrived in Delhi, says Col Pankaj Sharma (Retd), who runs Indian Birds on Facebook, the largest online community on birds in the Indian subcontinent that has 2.7 lakh members. “The bar-headed geese, northern shovellers, and pigtails from the ducks family will be arriving early as the wetlands are already full because of rains in September. I am waiting for the endangered steppe eagle to land from Europe. These birds can be sighted at Aravalli Range of Gurgaon, and in areas around Jhajjar district in Haryana.” Though birds have been carrying on these long trips for millions of years, Aravind says one can spot small changes in trends through eBird database and through sites like Migrant Watch. “Siberian Cranes, which are critically endangered, used to visit Bharatpur Sanctuary about 20 years ago, but we don’t see them now because that population which visited India seems to have gone extinct.” Charting new courses Agrees Ashvin, who has put together animation maps on migration based on data uploaded on citizen science platform eBird. “There is suspicion on how birds might be reacting to shifts in climate. Bird species like yellow-browed warbler and Richard’s pipit migrated to Northeast India, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Now, they are landing in western Europe in a new migratory route. There is a documented change in pattern.” Researches track birds using satellite tags and that reveals knowledge on individual birds and their migration routes. “We ringed northern shoveller at Manjeera Wildlife Sanctuary in Telangana, and tracked its flight all the way to Russia,” says Sivakumar and adds, “Migration is a long, exhausting journey. Global warming is real. Rains are inconsistent. Wetlands are drying up. At the world level, some changes have been noticed among the breeding ranges of birds already. We have to conserve our wetlands to ensure that food is available for the visitors. They can gain weight and fly back to their breeding ground on time and bring a healthy offspring.”     Chennai watchlist Terns and gulls can be seen at Pulicat lake. Whiskered tern is the most common migratory tern, and that can be seen atwe can find in multiple waterbodies in the city Caspian tern, which is the world’s largest tern, can be seen in many places around the city (like Sholinganallur, Pallikaranai, Adyar Estuary and even along the beaches atlike Besant Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur and so on) Brown-headed gull is the most common gull and can be seen at Adyar Estuary, Kelambakkam, and Pulicat Birds of prey — like marsh harriers, kestrels, short-eared owls, peregrine falcons and multiple species of eagles — can be found around Pallikaranai and Sholinganallur marshlands||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/grab-your/article36889547.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Cartoons underground||The location of the two-decade-old Indian Institute of Cartoonists (IIC) is surprisingly modest. It is almost like a meeting spot for a secret group. A few metres into Midford Garden road near Trinity Circle is the Midford Garden House with a board that says ‘Indian Cartoon Gallery’. If you miss the little red arrow mark on the board that points to the basement, you would probably look for the gallery in the other areas of the building. On a Monday morning, there are no visitors at the gallery, hosting IIC’s 172nd exhibition. There are 58 cartoons, by professionals and amateurs from India, on display. Looking at them, one wonders if this underground club-like setting is appropriate in a way. For, no one and nothing is spared from criticism and ridicule. The government, the opposition, Goods and Service Tax, Donald Trump, Rajinikanth, and of course, the more topical Coronavirus. “This is a free space for cartoonists across all ages and levels to display their works,” says VG Narendra, who started IIC in 2001. Narendra, 73, started reading newspapers in his late teens. Growing up in Dharwad, he read the Kannada dailies more than the English ones. More than the articles, the cartoons caught young Narendra’s attention. “They were entertaining and humorous but also gave an idea about what is happening in the society,” he says. “I used to look forward to them every day.” Soon, he started drawing them. A few got published in the local dailies. Narendra wanted cartooning to be more than just a hobby. So, after his graduation in BSc Physics in 1969, he left for Mumbai. He found a job at the Free Press Journal , where RK Laxman and Bal Thackeray had worked. His work caught the attention of the legendary cartoonist Shankar Pillai, who ran Shankar’s Weekly . Pillai employed and mentored him. He worked for the publication for two years until the Emergency in 1975 forced it to shut down. After returning home the following year, he founded the Karnataka Cartoonists Association. He wished for a national-level organisation for cartoonists. “The artists had the Lalit Kala Akademi. The writers had Sahitya Akademi. So, why not something similar for cartoonists?” He discussed this question with Mario Miranda, one of the country’s best-known cartoonists and illustrators. With his guidance, Narendra started IIC in 2001. SM Krishna, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, gave Rs. 5 lakh for a two-day national convention and exhibition. Over a hundred cartoonists across the country participated. IIC, however, had no premises until Ashok Kheny helped it get the 5,000 sq ft Midford House basement. So, where did it operate from until then? “My two-bedroom house in Nandini Layout,” jokes Narendra. He is grateful that IIC now has its premises. Over the last 20 years, it has organised over 170 exhibitions, teach over 500 aspiring cartoonists, build a library of over 3,000 books on cartoons, and attract hundreds of leading national and international cartoonists.  IIC will organise an exhibition from October 23 to November 16 to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of RK Laxman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cartoons-underground/article36889551.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Meet the millets||Whatever rice and wheat can do, millets can do better as revealed by cookies, savouries and all manner of munchies. With the United Nations declaring 2023 as the Year of Millets earlier this year, pearl, foxtail, amaranth, broomcorn and buckwheat are back in the news. Widely used in India and popular as bajra, kakum, rajgira, chena and kuttu, millets are not just a passing fad. Indian, Chinese and Egyptian civilisations used these cereals 6,000 years ago, and the Vedas make mention of a tribal girl feeding Lord Muruga a meal of foxtail millet and honey. Once a staple in almost every region, the cultivation of millets went into decline in India due to a host of factors including colonisation and changed cropping patterns. “There was a time when rice was served only during festivals and only the very rich could afford to eat it regularly,” says Mahesh Basavanna, CEO and founder of OrgTree in Mandya, Karnataka. He adds, “Despite having to be hand pounded, millets were the only cultivable option for thousands of years in the rain-fed Aravallis. The Government supply of rice, which was easier to cook, slowly edged out other millets, except for ragi,” Presently Kiru by OrgTree manufactures millet-based food products such as cookies, crunchies and energy bars. In 2015, Kiru teamed up with 400 farmers for a direct supply of millets, eliminating the middlemen. “Their women work in our factories which has also resulted in an increase in the income levels of their households. Almost 80% of our raw material comes from the farmers directly and 80% of our employees are women,” he says. “As a crop, millets do not need a lot of attention and can greatly boost the village economy as they can be grown on non-arable land,” says NS Krishnamoorthi, founder of Prem’s Graama Bhojanam — a restaurant in Chennai  known for its millet-based and farm-fresh menu. The lockdown proved to be a blessing in disguise for Mahesh, who says, “We used to supply to corporates and SAP labs, which halted work due to COVID-19. We had to adapt and come up with a product that could be retailed and since April we have seen a marked improvement in sales.” The lockdowns were a blessing in disguise for Slurrp Farms. “Our sales have grown three times in the past year. More people are reading labels these days, but apart from wanting to try out healthy alternatives, many were finding their way around a kitchen for the first time,” says Meghana Narayan, one of the founders of Gurugram-based Slurrp Farm which has a range of millet-based breakfast cereals, dosa and pancake mixes as well as munchies. “When my daughter was born, my grandmother roasted six to seven different grains and ground them into a fine powder for porridge. We have a heritage of millet and porridge eating culture across India,” says Meghana. As young mothers, Shauravi Malik and Meghana were very conscious of the dietary needs of their little ones. “Suddenly it seemed all the products out there contained maida , sugar and hydrogenated fats. Having children is a game-changer and we wanted to ensure ours had the best in terms of nutrition and taste.” As best friends, the duo always wanted to get into business together. “Millets were not our immediate answer; we were looking for better, healthier alternatives. With Slurrp we were not inventing new products; we were bringing existing ones in a format that were easy for mothers to put on the table, without having to think twice about nutritional content.” Having launched in early 2017, Meghana says there has been a steady increase in sales. “Though our target audience might be children, young adults also enjoy the convenience of opening an instant pancake pack. Mahesh believes the awareness of millets and not the products is key in helping consumers opt for a healthier lifestyle. According to Devaraddi Agasanakoppa of KNS organic farm in Gadag, Karnataka, the region of north Karnataka regularly consumed millets such as jowar, bajra and ragi. “The year-on-year growth in these places has been around 7-9%. However, with growing awareness in cities, the demand has gone up to 12 to 15%, with some metros showing up to a 20% increase in the past decade,” he says, adding that during the pandemic the demand for millets, cold pressed oils and jaggery further shot up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/meet-the-millets/article36889555.ece

Murthy, who is also manager of Grameena Angadi in Jayanagar is known for his Kinnala Gombe showcase. “Families from Kinnala village in Koppal district in Karnataka have taken to other professions owing to the lukewarm demand for their handmade, soft, drumstick wood dolls.” Murthy says Grameena Angadi is stocking dolls from Channapatna near Mysore, papier-mâché dolls from Kondapalli in Andhra Pradesh and Krishnanagar clay dolls from West Bengal. “We have to help the artisans or we might lose valuable traditions.”  Going strong  Shobha Rathnakar has been putting elaborate displays at her home in Malleswaram for the past five decades. “Although I have added dolls to my display, I have scaled it down,” she says. Shobha’s traditional pattada gombe and ivory masterpieces are family heirlooms. Some of the dolls in her 4,000-strong collection are 150-year-old. Her collection features dolls from all over India: silver with meenakari work from Mathura, glass from Delhi’s Meena Bazaar, Krishnanagar miniatures from Bengal and leather puppets. There are also dolls from Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, the UK, Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal. “I cherish the wooden ones I picked up from Varanasi and the traditional Kinnala dolls with the “Standing Gowri’ that has poseable arms and legs.”  Dasara by Dhaatu  Anupama Hoskere, the founder of Dhaatu, an organisation that works to revive traditional puppetry, has an intricate dolls house for the season in Banashankari. The doll and puppet maker and expert storyteller says the 1,500 square foot showcase aims bring back cheer to the season, after the challenges of the pandemic. “We have 72 story boxes of Ramayana,” says Anupama who has made 60 wooden dolls this year. “Each box is dedicated to an episode from the epic. The larger showcase also includes puppets of Ramayana that we used for the Avadh University display last year.” Anupama organises puppetry classes and co-ordinates with well-known puppeteers across the world. Karnataka is home to a large number of puppet forms including leather, string, rod, shadow, specialised string, glove, jointed and finger. “My goal is to train children to make dolls and puppets.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/all-dolled-up/article36889531.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The city as a canvas||Art has outgrown galleries, fitting into digital formats on our smartphones. Sometimes it occupies public spaces so a larger audience can share in the experience. Visitors to Bengaluru’s Berlie Street and Rajarajeshwari Nagar, may have had a glimpse of the works of artists Shan Re and Romicon Revola. Their installations are part of the fifth edition of Chicago-based Terrain Biennale, a public art festival founded in 2011 by artist Sabina Ott. Aimed at bring art into residential communities, this is the first time the Biennale is being held in India, with installations in Kolkata, Madikeri, Mangalore and Mysore as well. “The idea behind the Terrain Biennale is for a host and an artist to collaborate. Apart from a person who is willing to showcase a work of art on their property, it should be in a place with a lot of visibility so that it is accessible from the street,” says Romicon Revola aka Romi, who is known in the sphere of public art. “The theme this year was ‘Keep in Touch’ I sent in my proposal and they accepted it,” says Shan Re, adding, “Communicating with loved ones was a challenge during the pandemic, so the topic was relevant.” The artist who works with multiple mediums believes ‘hands have the power to express emotions’. “Hands also represent notions of protection, connection, strength and stability which are essential to life. During the pandemic we missed human interaction and a sense of touch.” This became the focus of Shan’s work. “For my piece I collaborated with members of the public and invited them to share how they felt during the lockdown and while in isolation. I incorporated their emotions, thoughts and feelings as well as my own, in the installation.” “It was an open call put out by the jury and I responded to it with a proposal which they approved. My idea centred around text messages, because during the pandemic it was the most used form of communication to stay in touch.” According to Romi, typography and digital art is part of her artistic vocabulary. “I believe since public art is not for people who come to galleries and museums, it should be easy to understand; even those who are just passing by should be able to engage with the work,” she says. “For Terrain, I chose three phrases which either summed up the lockdown or were most commonly used during that period — Kindness is Contagious, Stay Safe and Smiles are Key — and put graphics inside each alphabet.” Titled ‘The Human Alphabet,’ Romicon took about two to three weeks to complete her installation. “This non-profit initiative is a way of bringing art to the community.” Shan’s piece titled ‘Rebuilding Lives,’ is suspended from a balcony where it can be seen from both corners of the street. The installation which took her about 10 days to complete, employs bright colours, especially yellow and red, a hallmark of Shan’s work. Launched on October 2, both installations will remain in public till November 15 and those interested in the pieces are encouraged to interact with the artists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-city-as-a-canvas/article36889540.ece

Her soft yet energetic eyes and her beautiful smile will make you believe that anything is possible and that is exactly how her character, Sujata is.” Kajol chips in with, “I instantly connected with Sujata and thought her journey was incredibly inspiring.” The film will be produced by Suuraj Singh and Shraddha Agrawal under the Blive Productions and Take 23 Studios Production banner and is written by Sammeer Arora.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/and-they-collaborate/article36889515.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||On the magic bus||The blistering four-minute action sequence in the Muni bus in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings took a solid year of planning. “The pandemic took away three months; we shot in Sydney and San Francisco,” explains stunt coordinator Andy Cheng, over a video call from Budapest. For those who came in late, the said sequence happens in the beginning of the film when the thugs, including one who has a machete for a hand, attack Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who is travelling with his friend, Katy (Awkwafina) in a bus. “Shang-Chi pretends he does not know martial arts. He tries to tell the bad guys, ‘I think you have got the wrong guy.’ We, director Destin Daniel Cretton, and supervising stunt coordinator, Brad Allan, started from there. We thought we could take the fight outside the bus; on the roof to create a unique fight sequence.” Safety, Cheng says, was one of the biggest challenges of the scene. “We had two set ups — a meter high one for normal driving and another that was five meters high, which was like a roller-coaster. Keeping the actors who played the passengers,safe was paramount. Choreographing the fight where Shang-Chi goes from the driver’s seat to the back of the bus in a narrow space was demanding.” Cheng, who was part of Jackie Chan’s stunt team, says, “In the beginning of the scene, Shang-Chi saves a falling girl by grabbing her belt. It was a difficult stunt as Simu had to jump on a chair, run at a 45 degree angle while the bus was bouncing around. We did more than 20 takes, and sometimes, he would miss the belt and the girl would hit the window. One time, Simu missed the chair and hurt his shin. We had all safety measures in place but these things happen.” On whether CGI has helped or hindered action sequences, Cheng says, “ It helps control the environment — you know a car will not suddenly come into the frame. When Simu is running on the top of the bus and swinging in through a window, we were able to control the scene thanks to CGI.” The downside of CGI, according to Cheng is viewers are now smart and so the danger does not seem real. “However, in the balance, safety is more important.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-the-magic-bus/article36889518.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Creatively wild, structured in execution||Rakshit Shetty entered the Kannada film industry in 2010 with Aravind Kaushik’s Nam Areal Ondina. He drew fans with his acting and filmmaking skills. On screen, he transitioned from a gawky youngster to a seasoned performer who could smoothly toggle between action, comedy and drama. Soon, Rakshit was donning several hats including producer, director and writer. The actor goes back in time to analyse all he could do better even as he shares his future plans. Edited excerpts: How has your journey in the industry been thus far? It has been one of learning. Though films are a passion, I never thought I would become an actor. I always told myself that it would be a dream that may never come true. My passion for cinema took wing when I came to Bengaluru to work in the IT industry. I started working with short-film makers to make my portfolio look good. I found myself making short films on weekends simultaneously writing the story of Ulidavaru Khandante . Soon, cinema became my career and I believe I have learnt enough, from my success and mistakes, to continue working in this industry for a few more years. Does coming from an IT background influence the way you approach a project? Though my stint with the IT industry was short, I did realise that it had a structure to everything, which helped the work process be smoother and faster. This helped teams achieve their goals. When I joined films, that was one strategy I wanted to adopt. Since I also have people from the IT sector as a part of my team, everything fell in place or rather into the structure. You became popular with Kirik Party and Avane Sriman Narayana (AVN) . Yet, when people compliment you, you say there are many faults that could have been avoided. What are they? This was very clear in AVN . People get restless with a long film. That is not the case in an emotional film, where people connect with the story and sit through a three-hour movie. That is what AVN taught me. Another setback for AVN , I believe, was that I tried to write the story using a structure, which, perhaps, killed the creativity or the flow. AVN has been a beautiful learning experience for me. In 777 Charlie , you act with a pet. How easy or difficult was it to emote with a four-legged co-star? It was a Herculean task. We all loved Charlie, but she (yes, she is a girl) would take 30 to 40 takes for each shot. Because of this, I had to perform each take as if it were the final one. We were never sure when Charlie would get the emotions or the moves right. And, once she excelled in the shot, irrespective of whether I had done well or not, Kiran Raj (the director of the film) would shout ‘Çut!’ and refuse to go in for another take! We also took 150 days to shoot 777..., in which time, we could have shot two films! Why do you not go in for remakes? Being a writer myself, I believe I can use the resources and energy to tell a new story, rather than a remake. They are not fun to make. People who have watched the original film in the native language, will not watch it again in another. We need to make originals, come what may. Despite there being critically and commercially successful Kannada films, why do you think the industry is overshadowed by the Malayalam and Tamil industry? I think that is changing now. The Malayalam and Tamil film industry makes a certain kind of cinema. There is a major shift in filmmaking and in a few years, there will be just cinema and not a ‘Kannada film’ or a ‘Malayalam film’. The boundaries are breaking thanks to streaming platforms which bring cinema from across the globe into your home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/creatively-wild-structured-in-execution/article36889511.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||When they see us||You cannot go a whole day without hearing about Squid Game , the new Korean survival-horror fest that has people looking at children’s games in a whole new way. Directed and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the series on Netflix follows a number of people with heavy debts competing against each other in a series of seemingly innocent games for cash prize. But the rug gets pulled out from under them when they realise they are not just playing for money, but for their lives — losers get killed instantly in these games. Despite the bone-chilling displays of manipulation, peer pressure, and straight-up gaslighting seen throughout, the concept has enthralled millions around the world; people are recreating games such as Red Light, Green Light and the Dalgona cracking challenge. The cosplay world is already teeming with recreations of the pink overalls-suited soldiers, the Front Man with his geometric mask and, of course, the massive singing doll with swivelling eyes. Sameer Bundela, an award-winning cosplayer in Mumbai, is excited about the potential of Squid Game in this space. Often opting for sinister and complex characters, he appreciates the eye for detail. He particularly praises New York-based cosplayer M4stiff (pronounced ‘mastiff’) for her recreation of the singing doll; she donned a wig with the high-cut bangs and two ponytails, along with the orange tunic and yellow T-shirt teamed with knee-high socks and black shoes. But M4stiff took it to a sinister level with blackout contact lenses to mimic the soulless look of the doll that creeped everyone out. The giant robotic doll is featured in the first game of the series, as the host of Red Light, Green Light. The game is fairly common; you run towards a safe finish line while the host’s head is turned away. When they turn back towards the players, whoever is still moving is out. But in Squid Game context, ‘out’ means dead; and the doll’s eyes — which are actually cameras — swivel about to scan players’ body movements and the hidden rifles around the area shoot them if they move. Not just fun games US TikToker, TheBlondeJon, and his friends recreated the Red Light, Green Light game in an empty canal, complete with bright-coloured overalls, masks and paintball guns that were not fired but just aimed at the still-moving players. The video has got more than one lakh views across various platforms. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, Dhruv Viswanathan and his friends have summer plans to play the game. “I am reuniting with some old college friends, and we will play the game at our farm house next May. We plan to play the doll’s song on a loudspeaker and use water balloons filled with red water on those who still move, just to recreate the experience without hurting anyone. We have made a WhatsApp group just for that. We have already ordered overalls and masks from abroad which will take time to come,” he says. Would it even be a Squid Game cultural wave without the mention of ppopgi , aka honeycomb toffee or Dalgona? Jeon Minpyo, manager of Nowana, a family-run Korean restaurant in Auroville, recently started offering the Dalgona candy challenge to customers. In the series, the contestants are tasked with carefully cutting out a traced shape from a Dalgona candy disc — if contestants broke into the shape, they are killed. Of course, at Nowana, there are no such repercussions, says Minpyo with a laugh. “It took a lot of trial and error to get the consistency right, so we spent a whole day perfecting the ratios! If a customer succeeds, they get to take one home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-they-see-us/article36889571.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Heart of the matter||“Agathe Agathe Aithu!! (‘It will happen, it will happen, it’s happened!!’ in Kannada)” began a tweet from the official handle of German Women’s Cricket last August. Their captain had just accomplished a feat that no other woman in international cricket has: four wickets in four balls in a T20 International. The medium pacer finished that match against Austria with an astonishing bowling figure (three overs, two maidens, one run and five wickets). Whoever was tweeting from the German Women's Cricket team account wanted to pay Anuradha Doddaballapur a little tribute in her mother tongue. More accolades awaited Anuradha. She led the team to a commanding 5-0 series win that witnessed a slew of records: two hat-tricks, first T20I century, first T20I five-for, and an unbeaten opening partnership across all T20Is. The hitherto little-known German cardiovascular scientist was getting interview requests for an accomplishment in a game, which for her is a “serious hobby”. But cricket captured her interest before science. Getting into the game Anuradha grew up in Basavanagudi, a residential locality in South Bengaluru. Like many middle-class fathers of that time in Bengaluru, hers too was a keen follower of cricket. She recalls what she calls the “moment of reckoning” in her cricket career. “I was in Class VII at Bishop Cotton Girls’ school and a classmate who was playing for Karnataka then told me about an Under-16 trial. I dialled home from one of those one-rupee coin-operated phones and told them I’d be late,” she recalls, from Frankfurt, where she currently lives. A few weeks later, Anuradha made her debut for the Karnataka U-16 side. In the decade that followed, she played for the U-19 side, the senior State team and South Zone. Some of her teammates like Veda Krishnamurthy, Vanitha VR, Nooshin Al Khadeer, Karuna Jain and Mamatha Maben went on to play for India. She, too, could have had she chose to focus more on her “serious hobby” than her burgeoning interest in science. But the following for women's cricket in India was almost absent then. So, in 2008, she moved to the UK for a Masters in Medical Genetics at Newcastle University. Three years later, she was in Frankfurt for a PhD in Cardiovascular Biology at the Goethe University. She is now a postdoctoral research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research. What if women's cricket in India had the following it has now? Would she have chosen cricket over science? Anuradha pauses a bit before saying, “I think I would have still gone to the UK. But I might have taken a little longer to decide.” Making a mark away Though she chose science over cricket for her profession, she never let go of the game. In her three-year stay in England, she played for the Newcastle University, South North Cricket Club and Northumberland women’s county side Things were different in Germany, where cricket was not so popular. So, Anuradha took up coaching, and in 2015, put together a women’s team. Six years later, the team won the top-division tournament, German Women’s Bundesliga. She has been a part of the German side since 2013. She has played 18 T20Is, including the one that prompted the team's Twitter handle to tweet in Kannada. She laughs when asked about it. But beyond the amusement of seeing a Kannada phrase in a German team's handle are multiculturalism and camaraderie. “All the players feel extremely proud to wear the German jersey. But some of us have roots in different parts of the world: Kenya, Australia, the US and India.” There are two other Bengalureans, Karthika Vijayaraghavan and Sharanya Sadarangani, in the team. “So, sometimes, apart from English and German, we throw around these phrases [in our native languages]. And, ‘agathe’ is one of them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/heart-of-the-matter/article36889567.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I do not wish to limit myself’||In early September, as Yohani Diloka De Silva’s cover of ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ went viral in India, the Sri Lankan musician expressed a desire to tour India and interact with not just Indian fans but artistes too. Cut to October, Yohani just wrapped up a performance in Heart Cup Coffee, Hyderabad, as part of her two-city India tour with Zee Live’s newly-launched sub-IP ‘Supermoon #NowTrending’. The 28-year-old sports a small bruise under her right eye, which she explains with a chuckle: it is an occupational hazard, received from the stem end of a guitar during a set the night before. “I slept in today thankfully, to help it heal!” she laughs, during a sit-down interview withMetroPlusat Le Meridien, Hyderabad. And what of pre-set rituals? Yohani keeps it simple, “I just train my voice beforehand.” But when she gets on stage, it is the ambience that gets her in the zone: “The lights, band, audience, space, the stage itself — the whole package flips a switch.” Originally performed by Satheeshan Rathnayaka, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ is a Sinhala ballad sung by a man to a woman, to express his admiration of her character and beauty. But more than the sweet lyrics, Yohani’s soprano tones and gazes into the camera give it a simple teen-pop vibe that enraptured millions. The cover also features Satheeshan rapping and — at the time of writing this — the video has crossed 141 million views. She has received shout-outs from Amitabh Bachchan and Sri Lankan cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya. Since then, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ has been used on TikTok and Instagram Reels; the hashtag #ManikeMageHithe on Instagram has more than 70,000 posts. Such videos make Yohani happy but she does not take the responsibility that comes with a viral track lightly. “This is the first time a Sri Lankan song has been viral to this extent, and I want everyone to be proud of its success so far. A lot of people didn’t even know that the Sinhala language existed, so it makes me happy that the language has gone quite far,” she says, adding it has been overwhelming to be a sort of ambassador for the country, the language and the music. Funnily enough, Yohani’s tour does not feature Chennai, Bengaluru or Kerala cities even though she and her team put together Tamil and Malayalam versions of her ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ cover. “My producer is Tamil actually,” she explains, “and he taught me how to pronounce certain things.” The tour is proving hectic and to recentre herself, she tunes into two acoustic albums by British electronic group Above and Beyond. “My first cover on YouTube was ‘Satellite’ by Above and Beyond; they’ve been a very big part of my music life,” she states. “I listen to a lot of languages and I always explore other genres. I don’t want to limit myself.” More ambitions The musician talks about her debut album Kella , of which the first track ‘Ithin Adare’ will release on Saturday. The 12-track album is her narration of what it means to be a young modern woman in Sri Lanka in terms of friendships, relationships, independence and the mundane ( kella means girl or woman in Sinhalese). Bollywood has also kept Yohani busy; she just finished recording the female rendition of the title track for Kunal Deshmukh’s Shiddat, currently streaming on Hotstar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-do-not-wish-to-limit-myself/article36889591.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Grab your binoculars||Our seasonal guests have landed, in millions, after marathon flights across continents. Birds from 29 countries fly to India every year at this time, an annual ritual signifying the beginning of migration. The stint, a bird that weighs just about 20 grams, makes an astonishing journey covering 8,000 kilometres from Siberia to Tamil Nadu’s Point Calimere. Forested areas of the Indian peninsula are aflutter with warblers, a wispy olive green bird, that fly thousands of kilometres from the mountains of Central Asia. The bar-tailed godwits, after spending their summers in Russia, will soon embark on a long non-stop flight to spend the winters at shallow water bodies in Pulicat and Sholinganallur. In Chennai, wader birds are among the first ones to arrive, and can be spotted around Pallikaranai, Sholinganallur marsh, Kelambakkam, and Pulicat. “Wood sandpipers are the most common, followed by common sandpipers, that can be identified by the clear C shaped marking in white, near their wings. These birds wade through shallow waters, and have arrived in hundreds, like every year,” says Aravind AM, a birder in Chennai. As daylight shrinks and food supply dwindles at the breeding sites in the Northern hemisphere, birds start migrating towards wintering sites in the South. “It’s a natural process of survival. They take nine flyways across the world and some unusual routes during this flight,” says S Sivakumar, scientist at Bombay Natural History Society. He adds, “The Central Asian Flyway covers 30 countries including India. The black-headed, brown-headed and slender-billed gulls have arrived, mostly from Europe and Central Asia.” Our special guests can easily be spotted perched on trees or at a wooded area, says Ashvin Viswanathan of Bird Count India, Bengaluru. Bird Count India supports listing and monitoring of birds across India. “Grey wagtails have arrived. I saw a blue-tailed bee eater (that breeds in North and central India) calling and migrating while heading South. Most birds migrate in the night. When you go to a forest patch or a garden in the morning near your home, you will see a new bird every day as it rests there after flying all night.” During winter, we see flocks of swallows either perched on electric wires or making rapid circular flights, not just over water bodies, but even over busy traffic roads. “Not many realise that these are migratory birds which have come from as far as Europe and Central Asia,” says Aravind. Small dull brown birds called warblers and species like Blyth's reed warblers and booted warblers can be seen around bushes or trees even in busy neighbourhoods. Many birders have observed unusual sightings. For example, Amur falcons made a stopover in Pune in huge numbers in January, and the red-necked phalarope, a pelagic bird showed up at Uppar Dam in Dharapuram, a non-coastal area during the last week of September. Birds have a few favourite places, says Ramakrishnan Aiyaswamy, a widllife photographer in Bengaluru. “They choose their place based on the availability of food and how long they can stay there. They also have a plan B, and choose another water body in the nearby area if their original habitat is disturbed.” As long as the birds keep up the date with migration, birders are happy as it indicates a healthy environment and a safe habitat. “We are waiting to meet the brown shrike that comes from the Mongolian region. Every year, we see two birds at our school campus in Valparai. It arrives by the first week of October. We see more than 30 migrant species here,” says K Selvaganesh, a birder and teacher at Valparai. During this time, some birds called passage migrants, like the European roller, rufous-tailed scrub robin, and common white throat, migrate through Rajasthan, Gujarat and other parts of the Indian Peninsula to cross the Arabian Sea. They move to Africa by mid-October to spend the winters there. “Birders in Delhi can now see the greenish warbler (from Europe), Blythe’s reed warbler (from Europe and Russia) and rusty-tailed flycatcher (from Kashmir and Himachal) passing through as the birds are heading southwards,” adds Ashvin. Though birds have been carrying on these long trips for millions of years, Aravind says one can spot small changes, through eBird database and through sites like Migrant watch. “Siberian cranes, which are critically endangered, used to visit Bharatpur Sanctuary about 20 years ago, but we don’t see them now because that population which visited India seems to have gone extinct.” Charting new courses Agrees Ashvin, who has put together animation maps on migration based on data uploaded on citizen science platform eBird. “There is suspicion on how birds might be reacting to shifts in climate. Bird species like yellow-browed warbler and Richard’s pipit migrated to Northeast India, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Now, they are landing in western Europe in a new migratory route. There is a documented change in pattern.” Researches track birds using satellite tags and that reveals knowledge on individual birds and their migration routes. “We ringed a northern shoveller at Manjeera Wildlife Sanctuary in Telangana, and tracked its flight all the way to Russia,” says Sivakumar and adds, “Migration is a long, exhausting journey.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A spiral wheel to introspect||Patterns, contradictions and a warped visual sense characterise Gallery Veda’s quiet space. One walks in to see artist Kumaresan Selvaraj’s geometrical sculpture sprawled on the floor. The name explains its purpose: Representing Altitudes Through Depth. The artwork is set against the backdrop of a circular canvas that draws one in through complementary patterns in concentric circles akin to a pinwheel: from Saravanan Parasuraman’s series, Efflorescence. Similar But Not The Same is a diary of contrasts, by artists who are part of Kinetics Artists’ Group, a collective of alumni from the Government College of Arts, Egmore. As the title suggests, the exhibition emphasises the importance of individuality — even when concepts seem similar, each has its own latent quality. And so, works scream similar traits, though each artist’s style is different. “We are from different batches. In 2007 we decided to show together and since then we have been showing regularly. It started with five members, and we are now at nine members,” says Kumaresan. “Every individual shows a specific quality. But together, people share certain common traits — in terms of strength, social structure or education for instance. Even in their differences, people are similar,” explains Gurunathan Govindan, a participating artist whose six abstract canvases are a collage of colours and textures. To mix pigments, Gurunathan uses cloth instead of a palette that lets him explore the endless possibilities of each colour. Each of his canvases tells the story of an everyday instance. The space, divided in multiple rooms and sections, is an amalgam of dizzying canvases and geometric installations. Aneesh Kalode Rajan’s work titled Traces follows a trail of birds, by capturing their different journeys and dimensions. The artist has a series of photorealistic paintings (acrylic on board) that sport impressive, minute details: from shadows that line cracked, rocky terrain to the lines that run across faces bogged down by fatigue. Yuvaraj Velu’s introspective works play with wood: be it Integrated Thoughts, a maze of small wooden blocks in brown, black and white, or Mind, another pinwheel that houses wooden patterns in concentric circles. Gurunathan explains further, “If you look at Saravanan’s recent works, an endlessness and the sense of motion can be seen. Yuvan [Bothysathuvar] on the other hand plays a lot with paper strips, ribbons and posters to create illusions.” Dilip Kumar Kesavan’s canvases are an abstract celebration of colours, rather bright. And Sunil Sree’s Resources is a collection that explores negative spaces through black and white. While one is an installation, which protrudes out of the wall, the other shows strokes and amorphous shapes in black over white canvases. Whereas Suresh Kumar P follows linear strips of colours to create works by placing paper on wood. With the show, the group has also launched Kinetics Arts Foundation, a platform that will help budding, young artists to find their footing through residencies and workshops in educational institutions. “What connected all of us was art. The work speaks for the artist. And so, we don't believe in the distinction between seniors and juniors. We wish to take this mentality foward,” concludes Gurunathan.  Similar But Not The Same will be on display till October 15 at Gallery Veda, Nungambakkam||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-spiral-wheel-to-introspect/article36889576.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Sweet surrender||If you are the kind that believes desserts should be bumped up to take the place of the appetiser, you would probably find the time spent waiting for it at the end of a meal tortuous. Something similar happened on the way to sample Delish, Double Roti’s new dessert studio. I am caught in an endless swirl of traffic, and if this was dinner somewhere, would have arrived just in time for dessert — but Nikesh Lamba, executive director of Pricol Gourmet that runs Delish, navigates my evening through an exciting array of small eats from the burger bar and cafe’s revamped menu. Now set in a green-tiled, white-walled space filled with the happy light of an English kitchen, Delish occupies one side of the restaurant, with its menu spelt out on its walls. “Delish is where the science and art of baking come together to create some fine sweet and savoury bakes. Our focus was to offer Anna Nagar a breakfast place, a cafe and a dessert studio rolled into one,” says Lamba. Delish is filled, with the young Instagramming every cheese burger, thick as an ottoman, spilling with juicy tenderloin, cheese and lettuce; the middle-aged delicately popping wild mushroom filo pockets; and industrious staff buzzing about. The seemingly ubiquitous chicken pop-corn is a surprise. Terribly ordinary in most places with the taste of oil lingering for hours, here, it has been created with a furrowed brow attention to detail — the spice and crunch are just right, especially when dunked in the in-house sauce. The classic pepperoni pizza with its fresh buffalo mozzarella sparks smiles all around but I tear up — the sauce is a little too spicy. Which makes it just the right time to usher in the new kids on the block — Classic Opera, Snicker’d and Filter Kaapi tarts. I dive in, all the while rethinking the size of the waistband of my pants. Classic Opera has layers of almond joconde sponge, coffee buttercream and chocolate ganache; Snicker’d is filled with caramel and paired with a heavenly peanut custard; and Filter Kaapi has a luscious coffee caramel, a delicate namelaka and the taste of home. Delish is helmed by Kasthuri Subramanian and Upamanyu, formerly chef instructors at Lavonne Academy, Bengaluru. They have given up the endless parade of panna-cottas and mild cream sponges to make desserts taste like what they are — an indulgence.  Delish is at Double Roti, JB Khanna Jag Tirth, A2, 2nd Avenue, A Block, Anna Nagar East.9840591845||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sweet-surrender/article36889581.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||like a girl||Any young woman in India would want to stand in Lady Cadet Bijli Bijarnia’s shoes — they are a cool and successful pair. They often see more adventure than a pair in civvy street ever will — running through unmetalled roads with a battle-load and dashing between classrooms dodging the odd scorpion. They also just marched up to receive the coveted Sword of Honour given to the cadet who achieves overall best performance at the Officers Training Academy, Chennai. Bijli’s story has been lived and relived at the Academy since 1992, the year women were inducted into the officer cadre, walking through its Ram Singh Dwar as novices and leaving a year later as commissioned officers. Tanushree Podder’s latest book, The Girls in Green , (published by Bloomsbury), soon to be a web series, explores the journey of women like Bijli and the triumphs and heartbreaks they encounter during their tenure at the Academy. “Ever since I wrote my two books set in the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, I have been asked why I hadn’t written one on the OTA, the only Academy in the country that commissions women to be officers. When I saw Captain Tania Shergill lead an all-male contingent at the Army Day Parade 2020, I knew it was time to write the book,” says Podder over a phone call from Pune. “Only those who are intent on pursuing a career in the armed forces know what a lady cadet’s life looks like. I wanted to introduce that world to a larger audience through fiction.”  While Bijli is a star footballer from the Haryana hinterland and Lakmenlang Zyiem a lawyer, Shiny Joseph, an engineer from Kottayam joins OTA to stay close to her childhood sweetheart Aaron, often finding herself pitted against him. Nutan Patil, a starry-eyed small-town girl, brings up the rear. In the sapping humidity of Chennai, the four join other lady cadets of their course to write their own saga of extraordinary energy and unflagging resilience in the months it takes to earn a Lieutenant’s stars. There are moments so exhausting that some cry in the first few weeks of PT, squad punishments from the platoon commanders, front-rolls and pull-ups, pondering whether to quit. They tear up again when they leave, knowing that the moments forged in the fire of their training has made them part of a very rare sisterhood. It is these moments sprinkled with a generous measure of laugh-aloud humour that Podder captures well. Bringing the Academy alive to the reader is another aspect that Podder navigates well — right from the picture of the white, red-roofed Rezang La building that houses the headquarters on the book cover to the buzz in the cafeteria, the stifling quiet when a film is screened, the scrub-lined trenches, the snake pits, war rooms and the layout of Phoenix MarketCity where cadets spend their ‘liberty’ (out-passes are issued on Sundays). To tell the story of these women on the cusp of a brave new world, Podder visited OTA twice. “A lady officer from the Ordnance Corps took me around the Academy. I met instructors, watched cadets from different corners of India interact at the cafe. It gave me a sense of the place.” The girls buff their boots, crawl through rain sodden trenches and spend days doing drill without end like their male counterparts. They even sport close cropped hair and on the day of their Passing Out Parade are limber and spare, in a ceremony that is nothing short of captivating. In between, they have their share of mad adventures. Is the happy ending intentional? “The joy is intentional. We live in a dark world, shrouded by the pandemic,” says Podder. “The will to survive is what I wanted to focus on, the path to wearing the stars on your epaulette is not for quitters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/like-a-girl/article36889584.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A feel-good take on life||“It was a special moment,” says director SPP Bhaskaran about receiving praise from his mentors, director Bharathiraja and K Bhagyaraj, for his first feature film, Insha Allah . He arranged a private screening for the veteran filmmakers in Chennai recently. “They had positive things to say about the film, location, cinematography which was done by T S Prasanna of Blue Ocean Film and Television Academy and recording of live sounds. But what took them by complete surprise is the performances of poet Vikramathithan and his wife Bhagavathi Ammal who play an old couple in the film. Vikramathithan has played character roles in director Bala’s award-winning films like Naan Kadavul .” After doing the festival circuit (it made to the official selection at 32 film festivals and won nine awards at international film festivals), the film gears up for a theatrical release in Tamil Nadu, on October 15. Bhaskaran shot the film at Pillyarpuram village in Coimbatore where hundreds of families from different religious communities live in perfect harmony. The 84-minute film narrates the story of a middle-class Muslim society and is partly inspired by short stories by Thoppil Mohammed Meeran and Firdous Rajakumaran. He chose death as a central theme and the script touches upon the five tenets of Islam that includes daily prayers, alms giving ( zakat ), fasting during Ramadan, pilgrimage to Mecca (Haj) and the profession of faith. The protagonist is an ambulance driver played by Mogly K Mohan (who has been part of films like Kirumi , Bakrid and Master ). Abdul Salam from Thanjavur who is related to Kamala amma, wife of late actor Sivaji Ganesan plays an important role in the film. “He converted to Islam many years ago and Sivaji Ganesan’s family stood by his decision and supported him. He plays the role of an elderly man who saves money to do Haj but gives it away to support a needy girl’s marriage.” The film also has footage that shows the Cheraman Juma Masjid, believed to be the first mosque in the country, located at Kodungalloor in Kerala and the 800-year-old mosque at Keeranur, near Palani.  Insha Allah is produced by Shahul Hameed, under his banner Nesam Entertainment Private Limited. “To learn more about the community, I shifted my residence to Karumbukadai, a Muslim-dominated locality in Coimbatore, and lived there for six months,” says Bhaskaran, whose first short film Naanudaimai won recognition at online short film festivals. Insha Allah , he says, sheds light on the philosophy behind the Islamic way of life. The film is dedicated to the late Jabaramma,who ran a mess at Pillyarpuram. “She served us all three meals during our 30-day shoot there. I wrote a character based on her during my stay there and nudged her to play the role. Though shy to face the camera, she learned acting at a workshop done by late Arunmozhi and his team during our shoot and performed confidently. Her role in the film showcases how looks become banal in a relationship bound by love.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-feel-good-take-on-life/article36889595.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I do not wish to limit myself’||In early September, as Yohani Diloka De Silva’s cover of ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ went viral in India, the Sri Lankan musician expressed a desire to tour India and interact with not just Indian fans but artistes too. Cut to October, Yohani just wrapped up a performance in Heart Cup Coffee, Hyderabad, as part of her two-city India tour with Zee Live’s newly-launched sub-IP ‘Supermoon #NowTrending’. The 28-year-old sports a small bruise under her right eye, which she explains with a chuckle: it is an occupational hazard, received from the stem end of a guitar during a set the night before. “I slept in today thankfully, to help it heal!” she laughs, during an interview withMetroPlusat Le Meridien, Hyderabad. And what of pre-set rituals? Yohani keeps it simple, “I just train my voice beforehand.” But when she gets on stage, it is the ambience that gets her in the zone: “The lights, band, audience, space, the stage itself — the whole package flips a switch.” Originally performed by Satheeshan Rathnayaka, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ is a Sinhala ballad sung by a man to a woman, to express his admiration of her character and beauty. But more than the sweet lyrics, Yohani’s soprano tones and gazes into the camera give it a simple teen-pop vibe that enraptured millions. The cover also features Satheeshan rapping and — at the time of writing this — the video has crossed 141 million views. She has received shout-outs from Amitabh Bachchan and Sri Lankan cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya. Since then, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ has been used on TikTok and Instagram Reels; the hashtag #ManikeMageHithe on Instagram has more than 70,000 posts. Such videos make Yohani happy but she does not take the responsibility that comes with a viral track lightly. “This is the first time a Sri Lankan song has been viral to this extent, and I want everyone to be proud of its success so far. A lot of people didn’t even know that the Sinhala language existed, so it makes me happy that the language has gone quite far,” she says, adding it has been overwhelming to be a sort of ambassador for the country, the language and the music. Funnily enough, Yohani’s tour does not feature Chennai, Bengaluru or Kerala cities even though she and her team put together Tamil and Malayalam versions of her ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ cover. “My producer is Tamil actually,” she explains, “and he taught me how to pronounce certain things.” The tour is proving hectic and to recentre herself, she tunes into two acoustic albums by British electronic group Above and Beyond. “My first cover on YouTube was ‘Satellite’ by Above and Beyond; they’ve been a very big part of my music life,” she states. “I listen to a lot of languages and I always explore other genres. I don’t want to limit myself.” More ambitions The musician talks about her debut album Kella , of which the first track ‘Ithin Adare’ will release on Saturday. The 12-track album is her narration of what it means to be a young modern woman in Sri Lanka in terms of friendships, relationships, independence and the mundane ( kella means girl or woman in Sinhalese). Bollywood has also kept Yohani busy; she just finished recording the female rendition of the title track for Kunal Deshmukh’s Shiddat, currently streaming on Hotstar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-do-not-wish-to-limit-myself/article36889612.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||How’s that!||“ Agathe Agathe Aithu !! (‘It will happen, it will happen, it hashappened!!’ in Kannada)” began a tweet from the official handle of German Women’s Cricket last August. Their captain had just accomplished a feat that no other woman in international cricket has: four wickets in four balls in a T20 International. As the lower-ranked Austria floundered at 40/3 in 14 overs, chasing 198 at the Seebarn Cricket Centre, she wrecked them further in the next over with a four-wicket maiden. In the 18th over, the medium-pacer picked up one more to finish with an astonishing bowling figure (three overs, two maidens, one run, and five wickets). Whoever was tweeting from the German Women's Cricket team account wanted to pay Anuradha Doddaballapur a little tribute in her mother tongue. More accolades awaited Anuradha. She led the team to a commanding 5-0 series win that witnessed a slew of records: two hat-tricks, first T20I century, first T20I five-for, and an unbeaten opening partnership across all T20Is. Another 5-0 win over France this year extended the team’s T20I winning streak to 14. The hitherto little-known German cardiovascular scientist was getting interview requests for an accomplishment in a game, which for her is a “serious hobby”. But cricket captured her interest before science.  Getting into the game   Anuradha grew up in Basavanagudi, a residential locality in South Bengaluru. Like many middle-class fathers of that time in Bengaluru, hers too was a keen follower of cricket. A youngster from her city named Rahul Dravid was already making his presence felt in international cricket. Anuradha was more drawn to a cricketer from another country. The fearsome fast bowler from South Africa: Allan Donald. On a Sunday morning from Frankfurt, where she lives now, she reminisces about her childhood during the ‘90s over the phone. Dosas from Vidyarthi Bhavan and CTR. Traffic-free roads. Despite her fondness for Donald, Anuradha bowled leg-spin in her initial days. She also recalls what she calls the “moment of reckoning” in her cricket career. “I was in Class VII at Bishop Cotton Girls’ school and a classmate who was playing for Karnataka then told me about an Under-16 trial. I dialled home from one of those one-rupee coin-operated phones and told them I would be late.” A few weeks later, Anuradha made her debut for the Karnataka U-16 side. Some of her teammates like Veda Krishnamurthy, Vanitha VR, Nooshin Al Khadeer, Karuna Jain and Mamatha Maben went on to play for India. She, too, could have had she chose to focus more on her “serious hobby” than her burgeoning interest in science. The following for women’s cricket in India was almost absent then. It was not a great career choice. So, in 2008, she moved to the UK for a Masters in Medical Genetics at Newcastle University. Three years later, she was in Frankfurt for a PhD in Cardiovascular Biology at the Goethe University. She is now a postdoctoral research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research. What if women’s cricket in India had the following it has now? Would she have chosen cricket over science? Anuradha pauses before saying, “I think I would have still gone to the UK.”  Making a mark away   Though she chose science over cricket for her profession, she never let go of the game. It had become a part of her life. In her three-year stay in England, she played for Newcastle University, South North Cricket Club and Northumberland women’s county side. At least England was a cricketing nation and it was not too difficult to find women who played cricket. Frankfurt, where she moved to in 2011, was another story. It did not have a women’s team. So she did what she did as a young girl in Basavanagudi; play with the boys. It was awkward for the men who played against the Frankfurt Cricket Club (FCC). “They were surprised to see a woman bowling to them. And, I do not think they were very pleased when they got out,” she adds, laughing. Despite getting the better of the guys, Anuradha had an idea to start a women’s team for FCC in 2015. There was a problem — there were hardly any players to pick. Right, so there is not a team to pick; so, let us build one, thought Anuradha. She took up coaching, did a certified course and started teaching the basics to novices. Eight months into 2015, she put together a women's team. Six years later, she won the top-division tournament, German Women’s Bundesliga with them for the first time. She came. She saw. She found no team; so created one. And, she conquered. She has been a part of the German side since 2013. She has played 18 T20Is, including the one that prompted the team’s Twitter handle to tweet in Kannada. Germany was ranked outside the top-40 in the ICC T20I rankings when T20I status was granted in 2018 to all international games. They are 24th now. Anuradha would have liked to lead them to a World Cup participation. It would take several years of progress for Germany to get there. Anuradha, 34, might not be playing then, but would like to see the next generation of players getting there. The requirement of resilience. That is what, according to Anuradha, ties cricket and science together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/hows-that/article36889610.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||When they see us||You cannot go a whole day without hearing about Squid Game , the new Korean survival-horror fest that has people looking at children’s games in a whole new way. Directed and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the series on Netflix follows a number of people with heavy debts competing against each other in a series of seemingly innocent games for cash prize. But the rug gets pulled out from under them when they realise they are not just playing for money, but for their lives — losers get killed instantly in these games. Despite the bone-chilling displays of manipulation, peer pressure, and straight-up gaslighting seen throughout, the concept has enthralled millions around the world; people are recreating games such as Red Light, Green Light and the Dalgona cracking challenge. The cosplay world is already teeming with recreations of the pink overalls-suited soldiers, the Front Man with his geometric mask and, of course, the massive singing doll with swivelling eyes. Sameer Bundela, an award-winning cosplayer in Mumbai, is excited about the potential of Squid Game in this space. Often opting for sinister and complex characters, he appreciates the eye for detail. He particularly praises New York-based cosplayer M4stiff (pronounced ‘mastiff’) for her recreation of the singing doll; she donned a wig with the high-cut bangs and two ponytails, along with the orange tunic and yellow T-shirt teamed with knee-high socks and black shoes. But M4stiff took it to a sinister level with blackout contact lenses to mimic the soulless look of the doll that creeped everyone out. The giant robotic doll is featured in the first game of the series, as the host of Red Light, Green Light. The game is fairly common; you run towards a safe finish line while the host’s head is turned away. When they turn back towards the players, whoever is still moving is out. But in Squid Game context, ‘out’ means dead; and the doll’s eyes — which are actually cameras — swivel about to scan players’ body movements and the hidden rifles around the area shoot them if they move. Not just fun games US TikToker, TheBlondeJon, and his friends recreated the Red Light, Green Light game in an empty canal, complete with bright-coloured overalls, masks and paintball guns that were not fired but just aimed at the still-moving players. The video has got more than one lakh views across various platforms. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, Dhruv Viswanathan and his friends have summer plans to play the game. “I am reuniting with some old college friends, and we will play the game at our farm house next May. We plan to play the doll’s song on a loudspeaker and use water balloons filled with red water on those who still move, just to recreate the experience without hurting anyone. We have made a WhatsApp group just for that. We have already ordered overalls and masks from abroad which will take time to come,” he says. Would it even be a Squid Game cultural wave without the mention of ppopgi , aka honeycomb toffee or Dalgona? Jeon Minpyo, manager of Nowana, a family-run Korean restaurant in Auroville, recently started offering the Dalgona candy challenge to customers. In the series, the contestants are tasked with carefully cutting out a traced shape from a Dalgona candy disc — if contestants broke into the shape, they are killed. Of course, at Nowana, there are no such repercussions, says Minpyo with a laugh. “It took a lot of trial and error to get the consistency right, so we spent a whole day perfecting the ratios! If a customer succeeds, they get to take one home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-they-see-us/article36889598.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Grab your||Our seasonal guests have landed, in millions, after marathon flights across continents. Birds from 29 countries fly to India every year at this time, an annual ritual signifying the beginning of migration. The stint, a bird that weighs just about 20 grams, makes an astonishing journey covering 8,000 kms from Siberia to Tamil Nadu’s Point Calimere. Forested areas of the Indian Peninsula are aflutter with warblers, a wispy olive green bird, that fly thousands of kilometres from the mountains of Central Asia. The bar-tailed godwits, after spending their summers in Russia, will soon embark on a long non-stop flight to spend the winters at shallow water bodies in Pulicat and Sholinganallur. As daylight shrinks and food supply dwindles at the breeding sites in the northern hemisphere, birds start migrating towards wintering sites in the South. “It’s a natural process of survival. They take nine flyways across the world and some unusual routes during this flight,” says S Sivakumar, scientist at Bombay Natural History Society. He adds, “The Central Asian Flyway covers 30 countries including India. The black-headed, brown-headed and slender-billed gulls have arrived, mostly from Europe and Central Asia.”  Our special guests can easily be spotted perched on trees or at a wooded area, says Ashvin Viswanathan of Bird Count India, Bengaluru. Bird Count India supports listing and monitoring of birds across India. “Grey wagtails have arrived. I saw a blue-tailed bee eater (that breeds in North and central India) calling and migrating while heading South. Most birds migrate in the night. When you go to a forest patch or a garden in the morning near your home, you will see a new bird every day as it rests there after flying all night,” he adds. Many birders have observed unusual sightings. For example, Amur falcons made a stopover in Pune in huge numbers in January, and the red-necked phalarope, a pelagic bird showed up at Uppar Dam in Dharapuram, a non-coastal area during the last week of September. Birds have a few favourite places, says Ramakrishnan Aiyaswamy, a wildlife photographer in Bengaluru. “They choose their place based on the availability of food and how long they can stay there. They also have a plan B, and choose another water body in the nearby area if their original habitat is disturbed.” As long as the birds keep up the date with migration, birders are happy as it indicates healthy environment and a safe habitat. “We are waiting to meet the brown shrike that comes from Mongolian region. Every year, we see two birds at our school campus in Valparai. It arrives by first week of October. We see more than 30 migrant species here during the migration season,” says K Selvaganesh, a birder and teacher at Valparai near Coimbatore. During this time, some birds called passage migrants, like the European roller, rufous-tailed scrub robin, and common white throat, migrate through Rajasthan, Gujarat and other parts of the Indian Peninsula to cross the Arabian Sea. They move to Africa by mid-October to spend the winters there. “This time of the year is fascinating for bird watchers as a number of incredibly beautiful birds pass through the Indian subcontinent on their way to somewhere else. Birders in Delhi can now see the greenish warbler (from Europe), Blythe’s reed warbler (from Europe and Russia) and rusty-tailed flycatcher (from Kashmir and Himachal) passing through as the birds are heading southwards,” adds Ashvin. The common stonechat, a chunky little bird from Siberia and Turkey, has arrived in Delhi, says Col Pankaj Sharma (Retd), who runs Indian Birds on Facebook, the largest online community on birds in the Indian subcontinent that has 2.7 lakh members. “The bar-headed geese, northern shovellers, and pigtails from the ducks family will be arriving early as the wetlands are already full because of rains in September. I am waiting for the endangered steppe eagle to land from Europe. These birds can be sighted at Aravalli Range of Gurgaon, and in areas around Jhajjar district in Haryana.” Though birds have been carrying on these long trips for millions of years, Aravind says one can spot small changes in trends through eBird database and through sites like Migrant Watch. “Siberian Cranes, which are critically endangered, used to visit Bharatpur Sanctuary about 20 years ago, but we don’t see them now because that population which visited India seems to have gone extinct.” Charting new courses Agrees Ashvin, who has put together animation maps on migration based on data uploaded on citizen science platform eBird. “There is suspicion on how birds might be reacting to shifts in climate. Bird species like yellow-browed warbler and Richard’s pipit migrated to Northeast India, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Now, they are landing in western Europe in a new migratory route. There is a documented change in pattern.” Researches track birds using satellite tags and that reveals knowledge on individual birds and their migration routes. “We ringed northern shoveller at Manjeera Wildlife Sanctuary in Telangana, and tracked its flight all the way to Russia,” says Sivakumar and adds, “Migration is a long, exhausting journey. Global warming is real. Rains are inconsistent. Wetlands are drying up. At the world level, some changes have been noticed among the breeding ranges of birds already. We have to conserve our wetlands to ensure that food is available for the visitors. They can gain weight and fly back to their breeding ground on time and bring a healthy offspring.”     Chennai watchlist Terns and gulls can be seen at Pulicat lake.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Straight from the heart||Sivakarthikeyan is not weighed down by the load of the brand he has built over a period of nine years as an entertainer. It is another thing that he doesn’t see it as a ‘burden’, even if it is a staple of mindless entertainers with which he is often associated, despite notable exceptions. He gives a rather practical and measured response to the question of being stuck to the Sivakarthikeyan template. “If I am able to produce Doctor in a budget that was required, and also be part of films such as Hero , it is only because of the success and money those entertainers have made. Before Hero , I don’t think I would have made such an attempt but after its release, I decided to make sure those attempts don’t go in vain,” says Sivakarthikeyan over a steamy cup of hot chocolate, when we meet at a cafe in the city. Siva 2.0, if we were to call him that, is walking a tightrope to balance between regular entertainers and films that make a fresh attempt at storytelling or treatment. One such attempt was Hero (2019), which, Siva says, was his “lowest” in terms of box-office figures. During lockdowns, Siva took some time off to access his choices and look at his films with an objective lens. With respect to Hero , Siva feels it became an info-tainment missing out on the entertainment value, even though critics gave it a thumbs-up. A caped-crusader fighting for a cause, his character’s elevation point was delayed; it should have arrived at the interval point, he says. “It [ Hero ] was a lesson in how to present a subject for the audience in an entertaining way. Let us take Gentleman , which also dealt with a similar idea. But where both films differ is in the entertainment quotient.” Out of the comfort zone  Doctor , too, is a fresh attempt at presenting Siva in a new light. This time, however, he is working with someone all-too familiar: director Nelson Dilipkumar, a long-time friend with whom he has worked in television, and assisted in Simbu-starrer Vettai Mannan , a gangster film with dark humour which was eventually shelved. Nelson became a talent to watch out for, in Tamil cinema, post his directorial debut, Kolamaavu Kokila , which was a box-office hit. But Siva was not too surprised about the reception for Kolamaavu… , having known Nelson and his comedic sensibilities. What did surprise Siva, however, when he was handed over the script of Doctor was Nelson’s “meticulous” work. “I felt the script was a little quirky,” he says, “He [Nelson] is taking me out of my comfort zone, but also retaining certain elements for the hero image. None of which was demanded by me or Anirudh [composer].” Life seems to have come full circle for Siva on the professional front, having produced Doctor for Nelson and starred in it. By his own admission, Doctor ventures into dark zone and has Siva playing a character employed in the business of organ and human trafficking — at least going by the impression of its trailer. He offhandedly mentions the film being his first with a U/A certificate. Siva is tight-lipped about whether he plays an anti-hero, but admits that he would never essay an all-too negative character. “More than a question of whether it would suit my image, it is a question of whether I would be comfortable doing it. I don’t think I am comfortable getting into the mind of such characters,” he says. Aiming for the stars Sivakarthikeyan has produced Doctor on a first-copy basis for KJR Studios, which is distributing the film in Tamil and Telugu. There were whispers that the makers were exploring the possibility of a digital release, skipping theatre, at the height of the second wave. However, Siva says he was insistent on a theatrical release. Would the film have worked on OTT anyway? “It would have,” he continues, “But when you are laughing for a comedy, you laugh with 100 others inside a theatre. That would have been a miss.” Every year, on February 3, Sivakarthikeyan gets nostalgic and overwhelmed at the same time, looking at his career from afar. It was the date Marina (2012), his first on-screen appearance, released, and next year, Siva will complete 10 years in the industry. “Although two years vanished like naduvula konjam pakkatha kannom ,” he laughs. Watching himself on the screen for the first time is among his most memorable moments; each time he thinks about it, he pauses to introspect what he has done so far. “It has been a roller-coaster ride to be honest,” he says, “Although I will be completing 10 years, it feels like I have only started my innings — internally and mentally.” There was a point, Siva says, he took his critics too seriously, something he realised only recently. He does, however, make it a point to read everything written about him but — “I have made sure I don’t bluntly follow what they say, unless it is extremely constructive.” Doctor releases today   in theatres.   InDoctor, Nelson has taken me out of my comfort zone, but has retained certain elements for the hero image. None of which was demanded by me.   Lockdown memoir Sivakarthikeyan became a father for the second time to a baby boy, Gugan Doss; he says the lockdown gave him time to think about his plan for the next few years. Months into the gloom and doom of the first set of lockdowns, Siva and composer Anirudh Ravichander felt a need for a chirpy song that would put a smile on people’s faces. That is how, Siva says, the song ‘Chellama Chellama’, which has crossed over 130 million views on YouTube, came about. “Only after deciding the song did we [Anirudh and I] inform the director [Nelson]. And he simply asked where the song would be placed in the film,” he says with a laugh. Siva isn’t too keen on remakes. He expresses disinterest when posed with a question of whether he would be part of a remake, although he admits that he has been approached a lot for remakes including a Tamil version of Telugu blockbuster Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo . “First of all, who can even dance like [Allu Arjun]? And secondly, how do we even match the popularity of ‘Butta Bomma’ song? So, let us not even go there [remake].”   A hungry beast A self-professed fan of Vijay, Nelson has landed the opportunity to direct the actor in his third directorial, Beast . When the announcement for Beast came out, Siva posted a tweet tagging Nelson that read: “My brother with big dreams joining big names.” About Nelson’s career progression, Siva says, “He spent a really long time on a project that didn’t take off. It has been a wait of 10 years and his patience is now getting paid off.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/straight-from-the-heart/article36889597.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Shoot like a girl||Any young woman in India would want to stand in Lady Cadet Bijli Bijarnia’s shoes — they are a cool and successful pair. They often see more adventure than a pair in civvy street ever will — running through unmetalled roads with a battle-load and dashing between classrooms dodging the odd scorpion. They also just marched up to receive the coveted Sword of Honour given to the cadet who achieves overall best performance at the Officers Training Academy, Chennai. Bijli’s story has been lived and relived at the Academy since 1992, the year women were inducted into the officer cadre, walking through its Ram Singh Dwar as novices and leaving a year later as commissioned officers. Tanushree Podder’s latest book, The Girls in Green , (published by Bloomsbury), soon to be a web series, explores the journey of women like Bijli and the triumphs and heartbreaks they encounter during their tenure at the Academy. “Ever since I wrote my two books set in the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, I have been asked why I hadn’t written one on the OTA, the only Academy in the country that commissions women to be officers. When I saw Captain Tania Shergill lead an all-male contingent at the Army Day Parade 2020, I knew it was time to write the book,” says Podder over a phone call from Pune. “Only those who are intent on pursuing a career in the armed forces know what a lady cadet’s life looks like. I wanted to introduce that world to a larger audience through fiction.”     While Bijli is a star footballer from the Haryana hinterland and Lakmenlang Zyiem a lawyer, Shiny Joseph, an engineer from Kottayam joins OTA to stay close to her childhood sweetheart Aaron, often finding herself pitted against him. Nutan Patil, a starry-eyed small-town girl, brings up the rear. In the sapping humidity of Chennai, the four join other lady cadets of their course to write their own saga of extraordinary energy and unflagging resilience in the months it takes to earn a Lieutenant’s stars. There are moments so exhausting that some cry in the first few weeks of PT, squad punishments from the platoon commanders, front-rolls and pull-ups, pondering whether to quit. They tear up again when they leave, knowing that the moments forged in the fire of their training has made them part of a very rare sisterhood. It is these moments sprinkled with a generous measure of laugh-aloud humour that Podder captures well. Bringing the Academy alive to the reader is another aspect that Podder navigates well — right from the picture of the white, red-roofed Rezang La building that houses the headquarters on the book cover to the buzz in the cafeteria, the stifling quiet when a film is screened, the scrub-lined trenches, the snake pits, war rooms and the layout of Phoenix MarketCity where cadets spend their ‘liberty’ (out-passes are issued on Sundays). To tell the story of these women on the cusp of a brave new world, Podder visited OTA twice. “A lady officer from the Ordnance Corps took me around the Academy. I met instructors, watched cadets from different corners of India interact at the cafe. It gave me a sense of the place.” The girls buff their boots, crawl through rain sodden trenches and spend days doing drill without end like their male counterparts. They even sport close cropped hair and on the day of their Passing Out Parade are limber and spare, in a ceremony that is nothing short of captivating. In between, they have their share of mad adventures. Is the happy ending intentional? “The joy is intentional. We live in a dark world, shrouded by the pandemic,” says Podder. “The will to survive is what I wanted to focus on, the path to wearing the stars on your epaulette is not for quitters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/like-a-girl/article36889611.ece

While Vairavan thinks justice has to be wrested, Mathangi’s husband Sargunam (Samuthirakani) rests his belief in the law. Their ideological differences fissure the family. The story, set in Pudukkottai, revolves around this drama, even as it talks about other social issues. The film, written and directed by Era Saravanan, is set to premiere in Tamil and Telugu (as Raktha Sambandham ) on Amazon Prime Video on October 14. It also features Soori and Kalaiyarasan, among others. Jyothika took a hiatus in the mid-2000s after her marriage to Suriya before resuming in 2015. After her comeback, she has mostly starred in female-centric films. “I chose to portray dignified women on screen in my second innings. The character I play in Udanpirappe is special because it shows the strength of a woman’s silence,” she said. Udanpirappe, produced by Jyotika and her husband Suriya, is Jyotika’s 50th film.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-strength-of-silence/article36889606.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Business as usual?||The Telugu film Love Story , directed by Sekhar Kammula and starring Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi, reportedly grossed over Rs. 70 crore in 10 days since its theatrical release on September 24. In its opening weekend, it collected over $1,000,000 in the United States, the only Telugu film to do so post the second wave of COVID-19. A section of the Telugu film industry views this as a ray of hope for theatrical releases, while others temper it with caution and state that the footfalls do not match the pre-pandemic era. A slew of films starring well-known actors are scheduled to release in the next few weeks. Big budget films starring A-list stars will arrive beginning mid-December 2021. The pan-Indian film RRR directed by S S Rajamouli, starring Ram Charan and NTR, is scheduled for January 7. So far, 125 Telugu films have been released in theatres in 2021 — a staggering number despite theatres being closed for more than three months during the second wave of COVID-19. Theatres in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh re-opened on July 30, witnessing several small and medium film releases. A few managed decent opening weekend collections while others were washed out. For films with a budget of over Rs. 20 crore, the theatrical release was deemed a risk. Tuck Jagadish (directed by Shiva Nirvana, starring Nani), Narappa (the Asuran remake starring Venkatesh) and Maestro (the Andhadhun remake starring Nithiin and Tamannaah) chose direct digital release. Worth the risk The producers of Love Story , however, were adamant about theatrical release. Says Rammohan Puskar, one of the film’s producers, “It is up to the individual producers to decide how they want to release their film, depending on the financial situation. We released Love Story in 850 theatres worldwide. Theatres in several States in North India remain closed or have been doing dismal business, so we haven’t released there. We haven’t been able to release in Malaysia, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia as well. While Telangana allows 100% occupancy, Andhra Pradesh allows 50% occupancy and the ticket pricing is low (in rural centres, tickets are priced at Rs. 5 to Rs. 50). Distributors and exhibitors were sceptical about the returns but we took the risk.” Attending the pre-release event, superstars Chiranjeevi and Aamir Khan threw their weight behind Love Story , urging audiences to watch the film in theatres. Reality check As expected, the film opened to roaring business and theatres witnessed a festive atmosphere. The industry heaved a sigh of relief, but the footfalls dipped on weekdays which can partly be attributed to the effect of cyclone Gulab in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A leading producer who does not wish to be named, says it is too soon to celebrate the revival of theatres, “Anyone who talks about reality on the ground and chooses an OTT release comes under heavy criticism. We all want theatres to thrive, but it is going to take time. After the second wave, we are still waiting for a true blue hit like Uppena or Jaathi Ratnalu . We cannot dismiss the fear of family audiences stepping into theatres. During the pandemic, people have become habituated to watching movies on digital platforms.” Director Krish, whose film Konda Polam is releasing on October 8, says the theatre culture is here to stay: “OTT will not stop people from visiting theatres for a community viewing experience.” A few notable films, namely director Venu Udugula’s Virata Parvam starring Rana Daggubati and Sai Pallavi, and the Telugu remake of Drishyam 2 titled Drushyam 2 starring Venkatesh, are yet to announce their release plans.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||When they see us||You cannot go a whole day without hearing about Squid Game , the new Korean survival-horror fest that has people looking at children’s games in a whole new way. Directed and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the series on Netflix follows a number of people with heavy debts competing against each other in a series of seemingly innocent games for cash prize. But the rug gets pulled out from under them when they realise they are not just playing for money, but for their lives — losers get killed instantly in these games. Despite the bone-chilling displays of manipulation, peer pressure, and straight-up gaslighting seen throughout, the concept has enthralled millions around the world; people are recreating games such as Red Light, Green Light and the Dalgona cracking challenge. The cosplay world is already teeming with recreations of the pink overalls-suited soldiers, the Front Man with his geometric mask and, of course, the massive singing doll with swivelling eyes. Sameer Bundela, an award-winning cosplayer in Mumbai, is excited about the potential of Squid Game in this space. Often opting for sinister and complex characters, he appreciates the eye for detail. He particularly praises New York-based cosplayer M4stiff (pronounced ‘mastiff’) for her recreation of the singing doll; she donned a wig with the high-cut bangs and two ponytails, along with the orange tunic and yellow T-shirt teamed with knee-high socks and black shoes. But M4stiff took it to a sinister level with blackout contact lenses to mimic the soulless look of the doll that creeped everyone out. The giant robotic doll is featured in the first game of the series, as the host of Red Light, Green Light. The game is fairly common; you run towards a safe finish line while the host’s head is turned away. When they turn back towards the players, whoever is still moving is out. But in Squid Game context, ‘out’ means dead; and the doll’s eyes — which are actually cameras — swivel about to scan players’ body movements and the hidden rifles around the area shoot them if they move. Not just fun games US TikToker, TheBlondeJon, and his friends recreated the Red Light, Green Light game in an empty canal, complete with bright-coloured overalls, masks and paintball guns that were not fired but just aimed at the still-moving players. The video has got more than one lakh views across various platforms. Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, Dhruv Viswanathan and his friends have summer plans to play the game. “I am reuniting with some old college friends, and we will play the game at our farm house next May. We plan to play the doll’s song on a loudspeaker and use water balloons filled with red water on those who still move, just to recreate the experience without hurting anyone. We have made a WhatsApp group just for that. We have already ordered overalls and masks from abroad which will take time to come,” he says. Would it even be a Squid Game cultural wave without the mention of ppopgi , aka honeycomb toffee or Dalgona? Jeon Minpyo, manager of Nowana, a family-run Korean restaurant in Auroville, recently started offering the Dalgona candy challenge to customers. In the series, the contestants are tasked with carefully cutting out a traced shape from a Dalgona candy disc — if contestants broke into the shape, they are killed. Of course, at Nowana, there are no such repercussions, says Minpyo with a laugh. “It took a lot of trial and error to get the consistency right, so we spent a whole day perfecting the ratios! If a customer succeeds, they get to take one home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-they-see-us/article36889647.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Transformative tale in the jungles||The Telugu novel Konda Polam (which translates to forest grazing) written by Sannapureddy Venkatarami Reddy narrates the adventures of shepherds venturing into a hilly forest region to feed their cattle. Director Krish Jagarlamudi’s Telugu film, based on the book, is a coming-of-age story of a man from the shepherd community who studies BTech and is unable to land a corporate job and learns life lessons from the jungles to fight predators. As the film starring Vaisshnav Tej and Rakul Preet Singh gears up for theatrical release on October 8, the director opens up on what went into its making. Edited excerpts from the interview:  Konda Polam has the tagline ‘An epic tale of becoming’. Most of your films have been ambitious and large in scale, isn’t it? I cannot do regular love stories or revenge dramas. With each film, I crave for a new chapter. My initial films Gamyam (2008) and Vedam (2010) were not written to be small films, though we worked with limited budgets. When I write or adapt a story, I do not limit my imagination. The soul of the story is important; if the character evolves during an epic journey, so be it. Kanche (2015) was set during the Second World War and Gautamiputra Satakarni (2017) was a historical drama, warranting bigger budgets. My next, Hari Hara Veera Mallu with Pawan Kalyan, is set in the 17th century during the Mughal reign. Theatre, literature and history have influenced your films. Can you recall your early memories of being drawn to literature? I grew up in a large family of about 30 members, including six uncles and aunts. My grandfather inculcated the reading habit in me. At an impressionable age we learn from our elders, which is more than what we can absorb from any personality development or self-help books. Whatever I have learnt from my elders has held me in good stead. When did you read the novel Konda Polam ? Director Sukumar introduced me to the book during the pandemic. I loved the book, bought more copies and gifted them to Pawan Kalyan, Balakrishna and a few other friends. I knew that someday I might adapt it into a film, but didn’t think I would do it so soon. The story kept coming back to me and when I bounced the idea to Pawan Kalyan, he graciously asked me to do this film first and then Hari Hara Veera Mallu . He was filming for Vakeel Saab at the time. It was also the time when Civil Services results were announced and I thought it would be interesting to develop Konda Polam into a story of a shepherd becoming a forest officer. I also wanted to incorporate a beautiful love story into this. I bought the rights and approached Sannapureddy to write the screenplay.  Love Story also has a character choosing a different path after studying BTech. Is this a reflection of present times? There are many of us in the industry who studied Engineering and moved to cinema. Blessed are those who can do what they are passionate about. Konda Polam is the journey of a man who stops following the herd and becomes a shepherd. He studies BTech because everyone else is doing it. His low self esteem and deficiency in English makes it tough for him to get a job. He finds his true calling in the forests. Not many knew of this film before you released the first look a few months ago. Were considerable portions already filmed? Yes, we wanted to keep it that way. Though the story in the book is set in Nallamala, permissions were tough to come by during the pandemic and we filmed in Vikarabad. About 80 of us were in a bio bubble. We ventured into the forest with 1,000 sheep and their shepherds. Deep into the forests, villages may not have water and other essentials for all of us. So we took everything with us, followed protocols while filming with the sheep and factored in weather conditions. Other animals were created with visual effects. What went into the casting? I wanted someone new as the protagonist. I watched Vaisshnav Tej in the song ‘ Nee kannu neeli samudram’ from Uppena long before the film was released. I liked the intensity in his eyes. He has the zeal to learn. We wanted an experienced leading lady and cinematographer Gnanashekhar VS suggested Rakul. While narrating the story to her, I was sure I had found Obulamma (her character). Rakul is a go-getter and quick to grasp details.  I cannot do regular love stories or revenge dramas. With each film, I crave for a new chapter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/transformative-tale-in-the-jungles/article36889622.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The sounds of organic music||Shanka Tribe, a seven-piece music band recently dropped its first single ‘When Nature Calls’ on Spotify. The over five-minute music video shot in Kerala by cinematographer Jayesh Mohan is a treat for Nature lovers even as band members Joel Jackson P, Munna PM, Nithin M Menon, Sreeraj K, Bonny Abraham, Aswin Lal and Libin Noby create unique tunes with traditional tribal instruments like the didjeridoo, djembe, conga, handpan, darbuka, bongo, oud along with the flute, guitar and keyboard. They also include chants in their music. Shanka Tribe is proud to identify itself as a disruptive player in the Indian indie music scene, with their unique and alternative style. Their experimental music stands out with its signature opening — every track opens with the sound of a shankh (conch). The band’s didjeridoo player, Munna PM explains why this is the 10-year-old band’s first single. “In the initial days, the priority of the band was to simply create music. We had to give people some time to understand and get used to this new genre. Live performances were the best way to test our music. With each performance, our confidence grew as many people started appreciating our music.” Munna who first thought of forming a band, says he was inspired by a few tracks he had been listening to. Fascinated by tribal music, he says he luckily found like-minded members to join him. All the band members are full-time musicians and a few of them had worked in a Malayalam film. What’s in a name Born from a college music festival, the band name has nostalgia value. Munna says, “When we were considering different names one of my friends, Shishira, suggested ‘Shanka’ as in s hankh (conch) which a few band members had a personal connection with during their childhood. Also, the cleansing, purifying and spiritual effect of the shankh is unparalleled. So we felt that shankh is an apt name for an instrumental band like this.” Their music derives inspiration from varied styles and genres, experimentally incorporating emotions with chants, sounds and expressions and melodiously amalgamate sounds of various tribal and indigenous instruments. ‘Preserve instrumental beauty’ What is the most difficult part of creating music with folk instruments? Bonny says, “Whenever we create music we try to incorporate the didgeridoo, oud, jaw harp etc; these instruments are unique and exotic, so we have to use them wisely. It is important to understand what the instrument can do and what's best for that particular song. For example, the didgeridoo can be played as a drone to a rhythmic progression.” Also, he adds that one has to be patient as such melodic ideas takes time. It is important to listen and explore different genres of music to understand the contribution of each instrument to the track. Speaking of the pulse of young music lovers, Munna says, “When it comes to sound there have been a lot of changes in contemporary film music. There is a huge opportunity in experimenting with organic sounds. New sounds are what everyone prefers but they should come with context when shown in movies.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-sounds-of-organic-music/article36889650.ece

After many months of lockdowns, these are designed to bring like-minded people together over common interests. So apart from the food, there is a focus on planning an activity for the group from cook-offs to photography classes. The trend started during the pandemic when friends and families met in small groups in keeping with mandatory safety protocol. Suryaveer Singh, founder  of Hyderabad Wine Society was pleasantly surprised when a wine dinner he announced was sold out in a night. He adds that, as lockdowns eased, he was approached by an increasing number of people who wanted help with hosting wine dinners for private get-togethers. “This wasn’t the case before the pandemic. Hosting curated events for like-minded groups of people is a totally different experience because it has to be tailor-made.” While curated private dining experiences are not new; Suryaveer says the pandemic and excessive time spent on OTT platforms watching cook-offs and reality shows like Bling Empire and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills have made them more popular, and hence accessible. Curated events are not exactly classes. These sessions, which precede or run alongside the meal, are all about unwinding and engaging activity so participants can bond. Deepa Reddy — chocolatier and owner of Foncé— was in two minds about launching the High Tea by Foncé. The response was unexpected. “We get bookings not just for the high tea experience at the cafe, but also for the outdoor experience. Guests usually prefer smaller-scale gatherings of eight to 10 people in the comfort of their homes, usually setup in their gardens or farm houses.” She adds that they are receiving requests for bridal showers, as well as bookings for regular get-togethers with friends. “We curated an exclusive high tea set for a gentleman who used the experience to propose to his girlfriend. The concept of celebrating occasions has changed for good in this city,” she says. Such curated events do not always come with a fancy price tag. The key is to gather like-minded people, who could also just be the family, and pick a theme. Syed Hasnain, a medical student and a coffee lover did a coffee brew meet for his cousins, and says that everyone loved it. Syed explained roasting, grinding and different brewing techniques, then showed them four methods of making coffee — French press, pour-over, Aeropress and a mocha pot. He says, “All the coffee talk and the fragrance also attracted the curiosity of the elders at home.” Not all events are about food and drink. Some get-togethers involve picking up new skills, like photography for instance. Aditi Talwar, a professional photographer says she was surprised when an event planner approached her for a high tea that involved learning to take good photos with the phone. Aditi says, “After online classes during the pandemic, I gladly accepted the offer because it was also a new experience for me. I kept the session easy and only spoke about light, composition and angles.” She adds, “We followed the class with a series of portrait and selfie sessions which kept everyone engaged.”  What can be done in Hyderabad  Wine dinner: Learn about wine and pairing with food  Art meets over tea/coffee: Indulge in high tea or snack on your favourite foods as you paint  Dine with a farm experience: Host a farm stay and treat your guests to healthy good food  Photography get-togethers: Chill as you hone your photography skills and learn about your best photo angles  Crafting session: Learn a craft as your gorge on some yummy snacks  High tea: Catch up over intimate dos with friends and family||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/tailor-made-for-a-good-time/article36889636.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Grab your binoculars||Our seasonal guests have landed, in millions, after marathon flights across continents. Birds from 29 countries fly to India every year at this time, an annual ritual signifying the beginning of migration. The stint, a bird that weighs just about 20 grams, makes an astonishing journey covering 8,000 kilometres from Siberia to Tamil Nadu’s Point Calimere. Forested areas of the Indian peninsula are aflutter with warblers, a wispy olive green bird, that fly thousands of kilometres from the mountains of Central Asia. The bar-tailed godwits, after spending their summers in Russia, will soon embark on a long non-stop flight to spend the winters at shallow water bodies in Pulicat and Sholinganallur. In Chennai, wader birds are among the first ones to arrive, and can be spotted around Pallikaranai, Sholinganallur marsh, Kelambakkam, and Pulicat. “Wood sandpipers are the most common, followed by common sandpipers, that can be identified by the clear C shaped marking in white, near their wings. These birds wade through shallow waters, and have arrived in hundreds, like every year,” says Aravind AM, a birder in Chennai. As daylight shrinks and food supply dwindles at the breeding sites in the Northern hemisphere, birds start migrating towards wintering sites in the South. “It’s a natural process of survival. They take nine flyways across the world and some unusual routes during this flight,” says S Sivakumar, scientist at Bombay Natural History Society. He adds, “The Central Asian Flyway covers 30 countries including India. The black-headed, brown-headed and slender-billed gulls have arrived, mostly from Europe and Central Asia.” Our special guests can easily be spotted perched on trees or at a wooded area, says Ashvin Viswanathan of Bird Count India, Bengaluru. Bird Count India supports listing and monitoring of birds across India. “Grey wagtails have arrived. I saw a blue-tailed bee eater (that breeds in North and central India) calling and migrating while heading South. Most birds migrate in the night. When you go to a forest patch or a garden in the morning near your home, you will see a new bird every day as it rests there after flying all night.” During winter, we see flocks of swallows either perched on electric wires or making rapid circular flights, not just over water bodies, but even over busy traffic roads. “Not many realise that these are migratory birds which have come from as far as Europe and Central Asia,” says Aravind. Small dull brown birds called warblers and species like Blyth's reed warblers and booted warblers can be seen around bushes or trees even in busy neighbourhoods. Many birders have observed unusual sightings. For example, Amur falcons made a stopover in Pune in huge numbers in January, and the red-necked phalarope, a pelagic bird showed up at Uppar Dam in Dharapuram, a non-coastal area during the last week of September. Birds have a few favourite places, says Ramakrishnan Aiyaswamy, a widllife photographer in Bengaluru. “They choose their place based on the availability of food and how long they can stay there. They also have a plan B, and choose another water body in the nearby area if their original habitat is disturbed.” As long as the birds keep up the date with migration, birders are happy as it indicates a healthy environment and a safe habitat. “We are waiting to meet the brown shrike that comes from the Mongolian region. Every year, we see two birds at our school campus in Valparai. It arrives by the first week of October. We see more than 30 migrant species here,” says K Selvaganesh, a birder and teacher at Valparai. During this time, some birds called passage migrants, like the European roller, rufous-tailed scrub robin, and common white throat, migrate through Rajasthan, Gujarat and other parts of the Indian Peninsula to cross the Arabian Sea. They move to Africa by mid-October to spend the winters there. “Birders in Delhi can now see the greenish warbler (from Europe), Blythe’s reed warbler (from Europe and Russia) and rusty-tailed flycatcher (from Kashmir and Himachal) passing through as the birds are heading southwards,” adds Ashvin. Though birds have been carrying on these long trips for millions of years, Aravind says one can spot small changes, through eBird database and through sites like Migrant watch. “Siberian cranes, which are critically endangered, used to visit Bharatpur Sanctuary about 20 years ago, but we don’t see them now because that population which visited India seems to have gone extinct.” Charting new courses Agrees Ashvin, who has put together animation maps on migration based on data uploaded on citizen science platform eBird. “There is suspicion on how birds might be reacting to shifts in climate. Bird species like yellow-browed warbler and Richard’s pipit migrated to Northeast India, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Now, they are landing in western Europe in a new migratory route. There is a documented change in pattern.” Researches track birds using satellite tags and that reveals knowledge on individual birds and their migration routes. “We ringed a northern shoveller at Manjeera Wildlife Sanctuary in Telangana, and tracked its flight all the way to Russia,” says Sivakumar and adds, “Migration is a long, exhausting journey. Global warming is real. Rains are inconsistent. Wetlands are drying up. Some changes have been noticed among the breeding ranges.We have to conserve our wetlands. They can gain weight and fly back to their breeding ground on time and bring healthy offspring.”  More on birds Visit www.birdcount.in to track the migration route of birds with an animated migration map The most well-known example for long distance migration is the Arctic tern. The latest is a female bar-tailed godwit that set a landbird flight record — 12,200 km from Alaska to New Zealand, in eight years and 12 hours!

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I do not wish to limit myself’||In early September, as Yohani Diloka De Silva’s cover of ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ went viral in India, the Sri Lankan musician expressed a desire to tour India and interact with not just Indian fans but artistes too. Cut to October, Yohani just wrapped up a performance in Heart Cup Coffee, Hyderabad, as part of her two-city India tour with Zee Live’s newly-launched sub-IP ‘Supermoon #NowTrending’. The 28-year-old sports a small bruise under her right eye, which she explains with a chuckle: it is an occupational hazard, received from the stem end of a guitar during a set the night before. “I slept in today thankfully, to help it heal!” she laughs, during a sit-down interview with MetroPlus at Le Meridien, Hyderabad. And what of pre-set rituals? Yohani keeps it simple, “I just train my voice beforehand.” But when she gets on stage, it is the ambience that gets her in the zone: “The lights, band, audience, space, the stage itself — the whole package flips a switch.” Originally performed by Satheeshan Rathnayaka, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ is a Sinhala ballad sung by a man to a woman, to express his admiration of her character and beauty. But more than the sweet lyrics, Yohani’s soprano tones and gazes into the camera give it a simple teen-pop vibe that enraptured millions. The cover also features Satheeshan rapping and — at the time of writing this — the video has crossed 141 million views. She has received shout-outs from Amitabh Bachchan and Sri Lankan cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya. Since then, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ has been used on TikTok and Instagram Reels; the hashtag #ManikeMageHithe on Instagram has more than 70,000 posts. Such videos make Yohani happy but she does not take the responsibility that comes with a viral track lightly. “This is the first time a Sri Lankan song has been viral to this extent, and I want everyone to be proud of its success so far. A lot of people didn’t even know that the Sinhala language existed, so it makes me happy that the language has gone quite far,” she says, adding it has been overwhelming to be a sort of ambassador for the country, the language and the music. Funnily enough, Yohani’s tour did not feature Chennai, Bengaluru or Kerala cities even though she and her team put together Tamil and Malayalam versions of her ‘Manike Mage Hithe’ cover. “My producer is Tamil actually,” she explains, “and he taught me how to pronounce certain things.” She hopes to come back to India for a tour that includes more cities and collaborations with other musicians.  More ambitions The musician talks about her debut album Kella , of which the first track ‘Ithin Adare’ will release on Saturday. The 12-track album is her narration of what it means to be a young modern woman in Sri Lanka in terms of friendships, relationships, independence and the mundane ( kella means girl or woman in Sinhalese). Bollywood has also kept Yohani busy; she recorded the female rendition of the title track for Kunal Deshmukh’s Shiddat, currently streaming on Hotstar. “It wasn’t easy,” she recalls, “I had to record it about five different times mainly because my pronunciation was off; I was emphasising the wrong words because I didn’t know the meaning. So I sat down and wrote each word and its translation. There are still some issues with pronunciation, but I feel I’ll sing better in Hindi when I am more comfortable with the language.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-do-not-wish-to-limit-myself/article36889629.ece

The exhibition-like display makes it easier to observe the fusion of weaving techniques. Ahead of showcasing his new collection, Chaand, at the FDCI X Lakme Fashion Week on October 8 in Mumbai, Gaurang held a preview for his Hyderabad clientele recently. “Not many are keen to travel due to the pandemic, but they wanted to see the collection. So we decided to have a full-fledged preview,” says Gaurang, adding that 10 saris have already been booked by buyers. These 40 saris were conceptualised three years ago. The craft clusters that liaise with Gaurang began working in advance, thus minimising the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on this collection. The saris of Chaand are diverse in their weaves; woven in Benaras, Kota, Srikakulam, Uppada, Venkatagiri, Kashmir and Paithan, they were later embroidered. In some cases, a single sari has been worked upon by two or three clusters. Imagine one section of the sari highlighting jamdani on khadi from Srikakulam and another section being Paithani on organza. The motifs range from traditional birds and animals to the tree of life and vintage florals. “We have been combining different weaves over the last few years and this collection is an extension of it,” says Gaurang. The experimentation has also led to interlocking of yarns, without the weft, to enable vibrant reproduction of colours. Gaurang’s weavers experimented on the loom, without the weft, for an earlier collection of saris that reproduced Raja Ravi Varma paintings. The colour palette for Chaand ranges from all-time favourites such as rose gold and vermillion red to combinations of rose pink and yellow gold, grey and ivory white, mauves, pistachio greens and deep greys. A few saris were inspired by museum pieces. A sari with the Kutchi suf embroidery on fine Venkatagiri cotton took a craftswoman three years to make. “The fine threads on the sari are nearly invisible to us, but a traditional Kutch craftswoman counted the threads and did the embroidery. She worked without a design sheet; the design was all in her mind.” Another sari showcases the aari embroidery of Kutch on a Kanjeevaram sari. The floral motifs are embroidered with six to eight shades of fine threads and took the craftsperson two-and-a-half years to make. Chaand will be showcased at LFW to the ghazals of Anup Jalota. Actor Taapsee Pannu will be the showstopper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/woven-splendour/article36889632.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||On the magic bus||The blistering four-minute action sequence in the Muni bus in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings took a solid year of planning. “The pandemic took away three months; we shot in Sydney and San Francisco,” explains stunt coordinator Andy Cheng, over a video call from Budapest. For those who came in late, the said sequence happens in the beginning of the film when the thugs, including one who has a machete for a hand, attack Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who is travelling with his friend, Katy (Awkwafina) in a bus. “Shang-Chi pretends he does not know martial arts. He tries to tell the bad guys, ‘I think you have got the wrong guy.’ We, director Destin Daniel Cretton, and supervising stunt coordinator, Brad Allan, started from there. We thought we could take the fight outside the bus; on the roof to create a unique fight sequence.” Safety, Cheng says, was one of the biggest challenges of the scene. “We had two set ups — a meter high one for normal driving and another that was five meters high, which was like a roller-coaster. Keeping the actors who played the passengers,safe was paramount. Choreographing the fight where Shang-Chi goes from the driver’s seat to the back of the bus in a narrow space was demanding.” Cheng, who was part of Jackie Chan’s stunt team, says, “In the beginning of the scene, Shang-Chi saves a falling girl by grabbing her belt. It was a difficult stunt as Simu had to jump on a chair, run at a 45 degree angle while the bus was bouncing around. We did more than 20 takes, and sometimes, he would miss the belt and the girl would hit the window. One time, Simu missed the chair and hurt his shin. We had all safety measures in place but these things happen.” On whether CGI has helped or hindered action sequences, Cheng says, “ It helps control the environment — you know a car will not suddenly come into the frame. When Simu is running on the top of the bus and swinging in through a window, we were able to control the scene thanks to CGI.” The downside of CGI, according to Cheng is viewers are now smart and so the danger does not seem real. “However, in the balance, safety is more important.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-the-magic-bus/article36889617.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The great||Prim manicured lawns are being put to pasture. In their place, sassy urban jungles are springing up across the country, ablaze with fruit trees, flowering shrubs, water bodies and verdant greenery, much to the delight of ecologists and environmentalists. A colonial legacy of the British, a lush lawn was the hallmark of buildings of the Raj. Irrespective of geographic locations, the lawn spread all over India with the imperialists. Like many British legacies, it stayed, even after the Raj was uprooted from India. However, turf lawns guzzle water, pesticides and fertilizers to stay glossy. Sheetal Patil, researcher at Azim Premji University, says: “The chemicals silence crickets, ants, birds, butterflies and bees.” This is why architect Vinod Mathew, who trained under the renowned Bali-based landscape designer Made Wijaya, used plants endemic to Kerala to landscape the upscale Villa Maya restaurant in Thiruvananthapuram. Expressing his disappointment at seeing native gardens filled with hibiscus, jasmine, moonbeam, coral jasmine and other common flowers that used to flourish in the ‘70s and ‘80s in Kerala homes being replaced by lawns and imported plants over the past few decades, Vinod says he focusses on environment-friendly landscaping. He is not the only one. Landscape designer Roshni Nair says homeowners realise the disadvantages of a turf lawn only after they have lived with it for a while. “Prohibitively expensive to maintain in a hot, tropical place like Kerala, the lawn requires to be nursed with tender loving care to maintain its lush green look. Since grass needs sunshine, trees with canopy cannot be grown. The house is exposed to the sun and becomes unbearably hot,” she adds. That is why Suchitra Radha in Thiruvananthapuram decided to replace her lawn with a tropical garden and water body. Suchitra found that her house, which faces the west, would become unbearably hot due to the direct sunlight falling on the walls. When she planted trees to shade the house from the sun, her gardener was not happy as the trees were “spoiling” the lawn. Finally, she decided to take out the lawn completely. Landscape designer Malavika Mohan refuses to create lawns, and focusses instead on empowering her clients with alternatives. “It is important to know your garden well so that you know when and where you will get sunlight. So the garden is an evolving one. First, trees are planted along with bushes. Ferns and plants that need the shade come next. Once, the trees grow in a couple of years, I add fillers such as creepers and foliage plants that can come under them so it looks lush. Everything depends on the lay of the garden,” she says. Architect Tony Joseph in Kozhikode had his lawn removed because he wanted his house to be cooler, says landscaper Jacob Klavara. He replaced the turf grass lawn with pearl grass, creepers and foliage plants. Jacob says many residents are removing their carpet lawns because they have become aware of their high environmental cost. Ravindran Daniel, a former UN official, asked architect Liza Natarajan to redesign his garden to create a more life-friendly space with endemic flowers. After the redesign, his large garden began attracting birds and bees. “In most cases, architects plan the house and the garden is done at the last minute, usually a lawn bordered with flowers or palms. I insist on doing the interior and the exterior simultaneously so that each corner has its own surprise and a bit of green,” says Vinod. To avoid ‘green deserts’ Chennai-based architect Benny Kuriakose says many clients ask for trees, ferns and evergreens. “Unlike a decade ago, most of my clients don’t want lawns, they want green spaces with waterbodies and a not-so-pruned-and-orderly garden.” Benny avers that in water-scarce regions such as Chennai, having a lawn is harmful to the environment as it sucks up the available water from the water table. “A garden has to grow with the gardener,” says Malavika. “Instead of going for carpet lawns and fully-grown plants, the joy of gardening lies in watching your garden grow and bloom,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-great/article36890083.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Stamping grounds that bridge time||As shadows lengthen on Gothuruth Island, a village 40 kilometres from Kochi, weary feet quicken. Under harsh fluorescent lights, men and women transform into Emperor Charlemagne (the first Holy Roman Emperor), Oliver, Roland, Bethesda, knights, warriors and Turks, all characters from medieval Europe; the mainstay of Chavittunadakam, an indigenous form of theatre popular among the coastal people of Kerala. From North Kollam to Thrissur, makeshift stages come alive with Chavittunadakam ( chavittu means step or stamp and natakam means play in Malayalam) enacted mainly by Latin Catholic residents-turned-actors. Clad in shiny costumes and shoes, they speak in a mixture of Tamil and Malayalam and sing songs about battles fought in faraway lands to protect the early Christians. Charmed by a play he happened to watch, J. Bibin Joseph, an engineer-turned-film director from Thiruvananthapuram, made The Fragments of Illusion, a documentary on Chavittunadakam, which won the Kerala State Television Award for the best director in the non-fiction category. “Its practitioners are fishermen, weavers, boatmen, masons and so on. It is a legacy that has been preserved by them in the face of great odds,” he says. Without a master voice-over, the actor-singers of Chavittunadakam in Gothuruth talk about the plays and stories in the documentary. The familiarity with which they speak about incidents that are believed to have occurred in medieval Europe, is surreal. “Margam kali, a folk dance that bears a strong resemblance toThiruvathira kali, and Chavittunadakam are the two popular performing art forms unique to Christians in Kerala. Chavittanadakam is anchored in Christian mythology and the Crusades. Since it is cross-cultural in origin, actors wear footwear, a feature unique to Chavittanadakam. Other indigenous art forms in Kerala shun footwear during a performance,” says Arun Surendran, producer of the documentary. Chavittunadakam is said to have been created by Padroado missionaries who arrived with the Portuguese in 1498 in search of God, gold and glory. Folklorist Geetha P. Wilson says there are versions in all the regions where the Padroado preached. South America, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Africa have similar plays. Chavittunadakam has elements of Western opera, Koodiyattam, Kathakali and Kalaripayattu. Its dance segments are calledkalasam, the name of pure dance sequences in Kathakali. In the past, these plays were staged at night for church festivals. Some plays, like the popular and earliest, Karalman Charitham , were staged over 15 nights. Roy George, anasan(teacher) and practitioner of Chavittunadakam, recalls his father and his contemporaries putting up the plays by borrowing money and working hard to find stages. The art form received some exposure when Mammootty played a Chavittanadakam actor in Shaji N. Karun’s film Kutty Srank (2009). In 2012, the Kerala government’s inclusion of Chavittunadakam in the Kerala State Schools’ Youth Festival came as a shot in the arm for troupes. Since then, George’s kalari has students of all ages learning the unique footwork, songs and dialogues of Chavittunadakam. According to Geetha, traditional percussion instruments such as the chenda and ela thalam used to be played during recitals in the past. “Now, keyboard, tabla, rhythm keypad and ela talam are played. There is no fixed number for the musicians accompanying a play. It can differ,” she says. Vigorous footwork Traditionally, Chavittunadakam’s footwork includes 12 distinctive steps. Georgekutty asan created two more. The footwork is physically demanding. Geetha explains that in the past, the stage was a wooden platform constructed on top of wooden barrels: “The performers’ vigorous footwork would create a booming sound as they stepped hard on the wooden stage.” “The government’s encouragement has given us many stages; we have performed all over Kerala. New plays are in Malayalam, as it would be difficult for audiences to understand the language of older plays,” adds Roy. The five-day Chuvadi festival from December 26 to 31 last year, which began at Gothuruth, had to be postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Roy is upbeat when he says that the play is reaching cities and is not restricted to the coastal belt, once the stamping ground of the Chavittunadakam actors.  Chavittunadakam is said to have been created by Padroado missionaries who arrived when the Portuguese reached the land in 1498, in search of God, gold and glory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/stamping-grounds-that-bridge-time/article36890084.ece

Encouraged by customers eager to shop again after many months of lockdowns, vendors began setting up shop on roadsides in Mylapore and T Nagar, the hub of Navratri doll sales, in Chennai nearly three weeks ago. Families that have the tradition of displaying dolls for the nine days of Navratri, buy new ones to add to their collection. This season, as people turn to the comfort of nostalgia, there is a growing market for antique dolls. Divya N., designer and faculty member at National Institute of Fashion Technology, says, “People have always kept inherited dolls in thegolu, but now they are actively buying old dolls on social media. Sellers are either elderly people or dealers. Labelled as vintage, these dolls are around 40 to 80 years old, and sold as sets of four or more. They cost anywhere between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 20,000.” As this is the 100th death anniversary of the freedom fighter and poet Subramania Bharati, retailers say that the ‘Bharathiyar doll’ is trending. Tea and idli kadai sets are also garnering attention, particularly at Khadi Gramodhyog Bhavan, Anna Salai. Secretary of the Bhavan, G. Elangovan, says that sales were rather dull in 2019, and absolutely nil last year. “This year, we are trying to clear the previous stock and give minimal new orders, only enough to help sustain the livelihood of the doll makers in the State.” Divya, who works with doll makers in and around Tamil Nadu as part of the Central government’s craft cluster development programmes, says that artisan C. Bharanidharan of Chinna Kanchipuram has created an IPL theme set (Rs. 3,000) featuring coloured jerseys with names and numbers. The set of 15 pieces comprises fielders, batsmen and umpires. Says Bharanidharan: “We can customise it to any IPL team.” Adding that the cost of production has increased by 20% this year, he says they are stocking less. ‘Seemandham’ sets and ‘Thiruvallur Perumal’ dolls made last year, are being sold this year as new releases. According to K. Parameshwaran, proprietor of Sri Jyothi Handicrafts, Mylapore, customers are looking for lightweight dolls either because they are on a tight budget or due to a lack of space. “But dolls made in Tamil Nadu — mostly of gods, saints and leaders — come in big sizes. Therefore, we source small dolls from West Bengal and Andhra,” he says.  This year, the mood seems to be to keep the golu tradition alive, but on a smaller format.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-business-of-dolls/article36890082.ece

The actor, who launched Tweak Books last year, says the idea of what a ‘superhero’ looks like is changing. Her platform is out with its second book, published by Juggernaut, in theWhen I Grow Up, I Want To Beseries for children, that narrates inspiring accounts of 20 real-life ‘heroes’: from ‘Mr Inkredible’ Anirudh Sharma, who found a way to turn carbon emissions from cars into ink, ‘Forest Man’ Jadav Payeng, the environmental activist from Majuli, to ‘Rocket Woman’ Ritu Karidhal, who was the deputy operations director for the Mangalyaan mission. “We want children to get acquainted with our local heroes: men, women, and yes, kids, who have done remarkable things,” says Twinkle, in an email interview. The Tweak team drew up lists of people after combing through news reports, documentaries and recipients of prestigious awards in fields like conservation and invention. “We then had to narrow it down to 20 individuals that had consistently contributed to their individual fields. These had to be stories that children would find both inspiring as well as engaging,” she adds. Accounts of their merit and experiences were turned into stories that would capture the imagination of children. Picture ‘Choti Champion’ Alana Meenakshi lording over her chessboard, surveying the kingdom her pieces rule over, or a 100-kilogram birthday cake for all of Bibi Prakash Kaur’s (founder of Unique Home for Girls) 60 adopted daughters. “We included children like Saarang Sumesh, who invented the smart seat belt, so children would find a hero among their own peers,” says Twinkle. As a mother to her nine-year-old daughter, Nitara, Twinkle attributes the changing idea of what makes for a hero to the amount of exposure children have today. She recalls reading Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls with Nitara. “Her favourite story was on Catherine the Great, the German-born princess, who banished her husband and took over as the empress of Russia. She asked me, ‘So is Catherine good or is she evil then, like a witch?’” “I told her that all witches were perhaps princesses first, just like Catherine, who got tired of their knight in shining armour falling off his high horse. It gave us a chance to talk about gender, equality and ambition. Books about real-life heroes, I believe, give parents the chance to have conversations with their kids that can mould their world view,” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/my-hero-looks-like-me/article36890085.ece

It was late afternoon when Bhuvan found his parents fast asleep. He tiptoed to the kitchen and filled a bottle with some milk. The street was quiet and empty when he opened the main door. Bhuvan put on his mask, put a wrench from his father’s tool kit into his bag and stepped out. Stella and Mercy were playing outside the house. “Where are you going?” asked Stella. Bhuvan scowled and ran to the main road. He had reached the traffic signal when a tempo spewing a white cloud zipped past him. Bhuvan coughed and let go of the bottle. Someone poked him from behind. He turned around to find Popo Singh with his menacing lathi. “You shouldn’t be here. They are fumigating and disinfecting the streets,” he said. Bhuvan picked the bottle. “I wanted to help the kittens!” “Kittens?” “They are trapped in Mrs. Miranda’s shop.” “Don’t worry. I have been taking care of them ever since the lockdown started.” Bhuvan stared. “Do you have a key to the shop?” “No!” replied Popo Singh. “I have been feeding them through a hole at the bottom of the door. The shop must be smellier than unwashed socks, but at least the kittens are alive and safe!” “Can’t I go to the shop for a minute?” asked Bhuvan. “Go home!” said Popo Singh. “We can’t open the shop without a key.” “Can’t you break the lock?” Popo Singh glared. “I am a policeman, not a thief. Mrs. Miranda is being discharged from the hospital tomorrow. I will take the key from her and rescue the kittens.” Bhuvan refused to leave. “Did Stella tell you about the kittens?” “No! I heard the kittens mewing when I patrolled the streets.” Bhuvan tossed the bottle in his school bag and ran home as fast as he could. When he reached the door, he could see Stella singing and dancing with Mercy. He clapped twice to catch her attention. She responded by smiling at him. He smiled back. “I just found out Popo Singh has been feeding the kittens.” Stella shrugged. “I tried to tell you earlier. But you weren’t ready to listen.” Bhuvan pulled his ears. “I am sorry.” His smile turned into a frown when he heard the faint wail of a siren. “Get inside the house!” screamed Stella. Bhuvan ran in and looked out of the window with bated breath.  (To be continued)   “You shouldn’t be here. They are fumigating and disinfecting the streets.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/bhuvans-secret-one-more-attempt/article36890272.ece

Most astronomershold that the universe began with a big bang, about 14 billion years ago. Back then, according to them, the whole universe was inside a bubble, which was several thousand times smaller than a pinhead, and hotter and denser than imaginable. Out of the blue, it exploded and thus was born the universe, as we know it today. The noise, which indicated the birth of the universe, is what scientists refer to as the Big bang theory.    Why do mostof the birds fly   together in V-shape formation?  Scientistshave discovered that the V-shaped formation that birds use when migrating is for two reasons, primarily. To begin with, it conserves their energy. Each bird flies slightly above the bird in front of it, which results in reduced wind resistance. They take turns being in the front or falling back when they get tired. It also helps them with group communication and coordination, and to keep track of every bird.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article36890267.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Nine gems on Devi||At seven in the morning, I eagerly looked forward to attending my music class. I was excited about having already learnt two compositions since my gurukulavasam with Dr. S. Ramanathan began at his Triplicane residence. That morning, my guru started with an awe-inspiring Saveri alapana before teaching ‘Durusuga’ by Syama Sastri, a majestic composition that highlights the regal beauty of goddess Tripura Sundari. Though it has three charanams, it’s only the last mudra charanam that is usually sung. The composer pleads for a disease-free life, an apt song for the pandemic. The anupallavi describes her as an ocean of mercy, compassion, and the queen of Pranatharthihara, as Dharmasamvaddhani, and as Tripura Sundari. The first line of the anupallavi is a favourite for niraval singing. The play of words at ‘Bahu para kamalaguna’ is interesting. The composition has many swaraksharams, a trademark of Syama Sastri. The phrase ‘ g r n ’ in the swara sahityam leading up to the pallavi is unique. Brilliant alapana I once travelled with my guru for a concert in Bengaluru. At the hotel, he suddenly told me to bring the shruti box and taught me ‘Pahi parvatha’ in Arabhi, composed by Swati Tirunal. That evening at the concert, he sang the piece, prefixed by a brilliant alapana and suffixed with kalpanaswarams at ‘Pahi parvatha’ using swaraksharam at ‘pa’ of Pahi. The Arabhi in the pallavi itself is a work of art. The samskritam used by the royal composer is exquisite, with ‘Parvanendu’ (for the full moon), ‘kesari’ (for lions), and ‘ditijaali’ (for demons) uncommon words used in the kriti. The description of her locks dancing on her forehead is beautiful ( chanchadali lalita alake ). Here too there are three charanams, but only the last is usually sung. The composer’s usual mudra is not seen, but there is a reference to the kings of the Vanchi region. Another kriti that has always amazed me is the Thodi Dhyana kriti of the Kamalamba Navavaranam series. Conventionally sung in Rupaka talam, this tisra eka composition by Muthuswami Dikshitar is power-packed in terms of sahitya and raga. The start of the pallavi on nishadam, and the meandering curves and embellishments spanning the madhya sthayi are noteworthy. I have always felt that Dikshitar has given a glimpse of his alapana style in this free-flowing Thodi. The gamakams are priceless. The word ‘Kamala’ is used throughout the pallavi and anupallavi, but carries a different meaning each time. Kamala-ambike refers to the goddess, Kamalasana refers to Brahma, Kamalalaya refers to the temple tank, and Kamalapade describes her lotus feet. The description of the goddess at macro and microcosmic levels sets the stage for the rest of the Navavarana compositions. ‘Sundari Ni’, the Kalyani kriti by Tyagaraja, extolled as one of the Tiruvotriyur Pancharatnam, is very special to me. It was the main piece in my debut concert at the Madras Music Academy in 1986. Tyagaraja has shared his ecstasy when he sees the goddess. The exciting start on the tara shadjam and the seamless glide of the raga in the word ‘Rupamunu’ and the way the Phalamo is tuned in the anupallavi is simply indescribable. There are three charanams in this kriti and it’s the second that is commonly sung. Multiple tempos ‘Sankari nive’, by Subbaraya Sastri, is also among my favourites, in the raga Begada. This kriti lends itself to multiple tempos. Despite being a petite Rupaka tala kriti, if sung in vilamba kala, the kriti can sound like a majestic two kalai adi composition. The beginning phrase is wonderful. The charana sahityam compiles the virtues of the Devi and the composer implores her to protect her devotees. In addition to the swara sahityam, a trademark of Subbaraya Sastri, there is also a beautiful madhyamakala sahityam. The first part of the swara sahityam has a lovely pattern while the second is entirely in madhyama kala. ‘Sri Kanchi Sadana’ is a challenging line to take up for niraval. The phrase rndp in both the octaves is found only in this kriti. I remember trying this out at a December season concert at The Mylapore Fine Arts Club. Tiruvarur Ramaswami Pillai has composed only a handful of compositions, but each is a gem. One of them is ‘Ekkalathilum’ a Tamil composition in Purvikalyani. The slow gait, the meandering sangatis, and the wonderful sahityam have always brought tears of joy, even on a concert platform. The swara sahityam is sung only in slow tempo. The kriti starts with a unique phrase, gnddp . The composer has incorporated swaraksharams as observed in the swara sahityam. Both the phrases — gmds and dps — have been woven into this Purvikalyani tapestry. I learnt this from the legendary T. Muktha in the Veena Dhanammal style. Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar is known for his compositions on Devi and my favourite is, ‘Ni padamula’, in Natabhairavi. The composition starts with swarakasharam ni pa da . The very first phrase establishes the Natabhairavi raga in which we do not find many kritis. This one is fragrant with pure Natabhairavi notes and swarupa. A charming composition with a myriad possibilities for inspirational manodharma. The kriti is in praise of goddess Kantimati and has the raga mudra excellently incorporated as an epithet in the charanam. The madhyamakala of the composition facilitates niraval singing especially in the anupallavi, ‘Gopala sodari gowri’. Another favourite Devi kriti of mine, composed by Papanasam Sivan, is ‘Unnai allal’ in Kalyani. I particularly like the sahityam and the way he has used the raga to convey the emotion. How often do we hear a composition in Nayaki on the Nayaki of the universe? Well, Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri has composed one, set to Rupaka tala. I had the privilege of learning this from T.R. Vaitheeswaran, Viswanatha Sastri’s brother. The pallavi line establishes the raga amazingly. This composition is in praise of goddess Meenakshi. In the charanam, the composer has used gamakam ornamentation with the word ‘Pankaja’. For example, pankaja pada means lotus feet, pankajodbhava — brahma, panjakasana — lakshmi. The madhyamakala sahityam in the charanam flows with Nayaki phrases and also the raga mudra. These are just nine from among the numerous beautiful compositions on Devi. These are the ones that I have always felt a connection with.  The author is a well-known Carnatic vocalist.   Tiruvarur Ramaswami Pillai has composed only a handful of compositions, but each is a gem.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The voice that heralds the festival||When Mahalaya mornings dawned sharp and bright, there was no way one could escape the harbinger of the pujas, not if you lived in Kolkata at any rate. Across buildings and streets, the sonorous voice of Birendra Krishna Bhadra intoning the story of Durga’s arrival on earth and her killing of the demon Mahishasura would float along on sunbeams and permeate homes and indeed our very bodies as we lay asleep. So popular was Bhadra’s rendition that till today no other music heralds the launch of the lunar fortnight of Devi Paksha except his, broadcast faithfully by All India Radio each year and holding its listeners captive for the 90 minutes of its duration; now AIR’s oldest airing. Of course, no longer is the transistor or radio the medium of the music; one has switched to pods and phones to air it, but it is still the original ‘Mahishasura Mardini’ programme created by AIR in 1931 that generates that indefinable air of the pujas having arrived. It’s as if the official bugle has been blown to begin celebrations, not that Indians need an excuse. The metaphor of the bugle is actually rather literal — the broadcast begins with the long, plangent notes of the conch, the auspicious beginning for any event, followed by a few sweet, slow notes of Raag Malkauns, before Bhadra’s voice, with its famous tremolo, takes over. His narration is interspersed with the singing and chanting of various Devi songs and mantras by an accompanying team. First broadcast over Akashvani Calcutta, the programme was scripted by Bani Kumar or Baidyonath Bhattacharya, a long-standing playwright-composer for AIR; and its music composed by the famous composer-playback singer Pankaj Kumar Mallik. Chanting the Chandipath The radio programme, which has since been translated into Hindi, used to be transmitted live in the initial years. In 1966, a recorded version was created, and it is this that has been used since. On Mahalaya, almost all of Bengal wakes at 4 a.m. and tunes in. One remembers homes where the radio or transistor set was decorated with flowers and smeared with sindoor and a lamp lit at dawn to usher in the programme, as Durga was imagined entering homes borne gently on the sound waves. On the street where we lived, named after Maharaja Nandakumar, a revenue officer who was hanged by the British in what was possibly India’s first ‘judicial murder’, the buildings were set close to each other, so close in fact that we could throw secret notes weighed with pebbles into the balcony of our friends next door. Each flat would vie to produce the most son et lumiere during festivals, but we were all beaten hollow by the sheer volume that emanated from the first-floor flat opposite us. We woke each morning to the loud notes of Rabindra Sangeet and each Mahalaya to Bhadra’s voice, radiating so crystal clear into our home that we had no need to switch our own radio on. Bhadra, playwright, actor and radio narrator, was blessed with a tremendous voice and his abiding legacy is this Mahalaya broadcast; he died in 1991 aged 86. At the core of the programme is Bhadra’s recitation of the ‘Chandipath’, the Sanskrit verses written in praise of Durga in Chapter 5 of the text called Devi Mahatmyam , estimated to have been composed between the fourth and sixth centuries CE and incorporated within the Markandeya Purana . It is considered one of the most important texts associated with the worship of Devi or Shakti, and describes the fierce, angry, feminine aspect of the creator in some of the most exquisite Sanskrit poetry. In various iterations the Devi is invoked — ‘Ya devi sarvabhuteshu’ — and described as abiding in all beings as sentience, intellect, hunger, thirst and sleep, as energy, peace and faith, as courage and morality. The programme includes ‘Aigiri Nandini’, the Durga verses popularly attributed to Adi Shankaracharya and an important part of Navaratri celebrations in the South. The broadcast has seeped itself into public consciousness so deeply and is so closely identified with the pujas that none of its components can be altered. In 1976, AIR tried replacing Bhadra with the hugely popular Bengali filmstar, Uttam Kumar. As beloved as he was, audiences rejected him completely; Bhadra had to be brought back. And the Mahalaya tradition continued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-voice-that-heralds-the-festival/article36889471.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||To the sound of the charka||The cool breeze and the mild rays of the morning sun welcomed music-lovers as they walked into the MCG open-air amphitheatre in Gurugram to discover the ‘Music of Charkha’. The concert, organised by Kalagram in association with the Haryana government and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, featured Hindustani vocalist Rama Sundar Ranganathan alongside veteran Gandhian Vinod Kumar Handa (who turned 91 on October 2) and Kamaljeet Sangwan from Gandhi Hindustani Sahitya Sabhaon spinning the charkha. The unique concert explored both the sound of the charkha and the beauty of morning ragas. Rama, a Grade ‘A’ artiste of AIR and Doordarshan, initially trained in Carnatic music before pursuing Hindustani music under Shanti Sharma of the Indore Gharana. She was further trained by Pt. Tejpal Singh, a foremost disciple of Ustad Amir Khan, the founder of the gharana. Introducing the theme of the concert, Rama explained the importance of the 11 vows that Gandhi used, like Satya, Ahimsa, Asteya, Aparigraha, etc., to guide him through life and how music and the charkha were integral to his philosophy. The time was just perfect for Gujari Todi, when Rama created the serene atmosphere of the raag with a penetrating alap underscoring ‘Satya’, and sang ‘Satyameva Jayate’, composed as a madhya-laya bandish by her guru in Teentaal. This was followed by a Rubaidar tarana in the same raag, composed by Ustad Amir Khan with a Persian rubai (stanza) in antara (the second half of the composition) describing the essence of Sufism, quite similar to the theme of the concert. Accompanied by Pt. Bharat Bhushan Goswami on the sarangi and on the tabla by Akhtar Hasan, Rama displayed her prowess while elaborating the bandish, ‘Satyameva Jayate’, with behelawas, bol-badhat, sargams and adorning even the tarana with sargam and aakar taans. She explored ‘Ahimsa’ and the other vows through several raags and rendered them with warmth and appeal. During the course of the concert, she also touched upon aspects that inspired the Mahatma, for for instance, Thirukkural by Thiruvalluvar. Rama then rendered ‘Maithreem bhajata’ in Ragamalika. The last line of the song, ‘Shreyo bhooyaath sakala janaanaam’, conveys the message that when one looks at others as oneself, ‘Atmavadeva paraanapi pashyata’, there will be no violence. The Kabir bhajan, ‘Awwal Allah noor upaya, kudrat ke sab bande’ came next, composed by her guru in the sonorous swars of Hemant, and Rama reached the taar madhyam effortlessly. This was followed by Kamaljeet Sangwan talking about how the charkha not only provides occupation to many but is also a tool for meditation. Rama took over with the Kafi of Bulle Shah with a metaphor of charkha and the original version of ‘Raghupati Raghava Rajaram’ written by Lakshmanacharya. She thoughtfully wove it with ‘Naadopasana’ composed by Pt. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar in raag Jaijaiwanti. To mark the 75th year of Independence, Rama concluded with the Sanskrit shloka ‘Namami Dharani Mataram’ and ‘Vande mataram’ in raag Desh.  The Delhi-based author writes on classical music.   The unique Gandhi Jayanti concert explored both the sound of the charkha and the beauty of morning ragas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/to-the-sound-of-the-charka/article36889480.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The emotions of Rumi||This Pale is an Indo-Persian ensemble that musically interprets the poetry of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi. Grammy-nominated sitarist and composer Shujaat Husain Khan has collaborated with Iranian-American vocalist Katayoun Goudarzi for this six-track album that also features the Iranian ney (wind instrument used in Middle Eatsern music) artiste Shaho Andalibi and Shariq Mustafa, the fifth generation tabla player of the Thirakwa lineage. While Shujaat Khan conveys the essence of Rumi’s immersive verses through his sitar strings, Katayoun sings in Farsi to communicate the inherent emotions of Rumi’s poetry. “The 15th century poet is as relevant today. Though we chose parts of his ghazals that we felt would be perfect for a musical arrangement, none of the poems have been modified,” says Khatayoun. According to Shujaat, it was a challenge to bring out this album during the pandemic as everyone worked from different parts of the world. Having worked with Katayoun many times in the past , Shujaat talks about the comfort and understanding in their partnership. “We met a few years ago, when she toured India with her band. I realised she has a certain way of expression and Farsi comes naturally to her. Normally when musicians collaborate, they have their own vision. For This Pale, I had complete freedom as far as music composition is concerned. I create the tunes, she lends expression.” Having said that, Shujaat says he does not chase collaborations. “If it happens naturally, it’s fine.” Bonding over poetry Their love for poetry has been the starting point of all their projects. “Shujaat had heard some of my songs and liked it. So we decided to try working together. In the process, we became good friends and every performance has been a delightful experience,” says Katayoun. In all the tracks, Katayoun’s voice and Shujaat’s sitar gather an indefectible sound from the ney and tabla, leading to an effective synergy. “ It happens when there is mutual respect. Being the oldest in the team, they let me lead the music, though they are all exceptional musicians in their own right,” says Shujaat. A collaboration like this could inspire younger musicians. However, Katayoun has a word of advice for those wanting to be part of cross-genre exercises: “A strong foundation in one’s art is a must. Also, a good understanding of the culture one is born and raised in.” Shujaaat agrees: “Young musicians should first establish themselves as solo performers before experimenting with collaborations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-emotions-of-rumi/article36889502.ece

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A bandish in Sanskrit||The strains of the tanpura gently mingle with the air of unassuming confidence that vocalist Subhadra Desai carries. As she closes her eyes to enter a meditative state, the audience is invited to witness the interiority that defines her music. A melodious voice matched with rigorous training, each syllable is enunciated with clarity and precision. The notes of raga Chhayanat stir to life, and while the listener may expect a regular traditional bandish, there is a surprise in store. The lyrics of the composition are not in the usual Braj Bhasha, Awadhi or Hindustani, but in Sanskrit — with a verse woven seamlessly into the raag framework. “Sanskrit is not just a language, or associated only with dharma, it encompasses literature, arts, mathematics, science and various philosophical traditions,” says Subhadra, who also has a Ph.D in Sanskrit. She has delved into ancient Sanskrit texts and medieval Bhakti poetry to offer new interpretations within khayal music. Unique confluence Sharing the childhood memories that fuelled this innovation, she says, “At home there were always discussions around music, literature and spirituality. My mother used to teach Bangla literature and as a child I used to dream of becoming a professor of Sanskrit,” says Subhadra. She trained in Hindustani music, and at age 12, became a student of Madhup Mudgal at Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in Delhi. Later, she began researching Vedic chanting, and started to imagine new ways of musically interpreting various shlokas. “Only the three basic notes are used in Vedic chanting, or a shloka is sung as an invocatory prelude in a Hindustani concert, without the taal. But I wanted to understand the possibilities of a confluence with khayal music.” Explaining the intricacies of singing Sanskrit verses, she says, “The most important thing in terms of technique is to get the pronunciation correct, and there should be no grammatical errors. For instance, breaking up a seemingly long word to accommodate it into the rhythm may change its meaning. The language has a certain flow and that has to match with the music.” Composing a Sanskrit shloka in the khayal style was a challenging task. While the raag must compliment the literary sub-text, moulding it within a taal cycle was equally daunting. “There were times when I would sit with a shloka for days, trying different musical structures, understanding the bhava of the words. There must be synergy between sahitya, swaar and taal.” Recalling one of her earliest attempts at giving a khayal dimension to an 8th century devotional composition by Adi Shankaracharya, ‘Niravana Shatakam’ consisting of six Sanskrit verses, she says, “I composed it in Shree raag, and set it jhaptaal.” On women seers During her research, Subhadra also discovered that there is a mention of over 27 rishikas (women saints), who have remained unsung. After a concert based on their works, she travelled across the country collecting compositions of women saints. “We only know of Meera, Lal Ded, Andal, Akka Mahadevi, and a few others. But there are more than 75 women saints who have contributed immensely to bhakti sangeet. Subhadra’s research culminated in a book titled Indian Women Seers and their Songs: The Unfettered Note in 2017 that transformed her devotional music repertoire. “They have expressed their emotions so fiercely in the songs that I was intrigued about how the compositions must have been sung.” Combining her research with imaginative musicianship, Subhadra’s artistic quest touches upon philosophy, spirituality, literature and ragas. “Just like raag and swaar make us antarmukhi (inward-looking), Sanskrit texts also inspire us to explore our inner worlds,” she says.  The author is a Delhi-based arts researcher and writer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-bandish-in-sanskrit/article36889506.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The beads of breath||The philosophical depth of Baul songs combined with Parvathy’s infectious energy created an electric atmosphere at an event organised by Emami Art in Kolkata on September 25. Playing the iktara and the duggi, with her Radha-Krishna paintings in the background (she studied fine arts at Viswa Bharati University), the singer soared to the highest realms of her music. She jumped and twirled as if entering into a trance-like state, while the audience was transported to the soft plains of riverine Bengal and to Birbhum, the land of red soil. The tunes the Bauls sing have stirred the souls of the people of this region for centuries. Parvathy Baul began the performance by blowing the conch and talking about emerging from a long period of isolation. “This is not just a performance, it is an auspicious moment when I am back again amidst my rasikas,” she said. Born as Mousumi Parial in a privileged caste Bengali family, she assumed her new name when she was ordained as a Baul. The Baul tradition is a philosophy and way of life, showcased through songs by the poet-singers. They are mentioned in literary works dating to the 15th century. A mix of Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi and Tantric philosophies, the Baul tradition has strongly influenced Bengal’s culture. Parvathy’s first tryst with the musical form was on a train, where she met a blind singer. She was intrigued by the way he seemed lost in a world of his own. Soon she embarked on a journey of knowing the self by taking lessons from different gurus and through the practice of madhukori (seeking alms singing on trains). Eventually, she found the right guru in Sanatan Das Baul, in whose ashram she set out on her path of devotion. Following her guru’s advice, Parvathy set up Sanatan Siddhashram, a gurukul for Bauls, in Birbhum district in 2019. She now divides her time between Bengal and Kerala, where she has been working with her husband Ravi Gopalan Nair, a theatre artiste and puppeteer, for over two decades in spreading the Baul ideology through their organisation, Ekathara Kalari. Baul is fluid and agnostic to categories like religion. The same singer might move from a devotional song about Shiva to one by Lalan Fakir. Parvathy’s performance reflected this as she moved from song to song seamlessly and in no specific order. Song on true devotion “I usually don’t decide beforehand which songs I will sing. I prefer them to flow naturally,” she said at the event. Parvathy opened her performance with a song by Gopal Khyapa, who lived centuries ago in what is now Murshidabad district. She also rendered a song on true devotion composed by Sanatan Das Baul: ‘Kather malay kaaj hobe na, swasher mala jopte hobe’ (wooden beads won’t work, pray with the beads of your breath. The lockdown gave her time to delve deeper into the art. “Music is sadhana (devotion). A song composed by Panju Shah, a fakir from Bangladesh, says, aadhar chand mile murshid aadharo ghuchale (when darkness dissipates, one can see the unattainable inner moon). This was the first song I sang when I re-entered the stage after the lockdown,” said Parvathy. She closed the performance with a song on Durga.  The writer is an independent journalist based in Kolkata.   Parvathy’s first tryst with the musical form was on a train, where she met a blind singer.

08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Navaratri at Suguna Vilasa Sabha||Pammal Sambanda Mudaliar is considered one of the founding fathers of Tamil theatre. Born on February 1, 1873, he developed a flair for English and Tamil literature at an early age, influenced by his father Vijayaranga Mudaliar, who worked in the government Education Department. Pammal Sambanda qualified as a lawyer in 1897 and enrolled as an advocate in the Madras High Court. Interestingly, for a man who introduced many novel ideas to Tamil theatre, he began by disliking vernacular theatre, considering it crude and obscene. It was a visit in 1891 to a performance by Sarasa Vinoda Sabha, run by the then noted stage actor Bellary Krishnamacharlu that changed his opinion, and he went on to establish Suguna Vilasa Sabha with a few friends on July 1 that year. Over the course of the next five decades, the group, which made Victoria Public Hall its home, became one of the foremost in Tamil theatre, and Sambanda Mudaliar, its most reverential figure. His memoir, Nataka Medai Ninaivugal, is a remarkable account of theatre of the early and mid-20th century. It also mentions the Navaratri celebrations at Suguna Vilasa Sabha that makes for interesting reading. An elaborate celebration Sambanda Mudaliar writes that in 1905 Suguna Vilasa Sabha held for the first time an elaborate Navaratri celebration; before that only Saraswati puja had been celebrated. Interestingly, it was the extensive Vinayaka Chathurti celebration that year that gave him the idea. Sambanda Mudaliar writes that several members brought kolu dolls from their homes for the affair. Daily pujas were performed and the expenses borne by the members. With each year, the number of people partaking in the celebration increased, and to accommodate them a temporary enclosure had to be put up on the southern side of Victoria Public Hall. Even this proved insufficient and a huge tent began to be erected. Over the years, the first floor of the hall was also hired for the festival. From singing devotional songs, soon plays also began to be staged during Navaratri. With the increase in the scale of the celebration, the expenses rose too and it was decided to create member groups to defray them, with members divided based on various criteria such as lawyers, merchants, beri chettis, and arya vysyas. For women and children From 1906, one day was dedicated to women, and the expenses were borne by Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer. From 20-30 women participating in the initial years, Sambanda Mudaliar writes that the numbers crossed a thousand some years later, with Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer still continuing his patronage. With Victoria Public Hall now spilling over, the grounds of the South Indian Athletic Association were also hired. Next, one day was set aside for children, with recitation and singing competitions. This account was written in 1933, the 28th year of the sabha’s Navaratri festivities, making it one of the most important events in its annual calendar. The Sabha moved to its current location in Mount Road around 1935 and today functions as a social club.  The writer is a heritage buff and amateur Tamil theatre artiste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/navaratri-at-suguna-vilasa-sabha/article36889474.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Machine-made tunes||As I write this essay, a rather incredible experiment has happened, which combines data science with music. Beethoven’s unfinished 10th symphony has just been completed, 194 years after the composer wrote it, by an Artificial Intelligence programme as part of an effort at Rutgers University. This sort of development in the world of creativity is critical for two reasons. One, for arguments about how “machines can take over everything but the creative strain and original thought”. Two, for the promise it seems to hold for the directions in which the creation and preservation of culture can go. Coming to the first — that of creativity and the hard-to-articulate human factor, purists have often argued that original thinkers and composers — the Carnatic music Trinity or the Western old masters — are irreplaceable and their works will continue to endure hundreds of years. Their music has convinced us of that, surely, by now. Is it that easy for a machine, which uses past data patterns to construct or simulate where the composer might have gone, to create similar compositions and for those to endure too? Time alone will tell. But it is now becoming possible for AI programmes to replicate frequency and data patterns to a phenomenal degree of aesthetic beauty. The creative intelligence factor, one that has long been held as the sole enclave of human superiority over machines, is one that will need further scrutiny and redefinition. Coming to the second point, certainly this development holds great potential. The harnessing of technology to be able to co-create freely across cultures and geographies (something that got borne out by the pandemic), to use machine learning to add layers or even bits of compositional material to what we do, and the ability to preserve this data for future generations to use — all this just got bigger. At a frenetic pace So where does this leave today’s musician? Somehow, during the pandemic, we are seeing the re-emergence of the old rules. There is a desperate scrambling for share-of-voice, and social media is crammed with musicians who are uploading performative and compositional content at a pace that is too frenetic for anyone to consume all of it reasonably. Everyone is in a hurry to convince audiences that they are still performing, are still relevant — and in so doing, they are unfortunately providing us more of the same. Now, factor in the notion that a machine and an AI programme can possibly create something more palatable, and perhaps at a fraction of the financial and emotional cost of having to deal with people? Where would that leave us? I posit two solutions, and I am happy to argue these with musicians and creators who may think otherwise. For the human creative intelligence to truly achieve its potential, cultural creators will now have to stay humble and agile. They will need to revisit their art in a deeper manner and strive to break their own patterns and search for something inventive that a data prediction mechanism cannot replicate. Just a week ago, Arvo Part, the great minimalist Russian composer, cropped up in a conversation I had with musician Sid Sriram. In a world that was edging towards ornate orchestration, Part aimed at the wholeness of single notes and an almost monastic reverence for silences in his music. This broke the clutter of the time and continues to teach and inspire. Listen to the ballads — the John Legends and the Adeles will continue to impress even after all the clamour dies down for the same reasons — the simplistic beauty of melody with minimal orchestration and noise. Unfortunately, we are in the midst of a sound pandemic where clutter is deemed more trendy. The second solution will be to embrace co-creation and collaboration more freely. With the possibilities that have opened up now, thanks to even musicians in the remotest parts of the world embracing the Internet, this would be a great time to create more work with different flavours, while striving to strike a distinctive note. I am by no means saying that the era of the individual creator is over. I am actually arguing for the opposite, though with caveats. Unless we understand what it truly means to break predictability, outdo ourselves in our ability to be inventive, an AI programme does run the advantage of beating us at this game. So, yes, creative intelligence is still very much the human advantage. But the bar has just been raised higher.  The author is a pianist and   music educator based in Chennai.      Unless we understand what it truly means to break predictability, an AI programme does run the advantage of beating us at this game||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/machine-made-tunes/article36889497.ece
08 October 2021||October 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A well-etched Thodi||The flute concert by Sikkil Mala Chandrasekhar, which was premiered on YouTube by Naada Inbam, was a wholesome treat, but strictly traditional. Mala began her concert with the Kanada varnam ‘Ninne kori’ by Thiruvotriyur Thyagayyar. ‘Vathapi Ganapathim bhajaeham’ in Hamsadhwani, one of the series of Shodasha Ganapathy kritis by Muthuswami Dikshitar, set the background for a spirited fare. This kriti propitiates the Ganesha who is worshipped at a shrine in the Thiruchenkattankudi Uthrapathiswaraswamy temple dedicated to Shiva. M.R. Gopinath followed her closely on the violin, adding sheen to her silky notes, showcasing his prowess during the alapana and swara repartees. Steeped in bhakti ‘Padavini sadbhakthi’ by Tyagaraja in Salaka Bhairavi followed next, in which the saint talks about the futility of social status if one does not understand the nature of Rama. Syama Sastri’s devout kriti pleading for mercy, ‘Dayajooda manchi samayamidhe’, on Brihadamba of Thanjavur, in Jaganmohini was full of karuna rasa. After paying due respect to the Trinity, she presented Maharaja Swati Tirunal’s ‘Saevae srikantham’ in Mohanakalyani with a crisp alapana and sprightly swaras. The centre piece was Tyagaraja’s ‘Kaddanuvariki’ in Thodi. The raga appeared in all its elegance as Mala elaborated its swarupa layer by layer, ably supported by the violinist. In the kriti, which was presented with well-etched ornamentation, the composer yearns to see the face of his favourite deity ( Athambu chekkillache muthugaru momu chooda ). Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar on the mridangam and H. Prasanna on the ghatam laid a strong laya foundation and dazzled during the thani. The later songs, ‘Karpooram narumo’ by Andal and ‘Pibarae Ramarasam’ by Sadasiva Brahmendral carried great spiritual beauty and depth. Veena Seshanna’s ‘Chenchurutti’ thillana and ‘Maithreem Bhajatha’ gave the concert a thoroughly gratifying conclusion.

08 October 2021||New Delhi,||Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction to decide matter on merits: SC||The Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction to decide the matter on merits once it is found that compromise or settlement could not be reached between the parties, the Supreme Court said on Thursday. The apex court said the provisions of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 make it clear that the jurisdiction of the Lok Adalat would be to determine and to arrive at a compromise or a settlement between the parties to a dispute. It said that once the settlement or a compromise fails, the Lok Adalat has to return the case to the Court from which the reference has been received for disposal in accordance with the law. “The Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction at all to decide the matter on merits once it is found that compromise or settlement could not be reached between the parties,” a Bench of Justices M.R. Shah and A.S. Bopanna said. The judgement was passed on an appeal filed by the Estate Officer challenging the 2013 order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court by which in a Lok Adalat, the members of the Lok Adalat had entered into the merits of the writ petition and had dismissed the case on merits. The apex court said the order passed by the Lok Adalat dismissing the writ petition on merits is unsustainable and deserves to be quashed and set aside. Argument rejected It rejected the argument that once the matter was placed before the Lok Adalat with consent, it was justified in disposing of the matter on merits. “The consent to place the matter before the Lok Adalat was to arrive at a settlement and or a compromise between the parties and not for placing the matter before the Lok Adalat for deciding the matter on merits,” the Bench said. “Once there is no compromise and/or a settlement between the parties before the Lok Adalat, as provided in sub-section (5) of Section 20 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, the matter has to be returned to the Court from where the matter was referred to Lok Adalat for deciding the matter on merits by the concerned court,” the Bench further added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lok-adalat-has-no-jurisdiction-to-decide-matter-on-merits-sc/article36890100.ece
08 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||To flex its muscles, BJP eyeing majority mark in Assam bypoll||For the BJP, Assembly elections in Assam have been about achieving targets — “mission 84” in 2016 and “mission 100+” in 2021 — along with its regional allies. But its primary objective has been to attain the simple majority mark in the 126-member House, factoring in at least 35 Assembly seats where Muslim voters are dominant or are in large enough numbers to be the deciding factor. The by-elections to five Assembly seats on October 30, and a sixth soon after, could take the BJP closer to scoring 64 seats, which would lessen its dependence on its regional allies, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL). The BJP is contesting three of the five seats, leaving Gossaigaon and Tamulpur in the Bodoland Territorial Region to the UPPL. For the first time, all candidates of the BJP are turncoats. Phanidhar Talukdar has been fielded from the Bhabanipur seat that he won for the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) while Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain had won the Mariani and Thowra seats, respectively, as Congress candidates six months ago. The BJP had won 60 seats in the March-April Assembly polls but is down to 59 after the resignation of former Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who became a Rajya Sabha member. If all its three candidates win the bypolls, the party’s tally will be 62, short of the simple majority mark by two. Challenge for Congress The BJP is confident of the ruling alliance sweeping the five seats. The party is also upbeat about bagging Majuli, particularly after the Congress decided to let the Assam Jatiya Parishad contest the seat. “There are no reasons why the people will not vote for our candidates, who have a sizeable support base,” the BJP’s State unit president Bhabesh Kalita said. There are speculations that the Congress gave up the Majuli seat because Rajib Lochan Pegu, its best bet and candidate for the last two Assembly elections against Mr. Sonowal, is tipped to join the BJP. The challenge for the Congress would be to retain Mariani and Thowra through its candidates Luhit Konwar and Manoranjan Konwar, respectively. Their loss would leave Congress with only three of some 40 seats in eastern Assam, and there are fears that BJP could target at least one of the three MLAs. Without the AIUDF and the Bodoland People’s Front as its allies unlike in the March-April Assembly polls, the Congress is contesting all five seats while the AIUDF is contesting two (Bhabanipur and Gossaigaon). Activist turned politician Akhil Gogoi’s Raijor Dal is contesting the Mariani and Thowra seats. This could harm the prospects of Congress more than that of the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/to-flex-its-muscles-bjp-eyeing-majority-mark-in-assam-bypoll/article36889934.ece
08 October 2021||Pune,||Religious places open up in Maharashtra||Religious places across Maharashtra opened their doors to devotees on Thursday with several big temple trusts making online booking compulsory to avoid overcrowding. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who, along with his wife Rashmi, and son and State Environment Minister Aaditya, offered prayers at Mumba Devi temple in Mumbai, asked the public to strictly adhere to COVID-19 protocols. “While everyone has a right to enjoy, I urge people to remain safe by heeding pandemic regulations and behave like responsible citizens,” Mr. Thackeray said. The Chief Minister noted that arrangements made by trustees and priests at all religious places across the State were designed to prevent any spread of coronavirus. “With the COVID-19 threat yet to subside, I appreciate the fact that temple authorities have used technology to arrange darshan in temples through e-pass system and QR code scanning,” Mr. Thackeray said. Political battle The opening of temples and other religious places, shut since March last year, had snowballed into a political battle between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition led by Mr. Thackeray and the Opposition BJP and other parties such as Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). In August this year, the BJP had staged Statewide protest demanding the re-opening of temples on grounds that the government gave more importance to the opening of liquor bars than religious places. Symbolically blowing conches in their ‘shankhnaad’ agitation and defying COVID-19 regulations, hundreds of BJP activists and State leaders had participated in protests in key temple town areas in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Solapur districts while throwing pandemic norms to the winds. Last year, just after the first wave, Mr. Ambedkar and other VBA workers had staged an agitation outside the Vitthal-Rukmini temple in Pandharpur (in Solapur district), demanding the re-opening of all religious spots in the State. Meanwhile, all major temples across the State, including the Shirdi Saibaba in Ahmednagar, Pandharpur’s iconic Vitthal Rukmini in Solapur district, Mumbai’s Siddhivinayak Temple and Pune’s Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati, made it mandatory for devotees to book an online slot for worship, while permitting entry of devotees in limited numbers. Police patrol In many cases, double-vaccinated police personnel were seen patrolling temple premises to monitor large crowds thronging outside the gates. The famous Ekvira Devi Temple in Lonavla, perched atop a hill, opened its doors early in the morning with the Pune rural police strictly enforcing Covid protocol by controlling the large crowd of devotees. The temple houses the family deity of the Thackeray family. Policemen were seen monitoring crowds outside the historic Tulja Bhavani temple in Osmanabad district as well. Mumbai’s Siddhivinayak Temple permitted entry to only 250 devotees, who had booked an online slot previously, while putting up large boards detailing COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The Shirdi Saibaba temple has restricted the flow of people to 15,000 while the Vitthal-Rukmini Temple has limited the flow of devotees to 10,000 per day. Deputy Chief Minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who visited Siddhivinayak temple, urged the people to follow norms to ensure that the religious places could remain open in future also. “We have opened all temples and other religious places on the occasion of Navratri with certain conditions to avoid overcrowding. There will be a series of festivals after this, with Deepavali and Christmas not far behind. So, to ensure that this festive atmosphere prevails, people must follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour at all times,” Mr. Pawar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/religious-places-open-up-in-maharashtra/article36890102.ece
08 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI books four ASI officials for illegal NOCs||The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked four Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials for allegedly granting no-objection certificates to Riddhi Siddhi Enterprises for constructions in the regulated/prohibited areas of Kuki Biwiki Masjid and Muqbara (tomb) in Ahmedabad, which have been classified as national monuments. Among those named as accused are Rameshbhai Parmar, partner in the Riddhi Siddhi Enterprises; the then Superintending Archaeologist of the Vadodara circle, Shivananda V. Rao; Ravi Kumar Gautam, then Administrative Officer with the National Monuments Authority (NMA) under the ASI; Conservation Assistant Rajesh Johri; then Senior Conservation Assistant Arifali Agariya; and one Kanubhai Patel. The agency had instituted a preliminary enquiry into the allegations about a year ago, following a complaint from the NMA Member Secretary. The NMA, constituted under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, has the mandate to grant NOCs for undertaking construction by any person in the regulated areas of the centrally protected monuments. ‘Guidelines violated’ It was alleged that construction was allowed in the regulated/prohibited areas in violation of the guidelines and that authenticity of the papers provided with respect to the previous NOCs and extensions was also under suspicion. The related files could not be traced. According to the First Information Report, in January 2006, Rustam Mills & Industries Limited, partner of Riddhi Siddhi Enterprises, had applied for an NOC for the reconstruction of four blocks of industrial sheds. The office of Superintending Archaeologist, Vadodara, allowed it as the proposed construction was in the regulated area. Riddhi Siddhi Enterprises then applied for reconstruction of five blocks of a commercial building in April 2006. The NOC was refused, after which it requested that its representation be forwarded to the ASI Director-General, who approved it with certain conditions. In 2007, the company handed over some part of the land falling in the prohibited area to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cbi-books-four-asi-officials-for-illegal-nocs/article36890105.ece
08 October 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan Congress protests at U.P. border||The Congress party workers, led by Rajasthan unit president Govind Singh Dotasra, staged a massive demonstration at Bharatpur district’s Uncha Nagla village near the border with Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. The agitation was in protest against the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, in which eight persons were killed. The demonstrators raised slogans and burnt an effigy. The protesters had earlier planned to cross the inter-State border, march towards Lakhimpur Kheri and court arrest if stopped, but the plan was dropped at the last moment. Mr. Dotasra said since the U.P. government had released Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra after her detention, the march had been withdrawn. Mr. Dotasra said the “misbehaviour” of the U.P. police with Ms. Vadra, who wanted to meet the families of victims, was condemnable. “We have expressed our solidarity with the farmers who should get justice. There is a complete anarchy in Uttar Pradesh,” he said, while addressing the gathering. The Pradesh Congress president said the farmers had been agitating for the last 10 months against the Centre’s agriculture laws, but the top leaders of the BJP government at the Centre had no time or inclination to meet them. “Neither a farmer leader nor any political party had sought the enactment of these laws. Why were they brought in?” he asked. The party’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi and Deeg-Kumher MLA Vishvendra Singh were among the party leaders present at the demonstration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-congress-protests-at-up-border/article36890167.ece
08 October 2021||JAIPUR,||Yatra highlights indigenous tribal practices||A unique campaign launched in the tribal-dominated Banswara and Dungarpur districts of southern Rajasthan has laid emphasis on the protection of indigenous tribal practices, natural heritage and the local tribal population’s enormous storehouse of knowledge on food gathering, shifting hill cultivation, pastoralism and handicrafts. The villagers in the region, faced with the challenge of sustaining themselves during the pandemic, have joined the movement for promoting nutrition-sensitive farming system aimed at reducing the tribals’ vulnerability and ensuring food security through their own resource management. The priority areas of the drive are forestry, pasture, animal husbandry and seeds. The two districts, situated at the tri-junction of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, are rich in natural resources and have abundant edible materials that are nutritious for the local population. As part of their daily dietary intake, the tribals have been consuming a number of micronutrient-rich plant food. A ‘Heritage Swaraj Yatra’, started from Banswara on Gandhi Jayanti last week, is generating awareness on the tribals’ “inalienable right” on natural resources and has depicted the tribal farmers as resource-savers and resource-keepers of the country. The march has highlighted the tribals as a unique cultural and social entity who could define their own food and agriculture systems. Waterman’s support The yatra has received support from noted environmentalist and Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh, who flagged it off from the precincts of Banswara’s voluntary group Vaagdhara, which works on the tribal livelihood issues. Mr. Singh, popularly known as “Waterman of India”, said the preservation of natural heritage was a huge challenge when the rural population was migrating to cities in the name of development. ‘True companions’ Sarvodaya thinker Asha Bothra said Mahatma Gandhi’s swaraj could be achieved in the true sense through satyagraha for protecting the country’s legacy. “The tribal communities of southern Rajasthan are the true companions of swaraj because they have painstakingly saved their natural resources since time immemorial,” she said. Vaagdhara secretary Jayesh Joshi told The Hindu on Thursday that the government’s ongoing programmes for uplifting tribals had undervalued their contributions and practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/yatra-highlights-indigenous-tribal-practices/article36890104.ece
08 October 2021||Chandigarh,||Sidhu leads protest march to Lakhimpur Kheri||Punjab Congress Chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has demanded the arrest of Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra's son in connection with the death of farmers during violence in Uttar Pradesh, saying he would go on hunger strike if action is not taken against him by Friday. Union Minister of State for Home Mishra’s son has been booked for allegedly mowing down four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday. However, Mr.Mishra has denied allegations about his son’s involvement in the case. Mr. Sidhu on Thursday led a protest march from Punjab to Lakhimpur Kheri in protest against the killing of farmers. A large number of party leaders including Ministers, legislators and workers first assembled at Mohali here and then headed towards Lakhimpur Kheri in their vehicles. CM joins march Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi also joined Mr. Sidhu for a brief period when the march was about to start. Mr. Sidhu had resigned from the post of Punjab Congress chief on September 28 but it wasn’t immediately clear if the resignation was withdrawn.  U.P. govt. flayed Before the protest march Thursday, he slammed the BJP-led government in U.P. over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Mr. Sidhu said Punjab Congress and party MLAs are standing firmly with the farmers. He asked why U.P. authorities hadn’t taken action against Mr. Mishra’s son even after an FIR was lodged in the matter. “Are Union Minister and his son above the law and constitution?” he asked. “This fight is for our farmers,” he said, adding: “If U.P. police do not arrest the Union Minister's son, I will go on hunger strike. It is my ‘vachan’ (promise).” Mr. Sidhu called Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi “saviours of democracy.” Earlier, Punjab Congress working president Sukhwinder Singh Danny said they would stage a sit-in wherever they were stopped from heading towards Lakhimpur Kheri. Congress legislator Sunder Sham Arora said they were ready for courting arrest if prevented from going to U.P.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sidhu-leads-protest-march-to-lakhimpur-kheri/article36890098.ece

08 October 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra launches mega vaccination drive||In keeping with the Centre’s target to administer 100-crore COVID-19 vaccine doses till Dasara on October 15, the Maharashtra government will be holding a mega-vaccination drive from October 8 to 14 with the aim of providing jabs for 15 lakh people daily during this period, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on October 7. Unveiling the drive ‘Mission Kavach Kundal’, he said that thus far, 65% of the State’s eligible vaccine population (a little over 9 crore) had received the first dose while 30% had taken both doses. “We plan to vaccinate 15 lakh persons every day in this drive. We have a sufficient vaccine stock of one crore doses to achieve this… while speaking to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, the Minister said that it was his expectation that Maharashtra must play a major role in achieving the 100 crore-vaccination target,” Mr. Tope said. The Health Minister said that of the roughly 9.15 crore people eligible to be vaccinated in the State, 6 crore had been given the first dose while 2.5 crore persons had taken both doses. “As a result, Maharashtra today has opened up almost every establishment including religious places. Given the scale of our vaccination, even if someone does get infected in the future, the severity will be less, and there will not be a panic demand for ICU beds or oxygen requirement. The fatalities, too, will be controlled as a result,” Mr. Tope said, remarking that there were still some sections of society which demanded the involvement of community and religious leaders in order to expedite the pace of vaccination. Commenting on ‘Mission Kavach Kundal’, the Health Minister further said that he had a meeting with all District Collectors and Divisional Commissioners and stressed on the pressing need to work at an enhanced pace to complete as many vaccinations as possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maharashtra-launches-mega-vaccination-drive/article36889936.ece

Biren on Thursday said the government would take steps to reopen schools and colleges once the COVID-19 situation eased. The recovery rate was hovering between 5 and 6% and experts had said it was not advisable to reopen the schools now at this stage, he noted. Schools have been closed since the beginning of the pandemic. However, some are conducting online classes. In some cases, students are given 100% promotion, thereby creating problems in admission to colleges. There was a heavy demand for admission to colleges. Thousands of parents have been forced to stand in queue for the whole night to seek admission for their wards in colleges. They wanted the government to evolve a mechanism for smooth conduct of admissions instead of the first come, first served basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/schools-after-virus-situation-improves/article36890097.ece
