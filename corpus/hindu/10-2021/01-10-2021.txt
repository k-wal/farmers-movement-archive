01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Amarinder says he is leaving Congress, but not joining BJP||Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd.) on Thursday made it clear that he would be leaving the Congress as he felt “humiliated” by the leadership that had replaced him with Charanjeet Singh Channi. He more or less ruled out joining the BJP as well, despite his much-talked about meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday. ‘Won’t take such insults’ “I will resign... will not stay in the party,” he said in a statement, and that he was still thinking through his options in the interest of Punjab and its security. “I will not be treated in this humiliating manner... I will not take such insults,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that his “principles and beliefs do not allow him to stay in the Congress”. Later, after landing in Chandigarh, Capt. Singh asserted that “Sidhu is not the right man to lead Punjab and if he contests, I will not let him win.” Capt. Singh met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Thursday morning, where he said he talked about the security situation in the sensitive border State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amarinder-says-he-is-leaving-congress-but-not-joining-bjp/article36768341.ece
01 October 2021||New Delhi,||CWC meet soon, says Cong.||A day after the Congress’s group of 23 (G-23) dissenting senior leaders demanded a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party on Thursday announced that a meeting of the party’s highest body would take place soon. “Before leaving for Shimla, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had already indicated that a CWC meeting shall be called very soon, and it will happen in the coming days,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told The Hindu without specifying a date. Following the unravelling crisis in Punjab on Wednesday, at an explosive press conference, senior leader Kapil Sibal had asked, “Who is taking decisions in our party as we don’t have a president?” His colleague and former Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi had written a fresh letter to Ms. Gandhi, demanding the CWC to debate the turmoil within and desertions from the Congress. On Thursday, the divide between G-23 and loyalists of the Gandhi family played out on social media as a number of G-23 leaders targeted the party leadership for the hooliganism outside Mr. Sibal’s residence after his press conference. Lok Sabha MP Manish Tewari called the protests by Youth Congress members a “command performance”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cwc-meet-soon-says-cong/article36768334.ece
01 October 2021||Kolkata/New Delhi,||Bhabanipur byelection sees low voter turnout||The Thursday bypoll in the Bhabanipur Assembly constituency in West Bengal, which Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting, saw a relatively low voter turnout amidst isolated disturbances, while byelections to two other seats in the State and to the Pipili Assembly seat in Odisha saw a higher turnout. Till 5 p.m., about 53.32% voters had exercised their franchise in Bhabanipur, compared to 76.12% in Jangipur and 78.6% at Samserganj, where, along with Pipili, elections were adjourned due to the death of candidates during the Assembly poll in April. There were no major incidents of violence in any of the three West Bengal constituencies. In Pipili, 68.4% voter turnout was recorded till 5 p.m., according to Election Commission of India data. Odisha Chief Electoral Officer S.K. Lohani said there had been no untoward incident, and that polling had been peaceful. Results on Oct. 3 The results of the four elections will be out on October 3. The Bhabanipur bypoll is crucial as Ms. Banerjee had lost the election from Nandigram in May. She had six months from taking office to get elected to the Assembly in order to retain her post. Bhabanipur, an urban constituency in south Kolkata, has voters from different communities and religions. Ms. Banerjee, who is also a voter of the constituency, cast her vote at Mitra Institution in the afternoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bhabanipur-byelection-sees-low-voter-turnout/article36768338.ece

01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘LAC incidents will go on till pact is signed’||Developments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh have added to the ongoing legacy challenges on India’s active and disputed borders on the western and eastern front, Chief of the Army Staff General Manoj Naravane said on Thursday. According to him, such incidents will continue till such time a long-term solution is reached, which is to have a boundary agreement. “The unprecedented developments necessitated largescale resource mobilisation, orchestration of forces and immediate response, all this in a COVID-19 infested environment,” he stated, referring to the stand-off with China last May. Speaking at the annual session of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Gen. Naravane said, “We are well prepared to meet any misadventure... Such kinds of incidents will continue to occur till such time a long-term solution is reached — that is to have a boundary agreement. That should be the thrust of our efforts so that we have lasting peace on our northern borders.” Referring to issues in defence procurement, he observed that with the cycle of new and disruptive technologies getting shorter and faster, avoiding technological obsolescence remained a big challenge. “The danger that our long-drawn procurement processes and bureaucratic speed-breakers would prevent us from acquiring cutting edge technology is a real one,” he pointed out. Much work had been done to bring about systemic changes with the aim of ease of doing business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lac-incidents-will-go-on-till-pact-is-signed/article36768333.ece
01 October 2021||Mangaluru,||MCC to seek govt. nod to reduce domestic water tariff||The Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) will propose to the State government to reduce water tariff for domestic purposes, said Mayor Premanand Shetty here on Thursday. During the ordinary meeting of the MCC Council, Mr. Shetty said following concerns of councillors in the earlier meetings over the increase in the water tariff, he took up the matter with the director of Directorate of Municipal Administration. Mr. Shetty said he has told the director that the tariff structure in force since 2019 is as per the formula prescribed by State government in 2011. This tariff puts burden on domestic consumers and hence needs to be revised. With the proposed revised tariff, the residential houses will pay less while commercial and non-residential buildings will be paying more. The revised tariff will not affect the overall revenue from water supply. ‘Writing letter’ “The director has asked us to submit the comparative chart of the two tariff structure, which can be placed before the Urban Development Department for approval of the revised tariff structure. We are writing the letter in this regard,” Mr. Shetty said, and added earnest efforts are being made to answer people’s concerns about water bills. The Mayor further said steps are being taken to make changes in the water bill software to incorporate tariff for defective water meters and issue correct bills. On the delayed execution of the Jalasiri 24-hour water supply scheme in the city, the Mayor said the executing agency has been asked to complete works by this December in areas covered by the water reservoirs of Bendoorwell and Padil. Agreeing with councillor Naveen D’Souza about the elaborate procedure involved in issuance of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) certificates, the Mayor said the State government has recently brought changes and this will speed up the process. When a councillor pointed to delay in online issuance of trade licenses, MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said the problem with the local server was being resolved. Steps were being taken to resolve issues, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mcc-to-seek-govt-nod-to-reduce-domestic-water-tariff/article36768820.ece

A Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul stated that the issue could be resolved either through Parliament debates or in the judicial forum but the blocking of highways, inconveniencing commuters, could not go on perpetually. Noida resident’s plea The court was hearing a petition filed by Noida resident Monica Agarwal, who highlighted that the blocks caused by the protests had turned her daily commute between Noida and Delhi into a nightmare. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta noted that the farmers were refusing to participate in talks before a high-level committee. Sections of highways had become inaccessible due to their protests.

The need of the hour was to give the two-dose vaccination protection against COVID-19 to the entire adult population. “The talk of a booster dose is not pertinent at the moment.

The Union Health Ministry stated that 69% of the adult population had received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination, while 25% had been given complete coverage of two doses. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan observed, “We have seen slow uptake of the second dose in some States and the Ministry has spoken to them about this. We also would like healthcare workers covered completely. As festivals are approaching, we appeal to all persons to avoid crowds, maintain physical distancing and use masks. Celebrate festivals maintaining COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.” Dr. Bhargava emphasised that it would be prudent to avoid non-essential travel and observe festivities at a low key at least this year. Dengue vaccine Developing a dengue vaccine is an important agenda for India, Dr. Bhargava said. He said that certain dengue strains for clinical trials had been licensed to some companies in India. “Many of these companies have done their phase one trials abroad. We are planning to do more rigorous trials,” he remarked. Mr. Bhushan said 18 districts in the country were reporting a weekly COVID-19 positivity between 5% and 10%, with Kerala still reporting the majority of the new cases. “Directions have been issued to the State to ensure that the festival season does not become a reason for any spread of infection,” he said. States have been told that mass gatherings should be avoided in areas identified as containment zones and in districts reporting more than 5% case positivity, he added. Gatherings with advance permissions and limited people (as per local context) would be allowed in districts with a positivity rate of 5% and below. “Relaxations and restrictions should be imposed based on weekly case positivity,” he said, urging people to celebrate online with extended family and friends this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-data-given-to-who-for-nod/article36767957.ece
01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Monsoon may withdraw from next week||The monsoon is likely to begin withdrawing from the mainland from October 6, said the India Meteorological Department as the country recorded an average of nearly 87 cm of rainfall across subdivisions, just short of the nearly 88 cm it normally receives during the monsoon. The quantum of rainfall during the monsoon is counted as that received between June 1 and September 30. The September rainfall, at 223 millimetres (mm), has been the second highest since 1993 when it got 239 mm (40% above normal). In 2019, India recorded nearly 250 mm, or about 52% more than normal. Had it not been for the extraordinary rainfall last month, India could very well have ended up with deficit rainfall. With a weakening of the rainfall that began in mid-July and lasted most of August, the rainfall deficit in India had widened to nearly 24%. As of Thursday India has received 99% of its monsoon rainfall. At the start of the monsoon, the IMD had forecast rainfall in the four months to be “above normal” or around 101% of the Long Period Average (88 cm). After a staggering deficit in August, the second rainiest month, it revised it to saying that this would be “at the lower end of normal” without specifying a fresh number. As predicted However, the IMD did also say that September rainfall would be above normal, or “greater than 110%” of the normal for the month. September rainfall was expected to be good on the back of transitioning temperatures in the Central Pacific Ocean where a La Nina — characterised by colder than normal sea surface temperatures — was taking shape. While September is usually the month that marks the beginning of the end of the monsoon’s four-month sojourn over India, both 2020 and 2019 have seen rain spikes during the month. In 2019, September rain was a staggering 152% or close to 25 cm, close to what the country gets in August (26 cm), considered the second rainiest of the monsoon months. That year also saw India get the highest monsoon rainfall since 1994. Last September’s rainfall at 17.7 cm was not too high but more than normal. D.S, Pai, Head, Climate Research Services, IMD, Pune said while three Septembers of excess monsoon rains was unusual, it wasn't yet indicative of a trend. “There is always variability within the monsoon and the rainfall that we saw in September was part of it. We'll have to wait for longer to see if there’s any trend,” Mr. Pai said. Across the regions, central India saw 83% more rain than normal, northwest India 40% and southern India 24% above normal. However, northeastern and eastern India saw a 30% reduction. M. Mahapatra, Director General, IMD, said typically, heavy rains in central India correspond to weaker rains in the northeast because of the movement of the monsoon system. Other factors that contributed to strong September rains were favourable conditions in the Indian Ocean as well as a rain-bearing system in the Bay of Bengal that resulted in Cyclone Gulab that passed through Andhra Pradesh but whose effects were felt as far as Maharashtra, bringing in torrential rain in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/monsoon-may-withdraw-from-next-week/article36767928.ece
01 October 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amid crisis, Sidhu meets Channi||The fresh crisis in the Congress in Punjab, emerging after its State chief Navjot Singh Sidhu quit his post on the issue of inducting “tainted” leaders and controversial officials in the new government, showed sign of easing on Thursday, though Mr. Sidhu has not yet announced a withdrawal of his resignation. A meeting was held here between Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Mr. Sidhu and other party leaders in which, it has been learnt, a consensus was reached to set up a coordination panel of senior party leaders that would coordinate between the government and the party. As the situation in the Congress continues to be volatile, the Congress’s State in-charge Harish Rawat said it would take another five to seven days to get all things in place. Mr. Rawat said he would be going to Punjab soon to take stock of the situation. A close aide of Mr. Sidhu told The Hindu that the demands put forth by him had been met during the meeting. However, there is no confirmation by the party that any assurance was given to the former cricketer-turned-politician. Voicing concern Mr. Sidhu resigned on September 28, voicing concern over the appointments of ‘tainted’ leaders and officers in the new government. He had specifically raised questions over the appointments of the Director General of Police and the State’s Advocate-General. The Punjab government has appointed A.P.S. Deol as the A-G and given additional charge of DGP to Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota. Ahead of the meeting with the Chief Minister, targeting the new appointments, Mr. Sidhu on Twitter, said “DGP IPS Sahota was head of SIT investigating Beadbi case under Badal Govt; he wrongfully indicted two Sikh youth for sacrilege & gave clean chit to Badals. In 2018, I along with INC Ministers, then PCC President & present Home Minister assured them of our support in fight for Justice.” Earlier in the day, former Punjab Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar, in a veiled attack on Mr. Sidhu, accused him of undermining the authority of the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-crisis-sidhu-meets-channi/article36767949.ece
01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Marathon month for SC Collegium||In a month of marathon recommendations to fill up long-pending vacancies in the High Courts, the Supreme Court Collegium led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana has suggested the names of 16 judicial officers and advocates to the government for appointment as judges in four different High Courts. September has seen the Collegium meet frequently, that is, more than once every week, to recommend appointments, transfers, and re-transfers, and reiterate its recommendations to various High Courts. The Collegium recommendations have been sent through the month, starting from September 1 till September 29. The Collegium includes Justices U.U. Lalit, A.M. Khanwilkar, D.Y. Chandrachud and L. Nageswara Rao. In its latest set of resolutions, the Collegium has suggested appointments to the High Courts of Punjab and Haryana, Gujarat, Orissa, and Bombay on September 29. In Punjab and Haryana, the Collegium has proposed the elevation of advocate Sandeep Moudgil as judge. The names of advocates Mauna Manish Bhatt, Samir J. Dave, Hemant M. Prachchhak, Sandeep N. Bhatt, Aniruddha Pradyumna Mayee, Niral Rashmikant Mehta and Nisha Mahendrabhai Thakore have been proposed as judges of the Gujarat High Court. The Collegium has recommended advocates Aditya Kumar Mohapatra and Mruganka Sekhar Sahoo, and judicial officers Radha Krishna Pattanaik and Sashikanta Mishra, as judges of the Orissa High Court. Four judicial officers have been recommended for appointment as judges of the Bombay High Court. They are A.L. Pansare, S.C. More, U.S. Joshi-Phalke and B.P. Deshpande. Within days of successfully getting nine new judges appointed to the Supreme Court in one go in August, the Collegium had yet again scripted history by recommending 68 names in one stroke for elevation as judges of various High Courts. Following this, the Collegium recommended eight new Chief Justices to High Courts, the transfer of five High Court Chief Justices and the shuffling of 28 High Court judges across the country. The proposed shuffle, probably one of the largest in the higher judiciary in recent times, recommended the transfer of judges from across 14 of a total 25 High Courts in the country. The Collegium recommendations had covered the High Courts of Allahabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Madras, Orissa, Patna, Punjab and Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana. Earlier this month, Chief Justice Ramana had described judicial appointments as an “ongoing process”. The CJI had said the Collegium intended to “live up to the Herculean task of filling up 41% of vacancies existing in all the High Courts”. He had made it clear that the Supreme Court Collegium was united in its resolve to fill up the vacancies in the High Courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/marathon-month-for-sc-collegium/article36767943.ece
01 October 2021||New Delhi,||Urban missions to get big outlay||The revamped versions of the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch on Friday would include convergence with the corresponding missions for rural areas and outcome-based funding for cities, top Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MHUA) officials said on Thursday. The SBM-U 2.0 and AMRUT 2.0 aim at “saturation”, while the first five-year iterations of the schemes launched in 2014 and 2015 respectively focused on “transformation”, a senior MHUA official said. While SBM-U focused on construction of toilets and making cities open defecation-free (ODF), SBM-U 2.0 would aim to make the facilities better, reclaim all landfills and take processing of municipal solid waste to 100% from the present 70%, the official said. Similarly, AMRUT 2.0 would aim to provide universal coverage of water supply to all 4,378 statutory towns, an increase from the goal of covering 500 cities under AMRUT. The official said the Ministry would collaborate with the Jal Shakti Ministry to ensure convergence with phase-II of SBM-Rural and Jal Jeevan Mission for areas such as villages on the outskirts of cities that have both urban and rural features. In a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Thursday that the two missions had been designed to make cities “garbage free” and “water secure”, for which outlays of Rs. 1.41 lakh crore for SBM-U 2.0 and Rs. 2.87 lakh crore for AMRUT 2.0 had been proposed. According to the Ministry’s data, 66.86 lakh individual household toilets and 6.40 lakh seats in community toilets had been constructed under SBM-U. While 4,371 cities had been declared open defecation-free, 4,316 of them had been certified so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/urban-missions-to-get-big-outlay/article36767959.ece
01 October 2021||Washington DC,||‘Handling China a bilateral issue’||Negotiating China’s rise in the world was largely a bilateral matter, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said on Friday, in the context of Quad countries’ handling of China’s ascent. The Minister was responding to a question from former U.S. Ambassador to India, Frank Wisner, with whom he was in a discussion organised by the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum, an advocacy group. “On your question of how do we deal with the rise of China, I would say: In many ways, those are bilateral choices that all of us have to make. We each have a very substantial relationship with China,” he said. “And in many ways, China being today, such a big player and so salient in the international economy, I think it’s natural that these relationships are quite unique,” Mr. Jaishankar said, adding that countries — he named Quad members, France and Indonesia as examples — would have unique problems and opportunities around the issue. ‘Natural evolution’ The Minister said it was important to normalise conversations such as the Quad and that it did not imply a ganging up but a “natural evolution of the international order.” The Quad was for things and not against someone, he said in response to a question on why China was not mentioned by him in his earlier comments on the Quad. “We are for peaceful resolution of disputes, we are for democratic values, we are for territorial integrity of states. So, I think it’s very important not to be railroaded into some kind of negative discourse, which actually is not from our script, it is somebody else’s script,” he said. “And I don’t think we should fall for that.” Mr. Jaishankar said there existed a fundamental right to cooperate with partners. “ I think it’s important that others should not have a veto on our choices. It’s part of our democratic world order.” On the India-U.S. bilateral relationship, Mr. Jaishankar characterised the countries as a “very good fit” in terms of how they dealt with the big picture issues and the issues of the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/handling-china-a-bilateral-issue/article36768321.ece
01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘China can join Quad initiatives’||The Quad is a partnership among “like-minded” countries and is not ‘designed’ to be a security alliance, said Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison who argued that even China is welcome to contribute to the objective of ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. Addressing journalists after his return from the U.S. where a security alliance consisting of the U.S., the U.K. and Australia — AUKUS — was launched, Mr. Morrison said members of the Quad are not in the business of containing China. “Our objective of working together is to ensure that we promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and everybody who wants to participate in that, including China, is a welcome partner in that cause. I, we, don’t rally want to see the region in such binary terms,” said Mr. Morrison to a question that had raised critical comments made by certain Chinese officials about the Quad. The Quad, said the Australian leader, is certainly aimed at deterring any challenge that disturbs peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region or “in any way seeks to limit” the sovereignty of nearby countries. He said such a perspective is probably also shared by China and India. “We are not in the containment club when it comes to China. We have greatly benefited from their economic development, and they have been very successful indeed as India has, in taking millions, hundreds of millions of people out of poverty,” said Mr. Morrison. Australia, he said, does not believe in creating a balance between India and China and instead he highlighted that Canberra’s role in Indo-Pacific and in the Quad is “very positive”. The comments contributed to an ongoing debate about the nature of Quad which following the first leaders summit in Washington DC on September 24 has seen a lesser focus on a possible security cooperation and emphasis on handling the pandemic and climate change. Prime Minister Morrison emphasised the Quad will also play a role in critical and emerging technologies and exploration of rare earth minerals that are necessary for such technologies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-can-join-quad-initiatives/article36767929.ece
01 October 2021||New Delhi,||NEET: OCI candidates can appear in general category||The Supreme Court on Thursday permitted Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) candidates to participate in the NEET-UG 2021 counselling in the general category. A Bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari was hearing a challenge to a March 4, 2021 notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs directing OCI candidates to be treated on a par with Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) for the purpose of NEET. This would mean that successful OCI candidates would have to pay the higher fee paid by NRIs for medical seats in India. An NRI is an Indian citizen residing abroad. An OCI is a foreign national of Indian origin who is registered as an OCI cardholder under Section 7A of the Citizenship Act. ‘Seats taken away’ The government, represented by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, justified the notification, saying OCIs were “foreigners” who had pledged allegiance to a foreign state. Allowing them to participate in the general category meant taking a chunk of the seats away from young Indian citizens who aspired to study medicine and work as doctors in India. Ms. Bhati said there was a very high possibility that OCIs would use the scarce medical education resources in India and then return to their countries with their degrees. The court, while appreciating the point made by Ms. Bhati, said the sudden implementation of the March 4 notification, starting with the current academic year itself, was arbitrary. “We are of the view that at least for the current academic year 2021-2022, the petitioners are entitled to be considered eligible for all the medical seats which the OCIs were eligible for before the issuance of the impugned notification dated March 4, 2021. Therefore, we direct the National Testing Agency to declare the result of the examination taken by the petitioners (NEET-UG 2021) and the eligible petitioners are permitted to appear for the counselling in the general category,” the court directed in its order. The court, on Ms. Bhati’s insistence, clarified that the order allowing the OCIs to compete in the general category was confined to the 2021-2022 academic year alone. During the hearing, Ms. Bhati said OCIs had voluntarily taken up the citizenship of another country. Justice Murari observed that the government recognised these people as OCIs and gave them rights. It was now not right on the government’s part to take it away from them all of a sudden. Justice Nazeer said the country was known for its spirit of inclusiveness. Besides, the number of OCIs who had participated in NEET, around 400, was miniscule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neet-oci-candidates-can-appear-in-general-category/article36767963.ece
01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Paddy procurement delayed in Punjab||The Centre has postponed procurement of paddy in Punjab and Haryana to October 11, due to recent heavy rainfall, the Food Ministry said on Thursday. The original procurement date of paddy at minimum support prices (MSP) for the 2021-2022 kharif marketing season was October 1 in Punjab. It was officially due to have started on September 25 in Haryana. “Due to recent heavy downpour in the States of Punjab and Haryana, the maturity of paddy has been delayed and the moisture content in the fresh arrival at present is beyond the permissible limit,” the Food Ministry said in a letter to both State governments, citing information from the Food Corporation of India. “Therefore, keeping in view the interest of farmers and to avoid any inconvenience to them, it has been decided that the procurement of paddy under MSP would commence from October 11, 2021 in Punjab and Haryana so as to accept paddy stock as per FAQ specifications,” it added. The States were asked to advise their agencies to dry the paddy which has already arrived and ensure that any further produce is brought to the mandi only after proper drying. This comes against the backdrop of several farm unions protesting against the more stringent specifications issued this year for the government’s purchase of paddy. The permissible limits for moisture content, foreign matter, and discoloured, sprouted or damaged grains have all been lowered this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/paddy-procurement-delayed-in-punjab/article36767966.ece
01 October 2021||Mumbai,||ED turns up the heat on Shiv Sena||With three of its senior leaders currently being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in different cases of alleged money laundering, Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena finds itself cornered by the Central probe agency. Among the Sena leaders being investigated is the State’s Transport Minister Anil Parab, a close aide of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Mr. Parab was questioned for over eight hours at the ED’s Mumbai office three days ago. His name was brought up by former Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, who is currently jailed in the Antilia bomb scare case. Mr. Vaze claimed that Mr. Parab, through his accomplice Bajrang Kharmate, was involved in money laundering over police transfers. “I have done nothing wrong and I have nothing to fear. I will be available for questioning whenever the need be,” Mr. Parab had said before going to ED office, where he maintained that position. Sena MP Bhavna Gawali from the Washim-Yavatmal constituency has been summoned by the ED to be present for interrogation on October 4. Her aide, Saeed Khan, has already been arrested by the ED in a case related to money laundering in a trust. It is alleged that Ms. Gawali, along with Mr. Khan and others, conspired to convert the trust into a company through fraud. Mr. Khan’s lawyer had argued in court of a political conspiracy behind the ED’s action, saying that action had been initiated due to a “different political colour”. Former Sena MP Anand Adsul is also under the scanner in the Rs. 980 crore City Co-operative Bank scam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-turns-up-the-heat-on-shiv-sena/article36767925.ece
01 October 2021||New Delhi,||New Delhi hits out at Beijing for blame on Ladakh stand-off||India on Thursday hit out at China for attempting to blame it for the eastern Ladakh stand-off, asserting that the “provocative” behaviour and “unilateral” attempts by the Chinese military to alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the region seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity in the region. External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said China continued to deploy a large number of troops and armaments in the border areas and it was in response to Chinese actions that Indian armed forces had to make appropriate counter deployments. He said China’s allegations had “no basis in facts” and that it was India’s expectation that the Chinese side would work towards an early resolution of the remaining issues while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols. India’s reaction came in response to China’s fresh allegation that the “root cause” of the tensions between the two countries was New Delhi following a “forward policy” and “illegally” encroaching on the Chinese territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-delhi-hits-out-at-beijing-for-blame-on-ladakh-stand-off/article36768318.ece

He has flown more than 3800 hours on multiple fighter and trainer aircraft,” the Air Force said in a statement. Prior to the present appointment, he was the Vice Chief of the Air Staff. On September 29, the government announced the appointment of ACM Chaudhari as the next Air Chief. “Protection of our nation’s sovereignty and integrity is to be ensured at any cost,” ACM Chaudhuri said. Enhancement of operational capability through integration of newly inducted platforms, weapons and equipment with the existing assets and dovetailing the same in concepts of operations would remain a priority area, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-air-chief-promises-to-enhance-capabilities/article36767940.ece

Such kinds of incidents will continue to occur till such time a long-term solution is reached — that is to have a boundary agreement. That should be the thrust of our efforts so that we have lasting peace on our northern borders,” he added. Referring to issues in defence procurement, he observed that with the cycle of new and disruptive technologies getting shorter and faster, avoiding technological obsolescence remained a big challenge. “The danger that our long-drawn procurement processes and bureaucratic speed-breakers would prevent us from acquiring cutting edge technology is a real one,” he pointed out. Much work had been done to bring about systemic changes with the aim of ease of doing business. “This however remains a work in progress. There are still archaic rules and processes that defy logic and are at variance to modern best practices. This needs to be addressed,” he urged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lac-incidents-will-go-on-till-a-pact-is-signed/article36767922.ece

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said he felt “helpless” when meaningful conversations could not start within party forums and hurt when he saw pictures of Congress workers “raising slogans outside the residence of a colleague and MP”. “The safe harbour to which one can withdraw seems to be silence,” added Mr. Chidambaram, who is not a part of G-23. Azad’s tweet Mr. Azad tweeted: “I strongly condemn the orchestrated hooliganism @KapilSibal’s residence last night. He is a loyal congressman fighting for the party both inside and outside the Parliament. Any suggestion from any quarter should be welcomed instead of suppressing, hooliganism is unacceptable.” Members of the Youth Congress from the Chandni Chowk area protested outside his house on Wednesday evening. Apart from holding placards with “Get Well Soon” messages, Youth Congress workers reportedly threw tomatoes and roses inside Mr. Sibal’s compound. Though there was complete silence from the Gandhis, others like former Law Minister Ashwani Kumar, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and general secretary Ajay Maken were among leaders who strongly strongly defended them. “Sonia Gandhi ji and Rahul Gandhi ji have handled the party under difficult circumstances. We have full faith in them. Those who are raising questions now have been given a lot by the party,” Mr. Baghel tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cwc-meet-soon-says-congress-amid-crisis/article36767923.ece

The BJP also raised allegations against Ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, claiming that they were moving around polling booths and trying to influence voters. Both denied the allegations, saying they were merely interacting with party supporters at different party offices and did not try to influence voters. A vehicle of BJP leader Kalyan Chaubey was attacked and damaged at Bhabanipur. According to the police, there was no political connection with the incident and the attack was due to an altercation with a person on a motorbike.

Misgovernance in Punjab would give Pakistan the opportunity to create trouble in the State and in the country,” he said, adding that his meeting with Mr. Doval was centred on this theme. The long-running farmers’ protest against the three contentious farm laws were issues that he discussed with Mr. Shah and tangentially with Mr. Doval, as the agitation with no end to the confrontation was inimical to the security of the State. Capt. Singh said those undermining the growing Pakistani threat in Punjab were playing into the hands of anti-India forces by being in denial mode, a direct hit at Congress leader Navjyot Singh Sidhu. “They [Pak-backed elements] are killing our soldiers every day. They are pushing weapons into the State through drones. How can we overlook such dangers?” he asked. For his own party, the Congress, which he is set to exit, Capt. Singh had some home truths: “Senior Congressmen are the thinkers but they are being sidelined.” He condemned the attack on former Union Minister Kapil Sibal’s residence by Youth Congress workers for what he termed “choosing to express views that were not palatable to the party leadership”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/leaving-cong-but-not-joining-bjp-amarinder/article36767932.ece

Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav visited the trader’s family in Kanpur and announced that his party would provide them a support of Rs. 20 lakh. He demanded that the government provide Rs. 2 crore as compensation and conduct a probe under a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court. Meenakshi Gupta, who accused the policemen of assaulting and murdering her husband in Gorakhpur on Monday, said she met Mr. Adityanath and that he “deeply and properly understood” her case and situation. “I am fully satisfied,” said Ms. Gupta to a news channel, adding that the Chief Minister had accepted her demand for a job and had himself offered to shift the case to Kanpur. Ms. Gupta was later appointed as an OSD in the Kanpur Development Authority. The government had earlier announced an ex gratia of Rs. 10 lakh to the family. Six policemen were suspended while three were booked for murder on the complaint of Ms. Gupta. After meeting the family, Mr. Yadav said the BJP government and its administration were “equally responsible for the murder.” The autopsy report of the trader revealed he died of “coma due to injuries” and listed several injures including swelling in the head and a cut above the elbow joint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adityanath-offers-job-to-wife-of-dead-trader/article36767933.ece

The registration is mandatory for associations and NGOs to receive foreign funds. The Ministry had earlier given a relief up to September 30 to NGOs whose registration was expiring between September 29, 2020-September 30,2021. The latest order says the deadline for NGOs certificates or registration expiring between September 29, 2020 to December 31, 2021 could apply for renewal till December 31, 2021. The certificates of around 80% of NGOs are expected to expire on October 31 and as per norms they have to apply at least six months before the expiry of registration. Registered NGOs can receive foreign contribution for five purposes — social, educational, religious, economic and cultural. The FCRA registration is renewed every five years. The NGOs also have to compulsorily open an account with the SBI in Delhi to receive foreign contribution. Amid a slew of amendments to the FCRA, 2010 that the Ministry introduced in 2020 in Parliament, it made form FC6C — an authorisation certificate mandatory to operationalise a bank account with SBI’s main branch in Delhi, another compulsory requirement.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Yagnyavalkya, rare disciple||The Vedas are infinite and what is available today is only a small portion that Vyasa had comprehensively consolidated and split into four sections for easy assimilation. Each of the four Vedas has a rishi. Incidentally, Yajur Veda branched into two divisions that came to be known as Krishna Yajur Veda and Shukla Yajur Veda. The Taittiriya Saka or Samhita which is very popular belongs to Krishna Yajur Veda. In a discourse, Sri B. Sundarkumar drew attention to an interesting story about how this came about. Vaisampayana is the rishi for Yajur Veda and Yagnyavalkya was one of his foremost disciples. Once there arose a difference of opinion between the preceptor and disciple. The preceptor asked the disciple to give back whatever he had learnt. How was this to be done? Learning that is imbibed from a preceptor is not something tangible that can be returned as is the case with a book or any other object that one may borrow. Still, Yagnyavalkya, being a yogi of exceptional merit, spewed from his mouth all he had learnt. To prevent any disrespect to the sacred and profound knowledge thus thrown out, other disciples took up the form of Tittiri birds and absorbed it. This is how the famous Taittiriya Samhita got its name. Yagnyavalkya, for his part, felt unworthy without knowledge and wisdom. He experienced an empty feeling. He wanted to find a teacher who could impart the Vedas to him. He thought of the Sun god who is inseparable from the Vedas. Yagnyavalkya undertook severe penance and prayed to him to accept him as his disciple and impart the knowledge of the Vedas. It is held that the Sun god, pleased with such an ardent devotee, took the form of a horse and taught him the Vedas. This section has come to be known as Shukla Yajur Veda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yagnyavalkya-rare-disciple/article36767960.ece

Mr. Kejriwal, who was on a two-day Punjab visit ahead of the Assembly polls scheduled for early next year, said in Ludhiana: “If you go to a government hospital, primary health centre or a community health centre in Punjab, you will not get any treatment.

01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Scindia lauds tax cuts on aviation fuel||Minister for Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday thanked the governments of Uttarakhand and Andaman and Nicobar Islands for lowering VAT (value-added tax) on aviation turbine fuel. Uttarakhand has brought down the VAT to 2%, while Andaman and Nicobar have brought it down to 1%, Mr. Scindia said. “My heartfelt thanks to both these governments because it is only by decreasing the volume of taxes that you are going to increase the volume of connectivity going into those States. Considering that fuel is 37.5% of operational costs of an airline, it is very important that we put an impetus on greater connectivity by bringing down the cost structure [of fuel],” said the Minister at an event organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Last month, Mr. Scindia had written to 22 States and Union Territories appealing to them to reduce VAT to 1% to 4%. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim and Telangana are some of the States that have already lowered it. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has also proposed that ATF be brought under GST.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scindia-lauds-tax-cuts-on-aviation-turbine-fuel/article36767961.ece

01 October 2021||Bhopal,||Digvijaya recounts help by Shah, RSS workers||Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh is among the staunchest critics of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, but on Thursday he revealed how Mr. Shah as well as RSS workers had helped him during his Narmada Parikrama four years ago. Mr. Singh and his journalist wife, Amrita, had undertaken the arduous journey on foot along the banks of the Narmada river in 2017. “Once, we reached our destination in Gujarat around 10 p.m. There was no way ahead through the forested area and there was no facility for overnight stay,” he said during the launch ofNarmada Ke Pathik,authored by his long-time associate O.P. Sharma. “A forest officer arrived, and you will be surprised to know that he told me that Amit Shah had directed him to fully cooperate with us,” Mr. Singh said. “Elections were going on [in Gujarat], Digvijaya is their biggest critic, but he [Mr. Shah] ensured that there should not be any problem during our yatra. They found a way for us through the mountains and also arranged food for all of us,” the Congress leader said. Mr. Singh had started the over 3,000-km-long journey, which lasted six months, from Barman Ghat in Narsinghpur district on September 30, 2017. “Till today, I have not met Mr. Shah, but I expressed my gratitude to him through proper channels,” he said. ‘Example of friendship’ This was an example of “political coordination, adjustment and friendship, which has nothing to do with politics and ideology”, he said. Though he is a strong critic of the RSS, its workers kept meeting him during the yatra, Mr. Singh said. When he was passing through Bharuch region, RSS workers arranged accommodation for his group at a Manjhi Samaj Dharamshala one day. The hall where they were put up had photos of RSS stalwarts Keshav Baliram Hedgewar and Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar on the walls, the Congress leader said. Mr. Singh said he was mentioning all this to let people know that religion and politics are different, and he had “taken help from all” during his pilgrimage. A leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) youth wing, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, and three other BJP workers were part of his group, and they are now inseparable part of his “Narmada family”, he said. The former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister recounted that the late spiritual leader, Daddaji, had directed his follower and actor Ashutosh Rana to make arrangements for ‘bhandara’ (community feast) at Barman Ghat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/digvijaya-recounts-help-by-shah-rss-workers/article36767946.ece
01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Thermal plants may make Chennai unlivable’||North Chennai, an industrial zone, suffers from air pollution, mainly from the presence of several thermal power plants. The area has the North Chennai Thermal Power Station (Stage 1 and 2), NTECL at Vallur having a capacity of 1,500 MW and the Basin Bridge Gas Turbine Power Station, which are operated by State and Union government agencies. Ennore fishermen have been highlighting the pollution of waterways owing to dumping of fly ash. All localities suffer from air pollution that poses several health hazards. A study done by C40, a network of the world cities committed to addressing climate change, paints a gloomy picture of public health. It says the operation of thermal power plants could lead to more deaths among the adults, loss of man days and damage to children’s health. The study, entitled ‘Coal-free cities: the health and economic case for a clean energy revolution,’ pitches for sustainable energy to create thousands of jobs, prevent loss of man days, provide residents with cheap power and tackle climate change. The study has predicted that in the next 10 years, the pollution caused by thermal power plants could lead to 52,700 sudden deaths, 31,700 preterm births and asthma among 5,700 children in cities, including Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. It has also predicted the number of sudden deaths to increase in Chennai in the year 2030 to 500 against 340 in 2019 because of the pollution from the thermal power plants. The study has called for closing the thermal power plants in Chennai and for generating over 1.40 lakh jobs by investing in solar and wind energies. G. Sundararajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal urged the Tamil Nadu government not to construct any new thermal plant and spike any plan for replacing or expanding the plants that are to be decommissioned in the coming years. He cited the freeze imposed on new thermal power plants by Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. He wanted the government to promote sustainable energies to rid the city of pollution from the thermal power plants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thermal-plants-may-make-chennai-unlivable/article36768467.ece

01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MoU soon for Chennai port-Maduravoyal project||A memorandum of understanding (MoU) will soon be signed for fresh alignment of the Chennai port-Maduravoyal double deck road project. Since each stakeholder — the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Indian Navy, Chennai Port Trust and the government of Tamil Nadu — has obligations that need to be completed, an MoU is necessary, said a source associated with the project. The State government has to remove settlements along the Cooum and rehabilitate residents. The number of people to be displaced has now gone up due to an increase in the number of ramps to provide access to motorists. At present, there are 13 ramps. The cost of relief and rehabilitation was earlier around Rs. 500 crore. It has now increased due to more land being required for the additional ramps. “Tenders for the construction of the elevated corridor are likely to be called by financial year-end for the 20.5-km project,” said another official. The Chennai Port Trust is the project proponent. The idea is to allow container-carrying trailers to take the corridor, instead of crowding the Poonamallee High Road, as is being done now. During the night, trailers take the arterial road to reach the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway. The detailed project report is likely to take three more months to be completed. The proposal is to allow local traffic take the lower level and the heavier trailers that will have to pay toll take the second level. “Additional ramps are being created only for local traffic. The containers will take only the second level,” the official said. The Indian Navy has agreed to give 1.02 hectares of land. Around 60 houses will be demolished and constructed on another site. The project, which began in 2010, was put on hold in 2012, following objections over its alignment. It would have cost Rs. 1,815-crore if it had been completed earlier. It is now estimated to cost around Rs. 5,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mou-soon-for-chennai-port-maduravoyal-project/article36768478.ece
01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Disability rights association helps field candidates for upcoming election||For Thamizharasi A. from Ulagalampoondi in Vikravandi, the upcoming rural local bodies election is a significant one, and one she hopes will bring about change — not just for herself. She is among the 40 persons with disabilities who are members of the December 3 Movement and will be contesting for various posts in the election to be held next month. “I am contesting for the first time and a victory would mean that not only can I work for the betterment of my village, I will also bring disabled persons in my village together and we can represent our cause on platforms such as grama sabha meetings,” says the 34-year-old candidate. The 40 candidates will be contesting as independents in Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, Ranipet and Tirupattur for the posts of panchayat ward councillors, union and district councillors. Among the candidates is A. Kavitha from Villupuram, whose nomination for the local bodies poll in 2011 was rejected on the grounds that the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1944 had a clause that did not allow persons with a hearing or speech impairment to contest in the polls. Disability rights organisations and activists had then come together and protested this and took the legal route, following which the Act was amended in 2012. “When I go out to canvass for votes, I appeal to the voters to give someone like me, who can do good for the village, a chance and not just see me as someone with a disability,” said Vijaya Bai, a 48-year-old candidate from Tirupattur. She said that when a disabled person is elected as a representative, there would definitely be better understanding of their concerns and that their voices would be heard. “For years now, we have stressed how important it is to ensure there is empowerment at the grassroots level, and hence our keen focus on the local bodies poll. When a person with a disability contests and wins, we will have a significant presence in the administration, and the empowerment for the disabled in those areas too will be immense,” said T.M.N. Deepak, founder, December 3 Movement. He said this was the first time that a disability rights association had fielded candidates with disabilities in an organised way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/disability-rights-association-helps-field-candidates-for-upcoming-election/article36768484.ece

01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco cannot impose transformer cost on consumers, says ombudsman||S. Devarajan, Tamil Nadu’s electricity ombudsman, has ruled that the collection of costs towards the installation of distribution transformers along with associated equipment, is in violation of regulations and directives of the State power regulator and directed Tangedco to refund the excess estimate charges collected from five Chennai-based real estate developers. He also instructed Tangedco to prepare the estimate in line with regulations of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code and revise the estimate for all such similar cases and refund the excess charges collected from consumers. In separate petitions, Kamalalaya Hi Soft Limited, Navin Housing and Properties Pvt. Ltd, Akshaya Pvt. Ltd., Casa Grand Pvt. Ltd, High Value Developers had sought refunds for the excess charges, including the equipment costs paid under protest. Transformers/equipment/cables/line costs are also included in the estimate charges contrary to regulations. The demand was without any approval from the State power regulator, they said. The ombudsman noted that regulation 29(11)(c) of the code, which came into effect from January 27, 2021 clearly states that the cost of installation works from the distribution transformer to the consumer’s meter, including portion of any HT line within the consumer’s premises, shall alone be collected from the consumer. Collection of costs towards installation of distribution transformers with associated equipment/accessories viz. AB switch, HG Fuse, DT structure /pole by Tangedco is in violation of the regulations and directions issued by Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC), he said. A compliance report shall be submitted within 60 days from the order dated September 24, 2021, the ombudsman said. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, welcomed the order. He had written to the TNERC on the issue urging suo motu action against Tangedco for non-compliance with regulation with regard to collection of charges. But so far, no action was taken by them.

01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu likely to get normal rainfall this monsoon||Tamil Nadu is likely to have normal rainfall during the northeast monsoon this year, according to the India Meteorological Department. In its long-range forecast for the northeast monsoon (October to December), the IMD has predicted normal rainfall in the southern peninsular region, including Tamil Nadu. It may vary between 89% and 111% of the long period average (LPA) of 33.8 cm in the southern peninsular India. (LPA is the average rainfall recorded between 1961 and 2010). The outlook is based on the statistical forecasting system and the multi-model ensemble-based forecast system that incorporates global climate models, too. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said both the seasonal and October rainfall in the State is likely to be normal. Tamil Nadu receives an average of 44 cm during the northeast monsoon. The models have their own limitations for long-range forecasts at the State level for the northeast monsoon. The IMD has also forecast delayed withdrawal of the southwest monsoon. It may begin to withdraw from north-west India from October 6. The State has recorded 39.3 cm, which is 17% in excess of its average rainfall, during the southwest monsoon. Mr. Balachandran noted that there would be an increase in rainfall from Friday. Most places in the State may experience light to moderate rain till October 4 owing to an easterly trough. On Friday, one or two places in southern districts, like Theni, and the Cauvery delta districts may receive heavy rain. On Thursday, several parts of Chennai recorded light rain. Ennore received nearly 5 cm, and the rain gauges at Taramani, Villivakkam and MRC Nagar recorded nearly 1 cm till 5.30 p.m. The IMD forecast thunderstorms with light to moderate rain in some areas of Chennai till Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-likely-to-get-normal-rainfall-this-monsoon/article36768447.ece

Over 1,110 knives and seven country guns were seized from them. Station House Officers held meetings with blacksmiths, lathe-owners and shopkeepers who sell knives and billhooks. Over 2,500 persons took part at the meetings held at 579 places. Most of them assured the police of their cooperation in crime prevention. Director-General of Police C. Sylendra Babu has asked police officers to keep a close watch on the units and shops that sell knives and machetes and prevent the weapons from falling into the wrong hands. He said the officers should identify the units which make knives and machetes. Those who make and sell these weapons have been asked to collect the details of buyers and the reason for the purchase. They should not be sold to unidentified persons for any purpose other than domestic and agricultural, he said. These units should install closed circuit television cameras and approach the police in case of any difficulty in the installation. The units and the shopkeepers have been asked to alert the police if they come across any suspicious person visiting their premises to buy weapons. They will be duly rewarded, Mr. Sylendra Babu said.

01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Corruption, one of the limitations of Dravidian model of growth’||Political corruption has been one of the limitations of the successful Dravidian model of growth and social development and deep measures are needed to address it, said N. Ram, Director, The Hindu Group Publishing Private Limited. “The new DMK government under the leadership of M.K. Stalin has promised to find a new path. These are early days; we have to watch it. Corruption cannot be eradicated in a short time. The government has to take deep measures and it is a challenging task,” he said, addressing virtually the members of the Southern India Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SICCI), on the occasion of its 111th annual general meeting. Fine balance Speaking on the topic of inclusion, Mr. Ram said a fine balance between growth and inclusive development was needed. He pointed out that the recent book, ‘The Dravidian Model: Interpreting the political economy of Tamil Nadu’ authored by A.Kalaiyarasan and M. Vijayabaskar, had argued that the political mobilisation, resulting in social change, attempted to lower inequality, which made redistribution more natural and in turn helped achieve broad-based development. Mr. Ram said he was convinced by the conceptual argument made by the book, backed by data, about social and economic development that had happened in the State through populist mobilisation against caste-based inequalities. Even though caste-based inequalities still existed, opportunities had been created in the State through reservation, he pointed out. Another limitation of the model was the State finances and the white paper had already highlighted the challenges and steps needed ahead. In his welcome address, Ar Rm Arun, president, SICCI, said the organisation helped drive holistic inclusion amid the pandemic in areas such as finance, gender and healthcare among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corruption-one-of-the-limitations-of-dravidian-model-of-growth-says-n-ram/article36768479.ece
01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Savarkar a victim of machinations: Vikram Sampath||Savarkar has been a victim of political machinations, and his political philosophy and relevance is in the ascendant in India, although he remained persona non grata for long, author Vikram Sampath said here on Friday. He was speaking at the launch of his book Savarkar-A Contented Legacy , which is part of Prabha Khaitan Foundation’s Kitaab Series. At a discussion moderated by journalist Akhila Krishnamurthy, Mr. Sampath said that curiously there was a lack of research on Savarkar and his life had escaped the entire revaluation of history. Explaining one of the facets of Savarkar from his book, Mr. Sampath asked, “Why has a man who fought against untouchability become a political untouchable?” BJP Tamil Nadu president K. Annamalai, who released the book, said the common man knew very little about Savarkar, and if an opinion was sought about him on the streets, it would be divided. “The book presents a very neutral view of Savarkar, not a fanboy version,” he said. He said some Indian leaders were forgotten, while some were demonised by historians. “Savarkar was demonised. At one point, historians showed him as an apologist; later, they showed him as involved in Gandhi’s assassination. But Savarkar spoke truth to power. He never wavered in his philosophy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/savarkar-a-victim-of-machinations-vikram-sampath/article36768445.ece

01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TNERC keeps additional surcharge unchanged||The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) said that open access consumers (who buy power directly from third parties without depending on State utility) have to pay an additional surcharge of Rs. 0.70 per unit to Tangedco from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022. The rate of additional surcharge is similar to what was determined for the earlier six month period from April 16, 2021 to September 30, 2021. In its petition, Tangedco had sought to fix the additional surcharge at Rs. 0.85 per unit. The open access concept allows consumers like industrial users and commercial buildings to buy cheaper power directly from private generators. The move was aimed at increasing competitiveness and efficiency in the power sector and the loss of revenue suffered by Tangedco due to open access was compensated through the levy of a cross-subsidy surcharge. The TNERC noted that the additional surcharge shall become applicable only if the obligation of the licensee in terms of power purchase commitments has been and continues to be stranded, or if there is an unavoidable obligation and incidence to bear the fixed costs consequent to such a contract. Based on data furnished by Tangedco from October 2020 to March 2021, the TNERC arrived at the actual stranded capacity due to open access consumers as 597.11 MW. The fixed cost obligation on such stranded capacity is calculated as Rs. 406.47 crore, it said and allowed the levy of an additional surcharge of Rs. 0.70 per unit. The TNERC said the additional surcharge is more competitive when compared to the additional surcharge determined by other State Electricity Regulatory Commissions and is lower than those of many States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnerc-keeps-additional-surcharge-unchanged/article36768925.ece
01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. is yet to integrate land record and procurement portals||Tamil Nadu is among the eight States that have not yet integrated their land record portals with the procurement portals. The other States are Kerala, Telangana, Assam, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and West Bengal, according to a letter written by Union Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey to Union Secretary for Land Resources Ajay Tirkey on Wednesday. Mr. Pandey’s communication has been written on the eve of grain procurement for the kharif marketing season that begins on October 1. Pointing out that the integration of the procurement portals with the land records of the farmers formed one of the minimum threshold parameters for procurement, the Union Food Secretary explained that the main objective of the integration was “to ensure procurement and thereby, release of payments to genuine farmers and ultimately to eliminate the possibility of recycling of foodgrains”. The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation is implementing an online system for paddy procurement. Farmers must visit the websites, www.tncsc.tn.gov.in or www.tncsc-edpc.in, and fill out details such as their Aadhaar numbers, bank account numbers, land, cultivation type, expected yield and quantity of paddy to be procured, besides the sort and variety of the crop. They can also book a slot for procurement, indicating their preference for a direct purchase centre. However, some farmers say traders may misuse the system. They say harvest and yield cannot be calculated with certainty and highlight the possibility of being assigned to a distant direct purchase centre. Officials in charge of procurement say the system has been devised to “ensure transparency in procurement, protect the interests of genuine farmers and curb traders from direct purchase centres”. A July order from the Food and Civil Supplies Department said the location of direct purchase centres should be “convenient” to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-is-yet-to-integrate-land-record-and-procurement-portals/article36768449.ece
01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Alagiri condemns Kapil Sibal’s remarks on Congress leadership||Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri on Thursday condemned former Union Minister Kapil Sibal’s remarks that there was no president for the Congress party at the moment and that one did not know who was taking decisions. Mr. Sibal’s comments came after Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from his post. Mr. Alagiri said Mr. Sibal’s statement that there was no president for the party was not right, and that Sonia Gandhi was the president of the party. “For crores of Congress workers across India, the only leaders acceptable are Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. They are the binding force of the Congress. Only they have the ability to bring together people. Others do not have that capacity. No matter how much others try, cadres will not accept them,” he said. The TNCC president said just because Ms. Gandhi was currently an acting president did not mean there was no president for the party. “Acting president is only a technical word. Even party rules say there can be an interim president. That does not mean Ms. Gandhi is only a temporary president,” he said. He said some of the Congress leaders were playing to the wishes of the BJP and were following the BJP’s footsteps on the issue. “In fact, these leaders should focus on protecting the Congress. Did they raise these issues when they were in power? Now that they are not in power, these issues are cropping up,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-condemns-kapil-sibals-remarks-on-congress-leadership/article36768987.ece

01 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Idol Wing-CID not receiving attention: HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday observed that the Idol Wing-Crime Investigation Department (CID) did not appear to be receiving the kind of attention that it deserves and said it cannot be a coincidence for as many as 41 Case Diaries (CDs), related to theft of ancient idols and artefacts, to have gone missing from various police stations in the State. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu expressed shock over the police having managed to reconstruct only 25 of the 41 missing CDs and the rest of the 16 cases lying in limbo. They also expressed their displeasure over a status report filed by the Idol Wing CID on steps taken by it to detect the theft cases. “It is only in a few stray cases that some of the idols or other stolen property have been recovered, but in the majority of the cases detailed in the report, the idols do not appear to have been recovered. Only in one case there appears to have been recovery of the idols and the conviction of the accused,” the First Division Bench said. Stating that the Idol Wing CID must be relentless in its pursuit of the stolen idols and artefacts and treat the cases with a greater degree of seriousness, the judges wrote: “If there is an Idol Wing of the CID, some results need to be shown by such department in recovering the idols or discovering the persons who may have been responsible.” The Bench also observed that the status report does not reveal any degree of seriousness on the part of the investigating agency to recover the stolen properties or to bring the culprits to book. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by activist lawyer ‘Elephant’ G. Rajendran last year. The petitioner had complained of the missing CD files.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/idol-wing-cid-not-receiving-attention-it-deserves-hc/article36768480.ece

01 October 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||ECLGS extension to benefit more MSMEs||The Central government’s decision to extend the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) till March 2022 is expected to benefit the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in the district. President of the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) M.V. Ramesh Babu said the association had sought extension of the scheme till March 2022. Not all the MSMEs benefited from the Scheme earlier. Now, more units are likely to get support under the Scheme. However, J. James, president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said several micro and small-scale units were turning into non-performing assets in the district. The government should come out with a separate loan scheme for micro units and should not declare any account as NPA. Micro units doing job work with current account will continue to suffer as the extension of the ECLGS will not benefit such units. A. Sakthivel, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council and Federation of Indian Exporters Organisations, said the second wave of the pandemic was worse compared to the first one for the exporters as there were global orders but exporters were unable to serve them due to the lockdown restrictions. “Extension of the ECLGS is a real shot in the arm as we are trying to honour export orders ahead of the festive season,” he said. “A large section of the exporters, particularly the apparel exporters, are MSMEs and they were badly impacted due to the pandemic. This scheme is helping many MSMEs to get back to business,” he said. Further, capital infusion of Rs. 4,400 crore in Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) and its listing through an initial public offering are welcome measures. “Capital infusion in ECGC and its listing will strengthen the corporation to serve more exporters wanting insurance cover for their sale on credit, he added. Businesses adversely affected by the second wave of COVID - 19 will get higher collateral-free liquidity. This will provide much-needed support to all MSME borrowers just before the festival season, said Laghu Udyog Bharati, Coimbatore chapter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eclgs-extension-to-benefit-more-msmes-in-the-district/article36768502.ece

01 October 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Thadagam valley mining: NGT seeks reports on action taken||The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) Southern Zone has directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), Department of Mining and Geology, and Coimbatore District Collector to submit independent statements regarding action taken for violations related to brick manufacturing in Thadagam valley in Coimbatore district. In a recent sitting, Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member K. Satyagopal directed the TNPCB, Department of Mining and Geology and the District Collector to file the report of violations noted by them on or before October 8. The NGT made these directions after examining reports submitted by the TNPCB and the joint committee it formed on June 4 this year, after taking suo motu cognizance of the environmental degradation caused due to the operation of brick kilns in Thadagam valley. The NGT felt that a senior scientist from the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) regional office in Chennai can be included as one of the members of the joint committee in order to ascertain the damage caused to the environment, instead of appointing the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute for the purpose. The Coimbatore District Collector, District Environmental Engineer of TNPCB for Coimbatore north, Assistant Environmental Engineer of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), Chennai, and the Regional Joint Director of the Department of Geology and Mining (Tiruchi Region) are the existing members of the committee. The NGT direction said that the committee can conduct the study and submit a report. If the committee feels that a further study is required, that aspect will be considered. The committee, along with the officer deputed from CPCB, has been directed to inspect and ascertain the damage caused to the environment, list the remedial measures to be taken and to submit a further report, it said. The report submitted by the joint committee before the NGT said that it, along with Revenue officials including the District Revenue officer, Coimbatore, inspected the mining and brick making areas in Thadagam valley on August 7. According to the committee, brick kiln owners have not obtained any clearance from the SEIAA for quarrying brick earth in Veerapandi, Chinna Thadagam, Nanjundapuram, Somayampalayam and Pannimadai villages in the valley. It said that the brick kiln owners have not been granted permits for quarrying brick earth from patta lands as required under Rule 19(2) of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. The Coimbatore north Tahsildar has reported that brick earth was stocked in their units, with its source not known, and the entire quantity of the stocked raw material has been declared as ‘illegally stored’ as per closure proceedings initiated by the District Collector against 177 brick kilns on June 1, 13, 14, 15 and 16. It further said that the Coimbatore north Tahsildar has been directed to seize the entire quantum of brick earth, finished goods of bricks etc., which are stocked illegally on the premises of the brick kiln units. Also the Revenue Divisional Officer, Coimbatore north, has been directed to file complaints before the competent Special Court against brick kiln owners and for making prayers for confiscation of the finished bricks, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thadagam-valley-mining-ngt-asks-for-reports-on-action-taken-for-violations/article36768515.ece

01 October 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Sand smuggling from Varattar ‘rampant’||Farmers complained about sand smuggling in the Varattar and blocking of water flow in the Kodaganaar at the monthly grievance meeting. They were present at the meeting held at the Collectorate here on Thursday after the previous one was held in February 2020. Dindigul district farmers’ association leader, S. R. Rengamani, complained that sand smuggling from the Varattar was going on in full swing during nights nowadays. “I had complained to a senior revenue official about a recent incident of sand scooping in the early morning. But, the lower level employees let the tractor go scott-free,” he charged complaining about involvement of a section of government employees. When the Collector S.

01 October 2021||Kottayam,TAMIL NADU||Accident victim lies on road for 8 hours, dies||An autorickshaw driver who sustained injuries in a road accident near Ettumanur in Kerala bled to death after lying on the roadside for around eight hours. The deceased, identified as Binu, 36, of Athirampuzha, sustained injuries when he autorickshaw he was riding lost control and overturned near the Ettumanur Central Junction on Wednesday midnight. Witnessing the accident, a few local residents rushed to the spot and tried to rescue Mr. Binu and his fellow traveller, identified as Rajesh. “As the duo were in an inebriated state, none of the onlookers were willing to accompany them to hospital. Mr. Binu, who sustained head injuries, too refused to seek medical assistance or even board the autorickshaw again despite repeated requests from Mr. Rajesh. As the crowd dispersed, Mr. Rajesh too left the spot without taking the injured person along,” said a police official. Preliminary investigations revealed that the victim had been suffering from epilepsy. Mr. Binu lay on the roadside for nearly eight hours before dying of his injuries. Fire and rescue services personnel, who reached the spot around 8 a.m. on Thursday, shifted him to a hospital, though to no avail. The Ettumanur police have booked a case of unnatural death and are awaiting the post-mortem examination report to ascertain the exact cause of death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accident-victim-lies-on-road-for-8-hours-dies/article36768298.ece
01 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Sugar mills yet to pay around Rs. 21,000 crore to farmers’||Around Rs. 21,000 crore due to sugarcane farmers for having sold their produce to sugar mills across the country has not been paid for the last four years, said joint secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, Vijoo Krishnan. Addressing a State conference of sugarcane farmers pressing to resume operation of the National Cooperative Sugar Mills at Alanganallur on Thursday, Mr. Krishnan said that the interest for the pending money is huge. “The interest for deposits in banks is around 5% and some cooperative banks are paying as high as 11%. We demand that the Centre take efforts to not only pay the Rs. 21,000 crore to the farmers, but also the due interest,” he added. “No person can buy any product in the country without making the payment due for it. Then, how come only sugarcane farmers are denied money for the produce they had sold four years back,” he asked. The BJP promised to double farmers’ incomes, give 50% more as minimum support price of the production cost of crops, subsidy for seeds and loans at lower interest rates. But, after coming to power, it has betrayed the farmer by not implementing its poll promises. “Over one lakh farmers and farmhands have ended their lives in the last seven years of BJP rule,” he said. When farmers were in deep distress, the Centre has brought three farm laws to allow corporates to loot the hard work and land of farmers. By removing paddy, wheat, pulses, oilseeds, onions and potato from the list of essential commodities, the Centre has only allowed corporates to hoard them. The Essential Commodities Act ensured that basic foodgrains were not hoarded and were sold to people at an affordable price. But, now corporates can hoard the goods and export them, denying access to foodgrains to the local people, he said. Farmers in Delhi will not give up their year-long protest until the Centre repealed the new farm laws, he added. Madurai MP, Su. Venkatesan, said that the National Cooperative Sugar Mills has remained closed for two years. “The DMK government should take steps to resume crushing operation in the mill this year. The Chief Minister should give a financial assistance of Rs. 10 crore to the mill for resuming the operations,” he said. Besides, he said that sugarcane from cane growing areas of Dharani Sugar mills in Tenkasi district should be diverted to Alanganallur to ensure continuous running of the sugar mill. Tamil Nadu Cane Growers’ Association president, N. Palanisamy and secretary Raveendran, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sugar-mills-yet-to-pay-dues-to-farmers/article36768501.ece

01 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||GRH spearheads campaign to prevent limb amputation||Government Rajaji Medical College and Hospital has launched a campaign called ‘Love Your Limbs’ to make people aware of the symptoms and treatment for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), a circulatory condition in which blocked blood vessels reduce blood flow to the legs. This condition affects diabetic and geriatric patients more and can require limb amputation if not treated early, according to Saravanan Robinson, Head of Vascular Surgery at the GRH. WHO statistics indicate that 14 lakh PAD-triggered amputations are performed in the country every year, and below knee amputations are the commonest of them. With diabetic population rising in the country, it was a cause for concern. Dr. Robinson said those suffering from diabetes and cerebro-vascular disease and 60 per cent of those with Ischemic Heart Disease are vulnerable to infections and ulcers developing in their leg or foot. The figures for diabetic foot patients in the country were also alarming, he said. Those who suffered claudication – recurrent pain in their thighs and calf region that aggravated on walking and reduced after short rest – had to consult vascular surgeons as it was one of the most common early indicators, he sad. “Also for those who develop gangrene or non-healing wounds, the tissue dies of poor blood supply and it increases the risk of Critical Limb Ischemia and limb loss”, he added. The treatment for PAD was patient-specific. “The site and stage of infection decide the treatment modality,” said Dr. Robinson. The treatment included traditional peripheral bypass surgeries, minimally invasive endovascular and hybrid procedures. “If the affected arteries are tiny, the blood flow can be improved without surgical cuts. Advanced endovascular surgical procedures include invasive balloon angioplasty, stenting or directional atherectomy,” he said. “The new-age technology helps to restore circulation in big and small arteries and save the patient’s leg or foot from amputation,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grh-spearheads-campaign-to-prevent-limb-amputation/article36768597.ece
01 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Call for transparency in Covaxin clinical trials||The World Health Organization’s (WHO) refusal to grant Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for ICMR-Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine is a setback for the country’s vaccination programme. Indians travelling abroad with Covaxin shots are also finding it difficult to obtain visas or entry into other countries which generally recognise only WHO-approved vaccines. While the WHO has asked the company for more details, it is felt that the lack of transparency and public accountability has led to such a situation. All India People’s Science Network (AIPSN) representatives say the government’s failure to be transparent about the vaccine’s scientific rigour is also hardening vaccine hesitancy in India. AIPSN member in Madurai S. Krishnaswamy said failure of disclosing the clinical trials data during the earlier approval stage and now with its flawed application to WHO regulators, the government had damaged the country’s reputation. “It besmirches the standing of Indian science and regulatory systems. They will now come under heightened international scrutiny,” he said, adding “this was entirely foreseeable and yet no remedial steps were taken.” Prof. Krishnaswamy said Covaxin, among the first few COVID-19 vaccines developed, would have boosted India’s prestige if it had obtained approvals in India and abroad following the proper channel. In January, Bharat Biotech had applied to the Indian regulator with grossly inadequate data from clinical trials inviting rejection. Despite criticism from scientists and others in India, Bharat Biotech has failed to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. Instead, it got away with the backing of the Centre and recently even announced that the WHO approval was expected soon. Those who criticised and called for greater transparency were attacked by the government as anti-nationals, he pointed out. The AIPSN was now apprehensive of India repeating the same blunder in the approval process of Zydus Cadilla’s ZyCov-D 3-dose, the vaccine for those aged 12 and above. It was one of the 11 DNA-based vaccine candidates worldwide. “The regulatory agencies should assert their independence from both government and corporate interests, and make judgments based on scientific analysis,” read a statement from the AIPSN.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/call-for-transparency-in-covaxin-clinical-trials/article36768607.ece

Justice G. Ilangovan observed that several protests, agitations and demonstrations took place against NEET in Tamil Nadu. The ‘Right to Protest’ was well recognised and the court took note of the fact that the protesters had raised slogans against NEET. A reading of the FIR showed that slogan-shouting was not followed by any criminal or untoward instances, the court said. However, protesting without obtaining permission was not proper. The involvement of the petitioner, Anandasamy, was not properly investigated, the court said and quashed the criminal case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-quashes-case-against-anti-neet-protester/article36768811.ece

Keeping the applications pending for more than 30 days was contrary to the directions issued by the court and the government, the court observed. Taking note of the fact that there were more than six lakh pending applications for transfer of patta, Justice D. Krishnakumar directed the Director of Survey and Settlement and the Commissioner of Land Administration to ensure compliance in two weeks. Earlier, the court took a serious view of the fact that a large number of applicants were made to run from pillar to post to get a patta, even in those cases where there were no disputes. The court issued directions to the State to take effective steps to dispose of the pending applications. The State informed the court that effective steps were being taken to dispose of the pending applications. Taking note of the submission, the court directed the authorities concerned to file a further status report on October 5. The court was hearing a batch of petitions pertaining to transfer of pattas. The case was posted to October 6. It directed the Additional Director of Survey and Settlement to appear before the court with the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-steps-to-dispose-of-pending-applications-for-patta-high-court/article36768606.ece

District Health Officer Dhananjaya confirmed this and said that all of them are asymptomatic. They have been shifted to the COVID-19 Care Centre at Nagamangala as a precautionary measure. “There is no need to panic as the students are safe,” he said, adding that there is no need to infer the cases were indicative of a third wave, arguing that it was an isolated case and the infections were detected during random testing. Dr. Dhananjaya said 10% of the tests done in the district are confined to college students as part of routine surveillance. “We did tests on 400-plus students of the PU college after finding that a student had tested positive. Thereafter, 27 tested positive.” The college campus has been sanitised and it will be reopened for classes after Tuesday. Dr. Dhananjaya said that the contacts of the infected students have tested negative. Mandya’s positivity rate stands at 0.3%, with fewer than 10 cases for the past few days.

01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||SC defers Jaya panel case to Oct. 20||The Supreme Court on Thursday scheduled for October 20 a case concerning the Justice (retired) A. Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry into the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2016. A Bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari adjourned the hearing after senior advocate Aryama Sundaram, who appears for Apollo Hospitals where Jayalalithaa died, cited a personal difficulty. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave for Tamil Nadu government raised strong objection to the adjournment. However, the court agreed to hear the case after the Dussehra holidays. In the previous hearing, the inquiry commission said only four witnesses remained to be examined and the panel should be allowed to complete its work and place its fact-finding report before the State Legislative Assembly. The proceedings before the commission were stayed by the Supreme Court in April 2019 on the basis of a plea by Apollo Hospitals that the inquiry panel’s functioning was “replete with bias”. “Only four witnesses are left to be examined. A fact-finding inquiry report should be presented in the House. The House will then decide… 155 witnesses have been examined… only four more. The inquiry has been pending since 2017,” senior advocate Kumar had submitted. In 2019, the court had stayed the inquiry after Apollo Hospitals alleged that the commission, instead of conducting an impartial inquiry, had transformed itself into an adversary. Mr. Sundaram had argued for the hospital that the proceedings before the inquiry panel was causing “grave prejudice” to the hospital’s reputation. Tamil Nadu had, in 2019, urged the court to not stay the commission’s proceedings. However, the Bench had refused to oblige the State and proceeded to freeze the inquiry. The State had appointed the inquiry commission headed by Justice Arumughaswamy, a retired Madras High Court judge, on September 25, 2017. The Commission’s reference was to examine the circumstances which led to the hospitalisation of Jayalalithaa on September 22, 2016 and the nature of treatment given in order to determine the cause of hospitalisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hearing-in-jaya-panel-case-adjourned-to-oct-20/article36768489.ece
01 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Over million doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered in U.T.||The Union Territory crossed the milestone of administering a million doses of COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday. The region which began vaccinating priority segments of the population simultaneous to the nation-wide roll-out of the programme on January 16, has so far completed giving 10,03,013 doses. To date, 6,91,872 first doses of Covishield and 3,11,141 second doses of the vaccine have been administered. The administration is now focused on completing administering at least a single dose of vaccine to hitherto unvaccinated people numbering about three lakh. The Union Territory has an estimated 10 lakh population eligible for vaccination. Meanwhile, Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who, along with Chief Minister N. Rangasamy, visited a special vaccination camp in Kundupalayam, Mettupalayam, said the administration was going all out to ensure that the entire 10 lakh eligible population was either fully covered or vaccinated with at least a single dose of vaccine soon. According to the Lt. Governor, an estimated 70% of the population has been given the first dose and urged unvaccinated persons not to delay taking the jab.” It is noteworthy that through the vaccination programme, there has not been any shortage of vaccines in the Union Territory,” the Lt. Governor said. Meanwhile, with steady fall in coronavirus cases in recent months, the thrust of the health department’s messaging has shifted to promoting vaccination even while advising the public to adopt COVID-appropriate behaviour as the virus was still around. “We have broken through the phase of high vaccine hesitancy through our awareness campaigns. We are looking to maintain the momentum and achieve full coverage of the population,” Health Secretary T. Arun said. The department currently has a stock of about 2 lakh doses and planned to procure more as vaccination picks up, he said. The vaccination programme had been bogged down by slow offtake in the early days of the campaign, but had picked up speed in recent weeks. For instance, between January 16 and and June 10, only three lakh people had taken the first dose. By the beginning of July, the Union Territory had administered 5 lakh doses. “One of the first things we had addressed was to provide the facility closer to the community by decentralising the vaccine programme to local PHCs,” said Mr. Arun. Outreach interventions have since aimed to get the vaccination facility closer to the people. Health officials said the progress on the vaccination front had been driven by several initiatives, including special walk-in vaccination camps across 100 session sites in the Union Territory, street corner sessions, 48-hour non-stop sessions and door-to-door vaccination for the infirm and immobile categories. One of the ongoing drives is led by MLAs in their respective constituencies. The health department has dedicated a team of doctors and staff to each of these constituencies to manage vaccine session sites. “The key message to those who are still waiting to get a jab is that vaccination is safe. No adverse reaction has been reported as a result of taking the vaccine,” Mr. Arun said. Moreover, there is hard-to-ignore evidence that about 97% of ICU admissions of coronavirus patients is attributable to non-exposure to vaccination. Meanwhile, the health department reiterated that though the COVID-19 spread had reduced in Puducherry, it had not completely subsided. People should maintain all COVID-19 appropriate behaviour like hand washing, wearing face mask and maintaining social distancing as the festival season was approaching and the economy had opened up considerably. Those with COVID-19-like symptoms should immediately give sample for test and quarantine themselves. Everyone above 18 years of age should get vaccinated at the earliest, the department said. The health department appealed to the remaining people to get vaccinated at the earliest by utilising the vaccination services to make Puducherry safe and prevent third wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-administers-one-million-covid-19-doses/article36768611.ece
01 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Mushrooming roadside eateries spark concerns in U.T.||Several makeshift eateries, including street food joints, have come up near various institutions and government offices in Puducherry, selling a wide range of food items that pose a risk to people’s health. Hawkers selling food items like fried snacks and fruit juice outside government hospitals are a common sight. The authorities say they have made several efforts to remove them, but they just return to the spot the next day. “There is no quality check on the oil and other ingredients used in the preparation of these food items. Customers, who patronize such joints due to lower prices, would be at risk of developing health complications,” a health officer said. “Cleanliness is another area of concern, as a majority of them do not have proper arrangements. The food items are prepared in the open in a highly polluted environment. A few eateries are located near drains and also dump food waste into them,” says Lakshmiganthan, a resident of Saram. A majority of the eateries are unorganised and don’t have a licence under the Food Safety and Standards Act to operate or serve food to the public. “Street food, which is probably more easily available, is free from any supervision. As a result, hygiene is being compromised. This has led to adulteration and reuse of substances that can make the food unhealthy. We cannot even collect food samples for chemical analysis because they [the eateries] do not have a permanent address,” an official said. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has already flagged the possible adverse implications of the unregulated growth of food business operators on public health. Inspections conducted at 89 outlets revealed that 45% of them were functioning in unhygienic conditions and not in accordance with the norms prescribed under the Food Safety and Standards Rules, 2011. According to the report, food items classified as high risk were being cooked and displayed in the open outside restaurants/hotels. Besides, the general practices adopted with regard to storage of food items were found to be “unhygienic and unfit”. “The Department of Food Safety will be conducting drives across the coastal town to ensure that food vendors obey the rules. We have asked them to register themselves with FSSAI and display the registration certificate,” an official said.  Street food, which is probably more easily available, is free from any supervision.

The PCC functionaries wanted the AICC to take a stern stand on the alliance with the DMK for the local body polls, a PCC leader who took part in the meeting told The Hindu . The AICC delegation comprised Praveen Chakravarty, head of the party’s Data Analytics Department, Meenakshi Natarajan, former Member of Parliament, and Jothimani, Karur MP. “We have told the AICC delegation that if the party is in an alliance with the DMK, we should have a respectable position. The party should be leading the alliance, and should not yield to the demands of the Dravidian party on certain municipalities and wards,” the functionary said. The party functionaries had expressed their desire to keep the Puducherry Municipality under its fold, he said. Several members raised concerns about the Congress yielding to pressure from the DMK like it did during the seat-sharing talks for the Assembly polls. “We have lost many seats because those traditionally held by the party were snatched away from us. We should continue the alliance on respectable terms. Otherwise, we should contest the civic polls alone,” a functionary said. Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, MP V.

01 October 2021||Tenkasi,TAMIL NADU||Polling booths to get basic facilities||Zonal election officials have been asked to ensure basic facilities at the 1,328 polling booths in Tenkasi district ahead of the rural local body elections to be held on October 6 and 9. Addressing a meeting of the 69 zonal officials for the regions that would go for polls in the first phase, Collector S. Gopala Sundara Raj stressed that they should get all doubts about the election procedures cleared so that they could in turn help polling officials. Polling in the panchayat unions of Kadayam, Keezhappavoor, Melaneelithanallur, Alangulam and Vasudevanallur would be held on October 6, and other unions of Tenkasi, Sengottai, Sankarankoil, Kadayanallur and Kuruvikulam would go to polls on October 9. Poll Observer P. Sankar said the role of zonal officials was significant as they would be the bridge between the District Election Control room and the polling officials in the booths. They had been asked to inspect all the polling booths allocated to them in advance and check whether electricity, seating facilities, restrooms, drinking water, ramps and wheeler chairs for differently abled were available. They should also ensure proper law and order situation for free and fair polling. Besides making the presiding officers to fill up all information in various forms, the zonal officials should ensure handing over of the ballot boxes at the counting centres. The officials should prevent candidates from campaigning within 100 metres from the polling booths on the polling day. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu State Election Commission has made one dose of COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for the agents of candidates to take up polling and counting works. Based on the SEC instruction, the Collector told the agents of candidates to get at least one dose of vaccination. The agents would identify voters at the polling booths on the polling day and would follow counting of votes on the day of counting. Polling for rural local bodies, including 10 panchayat unions and 221 village panchayats and district panchayat will be taken up in two phases on October 6 and 9. He said that many agents had taken the vaccine on the third mega vaccination camp. “Adequate stocks of vaccine was available and they can get themselves vaccinated in the next few days,” the Collector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/polling-booths-to-get-basic-facilities/article36768981.ece
01 October 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Withdraw weekend closure of temples’||Devotees of Swaminatha Swamy Temple and local traders on Thusrday staged a demonstration at Swamimalai near Kumbakonam urging the State government to lift closure of temples during weekends. Participating in the demonstration held near the temple, they raised slogans condemning the government for shutting down shrines from Friday to Sunday while throwing open business establishments such as cinema theatres, parks and memorials. ‘Cinema halls open’ They said that while devotees were prevented from entering temples under the pretext that convergence large gatherings would result in spread of COVID-19, the same yard stick was not applied to TASMAC outlets and cinema halls. If ‘business interest’ was the reason behind the move, a sizeable number of vendors eked out their livelihood by selling ‘puja’ material and running hotels and shops for the benefit of devotees, the protesters pointed out. Further, while it would be easy for the officials to ensure that devotees followed the standard operating procedures scrupulously, they would not be able to enforce full adherence to the COVID-19 guidelines by movie goers and customers of TASMAC retail shops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/withdraw-weekend-closure-of-temples-say-devotees/article36768599.ece

01 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Basic amenities to be upgraded at Gangaikondacholapuram||Visitors to the famous Gangaikondacholisvarar Temple at Gangaikondacholapuram in Ariyalur district could look forward to better amenities soon as the Archaeological Survey of India is strengthening basic facilities at the temple complex. The ASI has currently taken up works at an estimate of about Rs. 3 crore to provide better amenities such as toilets and drinking water, cafeteria, public counter and parking area for the benefit of visitors to the temple, built by King Rajendra Chola-I. Following the conquest of the Gangetic plains in 1023 CE, Rajendra–I built the city of Gangaikondacholapauram, a Siva temple and a lake Chola Gangam in commemoration of his victory. The gigantic stone temple, which is a repository of beautiful sculptures, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Monument and is maintained by ASI. The temple, also referred to as Brahadeeswara temple, and the town are important tourist attractions in Ariyalur district. Separate toilets for men and women are being built as part of the project. Besides, a drinking water treatment plant and cafeteria are also being established. Another building housing a publication counter, where the ASI’s and other publications, including those on the temple, is also under construction. An approach pathway and lawn are also to be developed in between the buildings, whcih are being constructed without affecting the heritage ambience of the temple. A parking area is also being developed on an adjacent piece of land owned by State government, ASI sources told The Hindu . At present, vehicles are parked haphazardly under the trees in front of the temple. “The works, which slowed down due to the pandemic, are expected to be completed within about a month’s time,” an ASI official said. Similar amenities are being established at Sithanavasal and Kodumbalur also, a senior official said and added that the toilet complex at the Big Temple in Thanjavur has already been commissioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/basic-amenities-to-be-upgraded-at-gangaikondacholapuram/article36768616.ece
01 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Officials seek declaration of 100% literacy in Manikandam||Education officials of Manikandam have applied to initiate declaration of all adults in the block as 100% literate. The credit for the effort goes to over 300 government school teachers who went door-to-door to teach housewives and senior citizens, they said. Teachers appointed to various schools in the block undertook a census to enumerate the number of literate adults. It was found that at least 7,500 people, a majority of them women, were illiterate. Using the findings, the teachers drew up a plan to conduct classes for them. A total of 318 teachers undertook Karpom Ezhuthuvom (Let’s Learn, Let’s Write), an adult literacy programme initiated by the Department of School Education, in November last. Initially, they went door-to-door to monitor students' education through Kalvi TV and other methods and began teaching the people at the homes. When the number of students began to increase, they set up learning centres, usually a classroom or another common place. A total of 40 centres of at least 20 people each were set up. Following a year's worth of effort, 4,350 of of the 7,500 people have learnt to at least affix their signature. There were around 1,300 people with disabilities, including visually impaired, who could not be taught. The remaining had migrated to other parts of the district and had to be left out, said K. Marudhanayagam, Block Education Officer, Manikandam. "We undertook the project for nearly 5,000 people and we are happy to inform that 100% of them can sign their names. A total of 400 can read and write basic text, and 10 of them can study subjects meant for class 10 students,” he said. Watching their parents and grandparents learn, children also got motivated, Mr. Marudhanayagam said. “We send the adults homework to practice. When the children see their grandparents do homework instead of watching TV, they too follow." The BEO has written to the Chief Education Officer regarding the achievement and seeking declaration of the block as 100% literate. “I have sent a detailed list, including the names of individuals and phone numbers, in case the authorities wish to verify," the Block Education Officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-seek-declaration-of-100-literacy-in-manikandam/article36768601.ece
01 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||2GB data scheme delay is a dampener, say teachers||Though online classes are being conducted for the first-year students of arts and science colleges and a mix of online and offline mode is adopted for intermediate and final-year students, teachers say the delay in the implementation of the 2 GB data a day scheme for this academic year is a dampener. The teachers are apparently unable to prevail upon students to attend classes with a sense of authority. The attendance is, in general, poor, and pathetic at the afternoon session, they lament. “The assumption that all students have smart phones and can afford the daily expenses for digital data can well be termed myopic,” according to P. David Livingston, zonal secretary, Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers’ Association. “To a considerable extent, the possession of the laptops given by the government as a freebie at the higher secondary level is a huge advantage for students in rural parts. But the students are unable to put their laptops to the best use because of their inability to afford the cost of data on a daily basis,” he said. “We do emphasize attendance, but there is nothing much that could be done if the students do not attend the online classes. The attendance is only about 50% owing to the pause in the implementation of the scheme,” said M.S. Bala Murugan, State general secretary of the Association of University Teachers. The teachers are not entirely discounting the possibility of the colleges and universities reverting to offline teaching-learning in a month or two. The Higher Education Department is perhaps thinking that the free data may not be required in such an eventuality. But the students will need the free data as the University Grants Commission (UGC) is keen on making it mandatory for higher education institutions to adopt the blended mode of learning under which 40% of any course is taught online and the rest offline, in keeping with the National Education Policy, 2020, college heads pointed out. The UGC draft suggests that the blended mode will not only increase skills among students but will also give them greater access to information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/2gb-data-scheme-delay-is-a-dampener-say-teachers/article36768451.ece

01 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Transgender SHG promotes organic fertilizers, pesticides||A self-help group of 10 transgender women in the city is manufacturing organic fertilizers and pesticides to increase awareness of eco-friendly agriculture and gardening. The enterprise, functioning from a stall at Poomalai Vaniga Valagam building on Bharatidasan Salai, is also an attempt to raise the profile of the marginalised third gender. “Transgender people are often dismissed as being ‘unnatural’; we started this business to show that we too can be protectors of nature,” said Kajol, the transgender businesswoman and activist who leads the group that goes by the name of ‘Tiruchi Pasumai Pattru’. Ms. Kajol told The Hindu that she became interested in manufacturing organic agricultural inputs after reading and watching online tutorials about Indian green crusader G. Nammalvar. “We started our plant nursery last year during lockdown to cater to people who were interested in growing vegetables and herbs for personal use. As the venture took off, our customers kept requesting us for eco-friendly materials to nurture their plants and fortify the soil. This is when 10 of us from the transgender community decided to attend a certificate course in organic farming methods at the ICAR-Krishi Vigyan Kendra [affiliated to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University] at Siruganur; we felt that formal training would help us to give the right advice to customers,” Ms. Kajol said. At present, the group’s members meet over the weekend to prepare batches of fish extract (also known as fish amino acid), a nitrogen-rich liquid manure made from fish waste layered with jaggery that has been fermented for 25 days. The group also makes ‘panchakavya’ an organic product that is said to boost plant immunity and act as a natural pesticide. Made by mixing cow dung, urine, milk, ghee and yoghurt, ‘panchakavya’ takes 45 days of processing before it can be used. “Some people prefer to speed up fermentation by adding ripe poovan bananas or tender coconut water, but we like to follow the traditional formula,” said Ms. Kajol. The group also uses pesticide’s base ingredients to make oil lamps that burn down completely when lit. “‘Panchakavya’ lamps are considered to be auspicious, and the ash can be reused in multiple ways,” she said. All products are priced considerably lower than those already available in the market. The group has requested help from authorities for a small herd of indigenous cattle and a place to manufacture the organic materials. “If we have our own facility, it will be easier to organise the schedule of our members, and also generate employment for others. Since we are using what is normally discarded, an official premises will facilitate our service to society,” added Ms. Kajol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgender-shg-promotes-organic-fertilizers-pesticides/article36768604.ece
01 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Teachers for clear-cut guidelines on ‘Spoken English’ classes||Teachers of government and government-aided schools anticipateclear-cut guidelines from the school education department for ‘Spoken English’ classes. Earlier this month, School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said 30 minutes would be devoted daily to enhance English proficiency of students from class VI to XII. Most of the upper primary schools are not sure if the proficiency sessions will be centered around only reading exercises or include listening, speaking and writing too. The learning of English needs to encompass LSRW skills to be more effective, say language teachers. There may be limitations in making children learn in the classroom since the process has to be participatory in nature, they feel. Moreover, one section of school heads has plans to conduct the ‘Spoken English’ classes during lunch break, while others think it fit to conduct them after school hours. Some suggest that they must be integrated into the regular schedule, besides the usual English classes, to infuse a sense of seriousness in the minds of the students. Welcoming the idea of equipping students with English-speaking skills, a senior government teacher says there will be practical difficulties in retaining students beyond class hours. “It will be ideal if separate content is formulated by experts for Spoken English factoring in the learning abilities of children in rural parts,” another teacher says. Government teachers feel headmasters must have leverage to rope in more English teachers from local private schools. Then they will be able to teach students in smaller groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-for-clear-cut-guidelines-on-spoken-english-classes/article36768608.ece

01 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Excavation to be taken up at Adichanallur||The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will soon take up excavation and conservation works as part of an initiative to develop Adichanallur, an Iron Age urn-burial site near Tirunelveli, as an iconic archaeological site. Situated about 24 km from Tirunelveli in southern Tamil Nadu, Adichanallur is one of five archaeological sites to be developed as “iconic sites” in the country as announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2020-21. Adichanallur generated much interest after a burial urn with human skeletons and Tamil-Brahmi script, potsherds and the remains of habitational site of Iron Age people were unearthed during the ASI’s earlier round of excavation in 2004-2005. The ASI’s Tiruchi Circle has now forwarded a proposal for taking up excavation at the site. “We have forwarded the proposal to the Director-General and expecting approval soon. Once the approval is received, we will begin excavation and in situ conservation works at Adichanallur, which is the only site in south India in the list of five archaeological sites identified for development as iconic sites,” T. Arun Raj, Superintending Archaeologist, ASI, Tiruchi Circle, toldThe Hindu, on the eve of the circle’s first anniversary here. The new administrative circle, created by bifurcating ASI’s Chennai Circle, came into existence in Tiruchi on October 1 last year with jurisdiction over 160 monuments and sites in 21 central and southern districts under its control. Elaborating on the plans of the circle for the coming year, Mr. Raj says the excavation at Adichanallur will be a major initiative. “It is one of the oldest megalithic sites in the country dating back to 1,000 BC. The last round of excavation was done in 2004-05 [the State Department of Archaeology too carried separate excavations at Adichanallur]. The objective will be to expose and conserve urns and objects in situ so that tourists can walk through and view the finds.” The ASI will also be setting up a site museum where previously recovered material will be displayed. “We have earmarked the land adjacent to the excavation site. The Thoothukudi district administration has agreed to hand over the parcel of land sought by ASI,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/asis-tiruchi-circle-to-take-up-excavation-at-adichanallur/article36768619.ece

Appavu has objected to the establishment of a spent fuel storage on the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project site, citing the increasing Chinese presence in neighbouring Sri Lanka. Talking to journalists here on Thursday, Mr. Appavu, the MLA from the Radhapuram constituency, wherein the project is located, said the Union government should reconsider its decision to locate the spent fuel storage at Kudankulam. “As long as Sri Lanka was a friendly nation, the situation was different. But there is an increasing presence of China in the island nation which is posing a threat to the KKNPP,” he said. All the southern districts of Tamil Nadu and the southern parts of Kerala would be impacted in case of any untoward incident, he warned. Besides, a huge facility of the Indian Space Research Organisation was located at Mahendragiri, just 25 km from Kundankulam. The Centre could shift the location for the spent fuel storage to the unused mines of Kolar Gold Fields in Karnataka or to the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. “Ideally, this facility should be located at a place that is uninhabited by people.” It is still not clear where the spent fuel of units 1 and 2 that have been generating power for the last few years is stocked. “In a democracy, the government should be transparent and disclose where the spent fuel is being stocked,” he said. When that was not decided yet, why should the Centre finalise the spent fuel storage for units 3 and 4 which are under construction, the Speaker asked. He appealed to the Centre not to further expand the project under which six units have been proposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speaker-opposes-location-of-spent-fuel-storage/article36768453.ece

The operation, which has stretched into the seventh day since a 56-year-old man was killed in Devan Estate in Gudalur, is being spearheaded by officials and staff from the MTR and Gudalur forest division. Bhosale Sachin Thukkaram, Deputy Director of MTR (Core Area), and District Forest Officer (in-charge) of Gudalur division, told The Hindu that the tiger was spotted once again in Devan Estate where it had crossed on Wednesday. “We have spotted the tiger, T23, and are attempting to get close to it to try and tranquilize it with a dart,” said Mr. Thukkaram. To get close to the animal, the Forest Department is using the assistance of two kumkis from MTR. Srinivasan, one of the kumkis, has already made his way to the operation area, while another kumki is expected to join the operation in the coming days. Officials said the kumkis will be used as a perch from where veterinarians can shoot their darts at the tiger, or to drive the animal to a suitable area from where it would be easier to capture it. The animal is believed to be more than 10-years-old, and could be carrying an injury rendering it incapable of hunting wildlife to sustain itself, necessitating its switch to a diet of cattle which have been allowed to stray close to its habitat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-kumkis-to-join-search-for-tiger/article36768482.ece

Apart from cash, which was seized mostly from toilets and storerooms in the office, documents were also seized during the search. Thursday's surprise check comes less than a week after the DVAC's Vellore unit searched three places, including the Aavin office in Sathuvachari on the Bengaluru Highway (NH 48) in Vellore, in connection with a case relating to former Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration K.C. Veeramani. Documents were also reportedly seized during that search. Two teams, comprising four officials each, led by DVAC officials Vijayalakshmi and Vijay, conducted the surprise check between 4.30 p.m and 8.30 p.m on Thursday in the newly built Sub-Registrar office. The Sub-Registrar, Vanitha, who had recently taken charge, was present. However, the DVAC officials said that no cash was seized from her cabin. “Obviously, the check was based on a strong tip-off. We seized cash from this Sub-Registrar office after it was shifted from the Vellore Fort to the present location a few years ago. The office was always on our radar,” said a DVAC official. Likewise, the DVAC officials also seized Rs. 2 lakh unaccounted cash from the office of the Assistant Director (AD), the Town Planning section in the Tiruvannamalai Municipality during a surprise check on Thursday. The DVAC officials said that the Sub-Registrar office in Vellore was not the only one where such unaccounted cash had been seized.

China and India are the two largest shareholders of the multilateral development bank, which was launched in 2016, and now has, according to the bank, 103 members. A statement from AIIB said the project involved “the construction of a new corridor in Chennai’s Metro network, as part of Chennai Metro Rail phase 2”. It will run from Lighthouse in the east to the Poonamallee Bypass in the west “to ensure seamless multimodal transport across Chennai, by providing integrated access to suburban rail, bus stations and the city’s airport.” The goal, the bank said, was “to address traffic bottlenecks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing public urban transport options.” “This project is aligned with AIIB’s mandate to support high-quality and sustainable infrastructure. The improvement and integration of the transport sector in Chennai will further promote trade and economic growth,” AIIB’s vice-president of investment operations D.J. Pandian, who is from India, said. AIIB said the project would be implemented by the Chennai Metro Rail Limited, and “the project’s design and construction will have environment-friendly features to help reduce its carbon footprint.” “In addition to solar panels on the roofs of the elevated stations, the project will have dedicated spaces for bicycles and green vehicles and signage to raise environmental awareness. The project also integrates climate change resilience features to reduce its vulnerability to climate-related events,” the bank said. India has received loans from AIIB for 28 projects worth $6.7 billion — more than any other country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/356-million-loan-for-chennai-metro/article36768463.ece

Hence, following the graded approach, the review emphasised the impact of the plant on the site, like radiological impact, owing to postulated releases during normal operations and accidents and radioactive waste management. G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal said that instead of finding a location for a deep geological repository for safe disposal of nuclear waste, as directed by the Supreme Court, NPCIL was seeking permission for constructing an Away From Reactor disposal location for reactors 3 and 4. “Permission for Away From Reactor disposal can be granted once the location of the deep repository is found,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spent-fuel-storage-cleared-for-kudankulam-units-3-4/article36768456.ece

Narayana Gowda said on Thursday, adding that efforts had been made to close down the school in the past. The Minister, who reviewed the civil works on Thursday, including the construction of hangars, said the restarted school would be launched by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. “Already, 34 students have enrolled in the flying school. We are hastening the works to ensure that it reopens quickly to offer employment opportunities to students from rural areas,” he said. Saying that a conspiracy had been hatched to close down the flying school, the Minister said it was the reason no efforts were made to reopen the school for four years. “Efforts were not made to fill up the faculty vacancies and no attempt was made to acquire the land required for the runway. No one bothered when buildings came up around the aerodrome, in violation of the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation] norms. Efforts had been made to put the flying school, whose property is valued at hundreds of crores, to disuse. I am taking steps to rectify the issues.” The Minister also said that the flying school was yet to get dues towards land acquired for the national highway project. “A compensation amount of Rs. 10 crore was given, while Rs. 13 crore as interest is yet to be given. I am taking steps to recover the interest amount that is due. The flying school still needs three acres and the process to acquire it is on.” Mr. Gowda also said that the government, along with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, was surveying the 5-km radius to identify buildings that are above 45 m in height and are in violation of the DGCA guidelines. “We will complete the survey and take action against the violators. Efforts are also on to recover rental dues from aircraft companies. They will be allowed to function from the aerodrome after the payment of full dues.” The Minister added that the government was making an effort to develop the land commercially with private partnership for tourism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jakkur-flying-school-set-to-restart-with-runway-ready-in-a-week/article36768401.ece
01 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court quashes sale of CA site by KHB to trust||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday quashed an absolute sale deed registered in violation of rules by the Karnataka Housing Board (KHB) in respect of a civic amenities (CA) site in the city in favour of a trust managed by the wife of Lok Sabha member Umesh G. Jadhav. While directing the KHB to take possession of the site, the court directed the State government to conduct an inquiry on how officials executed an absolute sale deed in favour the trust on July 28, 2020 when the law permits execution of only lease deed in respect of CA sites. Fine imposed The court imposed a cost of Rs. 1 lakh on the KHB while directing the government to recover the cost from the officials responsible for the violation. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order while allowing a PIL petition filed by 72-year-old Adinarayanashetty of Koramangala. The petitioner had questioned the legality of the absolute sale deed executed in favour of Murthy Charitable Trust, managed by its president Gayathri Jadhav. The KHB had executed the absolute sale deed in respect of CA site number 35, 5th Phase, Yelahanka New Town, measuring around 278.73 sq. m, for a price of Rs. 21.87 lakh. Observing that “the procedure has been given up for obvious reasons,” the Bench said that “if such execution of sale deeds are permitted, there will be total anarchy in the system and lead to favouritism”. The Bench also observed that “the most shocking aspect of the case is that the mentality of the KHB in violating the provisions of the law governing allotment of civic amenity sites”. Initially, a conditional sale deed in respect of the same site, measuring an area of 232 sq. m, was executed in favour of the trust on August 23, 2004, for setting up an educational institution by imposing conditions that building for the institution should be constructed within three years,  lease period is for five years with provision for extension and cancellation of the lease in case of violation of any condition. Conditions violated However, the trust violated the conditions as it had neither put up any construction nor utilised the CA site even after more than 15 years. The KHB, instead of cancelling the lease for breach of conditions, executed absolute deed in favour of the trust by collecting Rs. 21.87 lakh besides extending the area of the land. The Bench also expressed displeasure over the conduct of the trust for going back on its undertaking given to the court on March 31, 2021 that it would execute a deed of cancellation of the sale deed. The trust had given the undertaking after the court decided to hold that the site was given illegally, but on August 30 it filed a petition seeking review of the court’s March 31 order in which the trust’s undertaking was recorded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-quashes-sale-of-ca-site-by-khb-to-trust-managed-by-mps-wife/article36768656.ece

01 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Baby died of strangulation, not starvation, say police||The nine-month-old baby boy who was found dead after his grandmother, mother, and two other adults allegedly killed themselves at their residence in mid-September had reportedly been strangled to death. The four adults have been booked posthumously for murder. “A case under Section 302 of the IPC has been registered against the other deceased in the house for the death of the toddler. Evidence shows the death happened due to strangulation,” said a senior police officer who is part of the investigation. On September 17, the bodies of Bharathi (51) and her children, Sinchana (34), Madhusagar (25), and Sindhurani (31), the mother of the baby boy, were discovered by the police at their residence in Byadarahalli. They had killed themselves three or four days earlier. The police also found the body of the baby on the bed. Sinchana’s two-and-a-half-year-old daughter survived the trauma, but needed immediate medical care. Initially, it was reported in the media that the toddler was suspected to have died of starvation, but the probe has revealed that he had been strangled to death. “The facial bone was fractured and there were ligature marks found on the neck. The postmortem and FSL reports confirmed the cause of death, following which the police have registered a case of murder,” said the senior police officer. However, they are yet to determine who carried out the act. The police found three death notes in different rooms in the house, reportedly written by the deceased accusing the owner of the house and Bharathi’s husband, H. Shankar, of constantly harassing them. “We have seized laptops, mobile phones, CCTV footage, and other electronic equipment to corroborate their claims. We have also recovered the laptop and mobile phones used by Shankar,” said a police officer. He added that they were investigating the validity of the claims. Medical evidence revealed that Madhusagar was the last person alive.

01 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BMRCL receives NOC to build metro corridor||A major hurdle to building a metro line linking Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to the city centre has been cleared. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) has received an NOC to build the proposed elevated corridor near the Government Flying Training School, Jakkur, in the city. Anjum Parwez, managing director of BMRCL, said the metro corridor would run parallel to the existing flyover built by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), as planned. However, the proposed metro corridor would be constructed at a lower level, around two metres below the existing flyover. “We have cleared one of the major hurdles by getting the required NOC from the flying school to build a metro line near the aerodrome. The proposed elevated line will not pose an obstacle to the operations of Jakkur Aerodrome,” Mr. Parwez said. For the construction of metro piers, the BMRCL will use land that was acquired by the NHAI. “As a goodwill gesture, the BMRCL will construct a hangar, side walls, etc. at an estimated cost of Rs. 4 crore to Rs. 5 crore,” he added. Controversy surrounding the metro line’s proximity to Jakkur Aerodrome has been in the news for more than two years. The issue had also reached the High Court of Karnataka. The 58-km Namma Metro airport line from Silk Road to KIA is estimated to cost Rs. 14,778 crore. The BMRCL has already started construction work on the stretch between Silk Board and K.R. Puram. For the remaining line, the contract is likely to be awarded by October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-receives-noc-to-build-metro-corridor/article36768394.ece
01 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Deadline to fill potholes extended: Minister||The civic body, which had to fill potholes on nearly 14,000 km of road by September 30, has been granted a reprieve. Given the countless bad reaches and potholes which still remain, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has been given new deadlines: till October 10 to fill potholes on major roads and till October 25 to fill those on interior and ward roads. The decision was taken by Minister for Revenue R. Ashok after he chaired a meeting with BBMP officials on Thursday. These are the new and final deadlines to fill all potholes, he told reporters. The loads from the hot mix plant were insufficient to fill potholes on interior roads. As a solution, Mr. Ashok said that local contractors could be asked to fill potholes. Every ward has funds amounting to Rs. 20 lakh that could be utilised. The Minister said he has directed the BBMP to blacklist the contractors of such roads. Issuing notice Admitting to delays in demolishing 175 out of 185 buildings already identified as weak and dilapidated in 2019, Mr. Ashok said he has given the BBMP one week to issue notice to the owners of these buildings. After a week, the BBMP will write to Bescom asking it to cut off power supply to these buildings. “The BBMP will coordinate with the local police and demolish these buildings. The cost of demolition will be added to the property tax,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/deadline-to-fill-potholes-extended-minister/article36768399.ece

However notwithstanding the opposition, the officials carried out the drive. As officially notified earlier, HDUDA officials, led by chairman Nagesh Kalburgi, had reached the illegal layout at Malapur in Dharwad on Thursday to demolish the illegal structures in the layout. But the land owner objected to the drive and urged the authorities to suspend it as people had already purchased sites and he sought time to regularise the layout. There was a heated exchange of words following which a person, named Mehboob Patthan, who accompanied the land owner Sayed Ismail Shetsanadi, staged the dharna before the earthmover. However, the authorities convinced him not to cause any obstruction to government officials doing their duty. They continued the drive and cleared drains and electricity poles erected at the site. Mr. Kalburgi asked people who had purchased the site to visit HDUDA and follow the guidelines in order to regularise their sites. He said although there was a provision for regularising unauthorised layouts, structures like electricity poles, drains, and boundary stones will be removed. He also asked the land owner and developer to give a written assurance of fulfilling the government norms before selling the sites to customers. He said that there was no question of supporting real estate developers developing illegal layouts and HDUDA would act against all such persons without yielding to political pressure. Meanwhile, president of Janjagruti Vedike Basavaraj Koravar argued with the officials that drive was being conducted at the behest of Dharwad Rural MLA Amrut Desai who indulged in political vendetta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/authorities-demolish-illegal-structures-in-dharwad/article36768646.ece
01 October 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Forest official urges Dharwad residents not to heed rumours||In the wake of a video of a wildcat attack going viral on social media creating panic among the residents of Dharwad district, the Forest authorities have clarified that no such incident had taken place in the district and urged people not to pay heed to such rumours. On Thursday, a video of a wild cat entering the backyard of a house on Wednesday and attacking an elderly woman went viral on social media with a message that it had happened in Kalaghatagi area of Dharwad district. The video caused panic as recently some residents had sighted a stray leopard and one was captured by the forest officials. Following the development, Deputy Conservator of Forest Yashpal Kshirsagar issued a statement on Thursday evening urging the public not to heed to rumours. In his statement, he has said that the district had a protected forest spanning over 1,400 hectares in Giriyal, Katnur, Gudisagar, Anchatageri, and Boodanagudda villages adjoining the Yellapur-Sirsi region and it was natural for wild animals to live in the forest. However the Forest Department had not received any report of leopard sighting on Wednesday in Gudisagar, Boodanagudda, Anchatageri, and adjoining areas. However officials were keeping a continuous vigil over the area, he has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forest-official-urges-dharwad-residents-not-to-heed-rumours/article36768647.ece

01 October 2021||Hubballi/Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Bypolls: Pick of candidates tough for BJP, less so for Cong., JD(S)||With the notification for the byelections to Hangal and Sindgi Assembly constituencies slated for Friday, the race for the party ticket has become intense in the BJP with aspirants making all-out efforts to woo the party high command. Relatively, there is not much confusion in either the Congress or the Janata Dal (Secular). The Congress is likely to stick with its earlier decision on the candidate for Sindgi and is most likely to field the defeated candidate in Hangal. The JD(S) has announced its candidate for Hangal and is yet to do so for Sindgi, which it held. The byelection to the Hangal Legislative Assembly constituency has been necessitated owing to the demise of six-time MLA and former Minister C.M. Udasi of the BJP and that to Sindgi seat has been necessitated owing to the demise of two-time MLA and former Minister M.C. Managuli of the JD(S). Daughter-in-law in race C.M. Udasi’s son Shivakumar Udasi is a Member of Parliament and now his wife, Revathi, is aspiring to step into her father-in-law’s shoes. Her candidature is reportedly backed by local Sangh Parivar leaders. The former MLA and MLC Shivaraj Sajjanar, BJP Haveri district unit president Siddaraja Kalakoti, and district general secretary and former ZP member Krishna Iliger are noteworthy names in the race. MLC Srinivas Mane, who lost the previous election by a few thousand votes and who has continued his work in the constituency, is most likely to be the Congress candidate. The dissenting Manohar Tahasildar, former MLA, is likely to be pacified. For Hangal, the JD(S) had announced its candidate in June when Niyaz Sheikh, a former Congressman, joined the party. Early start The situation in Sindgi is a bit different. Parties had begun preparations for the election in May, thinking that bypoll would be held along with that in Basavakalyan and Maski. As the late Minister Managuli’s son Ashok Managuli joined the Congress in April and the party immediately declared him as the candidate. However, dissidence is brewing in the Congress since then, with disgruntled former MLA Sharanappa Sunagar and local leaders Mehboob Tamboli and Vithal Rao forming a group to oppose his candidature. Congress leaders such as former Minister M.B. Patil are busy firefighting but have categorically ruled out a change in the candidate. Meanwhile, Mr. Managuli’s another son Shantaver Managuli has stayed away from the Congress. In May, the BJP had set up a committee led by the then Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi. Now, Mr. Savadi, ex-Minister, is back as party in charge for the bypoll. The BJP is reportedly looking at a candidate who could fight the 2023 election too. Aspirants in the BJP camp are Ramesh Bhusnur, former MLA, and Ashok Allapure, chairman of the Karnataka State Lime Development Board. Having lost a prospective candidate after Mr. Ashok Managul’s exit, the JD(S) is reportedly considering Ravikant Patil, a two-time MLA, who has now joined the party.  Hangal seat was earlier held by late C.M. Udasi of BJP Sindgi was represented by late M.C. Managuli of JD(S)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bypolls-pick-of-candidates-tough-for-bjp-less-so-for-cong-jds/article36768419.ece
01 October 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Conduct crop loss survey and compensate farmers: B.R. Patil||Congress leader and former MLA for Aland B.R. Patil demanded that the State government immediately conduct a survey of crop loss owing to the recent rains in Kalaburagi district and pay compensation to affected farmers. In a letter to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday, Mr. Patil noted that the standing crops on 1,35,000 hectares in the district were destroyed in the rains that had lashed for the last one month. He also reminded the government of last year’s floods that destroyed most of the crops in the district and the non-payment of crop insurance to the farmers. “Last year, the district received the highest rainfall of 1,060 mm and most of the crops had been destroyed. The farmers, who had already been in crisis due to COVID-19, had to suffer further as they did not receive the amount insured on their crop. This season, crops on 1,35,000 hectares, of the total 7,48,485 hectares sown, have completely been destroyed in the rains that lashed for the last one month,” Mr. Patil said in the letter demanding Mr. Bommai conduct a crop loss survey in the district and pay the compensation to the farmers who had lost their crops in the floods in the last two years. Mr. Patil also raised the issue of falling prices of black gram and green gram, the major crops in the district, in the market and demanded the government to open procurement centres and purchase the crop at Minimum Support Price (MSP). “As per the MSP announced by the Union government, the farmers should get at least Rs. 7,275 for a quintal of green gram. But, the crop is being sold between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 5,500 in the open market. If the prices of farm produces fall below the MSP, the government should immediately intervene and purchase the produces at MSP,” Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conduct-crop-loss-survey-and-compensate-farmers-br-patil/article36768651.ece

Addressing a media conference recently, he said: “Karnataka is the first State to implement NEP 2020. All universities in the State have started preparations to implement the policy after the State government and the Karnataka State Higher Education Council gave their approvals.

This curriculum is approved by the Academic Council and Syndicate of the university and will be implemented from this academic year,” Mr. Agsar said. To a question, the Vice-Chancellor said that admissions have started only for the four-year degree course as per NEP 2020 and over 40,000 students have already taken admissions to various undergraduate courses. “Skill development based on local industries is given adequate focus in the new curriculum as per the NEP 2020. By the time the undergraduate degree course is completed, a student will possess a set of skills required for the job he is going to do. As per NEP 2020, a student can attend classes in other colleges if his college lacks a specific facility. Grade will be given after the completion of each year and degree with honour will be given to those who complete the entire four-year course,” Mr. Agsar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gulbarga-varsity-to-implement-nep-from-2021-22-academic-year/article36768655.ece
01 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||SR rejects timing revision proposal for Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction train||The popular demand for a passenger-friendly timetable for the Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction-Vijayapura Express Special, a service connecting coastal Karnataka with Kalyana Karnataka, has been turned down by Southern Railway. Sanjeev Kishore, general manager of South Western Railway (SWR), recently wrote to G.M. Siddeshwar, Davangere MP, that Southern Railway had intimated the zone that the proposal for early arrival of Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction Service at Mangaluru (9.30 a.m.) and its delayed departure (5.30 p.m.) from Mangaluru Junction towards Vijayapura was not feasible. Southern Railway informed SWR that both the timings are peak hours when platforms at Mangaluru Junction would be occupied by other trains. Hence, the proposed revision of timings was not feasible at this juncture, Southern Railway said. Mangaluru Junction is under the jurisdiction of the Southern Railway while Vijayapura is under SWR. Besides Mr. Siddeshwar, Nalin Kumar Kateel, Dakshina Kannada MP, too had written to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnav seeking timetable revision saying it was inconvenient to passengers. Introduced in November 2019, Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction Tatkal Special (Train No. 07327) was leaving Vijayapura at 6 p.m. to reach Mangaluru Junction at 12.40 p.m. via Bagalkot, Hubballi, Davangere, and Hassan. Train No. 07328, Mangaluru Junction-Vijayapura Tatkal Express Special used to leave at 4.30 p.m. to reach Vijayapura at 11.45 a.m. As the services connected the coastal region with Bombay Karnataka and Kalyana Karnataka, the public had been demanding its reintroduction once the government eased COVID-19 restrictions. They also wanted revision of train’s arrival and departure timings in Mangaluru on the ground that they were inconvenient. Responding to Southern Railway’s refusal for timing revision, Mysuru Division’s Railway Users’ Consultative Committee member Rohith Jain from Davangere said: “Southern Railway has again proven that it is not working for the interest of people of Karnataka.” Rail activist Gopalakrishna Bhat from Mangaluru said this was the precise reason people in the coast are demanding merger of Mangaluru railway region with SWR. He alleged Southern Railway never bothered to serve the people of Karnataka and instead focused on Kerala and Tamil Nadu from Mangaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sr-rejects-timing-revision-proposal-for-vijayapura-mangaluru-junction-train/article36768823.ece
01 October 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||MCC to illuminate areas around Kudroli, Mangaladevi temples||Mangaluru Dasara this time will see more lights as the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has decided to illuminate streets and buildings around Mangaladevi temple in addition to Kudroli Gokarnanatha temple. Nominated councillor Radhakrishna on Thursday told the ordinary meeting of MCC here that the Kudroli Gokarnanatha temple management was illuminating streets where the Mangaluru Dasara Shobha Yatre was being taken out, including Kudroli Temple, Mannagudde, Lady Hill Circle, PVS Junction, Navabharat Circle, Hampankatta, Car Street, and New Chitra Theatre. However, he said the temple management appears unable to arrange lighting this year because of a drop in income following the pandemic. As such, it would be apt on the part of the corporation to arrange lighting as Mangaluru Dasara is one of the few notable events of the city. Another councillor said a similar lighting arrangement should also be made on roads leading to Mangaladevi temple. Mayor Premanand Shetty said the MCC will bear the expenses of lighting around the two temples. Agreeing with councillor Shashidhar Hegde, Mr. Shetty said budgetary provision will be made for this purpose from next year, which will help MCC get funds from the State government. The council proposed naming the road from A.B. Shetty Circle to the first railway bridge at Marnamikatte via Mangaladevi temple and Shami Katte as Mangaladevi Road. Already, the stretch between A.B. Shetty Circle and Mangaladevi temple bears the Mangaladevi Road name. The new proposal covers Car Street through which the chariot of Mangaladevi is drawn during its annual festival. The Mayor said the proposal will be referred to the MCC Standing Committee on Town Planning and Reforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-illuminate-areas-around-kudroli-mangaladevi-temples/article36768833.ece

Shetty Circle, Hamilton Circle, and Rao and Rao Circle will be referred to the District Traffic Advisory Committee for redressal, said Mayor Premanand Shetty on Thursday. Councillor A.C. Vinayraj said the new circular one-way movement, which came into effect from September 23, has been causing problems to motorists and pedestrians. Mr. Vinayraj said motorists coming from St. Ann’s College and from Bunder are forced to take a circular route to reach their destination. “The changes have been brought by keeping the council in the dark,” he said. The Mangaluru Smart City Ltd., which is doing the city beautification work, is not empowered to suggest circular one-way movement. Councillor Sudheer Shetty Kannur said the circular one-way movement has been enforced to ensure clog-free movement of vehicles in the central part of the city. He said it was following public consultation that the Police Commissioner notified the circular movement. One-way movement was already on the Hamilton Circle–Rao and Rao Circle-Clock Tower route and now Clock Tower-A.B. Shetty Circle-Hamilton Circle route has been added, he said. While confirming with contention of Mr. Kannur, Mr. Shetty said problems namely because of incomplete pedestrian underpass between Mini Vidhana Soudha and Lady Goschen Hospital needs to be addressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/circular-one-way-movement-problems-will-be-addressed/article36768831.ece

01 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Waiting for TAC report on audience for Dasara: Sudhakar||Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar on Thursday said guidelines have been sought from the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on the permissible limit of audience for the Jamboo Savari and the cultural events on the palace premises during the Dasara festivities. Approval has been sought for letting 500 persons to watch the daily cultural events organised on the palace premises and the final decision rests with the TAC, he added. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, he said the seating arrangement can be done keeping a distance of three-and-a-half metres at the events. With this seating arrangement and complying with all the SOPs, the events can be organised. “In this connection, we have written to the TAC for its advisory and have also sought the guidelines. Based on its reply, guidelines and advisory, the government will take the next steps on the permissible gathering in Mysuru Dasara,” he replied. Earlier, participating in Modi Yug Utsav organised in Krishnaraja constituency, he lashed out at the Congress for politicising the COVID-19. India got overwhelming support and help from across the world in the second wave as the country led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped nations during the first wave, supplying the vaccines, he claimed. K.R. constituency MLA and former Minister S.A. Ramdas was present. He alleged that the Opposition misled the public, describing the vaccines as “BJP vaccine” or “Modi vaccine”. Later, the Opposition realised the value of the vaccines in the fight against COVID-19. In K.R. constituency, 2.5 lakh doses of vaccine had been administered, and it stands first in the State in the vaccination coverage. He said 80 per cent of the eligible population in the State had been vaccinated and added that Karnataka has overtaken bigger States in terms of vaccination coverage. The government is fully prepared to combat the third wave if at all it comes. The Minister later inaugurated a vaccination drive in the constituency. Speaking on the occasion, he said 100 per cent vaccination has been done in K.R. constituency. The highest number of people vaccinated in the State is in this constituency, he said, thanking Mr. Ramdas for his efforts in making it happen. He said vaccination in some villages and hilly areas has been slow for various reasons. Though 80 per cent of vaccination has been done in the State, reluctance in some areas will be overcome soon and 100 per cent vaccination will be achieved soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/waiting-for-tac-report-on-audience-for-dasara-sudhakar/article36768847.ece
01 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Cannon firing practice goes off smoothly; jumbos remain calm||Barring a couple of elephants, most Dasara jumbos remained stable to the loud sound during the cannon firing practice held on the premises of Mysuru palace on Thursday to familiarise the jumbos to the booming sound produced from the artillery. Among the eight jumbos, Ashwathama, Lakshmi and Gopalaswamy showed some signs of distraction over the sound. The lead elephant Abhimanyu, who is carrying the 750-kg golden howdah for the second time this year, stood firm when the cannons were fired in three rounds making a 21-gun salute. This is the first practice session and two more cannon firing tests will be conducted on October 5 and 8. Horses that are going to be part of the Dasara procession were also present during the practice session. The 21-gun salute is given after the inauguration of the Jamboo Savari on the day of Vijayadashami. The personnel from the City Armed Reserve conducted the session at the parking lot of the palace. Cannon firing is usually practised as part of rehearsal for the procession and the cannons kept at the palace are readied days before the session. ‘Slghtly distracted’ Deputy Conservator of Forest K. Karikalan, who oversaw the session, told The Hindu that the first practice session went off smoothly. “Only Ashwathama, Lakshmi and Gopalaswamy appeared slightly distracted which was common. Ashwathama is making debut in the procession and his performance as first-timer is exceptional.” The Forest Department had taken all necessary precautions in case jumbos panic and run amok. Mr. Karikalan said all elephants were chained to trees during the first round of firing practice. In the second round, the chains were released and they were made to stand in a row during the third round. He said the wooden replica of the howdah will be mounted on the back of Abhimanyu as part of the rehearsal on Friday. The replica will be mounted between 9.25 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. Meanwhile, a health check-up camp was conducted for the mahouts and the forest staff engaged in Jamboo Savari tasks. Minister for Forest Umesh Katti presented kits to the mahouts and kavadis on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cannon-firing-practice-goes-off-smoothly-jumbos-remain-calm/article36768854.ece
01 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Sugarcane farmers plan to lay siege to Vidhana Soudha on October 5||Sugarcane Growers from across Karnataka are planning to lay siege to Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru on October 5 to bring pressure on the Centre to review the ‘measly’ hike announced in the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane from Rs. 2,850 per tonne to Rs. 2,900 per tonne. Arguing that the hike translates to just Rs. 5 per quintal of sugarcane, the Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association President Kurubur Shanthakumar accused the Centre of yielding to the pressure of sugar mill lobby and causing injustice to the farmers at a time when the cost of production had increased steeply. The Centre recently fixed the FRP for sugarcane with a recovery rate of 10 per cent sugar at Rs. 2,900 per tonne. Mr. Shanthakumar sought to know from the Centre the logic behind fixing the FRP at Rs. 2,900 per tonne when the Agriculture Department had estimated the cost of production to be Rs. 3,200 per tonne. The expenditure incurred by the farmers to pay labourers for harvesting had increased along with the cost of fertilizers and transportation charges, he said. ‘Unscientific’ He wondered how the Centre could fix an ‘unscientific’ FRP for sugarcane after repeatedly increasing the price of petrol and diesel. Taking the cost of production of Rs. 3,200 per tonne indicated by the Agriculture Department, the Union Government should add profit and fix the FRP at Rs. 3,500 per tonne, Mr. Shanthakumar said adding that the farmers from different parts of Karnataka will gather in Bengaluru on October 5 and lay siege to Vidhana Soudha to bring pressure on the Centre. He said the farmers, who were allegedly being cheated while calculating the recovery rate of sugar and weighing the sugarcane, besides forced to suffer delayed payment, were now subjected to injustice even in terms of FRP. The Union government, which had promised to double the farmers’ income by 2022, was instead resorting to ‘cheating’ them by offering them a price lesser than the cost of production, he lamented. He also regretted that the Centre had not yet formulated a policy to share with farmers the profits arising out of producing ethanol and other by-products. Mr. Shanthakumar also took exception to the government’s failure to include sugarcane among the crops falling under the purview of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bimha Yojane or the Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance scheme. Sugarcane cultivated on 2 lakh acres of land in north Karnataka districts of Belagavi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, and Kalaburagi is devastated in floods almost every year, leaving the farmers, who are not compensated for the losses, in dire straits.  Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association President Kurubur Shanthakumar accuses the Centre of yielding to the pressure of sugar mill lobby Agriculture Department had estimated the cost of production to be Rs. 3,200 per tonne Farmers say the Union government should add profit and fix the FRP at Rs. 3,500 per tonne||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sugarcane-farmers-plan-to-lay-siege-to-vidhana-soudha-on-october-5/article36768845.ece
01 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Vatal for full-fledged Dasara procession||Kannada protagonist Vatal Nagaraj held a demonstration in Mysuru on Thursday demanding a full-scale Dasara procession. He told reporters that restricting the Jamboo Savari to the precincts of the palace amounted to showing contempt for the festival, which had a historic background. As the Dasara was a state festival, the government should constitute a high-level committee drawing members from different political parties, besides litterateurs and artistes, to oversee the celebrations. “Unfortunately, this Dasara has become a “BJP Dasara”, he said. Taking exception to restricting the Dasara procession to the palace premises, the Kannada protagonist said the government wanted the procession to be seen only by a few dignitaries while leaving out the general public. He said the procession should run its full course to Bannimantap. Mr Nagaraj also found fault with the government’s decision to invite former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to inaugurate the festivities atop Chamundi Hills on October 7. Mr. Vatal Nagaraj was accompanied by other Kannada activists at Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar Circle (earlier Hardinge Circle) including Thayoor Vittalmurthy, who shouted slogans in favour of a full-fledged Dasara procession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vatal-for-full-fledged-dasara-procession/article36768862.ece

The restriction was needless especially at a time when COVID-19 cases have declined considerably here and the people are taking care of their safety, the Federation said in a letter to the DC.. The pujas in the evening at Sri Chamundeshwari Temple are considered sacred by many who come from faraway places for the darshan of the deity during the festive season. The decision would hamper their plans of visiting Mysuru as most plan their visits to the temple in the evenings, the Federation stated. “When all other sectors are allowed to open till night (9 p.m.), why are there restrictions for visitors to the hills after 6 p.m.,” the Federation asked. Last year, in view of the pandemic, there was a blanket ban on public entry to the hills. Even darshan was not allowed to the public and only daily rituals were allowed to be performed by the temple priests. In view of drop in cases and the pandemic situation under control, the administration can withdraw the curbs and take measures to ensure that the devotees are allowed to visit the temple at least till 9 p.m. strictly enforcing all SOPs, Federation President B.S. Prashanth said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/trade-body-urges-dc-to-drop-curbs-on-devotees-visiting-chamundi-hills/article36768858.ece

Satish has said that officials of the departments concerned should attend to grievances of farmers and implement schemes meant for them effectively. He was addressing a meeting in Raichur on Tuesday. Dr. Satish said that most of the farmers suffer crop loss during both kharif and rabi seasons for various reasons, mainly natural disasters. “Officers of the Revenue, Horticulture and Agriculture departments should conduct surveys and assess loss incurred and ensure that compensation reaches the affected farmers,” he added. The Deputy Commissioner advised the officials of GESCOM to conduct grievance meetings for farmers on Saturdays to ascertain the problems related to electricity supply, damage to transformers and poles and attend to them without any delay. “Farmers may face another crop loss without power supply for their pumpsets if there is a delay in restoration work,” he said. On the role of the Irrigation Department, he said that the officials concerned should take appropriate steps to reach water to the beneficiary farmers and also take action against those drawing water illegally.

01 October 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Modernity pulls the plug on century-old system||A.K. Kunjumon, a pump operator, is busy draining out the excess water from the 110-acre Kombankuzhy padasekharam (paddy field). He operates two different pumping mechanisms to dewater the field – ‘petti and para’ (pettiyum parayum) which uses indigenous technology and a 20-HP modern water-cooled pump. “This one is a new addition,” says Mr. Kunjumon, referring to the 20-HP pump, which the padasekhara samiti installed after the 2018 deluge. “The floods had exposed the limitations of petti and para. The new pump is draining floodwaters more quickly,” he adds. Days numbered Petti and para, the traditional dewatering mechanism, which has been in use in Kuttanad for around 100 years has withstood the test of time so far. However, with recurring floods and technological advancement, its days seem to be numbered. Padashekhara samitis and farmers are slowly scrapping the age-old dewatering technique for more energy-efficient and low-maintenance advanced systems. Petti (an outlet in the shape of a rectangular box to pump water) and para (a submerged cylindrical vessel with an impeller) are made of wood. The electric motor, another component of the dewatering mechanism, is connected to the shaft of the impeller by a belt. The water is lifted from the para to the petti before discharging to canals or backwaters. While the majority of padasekhara samitis such as Kombankuzhy is still operating petti and para, there are some who have completely migrated to modern dewatering mechanisms, setting a trend for others to follow. The Padinjare Mangalassery padasekharam in Ramankary is one among them. The padasekhara samiti there installed a vertical axial flow pump with the help of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation and a private bank last year. Less time-consuming “Using petti and para would take more than six days to dewater the paddy field for the puncha cultivation (first crop). The vertical axial flow pump has drained the water in three days. It consumes less electricity and we save money on manpower, maintenance and power,” says George Mathew Vachaparambil, president, Padinjare Mangalassery padasekhara samiti. Advantages Petti and para needs huge storage space and chances of it getting damaged in floods are high. But advanced systems such as the one installed at Padinjare Mangalassery, developed locally, can be dismantled and stored safely. “Kuttanad’s below sea level farming system is a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System. If the farming practice is to sustain, we need to put technology and innovative solutions to the best use. The agriculture in Kuttanad needs to be modernised,” says Jibin Thomas, coordinator, M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, Kuttanad Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/modernity-pulls-the-plug-on-century-old-system/article36768789.ece

Speaking after inaugurating a new smart village office at Erattayar, the Minister said the government aimed at taking strong action against encroachments, while also entrusting the landless with the land. “There are complex issues with regard to land in the district and the government will make earnest efforts to resolve them,” he said.

But not much is known about this phenomenon. Now, the Ferns Nature Conservation Society(FNCS), an NGO based in Wayanad, has come out with some interesting findings on the journey of the winged beauties through a citizen science project. The NGO has found that six species of milkweed butterflies, including Dark Blue Tiger, Blue Tiger, Common Crow, Double-branded Crow, Striped Tiger, and Plain Tiger, begin their ecologically significant journey in October-November, with the onset of the northeast monsoon, from the plains to the Ghats, and in April-June, just before the advent of the southwest monsoon, from the Ghats to the plains. Danaine Watch “We launched the project Danaine Watch to understand the migration better. The project has made a head start and important data regarding this migration have been collected,” says P.A. Vinayan, president, FNCS. “We could collect data from 1,119 locations from southern India, including the Nilgiri Biosphere reserve,” he says. Along with details on the butterfly species, their numbers and migratory routes, data on larval host plants and nectar plants are also being documented. A primary butterfly migration map has also been drafted after compiling the data with published information dating back to late 19th century. “ The project is being taken forward with the help of students and volunteers. Eco clubs of many schools are involved in collecting data on butterfly migration,” says Mr. Vinayan. Butterfly enthusiasts can upload their observation on the migration in the Danaine Watch project through the iNaturalist web portal or contact through WhatsApp numbers 9846704353, 9497402761.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shedding-light-on-annual-migration-of-butterflies/article36768764.ece

The court granted the bail to Anto Augustine, Josekutty Augustine, Roji Augustine, and their aide Vineesh, in four cases registered by the police in connection with the massive felling of rosewood trees. The court granted the bail on the ground that the police had failed to submit the charge-sheet even after 60 days of their arrest. The petitioners have been in custody since their arrest on July 28. The Forest department officials have also registered cases against the accused in connection with the incident. The prosecution case was that the accused had illegally and deceitfully cut 204.635 cubic metres of rosewood trees worth Rs. 8 crore from the assigned land in Muttil South in Wayanad without the permission of the Revenue Department. A special team of police officials, led by V.V. Benny, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Sulthan Bathery, was constituted for the investigation.

The police cordoned off the area as the people gheraoed the secretary of the society P.V. Hari, and staged a protest. The investors alleged that the society had been delaying paying back about Rs. 3 crore to more over 150 people. Sibi Macheri, one of investors, said that more than 600 persons had joined the chit of Rs. 1 lakh, which was started by the society in 2017. They had to pay Rs. 2,000 as instalment for 50 months. The period ended on August 15, but more than 150 investors are yet to get back the amount deposited in the society. Mr. Macheri said that he had visited the society more than eight times but the officials had failed to return the money. The society had promised to pay the full amount at maturity. Investors believed this and invested money, said another investor, on the condition of anonymity. He said that the society was also collecting money for chits of Rs. 2 lakh, Rs. 5 lakh, and Rs. 6 lakh. Earlier, when the investors approached the society, the officials said that there was no money. After the investors lodged a complaint, discussions were held with the society officials in the presence of the police. The society then promised to pay pay the money by September 30. But when the investors came to the society on Thursday, the board members demanded another six months for paying back the money. Following this, the investors staged a protest and gheraoed the secretary. The protest went on till 7 p.m., and later, the police who held discussions with the secretary, ordered holding of a board meeting in the presence of the investors on Friday at 2 p.m. to sort out the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/investors-stage-protest-after-co-op-society-fails-to-return-chit-amounts/article36768705.ece
01 October 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||Members of Koraga community in Pavur being denied title deeds||Around 250 families of Koraga community, the only Particularly Vulnerable Tribal (PVT) community living in Pavur village of Manjeswaram panchayat and Udyavaru and Kunjathur in Vorkady panchayat of Kasaragod district, are yet to receive title deeds. This is despite the recent distribution of 589 title deeds by the State government in the district. The tribespeople, many of whom have converted to Christianity, claim that in 1913, the Madras Presidency had granted 308 acres to Fr. Alexander Comisa to be handed over to the Koraga community and other deprived groups. The land is now spread across Manjeswaram and Vorkady panchayats. However, members of the community are unable to claim ownership of the land, with the Holy Cross Church under the Mangalore diocese claiming that the land belonged to the church. Fr. Varghese of Holy Cross Church said that the documents proved that the land was meant for the welfare of tribespeople and other backward groups. The land was now in the name of the Bishop, the head of the Mangalore diocese. “We have taken up the matter with the Mangalore diocese, and a committee has been formed to address the issue and to grant patta to the tribespeople who are in possession of the land,” Fr. Varghese said. However, the community members alleged that no steps had been taken by either the church or the government authorities to address the issue. Robert Pera, a member of the Koraga community, living in Pavur colony, said whenever the community raised the issue, the church was quick to claim its rights over the land. The panchayat and village offices too have refused to provide information regarding the land. Though the church had been paying land tax in Udyavaru and Kunjathur villages, the village officers had stopped collecting it after the issue came to the fore, Mr. Pera claimed. However Vorkady village office continues to collect taxes, he said. Stephen Varada, another tribesperson, said since the church claimed right over the land, it was constructing buildings, which should rightfully be given to tribespeople. “After a protest was launched, the church authorities threatened tribespeople saying that they would lose the land as it belonged to the diocese,” Mr. Varada alleged. The authorities have not taken the matter seriously, and, as a result, outsiders too have started encroaching upon the land, he said. For the record, several tribespeople had constructed houses using funds provided under the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups Project of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Similarly, other funds for the uplift of the community under the Scheduled Tribes Development Department are also being utilised. However, in the absence of title deeds, the community members are unable to avail of benefits such as construction of houses under the LIFE Mission project. When contacted, the panchayat secretaries of Vorkady and Manjeswaram said they were unaware of such a tribal community. Tribal Extension Officer T. Madhu said officials had discussed the issue with the church, and that they wanted to amicably resolve it. Sreeram Koyyon, president of Adivasi Dalit Munnetta Samiti, said that the failure of the government to address the issue amounted to injustice. He said that even if the church owned the land, it could keep over 50 acres in its possession. How can the Mangalore diocese lay claim over the land that was given to the tribal community, he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/members-of-koraga-community-in-pavur-being-denied-title-deeds/article36768703.ece

A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, measuring 51.3 feet in height and 44.3 feet in width and spread over 2,272 sq.ft, was unveiled at the school auditorium. The creative work was undertaken by nearly 120 budding artists from Classes 7 to 12 as part of Gandhiyam initiative by cartoonist Shanavas Mudikkal. Freedom fighters “The portrait of Mahatma Gandhi is the first in the proposed 100 portraits of freedom fighters to be set up in select schools across the State. We hope that such a venture will help the young generation learn more about the sacrifices made by those who fought for India’s Independence,” said Mr. Shanavas. The portrait in stencil art took around eight hours to be completed, as the students were invited in batches to the school considering the pandemic situation. Mr. Shanavas said 545 chart papers, each having a size of 22x20 inch, were used for making the portrait. “Each batch of students was asked to finish a layer. They were given an outline without mentioning who they were drawing to retain an element of suspense,” he added. K.A. Noushad, teacher and co-ordinator of the initiative, claimed that the portrait was the largest in stencil art made by students of a school. “The creative process involving students assumes significance at a time when efforts are on to remove freedom fighters and social reformers from the annals of history,” he said. Students who participated in the initiative said they had received online training on how to complete the portrait amid the COVID-19 situation. “It was a learning experience for all of us,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/students-make-huge-portrait-to-commemorate-mahatma/article36768736.ece
01 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Transport dept. may cut tax on tourist caravans||The Transport Department has agreed in-principle to slash vehicle tax on tourist caravans to one-fourth, considering the potential of caravan tourism in revving up tourism and employment in Kerala. Transport Minister Antony Raju agreed in-principle to such a proposal from Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas at ‘Keravan Kerala’, a joint workshop of Tourism and Transport departments, held at Bolgatty Palace here on Thursday, to deliberate on the operational details of caravan tourism policy and to sensitise Regional Transport Officers (RTOs) on its procedural and regulatory aspects. The government would approve the proposal shortly after going through the formalities required, said Mr. Raju while inaugurating the workshop. He hailed the policy announced in early September in Kerala as a major step forward in tourism development. “The government will provide green-channel passage for caravans that carry a special sticker, suggesting their joint recognition by the Tourism and Transport departments. Caravans will be given registration within 24 hours of applying. They will also get preference while testing for pollution,” he said. The Additional Transport Commissioner will be the State nodal officer for caravans. On-road inspections would be avoided to the maximum to facilitate smooth passage of caravans, said Mr. Raju. Tourist destination Presiding over the function, Mr. Riyas urged the Motor Vehicles Department to ensure that the registration and permits of caravan vehicles were carried out in a hassle-free manner. The tax must be reduced to Rs. 250 per square metre, from the current Rs. 1,000 per sq. m, he demanded. “The government’s policy is that every panchayat and municipality must proactively ready a tourist destination. The government has decided to enlist such local bodies for their smooth functioning. Here too, caravans will come in handy, since readying conventional accommodation units could be cumbersome,” he said. Tourism Director V.R. Krishna Teja made a presentation on the caravan tourism project. “Caravans will enable tourists to camp in hitherto unexplored destinations, which abound from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuam. This will help them be to nature. Steps will be taken to ensure water and power supply in caravan parks,” he said.

01 October 2021||Kochi,KERALA||When Gandhi visited Fort Kochi||Few people know that Mahatma Gandhi chose to visit Fort Kochi (what was then British Cochin) in 1925 following the success of the women-led agitation that led to closure of a dozen toddy shops in the locale. The agitation was such a romping success that there were no toddy shops till the early 1960s in the locale which saw footprints of the Portuguese, Dutch and the English, said former Mayor K.J. Sohan, who is the convener of the Kerala chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). “Even post-Independence, people from Fort Kochi used to visit nearby Mattancherry to have toddy for drinking or use in appams ,” he said. His father, K.T. Joslin, was a volunteer captain of the anti-toddy satyagraha. Mr. Sohan spoke of how a Congress volunteer from Fort Kochi was the first to be arrested in connection with the Vaikom Satyagraha. Having arrived at the Old Railway Station (which was abandoned after Ernakulam Junction and Town railway stations were built), Mahatma Gandhi reached Fort Kochi by boat. He was accompanied by a team led by freedom fighter K.J. Burleigh, whose wife Anne was a leader of Mahila Samajam which spearheaded the satyagraha in front of the toddy shops, said 88-year-old Thomas Burleigh, one among the four sons of K.J. Burleigh. “My father used to fondly recollect how Gandhiji chose to visit Fort Kochi, hearing of the what perhaps was the first women-led satyagraha that resulted in closure of liquor shops. The Mahatma was convinced that men spending on and getting addicted to liquor was the main reason for impoverished families. The around 5,000 British soldiers who were then stationed in army barracks (at what is now INS Dronacharya - Indian Navy’s gunnery school) were deployed in Fort Kochi when he arrived to address people at the beach,” said Mr. Burleigh, who is a pioneer in Kerala’s seafood export sector. Having made his mark as actor, director, producer, music director, poet, painter and writer, his latest book Inverted Man is awaiting release. ‘Epitome of adventure’ It was during his 1925 visit to Fort Kochi that Mahatma Gandhi described the coastal town as the “epitome of adventure”. Among the iconic freedom fighters who visited the ancestral house of K.J. Burleigh include Captain Lakshmi Sahgal of INA fame and A.K. Gopalan, in 1945. The then Pope had decorated K.J. Burleigh with the Chevalier title.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-gandhi-visited-fort-kochi/article36768727.ece
01 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||SLMC raps civic body for waste dumped on pvt. land||The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has pulled up the Kalamassery municipality for unauthorised dumping and handling of non-biodegradable waste on private land along the Seaport-Airport Road here. In a report submitted before the National Green Tribunal, SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai pointed out that the primary responsibility for the lapse rested with the civic body, as it had failed to take action against the violation that had continued for more than a year. The land, spread over an acre, was found to be used for storage of waste in violation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. Huge quantities of solid waste materials were found dumped without any proper roof protection, the report said. It added that leachate from the dumped waste was found stored in a pit. The committee was told that leachate flowed into a nearby canal before reaching the Kadambrayar. Those who had taken the land on lease informed the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) that they were trying to remove the waste to a safer place. However, inquiries revealed that they had not asked an authorised firm to get it done. The committee pointed out that the said individuals had shifted the waste to unidentified places in violation of rules on collection, storage and transportation of solid waste. Quoting media reports, the report said waste was transported in heavy vehicles for dumping on Willingdon Island during night hours. It was also taken to wetlands in Alangad, Thengode, and Kakkanad. The SLMC also received information that the remaining waste was levelled at the site itself. An excavator was used to cover it with soil to give the impression that the entire waste was removed. The NGT is expected to consider the committee report soon and issue necessary orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slmc-raps-civic-body-for-waste-dumped-on-pvt-land/article36768752.ece

The move assumes significance, since the petitioners have submitted a lot of audio clips and videos to substantiate cheating charges against the accused. Later in the day, he was taken to his rented house at Kaloor for evidence collection. 3 cheating cases S. Sreejith, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Crime Branch, told reporters that Monson remained charged with three cheating cases, including on a sculptor’s complaint that he was not paid for his works, which the accused allegedly passed off as antiques. Mr. Sreejith is supervising the investigation. Monson was arrested last Sunday and is booked for, among other things, cheating six persons of Rs. 10 crore in less than four years in the guise of an antique dealer and influential businessman. The mystery around the accused has further deepened after the man charged with cheating crores of rupees claimed to have no money in his bank account. The man claimed to have busted the entire money on lavish lifestyle. It had emerged that he had collected and transacted money running into crores through third-party accounts, including that of his former employees who were reportedly in the dark about it till he was nabbed. The money was reportedly lavished on collecting antiques, a majority of which have now emerged to be fake, sponsoring festivities for building his image, and buying premium cars. The cars have also evoked suspicion, since Motor Vehicles Department officials have reportedly found no details of them, except one in their books. The mansion-like home rented by Monson entailed a monthly rent of Rs. 50,000, which he reportedly defaulted for eight months, while the monthly power bill exceeded Rs. 30,000. He also claimed to spend about Rs. 25 lakh towards personal security, including the salary of his bouncers, a month. More videos have emerged where the accused is found boasting his diplomatic privileges even as it has emerged that the man does not even possess a passport and yet acted as the office-bearer of an expatriate organisation without ever going abroad. Remand extended Meanwhile, Monson’s remand was extended for three more days. Arguing for the extension of the custody, M. H. Mohamad Rafeeque, assistant public prosecutor, submitted before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate that Monson was not cooperating with the investigation agencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cb-collects-monsons-voice-samples/article36768766.ece

Rajesh said here on Thursday that it was disheartening to witness people falling into illogical campaigns and claims such as someone having in possession two of the 30 silver pieces paid to Judas for betraying Jesus Christ. Without referring directly to the fake antique dealer Monson Mavunkal, Mr. Rajesh said that the fraud could not be termed as an isolated incident. “Many people had believed that somebody was in possession of Judas’s coins. Have we not come across people asking whether the fake information shared widely on WhatsApp on various issues is true?” he asked at the seminar on “Malabar rebellion” organised by the district wing of the Democratic Youth Federation of India here. Stating that right wing forces were making concerted efforts to portray the rebellion as a communal riot, the Speaker said such divisive elements were using the topic to divide people in the name of religion across the country. Mr. Rajesh blamed the Indian Council for Historical Research for toying the line of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre by deciding to remove the names of the freedom fighters associated with the Malabar rebellion from the dictionary of the martyrs of the Independence struggle. “The council seems busy re-writing the history by misrepresenting it and ignoring the facts,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/conmen-preying-on-peoples-credulity/article36768738.ece

The mission authorities are waiting for the results of the soil test to initiate the project. A public meeting was organised at Kalvathy on Wednesday evening, protesting against CSML’s decision to set up the plant at the site at Kalvathy, which, according to the protesters, was once a pond. Protests would be intensified in the coming days against the setting up of the plant at the site, located close to hospitals and other establishments, said T.K. Ashraf, chairman, health standing committee of the Kochi Corporation. The proposed site was recorded as a pond in the Basic Tax Register, and the Kochi Corporation had earlier denied permission for it, he added. The protesters also planned to move a writ petition in the Kerala High Court challenging CSML’s decision to set up the plant, he said. The 6.5-million-litre-per-day capacity plant has been proposed at a 45-cent holding near the Kalvathy canal. The Rs. 166-crore plant will cater for Divisions 1 to 5 of the Kochi Corporation. Mayor’s stand Meanwhile, Mayor M. Anilkumar said the present regime had no role in the selection of the site or the project, as it was cleared during the terms of the previous councils led by the Congress. Projects once approved by the councils could not be changed by subsequent councils, he added. The issue was discussed with the Chief Secretary following public protests. However, the authorities were not in favour of scrapping it. They pointed out that the city lacked an effective STP mechanism, and septage was being directly discharged into drains and waterbodies, triggering serious health concerns, he said. The CSML director board had refused to reconsider the project when the issue was raised at the meeting. All board members unequivocally argued for the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protests-mount-against-stp-project-in-west-kochi/article36768743.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran appealed to the good conscience of the heads of the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Church to put an end to the long litigations resorted to by both factions. 1934 constitution The court orally observed that no Orthodox faction or Jacobite faction did exist after the Supreme Court judgment in the K.S. Varghese case. Parishes should work as per the 1934 constitution. The heads of both factions should understand that game was up with the Supreme Court judgment. They should realise that the litigations were bleeding them. The mindset of the heads of both factions would have to change and they should end the long journey of litigations. The court observed that the disputes had set one citizen against another. Even the State was in a quandary as to what to do. The court wanted to know who was benefiting from this fight. “There is one church and one constitution. You are all the same; you are all human beings with the same colour of blood running in your veins. Why is that so hard to understand?” the court told both factions. The judge said he would be the last person to order force to implement the Supreme Court judgment, but would do so when he was pushed.

The Commission chaired by D.B. Binu, with Vaikom Ramachandran and Sreevidya T.N. as members, directed the District Police Chief to arrest and produce before them T.G. Sadanandan of Kalamassery. On February 25, 2020, the Commission issued a warrant to the Kalamassery police to arrest and produce the accused. However, the police returned the warrant citing their preoccupation with law and order duties. The Commission then directed the District Police Chief (Kochi City) to comply with the direction after the petitioner Nelson Thomas of Mookannur in Aluva complained of non-implementation of the previous order. The incident pertaining to the case dates back to August 12, 2012. The petitioner approached the Commission a year later after a biogas plant he bought from the accused fell into disrepair and the latter declined to honour the commitment to replace it. The Commission ordered a refund for the plant in 2015. However, the petitioner returned to the Commission after the order went unheeded. The accused eventually reached out to the Commission through his lawyer to settle the dispute after receiving the warrant issued by the District Police Chief (Kochi City) on September 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/warrant-puts-end-to-consumer-dispute/article36768748.ece

Inaugurating the fair on Thursday, Rubber Board Executive Director K.N. Raghavan said the virtual trade fair would become a harbinger of change for the marketing of rubber and rubber products. Rubber products exports fetch Rs. 25,000 crore in foreign exchange and proper positioning of a product is a must for marketing it, he said. “New manufacturers, especially in the MSME sector, need to constantly showcase their products as they need to make improvisations, innovations and incremental value additions on a constant basis. The virtual trade fair provides the platform for each member of the sector for buying, selling and moving their business forward. This would also be a perfect place for buyer-seller meets,” he said. Divakar Nath Misra, Joint Secretary (Plantations), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said India exported around 30,000 rubber products and there as scope for expansion of the sector, especially the MSMEs. The Virtual Trade Fair is being hosted on the official website of the Rubber Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rubber-board-opens-virtual-trade-fair/article36768808.ece
01 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||COVID situation stabilising in Kozhikode||COVID-19 situation seems to be stabilising in Kozhikode district now with daily cases revolving around 1,500 and the daily test positivity rate at 15% or just above that. Going by the Health Department data, the active caseload now stands at 14,902, of which 12,102 are under home isolation. As many as 56,955 people are under observation in various parts of the district. Only 1,360 people tested positive for the virus on Thursday while 1,955 recovered from the infection. Of the 2,833 beds in 65 COVID hospitals, 1,710 are vacant. Of the 968 beds in nine COVID first-line treatment centres, 819 are vacant. This is perceived to be a huge relief as the daily caseload used to surge above 2,000 since July, weeks after the second lockdown was withdrawn. As there was no let-up in daily cases and the TPR, the district administration imposed more curbs on social life and ramped up testing by July-end. Earlier, the highest number of cases were reported in the district on May 6 when 5,704 people tested positive for the virus. The daily TPR then was 32.9%. As many as 53,244 people were under treatment then. However, the numbers had come down to around 500 after the second lockdown. Traders’ protest By August first week, weekly infection population ratio (WIPR)-based restrictions for containing the pandemic were implemented. The number of fresh cases, however, surged again as the curbs were lifted in view of festivals such as Onam and Bakrid. There were huge protests by a section of traders here as well. The week after Onam saw daily cases surging above 3,500 and the active caseload was around 35,000. By September mid-week, the district reported a steady rate of recoveries from COVID-19 even as the fresh cases hovered around 2,000-mark. The active caseload dropped too. In the meantime, though the restrictions on social life almost became non-existent except in places where WIPR is very high or where large gatherings could happen, vaccination picked up pace in the district. As many as 32,45,997 doses have been administered in Kozhikode as on September 30, according to data from the CoWIN portal. A total of 22,82,218 of the around 25 lakh people aged above 18 have got the first dose and 9,63,779 have got both the doses. However, there has been a considerable drop in the number of daily tests now even as there are allegations of under-reporting of cases. Only 9,058 samples were tested on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-situation-stabilising-in-kozhikode/article36768718.ece

The BJP councillors led by T. Raneesh held a press meet accusing the corporation of engaging in corruption using the Kudumbashree as a front. They alleged that the Mahila Mall, run by the Kudumbashree, was projected as a flagship venture of the corporation initially. When it incurred losses, the corporation promptly washed its hands of the project, they alleged. However, T.K. Geetha, Sheeja Vinod, and O. Rajitha, chairpersons of the north, south, and central CDS of the Kudumbashree, said in a release that the Mahila Mall was only one of the hundreds of ventures promoted by them. The Kudumbashree is training women in various jobs and helping them get loans with interest subsidy to start ventures. The Mahila Mall, opened in 2018, had a good run till March 2020, they said. Later, the entrepreneurs defaulted their rent payments. Along with the losses due to the closure of the mall because of the pandemic restrictions, the rent dues went up further. The Kudumbashree could not handle the burden. Though steps were taken to reduce the rent, the entrepreneurs said that they were not ready to operate under the management. This led to its closure forever. Though these facts were explained at the corporation council meeting already, the members were again trying to mislead the people, they alleged. The Kudumbashree functionaries also dismissed the allegations of the BJP councillors that they had collected funds for the ‘COVID vaccine challenge’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-kudumbashree-in-war-of-words-over-mahila-mall/article36768714.ece
01 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Probe under way into ‘paid government agencies’||The police have started gathering details of private organisations that are suspected of functioning as government-supported units handling public grievances, to generate money. The move follows the recent exposure of a fake rights panel in the city which functioned in the name of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission and offered only paid mediation service. Police sources said the parallel ‘service providers’ were found attracting clients by promising them quick service by bypassing all possible red-tapism and technical delays. They were also found creating a false impression that the paid service was legal and sourced by many to settle personal and professional disputes, the sources said. Usual trickery Impersonating themselves as officials of the government’s rights panel was the usual trickery adopted by the operators of Kozhikode-based organisation for addressing private complaints related to government departments and functionaries. On many occasions, they had even tricked senior officers of government departments. A police officer who was part of the recent investigation against the agency said there were many uninformed individuals who used the ‘paid service’ considering it as the official rights panel of the State government. “Many documents uncovering the details of such cases and the payment received have already been recovered. We are planning to expose more such illegal activities,” he said. Based on confidential complaints, the police have also received information about the attempts of some of the organisations which canvassed people with an offer to easily claim benefits of government welfare schemes through paid service. According to police sources, such agencies collected the service charge with a claim that it was meant for supporting people who were in need of similar services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-on-into-paid-govt-agencies/article36768721.ece
01 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Legal challenge to appointment of Assistant Professors in varsity||The appointment of 53 Assistant Professors in the University of Calicut is likely to face legal challenges as the Supreme Court has registered a petition against the verdict of a Kerala High Court Division Bench related to reservation in recruitments. The plea was filed by Rajesh Komath, Ahmed Shariff, and Roshni Prabhakaran, who had applied for those posts. Haris Beeran, their lawyer, pointed out in the petition that the High Court verdict had not included the fact that posts for differently abled persons as per the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, had already been determined even before issuing notification for the appointment. Also, the notification had not included the 3% posts reserved for the disabled since 1996 and the backlog posts since 2016 after the Act increased the reservation limit to 4%. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that ‘vertical’ reservation followed by the university was illegal and that ‘horizontal’ reservation should be followed. The university, however, reportedly did not take this into consideration while appointing the faculty recently. The reservation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes is referred to as vertical reservation as it is applicable to each group specified under the law. Horizontal reservation is applicable to categories such as women, senior citizens, people with disabilities and transgender persons who are given equal opportunities. Earlier, P. Rasheed Ahammed, a United Democratic Front-aligned Syndicated member, had petitioned Chancellor and Governor Arif Mohammed Khan highlighting this. Mr. Ahammed had alleged that ineligible people might have got recruited. Some other applicants, meanwhile, approached the High Court against the alleged incorrect way of implementing reservation for differently abled persons. The Higher Education Minister also told the Assembly that the order based on which reservation for the disabled was implemented had been frozen.

01 October 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||KPCC gets free hand for revamp||With the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership setting its agenda for reorienting the party, the central leadership appears to have refused to entertain the growing discontentment with the new dispensation in the State unit. That former Congress president Rahul Gandhi during his one-day visit to the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency on Wednesday declined to grant audience to disgruntled leaders to discuss the unprecedented changes showed that the central leadership is against disturbing the existing equilibrium in the party. Beset by problems in Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh and challenges posed by the so-called G-23, the central leadership is of the view that the new KPCC leadership is marching determinedly to revamp the party apparatus. The resignation of senior leader V.M. Sudheeran from the political affairs committee and subsequently the All India Congress Committee, the central leadership believes, will not have any major impact on the organisational structure. The sane voice of former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran also failed to canvass opinion following the shift in the party’s internal dynamics, sources said. They also felt that the troika of KPCC president K. Sudhakaran, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, and AICC general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal really meant business even if the old guard was left in the cold. For the long run Now, with the blessings of Congress Working Committee (CWC) member A.K. Antony, sources said, Mr. Venugopal would be able to realign himself with Mr. Sudhakaran despite differences of opinion with him earlier. Many believe that Mr. Sudhakaran’s lateral thinking and non-conformist attitude will help the party in the long run. Dismayed by factionalism, the central leadership will certainly go for rapprochement in its own terms rather than get browbeaten to rock the KPCC, the sources said. After being outplayed by the domineering Sudhakaran, the ‘A’ faction led by former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and the ‘I’ faction led by Ramesh Chennithala have lost traction with the central leaders. Even then their proteges have got a pie in the appointment of District Congress Committee presidents, a senior party functionary said. The central leadership has already sent a message that coaxing strategies employed by both the factions will not work any more. However, it has tactfully flown down AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar as an emissary to generate a feeling that he was a diplomatic representative to sort out the resentment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kpcc-gets-free-hand-for-revamp/article36768754.ece

The diesel-to-CNG conversion is claimed to be the first such project in the case of private buses in Kozhikode district. At a press conference here on Thursday, leaders of the Kozhikode District Bus Operators Association said the CNG-powered vehicles would help the bus operators save about 50% of the existing fuel cost and overcome the huge financial crisis in the sector. The conversion could be carried out by interested bus owners at a cost of Rs. 4.5 lakh, they said. “As of now, the cost of diesel is Rs. 95 a litre which gives an average mileage of three to four kilometres. At the same time, the cost of one kilogram CNG is just Rs. 62 which can power the vehicle to cover at least six to seven kilometres,” said A.C. Baburaj, vice president, Kozhikode District Bus Operators Association. According to him, over 700 private buses now operating daily service would be able to try the new fuel efficient service after the trial period. Mr. Baburaj also hoped that the district would get more CNG stations with the support of the already operational fuel stations within a few months. “With the full-fledged functioning of such CNG stations, bus operators would be able to take better advantage of the situation,” he pointed out. Representatives of a Delhi-based company, which assisted the bus operators in the first conversion process, said they had already opened a CNG conversion centre in Kozhikode district with an aim to convert at least 100 to 150 vehicles by March next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/minister-to-flag-off-trial-service-of-cng-powered-bus/article36768716.ece

Ms. George told media persons that the change in designation was only technical and the doctors would not have to move under the Director of Medical Education. None of the doctors would be relocated to Konni, she said. “If we are not going ahead by recognising the General Hospital as part of Konni medical college, the admission of students will be delayed by another three years,” said the Minister. According to her, the National Medical Commission (NMC) that is inspecting the medical college should be shown a hospital, which has been operating for three years and has all the facilities, including 300 beds, and is within an air distance of 10 km. The Pathanamthitta General Hospital was declared a part of the Konni medical college in 2015 by taking this aspect into consideration. On LDF’s opposition against the move in 2015, the Minister said the objection had been against a mere renaming of the General Hospital without implementing any facilities. First phase done “The first phase of the medical college has been completed and 60 outpatient wings are running. About 200 beds are ready. Of the 394 posts sanctioned, recruitments have been made to 218,” she said. According to her, the 300 beds in the General Hospital need to be shown as part of the IP section of the medical college so as to present the hospital as a 500-bed facility during the NMC inspection. Through this, 100 students will be able to obtain MBBS admission next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/veena-allays-concerns-over-doctors-deemed-deputation/article36768809.ece

Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, P.G.

The inscription had assumed attention during the 2018 Sabarimala protests when some media outlets highlighted it as an authentic document on the rituals and custom at the temple.

01 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Research corrects ‘mistaken identity’ of cicada||A new species of cicada ( cheevidu in local parlance) has been described in the Western Ghats in Kerala. The discovery, Pomponia pseudolinearis Sadasivan 2021, is the result of an expedition undertaken by entomologist Kalesh Sadasivan to Swargam Medu, a scenic hilltop in Idukki in 2019. The research, published in taxonomic studies’ journal Zootaxa , noted the species to be a member of the Pomponia linearis (or P. linearis ) species group. Despite being viewed as a discovery, the species is not a new entrant to the rich biodiversity of the Ghats. Pointing out that P. pseudolinearis is “very common,” Dr. Kalesh said it used to be mistaken for the P. linearis species. Distinctive factor The discovered species can be distinguished from the other Pomponia species of the Western Ghats on the basis of the unique structure of the male genitalia. The divergent basal lobes of the pygofer (the last abdominal segment) makes it stand apart from the other members of the species group. The author said the species is also common in homesteads, edges of tea estates, coffee plantations and jungles of 500-1,200 m elevation. “Such invertebrates call during the late afternoon from trees at a height of around eight metres. Camouflaged against the green moss and dark bark of trees, the species engage in unmistakable deafening calls until they are disturbed,” he says. He collected the first specimen from a private cardamom estate at Swargam Medu for his research. Later, he found more from Ponmudi and Bonacaud in Thiruvananthapuram and Rajakumari in Idukki. Dr. Kalesh, who is credited with discovering four taxa, including a butterfly and two damselflies, from the Western Ghats this year, said the recognition of one of the most common cicadas of Kerala as a new species highlighted the need for more scientific explorations of the biodiversity hotspot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/research-corrects-mistaken-identity-of-cicada/article36768962.ece

01 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Govt. doctors to fast tomorrow||Doctors in the State Health Service will observe a day’s fast in front of the Secretariat on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti day, in protest against the denial of allowances and benefits to doctors and other anomalies in pay revision. Stir from Monday Doctors will go on a non-cooperation strike across the State from October 4. While patient care services will not be disrupted, they will stay away from review meetings, trainings and e-Sanjeevani clinics indefinitely from this day. Doctors were forced to take the path of agitation because of the government’s continued neglect of the just requests raised by them, Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association said in a statement on Thursday. Though the KGMOA had observed a protest day on August 31, without disrupting patient care, to draw the attention of the government to doctors’ demands, the issues were ignored, it said. Doctors were denied even risk allowance despite their working round-the-clock to fight the pandemic and care for the patients, the KGMOA said. The grievances raised by the KGMOA include slashing of basic pay at the entry cadre, stopping of personal pay and denial of higher grade. These issues should be read against the fact that the State seriously lacked human resources in the Health sector, it added. It appealed to the government to settle the issues raised by doctors and not to push them to intensify the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-doctors-to-fast-tomorrow/article36768968.ece

The government on Wednesday issued orders that COVID-19 Death Ascertaining Committees (CDACs) be constituted in all districts for the issuance of the ‘Official Document for COVID-19 Death’, in accordance with the new guidelines for declaring deaths due to COVID-19 drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The new guidelines are more inclusive and it states that “deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of testing or from the date of being clinically determined as a COVID-19 case will be treated as “deaths due to COVID-19” even if the death takes place outside the hospital/inpatient facility. A patient admitted to a hospital as a COVID-19 case and died while in hospital beyond 30 days will also be treated as COVID-19 death. The next of kin can submit a petition to the District Collector for issuance of the appropriate Official Document for COVID-19 Death. The CDACs will also examine the grievances and propose necessary remedial measures, including issuance of amended official document for COVID-19 death, after verifying facts and evidence. The grievance redressal system will be operational from October 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-issue-official-covid-death-certificate/article36768758.ece

Inaugurating the second Kairali Research Awards 2020 presentation ceremony through videoconference on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan said educational institutions must strive to evolve solutions for local problems. The knowledge produced by academia should be developed with the assistance of industrial bodies and operationalised for the betterment of society, he said. He added that the pursuit for a ‘new Kerala’ hinges heavily on research and advancements in the manufacturing sector. A judicious distribution of resources was a must to shape an inclusive society. Cardiologist M.S. Valiathan and historians K.N. Panikkar and M.R. Raghava Varier were selected for the Kairali Global Lifetime Achievement Prize for Researchers in the respective fields of science, social science, arts and humanities. ‘Recovering knowledge’ Dr. Varier, who was present on the occasion, lamented the scant importance shown towards research in certain disciplines, including history. He said only a few universities in the country had strived to reform curriculum so as to recover lost knowledge and preserve them for posterity. Mahatma Gandhi University Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas, linguist Scaria Zacharia and historian P. Sanal Mohan were presented the Kairali Lifetime Achievement Award for science, arts and humanities and social science respectively. The Kairali Gaveshaka Puraskaram for post-doctoral research, Kairali Gaveshana Puraskaram for teachers undertaking research were also given away. ‘Hindering research’ Kerala State Higher Education Council vice chairman Rajan Gurukkal called for steps to reduce bureaucratic involvement that often hinder research activities.

Health Minister Veena George will be present at the State-level launch of the vaccine at the Women and Children Hospital at Thycaud. PCV will be available for administration from the next immunisation day in all districts, a release issued by the Health Department said. Pneumococcal pneumonia is one of the leading causes of mortality among children below five years and causes over one lakh infant deaths annually in the country. The treatment is hard and prohibitively expensive. Dosage The vaccine will be given in three doses to infants at one-and-a-half months, five months, three-and-a-half months and at nine months. The State is aiming to administer PCV to 40,000 infants in the first month and to immunise 4.8 lakh infants in the first year. A month’s requirement of PCV — 55,000 doses — is already available with the State and this has been distributed to the districts. The training of medical officers and health workers has been completed. PCV, an expensive vaccine, has been available since long in the private health sector. However, it was first introduced in the UIP schedule by the Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare in May 2017 in the States of Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. With the introduction of PCV in the UIP schedule, all children below one in the State will receive the same vaccines as are being given in the private sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcv-vaccine-for-children-to-be-launched-today/article36768794.ece

Jeevaraj, who have been appointed as political secretaries, had earlier served in the same post when Mr. Yediyurappa was the Chief Minister. Coming just ahead of the commencement of filing of nominations for the bypolls from Friday, the move is being seen in political circles as an effort to placate the followers of Mr. Yediyurappa and ensure that they work actively on ground. Victory in these two seats is crucial for the Chief Minister, particularly with Union Home Minister Amit Shah announcing that the BJP would face the 2023 Assembly elections under him, observed a senior party leader. ThoughMr. Bommai is supposed to be the political protégée of Mr. Yediyurappa, there is apprehension in the latter’s camp that the former is steadily charting his own political course.In this context, this is an effort by the Chief Minister to send a message of unity in the party, observed another BJP leader. In fact, soon after the announcement of the byelection dates, the Chief Minister said the party would go to the bypolls “under collective leadership”. However, a section of the leaders in Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp are still confused. Knowing well that the party high command plays its cards close to its chest, they wonder if the move is, on the contrary, an effort to isolate Mr. Yediyurappa from his camp. “Though Mr. Yediyurappa has said that his son B.Y. Vijayendra will not contest the bypolls, there is still some expectation in this regard. But what if the party high command does not consider him for the candidature this time?” asked a BJP MLA from north Karnataka. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister held a meeting with several party MLAs and MPs on Thursday as part of his earlier promise to dedicate some time for the party legislators on every Thursday. He is learnt to have assured them of not discriminating against them while releasing funds for the development of constituencies. Amid these developments, the Chief Minister is expected to visit New Delhi next week during which he would hold consultations on the party’s strategy for the bypolls. Arun Singh to hold meet The BJP national general secretary in charge of Karnataka, Arun Singh, is arriving in Bengaluru on Sunday to hold consultations on selection of candidates for the byelections. The BJP core committee is expected to meet in his presence for candidate selection. While a notification on the bypolls will be issued on October 1, October 8 is the last day for filing nominations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bsy-loyalists-renukacharya-jeevaraj-appointed-political-secretaries-to-cm/article36767972.ece

Fortunately, the building on the property was not damaged and no one was injured. The family residing there has been evacuated. The building has a shop on the ground floor and a house on the first floor. According to officials, the earth caved in where there was an old open well, which was recently closed. “On Thursday, during tunnelling work by tunnel boring machine Bhadra, a sinkhole appeared about 100 metres from Venkateshpura underground metro station towards Tannery Road metro station at around 7.30 a.m.,” the BMRCL said in a statement. The owner of the property, who had rented it out, told mediapersons that it was the BMRCL which asked them to close the well recently before commencing the tunnelling work. “There was no problem for over 35 years as the building and the well stood. Now, metro work is responsible for the damage to the building,” he said. The BMRCL said in its statement that to ensure safety, the shop has been closed and the family provided accommodation near Nagawara. “Once the filling of the well with sand and concrete, which is in progress, is completed and the building is secured, the tunnelling activities will continue.” It added that the family would be allowed to return after the tunnelling work is completed and after ensuring the building is structurally safe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sinkhole-opens-up-on-tannery-road-during-metro-tunnelling-work/article36768299.ece
01 October 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Spent fuel storage cleared for Kudankulam units 3 and 4||The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has granted consent for the establishment of Away From Reactor spent fuel storage for the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project’s units 3 and 4. The consent will be valid for five years from the date of issuance: August 23, 2021. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) had proposed Away From Reactor storage for units 3 and 4 on the existing site where the 2x1000-MW units 1 and 2 are in operation and the 4x1000-MW units 3-6 are in various stages of construction. The AERB said in its consent letter that the primary responsibility for safety of the facility rested with NPCIL. “It is the responsibility of the Consentees to comply with safety requirements as specified in the regulations.” The AERB said the criteria for evaluation of a site for locating a particular nuclear facility was to ensure that the site-plant interaction did not result in radiological impact beyond the limits prescribed by the AERB, and the site was engineered to handle external hazards. The AERB said that the Away From Reactor storage was proposed to be located within the main plant boundary of units 5 and 6, and all the phenomena/criteria that could result in the rejection of the site had already been reviewed by the board during the siting review for units 3-6. Hence, following the graded approach, the review emphasised the impact of the plant on the site, like radiological impact, owing to postulated releases during normal operations and accidents and radioactive waste management. “These were reviewed against the AERB’s dose criteria,” it said. G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal said that instead of finding a location for a deep geological repository for safe disposal of nuclear waste, as directed by the Supreme Court, NPCIL was seeking permission for constructing an Away From Reactor disposal location for reactors 3 and 4. “After they locate the deep repository, it will take them a long time to construct the facility. Permission for Away From Reactor disposal can be granted once the location of the deep repository is found,” he said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/spent-fuel-storage-cleared-for-kudankulam-units-3-4/article36768410.ece

01 October 2021||Coimbatore/New Delhi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Court hands over T.N. rape case to IAF||The additional mahila court in Coimbatore on Thursday handed over to the Indian Air Force the case of rape made against a Flight Lieutenant by his woman colleague for court-martial proceedings. Sources said N. Thilageswari, in-charge of the Additional Mahila Court, ordered that the case must be transferred from the Coimbatore City Police to the IAF as per provisions of the Air Force Act, 1950. Since both the accused and the survivor were in active service under the IAF and the alleged incident occurred within the premises of the Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) in Coimbatore, the judge observed that only the IAF could carry out further legal proceedings in this case. Earlier, the accused, Flight Lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh, 29, was produced in the court. The All Women Police, Coimbatore Central, arrested him on September 25 based on a complaint of the 28-year-old woman IAF officer and he was remanded in judicial custody for four days. According to the police, the incident occurred in the early hours of September 10 on the AFAC, Coimbatore campus, where both had arrived for a training course. The woman officer, in an FIR registered on September 20 in Coimbatore, alleged that a Flight Lieutenant trespassed into her room and raped her under the influence of alcohol on September 10. She also alleged that her Commandant and senior officers pressured her to withdraw her complaint, and that she was subjected to a two-finger test at the Air Force Hospital. N. Sundaravadivelu, who appeared for the accused in the court, said the IAF would now form a court of inquiry and subsequently a court-martial for the case. “It is not that the accused has been favoured or the victim has been disfavoured. It is only a question of law [who can investigate],” he told The Hindu, adding that the case had now been handed over to “the rightful authority.” Meanwhile, the National Commission for Women on Thursday wrote to IAF Chief V.R. Chaudhari on the banned two-finger test conducted on the woman officer following her allegations of rape against a male colleague. The NCW said it was “utterly disappointed and strongly condemned the action of IAF doctors conducting the banned test on the victim (sic).” In her letter, NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma urged the IAF Chief to “take necessary action” and ensure that its medical fraternity is aware of “prevailing guidelines laid down by the government.” When contacted, an IAF spokesperson said, “The IAF is cooperating with the police investigation and is also conducting an internal inquiry.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/court-hands-over-tn-rape-case-to-iaf/article36767969.ece

01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Probe on into Telugu Akademi scam||The Hyderabad Central Crime police have expedited the investigation into the alleged financial fraud in the Telugu Akademi bank accounts. On Thursday, more than 15 people, including bank officials concerned and employees of the Telugu Akademi, were questioned in connection with the misappropriation. An official associated with the investigation told The Hindu that about Rs. 64 crore allotted to the Akademi, which was made as fixed deposit in three public sector banks, was being transferred to the bank accounts of the Agrasen Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd., and RBL Bank, by some persons since December last. “The suspects have left only Rs. 5 lakh in the Akademi’s accounts,” the officer said, adding that a total of three cases were registered and a probe was on. He said the misused money was deposited by the Akademi after the retail sale of textbooks of Intermediate, degree, postgraduation courses and various competitive examination preparation books. “The State government pays salaries to the Akademi staff. So the misused amount was earned by the institution by retail sale of books which they print,” the officer said. Police said a private agent played a key role in the fixed deposit of money in Union Bank of India. “By Saturday we will get some clarity in the case and can zero in on the actual suspects. As of now, everybody will be considered as suspects in the case,” an officer said. SC directive The alleged misuse of funds came to light only after Akademi director Somi Reddy directed the officials to examine the bank accounts following the directions of the Supreme Court for ‘bifurcation’ of the institution for both the Telugu speaking States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for equal distribution of funds and assets. Soon, the officials found that Rs. 43 crore deposited in the Karwan branch of the Union Bank of India was ‘missing’. Similarly Rs. 10 crore and nearly Rs. 11 crore went missing from two other branches, the investigators said. The Akademi also ordered a departmental inquiry by a committee headed by Intermediate Education Commissioner Omar Jaleel to ascertain the facts. The committee had been set October 2 deadline for submitting its report. The police are inquiring as to who was holding the account to which the amount was transferred initially.

01 October 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Researchers find rock art site near Idupulapaya||Researchers at Yogi Vemana University (YVU) have discovered a rock art site belonging to the megalithic culture, or early historic period, close to Idupulapaya in the district. Based on information provided by M.A. student P. Maheswaraiah, the Head of History and Archaeology Department, Kankanala Gangaiah, constituted a team comprising nature enthusiast P.C. Chennakesavulu, researcher Babu, and Ph.D scholars J. Narayana and Sivakumar Challa. The team reached the spot on September 23 and found the rock paintings on a hillock, the exact year of which had to be decided after a scientific study. The rock shelter situated close to the IIIT and on the opposite side of the YSR Ghat can be reached after walking for about 2 km from the main road. The drawings are found on the ground level rock cave and on the ceiling wall of the upper deck, which seem to be artistic sketches by the early man as clues to identify the steps to climb atop. The images are painted with ochre material using brush technique. Explaining the findings to Vice-Chancellor M. Surya Kalavathi on Thursday, Dr. Gangaiah appealed for protection of the site, besides its development as a heritage and eco-tourism spot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/researchers-find-rock-art-site-near-idupulapaya/article36768907.ece

01 October 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Neolithic and megalithic structures discovered||A team led by ethnoarchaeologist Yadava Raghu has discovered neolithic grooves, a celt (a tool), and Iron Age burials (megalithic burials), and found epigraphic evidence in and around Chanugondla village of Gudur mandal in Kurnool district. Mr. Raghu, who works as assistant professor in the Department of History at the Sri Sathya Sai University of Human Excellence, Kalaburagi, Karnataka, said he and his team could see a “cultural continuity” from the pre-historic period to the present day. The neolithic evidence found was from 2900 BC to 1000 BC and the Iron Age or Megalithic period evidence found was from 1000 BC to 300 AD. The team found the grooves on the top of ‘rathikonda’, a hillock, and the Celt within 100 metres from each other. The villagers considered the grooves as symbols of Lord Hanuman’s knees. Dolmenoid cist One large east-facing dolmenoid cist, a burial chamber with a porthole, was found on the banks of a tank (locally called Rakunta). The cap stone measured 3.40 metres in length and 2.30 metres in width. The porthole had a width of 60 cm and a height of 80 cm. According to the archaeologists, the portholes are intended to “release the soul of the deceased”. “The portholes also make it possible to gain access to the interiors of the room to perform final rituals,” Mr Raghu explained. “We found three dolmens (east faced) in a row at a distance of about 200 metres from the village on the north. What makes them special is that there is a small burial between two big burials. Probably, all these burials belonged to one family. The small burial could be their offspring,” he said. Neolithic people used polished stone axes for their livelihood. The stone axes are called neoliths. The team came across one beautifully polished and finished triangular celt that measured 18 cm in length, 9 cm in width at the sharp edge, and the butt-end was 2 cm. “Kurnool district is one of the richest zones of the prehistoric centres in the world for early man’s activities. The study in the village, located at a distance of 34 km from the district headquarters, proves it,” Mr. Raghu observed. The other team members were R. Vinod Kumar, M. Sundar Raju, U. Rajasekhar, and R. Jammanna (history lecturers in K.V.R. College and Padmavathi College, Kodumur). They were assisted by Jaya Lakshmi, an assistant professor of history in K.V.R. Degree College, Kurnool. The uniqueness of the village is that it has historical landmarks intact from the Neolithic age.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/neolithic-site-found-in-ap-village/article36767976.ece

01 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||VMC Council meet held amid protests by opposition parties||Protests by opposition parties against the alleged unilateral proceedings by the ruling party marked the general body meeting of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation council led by chairman and Mayor Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi at the Council Hall on Thursday. Telugu Desam Party corporators boycotted the council meeting alleging that the YSRCP-led governing body was passing all the items in the council agenda without leaving any room for discussion. The corporators of TDP and YSRCP were engaged in a war of words as they tried to defend their actions in the council meeting. This forced the Mayor to adjourn the meeting twice. TDP floor leader N. Balaswamy demanded that the VMC repay the amount collected from people as it failed to construct and hand over the APTIDCO houses to them so far. MLA Malladi Vishnu said that the delay in completion of the construction was caused as a result of poor quality construction by the TDP government. Suspended CPI(M) floor leader and lone corporator Boyi Satya Babu also criticised the ruling party for not discussing the agenda before approving the proposals. He was suspended by the Mayor and was forced out by marshals. Mr. Satya Babu later staged a sit-in outside the Council Hall. He alleged that the ruling party was not willing to discuss issues like damaged roads, allocation of TIDCO houses and controlling of viral fevers which were a major cause for concern. Later, TDP corporators walked out of the meeting alleging that the issues raised by them were not addressed. Construction of an indoor stadium at a cost of Rs. 8 crore and appointment of over 200 vidya volunteers were among key resolutions passed by the Council. Earlier in the day, TDP and CPI(M) corporators staged a protest on the premises of the VMC office. They demanded that the government immediately sanction houses to all eligible beneficiaries. They also demanded the withdrawal of the proposal of setting up water meters to household connections and withdrawal of true-up charges on electricity bills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vmc-council-meet-held-amid-protests-by-opposition-parties/article36769062.ece
01 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Justify stand on publishing G.O.s on e-gazette website, HC tells State||The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Thursday directed the State government to file a counter affidavit with regard to every averment made in the petitions that challenged the publication of G.O.s on the websitehttps://apegazette.cgg.gov.ininstead of the old onehttps://goir.ap.gov.in, by October 27, to which date the matter was posted. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice N. Jayasurya, issued the interim order upon hearing a petition filed by S.R. Anjaneyulu, an advocate from Chilamathur mandal in Anantapur district, against the closing down ofhttps://goir.ap.gov.inand selective publication of G.O.s on the e-gazette website in the name of confidentiality. Representing the State, special government pleader C. Sumon said it was only a change of website. He claimed that all the G.O.s were being uploaded on the e-gazette website. He also told the court that it was only for certain reasons thathttps://goir.ap.gov.inwas considered expedient. The petitioner’s counsel, Y. Balaji, sought a direction to the State government to implement Sections 4 and 8 of the Right to Information Act for making all the departments to set up official websites and upload details of their duties, functions etc. He also prayed for declaration of Rule No.156 of the A.P. Secretariat Office Manual, 2005, which provided for restricted uploading of G.O.s in the name of secrecy, as illegal. Mr. Balaji further said the closure of the old website on the pretext that the G.O.s were not having digital signatures was not tenable under law. The court took a serious view of the matter and ordered that the government should come back with a proper justification of its stand by the above date.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/justify-stand-on-publishing-gos-on-e-gazette-website-hc-tells-state/article36768912.ece

JSP political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar and BJP leader Madhukar were present during the deliberations that reportedly focussed on the ways to intensify the protests against the State government’s “anti-people policies.” The Badvel by-election will be a major test for the alliance that suffered a rout in the by-election to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat. The alliance seems to have gained some strength since then going by their relatively better performance in the ZPTC and MPTC elections, though it pales in comparison with the ruling YSRCP’s emphatic win. The outcome of the discussions is kept under wraps amidst speculation that the BJP has agreed to let the JSP field its candidate as part of their mutual understanding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pawan-veerraju-discuss-strategy-for-badvel-bypoll/article36768903.ece
01 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||MPs raise ‘tardy pace’ of railway works with SCR||The issue of tardy pace of railway works allegedly due to the State government not contributing its share of funds was discussed at the meeting the South Central Railway (SCR) officials had with the Members of Parliament representing the constituencies under the railway divisions of Vijayawada, Guntur, Guntakal and Hyderabad here on Thursday. Addressing the media after the meeting, YSRCP MPs Margani Bharat and Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose said it was not right to stall the works citing delay in the sharing of funds by the State government. “We have told the officials that works cannot be stopped citing financial issues as both the State and Central governments have suffered severely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mr. Bharat said. He said representation to take forward the new railway zone works was also made. TDP Rajya Sabha member K. Ravindra Rao said the SCR officials informed that projects such as laying of new railway lines between Nadikudi and Srikalahasthi, Kadapa and Bengaluru, Kotipalli and Narasapur and several RoBs were taken up on a cost-sharing basis. Works were stalled as no funds were deposited by the State government, they said. “It shows that the State has no commitment to complete the projects,” he alleged. Anakapalli MP B. Venkata Satyavathi said the State government had already asked the Centre to bear the cost of all RoBs (Rs. 534 crore). Kakinada MP Vanga Geetha asked SCR to restore trains and increase stoppages. SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya said the issues raised would be considered by the Railways in finalising the development plans. The YSRCP MPs said a decision on supporting or opposing the proposal to privatise the Vijayawada railway station was yet to be taken by the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mps-raise-tardy-pace-of-railway-works-with-scr/article36768900.ece

He said the TDP had a clear majority of 10 of the total 18 MPTCs to win the Duggirala MPP seat. But, the tahsildar did not issue the caste certificate to the TDP-backed MPP candidate Shaik Jabeen on a flimsy ground that her application was incomplete. A representation was made to the Collector, but to no avail, he said. Alleging that the local tahsildar denied the certificate to the candidate at the behest of the YSRCP leaders, Mr. Atchannaidu demanded that the Guntur Collector take steps for issue of caste certificate to Ms. Shaik Jabeen, whose application, filed on September 20, was pending with the tahsildar office.

01 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Encroached drains lead to water-logging in city||Inadequacies in the city’s drainage system surfaced as heavy rains under the impact of Cyclone Gulab pounded the city over the past few days, with stormwater flowing on to roads and inundating entire colonies. Sixty-three areas under the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) limits witnessed severe water-logging, with residents being shifted to rehabilitation centres. Many people underwent an ordeal as rainwater entered homes, damaging furniture, books and kitchen essentials. They bemoaned that inundation of their colonies was due to drains being encroached by illegal constructions. According to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA Visakhapatnam (West Constituency) P.V.G.R. Naidu (Gana Babu), the overflowing of stormwater from a number of drains was occurring due to encroachment caused by unauthorised constructions both by the government as well as private agencies in many colonies. “Pendurthi and the airport area were badly affected. Such heavy water-logging was not seen in recent times. Many colonies experienced flooding for the first time,” Mr. Naidu said. He also said that an Union Government agency has raised the area of construction by around 12 to 13 feet near the Airport-Sheela Nagar area, which resulted in diversion of canal water and flooding of Yellapuvanipalem, SC Colony, Bhagat Singh Nagar and Kothapalem, with the NDRF being deployed to rescue people. “People of Durga Nagar near Sujatha Nagar have never seen such water-logging. The width of a stormwater drain was reduced for the widening of the BRTS corridor near Pendurthi. This led to flooding in the colony. A similar situation prevailed at Marripalem and in the industrial area. Many colonies were flooded for the first time due to disturbances caused to the stormwater drains,” he alleged. When Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao visited the flood-affected areas in Yellapuvanipalem near Gopalapatnam, a number of locals complained of encroachment of drains, saying it led to the inundation of their colonies. A number of areas from Pedagantyada and Gajuwaka region were also inundated. Ward 76 corporator Gandham Srinivasa Rao of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) said that a large boundary wall was built by a private company, which is obstructing the free flow of water in the drain. The water flow was disturbed at many other places such as HB Colony, Burma Colony, Balacheruvu, Korada, and Dairy Colony. The corporator added that he has requested the GVMC to take up desiltation works in the wards, which is still pending. CPI(M) leader B. Ganga Rao alleged that a number of areas do not have proper drainage system. Drainages in many areas are not properly connected to nearby streams. Colonies in Arilova, Hanumanthuwaka, Akkayyapalem, Kancharapalem face inundation due to blockage of existing drains, he said. He also added that the corporation should also provide proper drainage system to slums in areas such as Pendurthi and Kancharapalem. Ward 39 corporator Sadiq Mohammed said that a few drains were blocked due to encroachments over drains, and due to this de-siltation was being hindered, resulting in inundation of a number of areas in One Town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/encroached-drains-lead-to-water-logging-in-city/article36769079.ece
01 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI(M) takes novel route to highlight condition of roads||Cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), armed with shovels and sacks of gravel, converged at Swarna Bharathi Indoor Stadium on Thursday morning and filled up cavernous potholes that sprang up on the roads in the wake of heavy rains caused by Cyclone Gulab. The cadres raised slogans against the State government, protesting its ‘negligence’ in repairing the damaged roads. The protesters further alleged that several accidents are occurring in the city due to the dangerous condition of the roads, and demanded that the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) take up repairs of the roads on a war footing. CPI(M) leader and Ward 78 corporator B. Ganga Rao said that not even a single road under GVMC limits was in a good condition. Since the last two years, the corporation has failed to lay new roads despite seeing first-hand the problems being faced by citizens, Mr. Ganga Rao said, finding fault with the GVMC Council’s decisions to allot funds for theme parks worth Rs. 12 crore on a priority basis instead of repairing local roads. Though many corporators have raised the issue of bad roads in their wards during the council meet, the council has not released any funds for road repairs, he alleged. The CPI(M) leader claimed that the GVMC has not paid arrears to contractors which is why they were unwilling to lay roads. He added that recent rains further damaged the roads, but the GVMC is not focusing on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-takes-novel-route-to-highlight-condition-of-roads/article36769077.ece

According to sources, the incident occurred when some aggrieved tribal farmers put up resistance to the attempts by the Forest staff to take up plantation drive near the village in Ramavaram reserve forest area on Thursday afternoon. Tense situation prevailed for sometime as a group of tribal farmers took the forest staff to task charging the latter with attacking several women farmers and inflicting injuries on them for resisting their attempts to raise plantations in the lands, which they termed as their ‘podu lands’. Claim rejected However, the Forest officials concerned rejected their claims over the “forest lands” and rebutted the charges against the forest staff terming them as “baseless.” Both the aggrieved tribal farmers and the forest field staff filed complaints against each other at the local police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tension-in-tribal-village-over-podu-land/article36768667.ece

However, the first flood warning remained in effect in the riverside areas as the water level hovered at 43.10 feet at the temple town on Thursday night. Collector D Anudeep reviewed the measures to prevent loss of life and property in the flood prone areas through a video conference from the Collectorate in Kothagudem on Thursday afternoon. He issued a set of instructions to the mandal and divisional level officials to prevent the movement of vehicles and bullock carts in the areas around the streams and step-up vigil to curb illegal sand transportation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-level-receding-at-bhadrachalam/article36768694.ece
01 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Increase in paved surfaces leading to urban flooding||A Telangana minister linked the recent flooding in parts of the State to the rise in groundwater table. But is there a link? “It is simple understanding that if the water table becomes shallow or near the surface, the percolation will be limited. And Telangana has seen a big rise in the water table,” says Pandith Madhnure of Telangana Ground Water Department. More roads “But one of the main reasons for urban flooding has been the increase in asphalted and concrete surfaces. This has led to reduced percolation and more run-off leading to floods,” says Mr. Madhnure. A researcher investigating climate change and flooding in Hyderabad says 75% to 80% of the surface in the city has become impervious, leading to flooding. Telangana has seen a big increase in roads at the district, State and national highway levels. In 2016, Telangana had 2,696 kilometres of national highways; this went up by nearly a thousand km in 2019 with national highways covering 2,795 km. Coupled with increasing road density and urbanisation, plastic clogging surface and drainage channels is also playing a role in urban flooding. The Groundwater Department statistics show that Telangana has seen a big improvement in water table that can be seen from the fact that only 1% of the State has water table less than 20 metres below ground level (MBGL) this year. In 2020, the area was 3% and in 2019 it constituted 12.3%. This stunning rise in water table is being credited to above normal rainfall over the past few years, clutch of big irrigation projects as well as the lake rejuvenation programmes undertaken by the State. “Siddipet and Sircilla have shown one of the sharpest rise in water table. In Sircilla, it is due to the Upper Manair and Mid-Manair dams being full and are recharging the aquifer,” says Mr. Madhnure. In August 2019 the water table for Sircilla district was at 12.65 metres BGL, in 2020 it was at 5.54 mts BGL and in this year it is at 4.69 mts BGL. The decadal average of the district is 16.10 mts BGL. “Mission Kakatiya has led to rejuvenation of 27,000 lake bodies as well as 10,000 irrigation tanks. The dependency on ground water for drinking water too has dipped,” informs Mr. Madhnure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/increase-in-paved-surfaces-leading-to-urban-flooding/article36768692.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fever survey on course to track spike in water borne diseases||With the effect of Cyclone Gulab receding in Telangana, the threat from viral fevers, mosquito and water borne diseases is looming. And therefore, the State Health department is on the job of conducting fever surveys to know if there is any spike in viral fevers or other diseases. Since heavy rains and inundations could lead to water stagnation and contamination, there is a possibility of increase in mosquitoes leading to dengue, malaria and other vector borne diseases. District Medical and Health Officers said that surveillance measures have been going on continuously since it has been raining at regular intervals in the State. Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao has recently issued instructions to the DMHOs directing them to make sure supervisory staff, nursing and para medical staff conduct field visits in their jurisdiction and take the necessary preventive measures. “Whenever we receive heavy rains, the immediate measures we can take are limited to conducting health camps, and shifting pregnant women or patients in need of emergency medical care to hospitals as saving lives is the priority during such times. The measures to control vector borne diseases begin after the rains subside. But, we have to ensure that mosquitoes do not breed,” said a Health official. Additional director at National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr. G. Amar Singh said that the ideal temperature for mosquitoes to breed and dengue virus to spread is around 25 degrees centigrade, and constant water stagnation, and presence of huge number of people. “The temperatures of less than 20 or above 30 degrees centigrade is not ideal for mosquitoes. So prevalence of the virus will come down after monsoons. Aedes mosquitoes can bite multiple people. So, presence of a lot of people is another factor for the virus to spread,” Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fever-survey-on-course-to-track-spike-in-water-borne-diseases/article36768669.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KRMB urged to stop GNSS works||Telangana government has addressed one more letter to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), this time requesting the river board to restrain Andhra Pradesh from executing works pertaining to the Galeru-Nagari Sujala Sravanthi (GNSS) lift irrigation project with enhanced scope of the surplus water-based project. “Any expansion work of an irrigation project or a new scheme taken up after June 2, 2014 attracts the provisions of Section 85 (8) of the AP Reorganisation Act,” Engineer-in-Chief (General-Irrigation) of Telangana C. Muralidhar said in a letter written to Chairman of KRMB M.P. Singh. He requested the river board Chairman to stop A.P. from proceeding with the expansion works of the project and also take the matter to the notice of the Jal Shakti Ministry. The Telangana ENC stated that the A.P. government had given approval to the work of improvement, widening and lining to the GNSS main canal from 0 to 56 km to increase the discharge capacity with Rs. 305.7 crore and also taking up construction of a new lift based on GNSS main canal with Rs. 56.83 crore. Stating that two letters were already written to the board restraining A.P. from taking up expansion of GNSS project he said A.P. was modifying the project scope and adding new components without appraisal of the river board and approval of the Apex Council. He explained to the river board Chairman that GNSS would draw water from Pothireddypadu Head Regulator, Srisailam Right Main Canal and Banakcherla Cross Regulator during the flood period. A new regulator was constructed at Banakacherla to draw 22,000 cusecs water to GNSS without any approval. However, the approved total drawal of water from Pothireddypadu was only 34 tmc ft with maximum drawal of 11,150 cusecs from the old structure of the regulator with four gates (vents) and not the expanded portion taken up in 2007 without any approval to draw another 44,000 cusecs, the ENC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/krmb-urged-to-stop-gnss-works/article36768683.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Breast cancer helpline launched||UBF HELP 08046983383, a helpline that gives information about various aspects of breast cancer and benign breast diseases, was launched by Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu at a virtual event held on Thursday. Convenor of the community services at Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation (UBF) K. Sandhya Rani said that objectives of the helpline are to dispel apprehensions and provide emotional support to callers. Patients will be provided with information and clarify on all aspects of benign breast diseases, breast cancer, including assessment, treatment, coping mechanisms, post-treatment coping, and diet. She added that callers will be advised about breast health, and counselling will be provided to those who are anxious, fearful, and distressed. An important feature of the initiative is that the helpline will be spearheaded by breast cancer survivors who have been through the gruelling grind of treatment. They will share their experiences, and reassure and support callers. A committed team will provide free one-to-one counselling. Mr. Naidu praised the efforts of the survivors and their unwavering commitment towards spreading awareness about breast cancer. He said an alarming fact is that for the first time since 2020, the incidence of breast cancer has overtaken lung cancer to become the commonest cancer worldwide. “According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer GLOBOCAN 2018, in India, breast cancer claims lives of 87,000 patients every year. Breast cancer has now surpassed cervical cancer to become the most common cancer affecting women in India,” he said, adding that there is an urgent need to bring down the cost of cancer treatment. Founder, CEO and director of UBF Dr. P. Raghu Ram listed the initiatives of the foundation towards creating awareness about early detection of cancer. Pink Ribbon campaign, population-based screening programme, and other initiatives were listed. Technical support is provided by Step One, and Association of Health Psychologists provided services of a network of counsellors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/breast-cancer-helpline-to-dispel-apprehensions/article36768671.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ordnance Factory Medak now under AVNL Chennai||One of the biggest defence production establishments in Telangana and the only one in the country making armed combat vehicles, Ordnance Factory Medak, will be seen in a new role as it has been amalgamated into the newly-formed Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (AVNL) to be headquartered in Chennai (Avadi) from October 1. All the 3,000-odd employees will be deputed and transferred into this new defence unit, one of the seven recently-formed after rejig of Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) headquartered at Kolkata, a few days ago. The Medak unit is among the 41 factories under OFB and its foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the first vehicle was rolled out in 1987 with technology assistance from Soviet Union and later the Russians, informed senior officials on Thursday. Ever since for the last 37 years, it has been in the forefront in making armoured personnel carriers of various kinds with lot of indigenous technology inputs, including mine proof, bullet proof vehicles and those on reconnaissance missions and missile launch vehicles. OF-M has been collaborating with DRDO armament and combat engineering cluster like the Combat Vehicle Research Development Establishment at Chennai and the Vehicle Research Development Research Establishment at Ahmednagar. Armoured Engineering Reconnaissance Vehicle with amphibious movement capabilities and another set to be able to detect biological, nuclear or chemical attacks are part of its production with the factory having the latest steel casting and aluminium foundry, heavy machining and assembly lines, precision cutting machines and castings. Senior officials said high altitude and futuristic combat vehicles with night vision capabilities are being made following the recent border skirmishes with the Chinese. Till date, it is said to have rolled out more than 3,000 armoured vehicles with annual turnover of more than 100 with works on to double the capacity. Earlier this year, it has received the defence ministry order of about 150 combat vehicles. The first ordnance factory was set up in Cossipore near Kolkata in 1801 and hence, the lineage can be traced to the British times but now the government wishes to make it easier for private sector participation under the public, private partnership for developing futuristic armoured vehicles in a more competitive manner, they added. OF-M will now be part of three other firms in AVNL - Engine factory and heavy vehicle factory at Avadi, Machine Tool prototype factory at Ambernath (Maharastra) and vehicle factory at Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ordnance-factory-medak-now-under-avnl-chennai/article36768678.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||An invitation to death on city roads||Storm water drains continue to gobble up lives of citizens, which has become quite a common occurrence in city especially when it rains heavy. Yet, safety measures against such deaths do not appear to take priority in the list of infrastructural development works planned for the city. The latest such fatality is a 54-year-old man who fell into the open storm water drain near Qutbullahpur, whose body is yet to be traced five days after his disappearance. The incident in Manikonda on the same day, where a techie stepped directly into a drain assuming that there was road, is another case in point, though the drain concerned is not an open one. Action has been taken against officials responsible for the open manhole on the drain in Manikonda. Open drains without retaining walls, as in the Qutbullahpur incident, pose even graver danger for walkers, while the blame cannot be pinned on any official. “During heavy rains, it is common for the nala to overflow on the road. It becomes difficult to distinguish between road and nala space unless one is familiar with the terrain. Officials do close the culvert for vehicles during such times, but pedestrians keep crossing over,” says Khaja Mohiuddin, a shopkeeper in Uppal. The drain in question is lined by the back portions of built houses for most of its course, only to be broken by roads built over culverts. Danger just lurks by for pedestrians as the narrow road portion becomes one with the drain when it overflows. A retaining wall, or a chain linked mesh built over the nala could help, Mr.Mohiuddin feels. There are several such stretches in city, where fatal mishaps could be prevented through construction of retaining walls. As per the information available with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), the stretches of major open drains over two meters in width without retaining walls or security mesh are close to 40 kilometres in length. “When the drain is less than two metres in width, safety measures may include laying slabs or covers and constructing box or pipe drains wherever the drain is open. But when the width is over two metres, retaining wall or chain linked mesh is the only option to prevent accidents,” shared an official. Chain linked mesh, however, can only be a temporary solution, as evidenced in the case of the Qutbullahpur incident. The mesh, though existing, was rusted, and partially broken, leading to the fatality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/an-invitation-to-death-on-city-roads/article36768666.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Primary education in doldrums, charges Bandi Sanjay Kumar||BJP State president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar charged the TRS government of “weakening the primary education system” - directly affecting the prospects of the children belonging to the weaker sections by removing Vidya volunteers and sanitary workers even while not releasing maintenance funds for government schools. “Does the government want to shut down schools? Every place I went, most schools are functioning from dilapidated buildings - lacking teachers, basic amenities and cleanliness. How will children get proper education under these conditions?,” he questioned on the 34th day of his ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ in Siddipet district, following a visit to school at Sriramulapalle village on Thursday. Government grant The government is supposed to grant up to Rs. 12,00 - Rs. 1 lakh for primary schools and Rs. 25,000 - Rs. 1 lakh for high schools for maintenance but this has been stopped. “There are not enough staff to teach or keep the classrooms clean and on top of it 12,000 Vidya volunteers have been removed. The primary education is in doldrums. What happened to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s promises on this front,” he questioned. Mr. Sanjay Kumar interacted with students and teachers and regretted that “there is no fund to even purchase chalks.” Later in the evening, he released a press note castigating the government for ignoring Backward Classes and asked about the Rs. 20,000 crore separate budget as was assured by the CM and also about funds for the BC federation, self-respect buildings, etc. Smirti Irani coming Union Minister for Women & Child Development Smirti Irani will be the chief guest for the final meeting of the BJP president to be held at Husnabad town on Oct.2 to mark the end of the first phase of his ‘padayatra’. The duo will garland the statue of Mahatma Gandhi and later conduct a road show before reaching Dr. Ambedkar centre for the public meeting. Party leaders claimed that the ‘padayatra’ has been an unprecedented success with Mr. Sanjay Kumar not only attracting crowds wherever he went, but his message of highlighting the people's problems and criticism of TRS government's maladministration and failure to keep up promises has been well received.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/primary-education-in-the-doldrums-alleges-bandi/article36768685.ece

Focussed on gas safety devices manufacturing, the company said the facility is its first in India. Speaking at the factory opening event, CEO Tom Lundquist said the company has received ISI certification for its LPG safety device and looked forward to tapping the huge potential for the product in India. The factory near Hyderabad is also part of the firm’s plans to diversify the supply chain beyond China. Thanking Telangana government for its support, he said the market for the products, government’s emphasis on Make in India and political stability were factors behind the company’s plans to establish a bigger facility. Sources in the company said IGCT has invested Rs. 20 crore on the manufacturing facility here and plans to invest an additional Rs. 20 crore on the expansion plans in near future. The LPG safety device for households is an advanced gas safety device with features such as automatic shut off in the event of a gas leak. The company is also considering introducing another safety device for commercial LPG users such as restaurants and eateries. Telangana Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said IGCT represents the best of Danish enterprise known for innovation and technology. The firm has decided to set up a factory whose capacity will be many times over the 1.50 lakh units a month it has created now in Hyderabad. More jobs A bigger factory would also translate into creation of more jobs opportunities, he said, hoping the location for the new factory is identified shortly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/danish-firm-opens-factory-near-city/article36768676.ece
01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BCs demand caste-based census||Intensifying the pitch for caste-based census, an alliance of 92 Backward Class groups has warned that they will not vote for the BJP if caste is not incorporated in the census operations. Major political parties, including the Congress, the TRS, Left and the TJS extended their support to the demand at an all-party meeting held here on Wednesday. The meeting demanded that the government refrain from privatising public sector undertakings and take steps to provide 50% reservation to BCs in legislatures. The meeting was chaired by National BC Welfare Association president R. Krishnaiah and it was attended among others by V. Hanumantha Rao and Mallu Ravi of Congress, L. Ramana of TRS, M. Kodandaram of TJS and Aziz Pasha and Bala Mallesh of the CPI. The speakers lamented that the government is not taking advantage of the census operations to ensure enumeration of BCs. The BC census would be of significant use in the conduct of elections to local bodies as well as providing quota in employment and education. Absence of the data pertaining to BCs is making it difficult to allot reservations in accordance with their population. The government had appointed a committee to classify reservations for different BC groups, but the committee is finding it difficult to make the assessment for want of census of BC population. The meeting felt that there would not be any scope for giving reservations to underprivileged sections going by the manner in which the Centre is bent on privatising public sector undertakings like LIC, banks, ports and others. The BJP which criticized the previous governments for handing over the industries to corporates is itself privatising all the profit-making PSUs, said the leaders present in the meeting. Mr. Krishnaiah threatened to launch an agitation if the Bill providing 50% reservation to BCs in legislatures is not tabled in the Parliament. He lamented that 74 years after the country became independent, BCs are still not being given their constitutional rights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bcs-demand-caste-based-census/article36768686.ece

Water harvesting works such as construction of farm ponds, percolation tanks and check dams taken up under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, silt removal, improvement of feeders and bund strengthening of minor irrigation tanks taken up under the Mission Kakatiya programme and improved irrigation facilities have all helped bring up the groundwater table. From the average of 17.55 metres below ground level in May 2016, months before reorganisation of the district in October that year, the groundwater table has come up to 6.38 metres in August this year, after the second reorganisation of the district in February 2019. In May this year, the average depth of groundwater availability was 10 metres below ground level. According to district officials, there is no drinking water scarcity now with the help of Mission Bhagiratha scheme and it has also shed the tag of having dark areas, where groundwater table is below 20 metres of ground level. “Till 2014, there were at least six mandals — Midjil, Rajapur, C.C.Kunta, Hanwada, Jadcherla and Mahabubnagar which fall in the present Mahabubnagar district (the combined Mahabubnagar was first reorganised in October 2016 and again in February 2019),” the official explained. During the 2014-21 period, a total of 342 check dams, 338 percolation tanks and 656 water harvesting structures have been constructed under various schemes including Jal Shakti Abhiyan in the district (the present Mahabubnagar areas). Besides, removal of silt, strengthening of the bunds and improving feeder channel has also been taken up in about 450 minor irrigation tanks to improve their water-holding capacity. Linking of most of those MI tanks to canals of major irrigation projects has also helped replenishment of water in the tanks for the two crop seasons every year. “All such measures have helped bring up the groundwater table with no dark areas. In fact, the groundwater is available in the 5-10 metres below ground level range now in mandals such as Bhoothpur, Koilkonda, Mohammadabad and Nawabpet,” the official explained. One indication of improved groundwater table is cultivation of paddy. It was taken up on 1,14,232 acres in 202-21 kharif and 1,21,031 on acres in 2020-21 rabi. This kharif, it is cultivated on 1,72,518 acres with production estimated at 4.33 lakh tonnes of paddy, the official said. “From the past of labour from Mahabubnagar going on distress migration every year, now labour from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha are coming to the district for livelihood in agriculture and allied work,” District Collector S. Venkata Rao said summing up the change.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-table-up-in-mahabubnagar/article36768682.ece

01 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court notices in PIL plea over lawyers’ group insurance||The Telangana High Court has issued notices to the State government, Law Secretary and others in a PIL petition seeking group medical insurance facility to all advocates on the rolls of Bar Council of Telangana without any discrimination. A bench of Justices A. Rajashekar Reddy and T. Vinod Kumar, after hearing the PIL plea, said that notices should also be issued to two other respondents Telangana Advocates Welfare Trust and Bar Council for the State of Telangana in the matter. Lawyer and member of Telangana Bar Council Sirikonda Sanjeeva Rao, who filed the petition, contended that amendments made to clauses 2, 3 and 4 of Supplementary Deed of Advocates Welfare Trust were without jurisdiction and arbitrary. He wanted an order to be issued to the government not to disburse any grants from the Trust to any person other than advocates. According to the petitioner, originally the Trust was meant for the benefit of only advocates practising in the State of Telangana. With the amendments, public at large (with particular focus on economically backward sections) were brought under the gambit of the Trust beneficiaries. As a result, the benefits meant exclusively for the practising advocates of Telangana would have to be shared with the general public other than lawyers. Hence, these amendments were arbitrary and illegal, he stated. The petitioner maintained that while there were 42,237 advocates in the State only 20,237 had been covered under group medical insurance. Only those lawyers whose details were sent by the bar associations to the Bar Council got covered under the insurance scheme, he said. The Trust should not have asked the bar associations for the details of the lawyers to be covered under the insurance scheme. The Trust knew that details of all practising advocates in the State were available with the Bar Council. Still, it preferred to secure details of lawyers from the bar associations. This was resulting in injustice to the lawyers, the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-court-notices-in-pil-plea-over-lawyers-group-insurance/article36768696.ece
01 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Owaisi-KCR duo manipulating statistics of poor Muslims: Shabbir Ali||The Congress party has alleged that AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao have hatched a plan to cheat the Muslim community of Telangana by trying to sell the figures that only 9,000 Muslim families are eligible for ‘Minorities Bandhu’, which the Congress party has been demanding. TPCC Political Affairs Committee convener Mohammed Ali Shabbir said that more than five lakh poor Muslim families are eligible to get Rs. 10 lakh each on a par with Dalit families who are being covered under the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme. However, AIMIM has used the data compiled by a Commission of Inquiry in 2015-16 and manipulated it to show that out of 8.80 lakh Muslim households, only 9,000 Muslim families are eligible. Mr. Ali said that the Centre for Development Policy and Practice (CDPP), an NGO, with its misleading analysis of the G. Sudhir Commission report on Muslims claimed that only 1% of the Muslims were poor and this is to deny Muslims the benefit of ‘Minorities Bandhu’ which the Chief Minister is under pressure to announce. Mr. Ali asked on what basis the report arrived at the conclusion that only 8.5% of Muslims are poor and said this estimation was not based on any official data. He said Mr. Asaduddin Owaisi lives in a palace in Vattepally, Shastripuram, and if he conducts a survey in the slums of Vattepally, he will find more than 9,000 poor Muslim families there itself. He reminded that the Sudhir Commission, in its report, pointed out that 43% of Muslims are living in rented houses. “Are those poor Muslim families living in rented houses not eligible to get Rs. 10 lakh assistance?” he asked. Only 19.2% of the Muslims are regularly salaried as per the report, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/owaisi-kcr-duo-manipulating-statistics-of-poor-muslims-shabbir-ali/article36768689.ece

01 October 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Lecturer takes up organic farming to grow dragon fruit||A tech-savvy physics lecturer of the Government Junior College in Wyra town is showing the way to farmers in growing the exotic and delicious dragon fruit by following organic farming method to protect soil fertility, and using solar-powered surveillance cameras to save the ready to harvest fruit crop from theft and monkey menace. For 45-year-old Bukya Veerabhadra Rao, hailing from a small village in Nelaondapalli mandal, organic farming has been a passion since his school days. He continued to pursue his interest in organic farming and growing fruit plants even after entering the teaching profession more than 16 years ago after completing his M.Sc and B.Ed degrees from Osmania University. He has procured dragon fruit plants from a progressive farmer in Sangareddy district and planted them on his one-and-a-half-acre farm field by adopting the organic farming method at Ganya Tanda in Kusumanchi mandal in September last year. He has now started reaping a rich harvest of the exotic fruit known for its high nutritional value. To protect the ready to harvest dragon fruits, he has recently installed solar-powered based surveillance cameras at his farm. Dragon fruit is not only delicious but healthy as it contains micronutrients and is considered as an immunity booster, says Mr. Veerabhadra Rao. There is an increasing awareness on the health benefits of dragon fruit and as such the demand for the delicious fruit is set to grow further, he noted, saying the dragon fruit is presently commanding a good price in the range of Rs. 170 to Rs. 200 per kg in the local market. The recently installed solar-powered CCTV cameras at my farm are helping me to keep tabs on the movement of monkeys and intruders on my smartphone through the internet, he explains, highlighting the potential of wireless technologies and off-grid surveillance systems to protect fruit crops in rural areas. “I am trying to educate local farmers to adopt organic farming and harness the latest technologies to earn a sustainable income,” the physics lecturer, who has gone hi-tech in protecting his farm field, told The Hindu . “The fruit crops should be grown in a natural way to protect the soil fertility, public health and the environment,” he emphasises.  I am trying to educate local farmers to adopt organic farming and harness the latest technologies to earn a sustainable income.

01 October 2021||Kochi,TELANGANA||Monson’s ex-driver to get protection||The Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the police to ensure protection for former driver of Monson Mavungal, self-styled antiquities dealer and accused in a financial fraud case. The former driver, who had earlier been questioned over a cheating complaint against Mr. Mavungal, had alleged intimidation by his former employer and some police officers. Justice Devan Ramachandran allowed the petitioner to implead the State Police Chief as a respondent in the case as the court felt that the allegation had acquired a new colour. A district court has extended Monson’s Crime Branch custody by another three days. The court observed that the assertions of the petitioner required to be closely looked into by competent police authorities, including the State Police Chief, particularly because investigation was proceeding against Monson. The court passed the order on a petition by Ajith E.V. of Ernakulam seeking a directive to the Circle Inspector of Police, Cherthala, and the Station House Officer, Ernakulam North police station, to desist from harassing the petitioner. According to the petitioner, he had earlier appeared before the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch, Alappuzha, for interrogation in connection with a cheating complaint against Monson filed by one Rajendran Pillai and given statements on August 7. The petitioner was threatened by Monson after he learnt that the former had disclosed details regarding the case. The petitioner said Monson was close to many senior police officers and had threatened him that he would be implicated in criminal cases and put in jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/monsons-ex-driver-to-get-protection/article36767974.ece

Both government and the oustees are sticking to their guns. “We are ready to extend all payments to the oustees at one stake and all steps are being taken in this direction. For many oustees the amounts were paid about five years ago. We appeal to the oustees of Gudatipally and Samaji Tanda to vacate the villages voluntarily,” said Collector P.

Bandi Sanjay Kumar, who embarked upon a padayatra in the State, will conclude his programme at Husnabad on October 2, the party leadership announced on Wednesday night. Though the programme was scheduled to culminate at Huzurabad, where a by-election was announced after the resignation of former health minister Etala Rajender from TRS and from his elected post, it was shifted to Husnabad due to the election code coming into force. The by-election will be held on October 30 and counting will be on November 2. Mr. Sanjay has taken up the padayatra to boost the prospects of the party in the State and paving way for the general elections scheduled for 2023 in the State and 2024 at the Centre. The BJP State president is on aggressive mode against the State government and firing salvos on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. As late as on Wednesday, he has written an open letter to the Chief Minister demanding that the government release a white paper on the double-bedroom houses constructed in the three constituencies – Gajwel being represented by Chief Minister himself, followed by Siddipet being represented by Finance Minister T Harish Rao and at Sircilla being represented by Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao and in the remaining 116 Assembly constituencies in the State. Several BJP leaders from the State and Centre are expected to attend the meeting. It might be recalled that on September 17, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy held a public meeting attended by Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabba, which turned out to be a grand success in the native place of the Chief Minister.

01 October 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Sidhu was focussed on Sikh matters alone||Two days ago, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu quit as president of the Punjab Congress, asserting he would “not compromise on the struggle for Punjab-favoured agenda,” even as his politics in the recent past is seen to have been largely revolving around Sikh (panthic) issues in an attempt to politically corner the Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), keeping other potent issues at bay. In April, after remaining in political slumber since his resignation from the Punjab Cabinet in 2019, Mr. Sidhu resurrected his political ride by going to a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, near Bargari village of Faridkot. The village was the epicentre of sacrilege incidents in 2015. Two Sikh protesters were killed at Behbal Kalan during protests against the sacrilege. Mr. Sidhu had been forcefully raising the issue of providing justice in the sacrilege incidents and hitting out at both his own government and the ‘Badal’ family in an attempt to project himself and the Congress as ‘pro-panth.’ In his bid to garner Sikh votes focussing on the community’s issues and by presenting himself as ‘pro-panthic’ by evoking the Bargari sacrilege issue repeatedly, Mr. Sidhu possibly does not realise that ahead of 2022 Assembly election, the ‘over focus’ on ‘panthic’ issues could end up eroding a substantial section of the Hindu vote bank that, according to many political analysts, has traditionally been with the Congress. In Punjab, ‘panthic’ voters have been traditionally associated with the SAD, while Hindu voters have traditionally been inclined towards the Congress. “The Congress has always had its support base among Hindus and Sikhs. But over-focussing on ‘panthic’ issues could create problems as it would be playing in the domain of the Akali Dal. The Congress should not go overboard with such issues. Already, the Akali Dal is on the back foot over the sacrilege issue. The Congress, in fact, should show some action on the ground rather than making noise. Mr. Sidhu’s attempt to foray into ‘panthic’ voters could backfire as the Hindu voters could swing,” said Ashutosh Kumar, professor, political science department, Punjab University. Punjab-based writer and political analyst Desraj Kali said resignation over the issue surrounding Bargari was not justified. “Mr. Sidhu should have realised that there are several other issues beyond the Bargari sacrilege that have plagued Punjab. People in Punjab are facing issues of unemployment, drugs, economic mess, farmer and labourer problems and their suicides. He quit on only one agenda,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sidhu-was-focussed-on-sikh-matters-alone/article36768535.ece
01 October 2021||Coimbatore/New Delhi,||Court hands over T.N. rape case to Air Force||The additional mahila court in Coimbatore on Thursday handed over to the Indian Air Force the case of rape made against a Flight Lieutenant by his woman colleague for court-martial proceedings. Sources said N. Thilageswari, in-charge of the Additional Mahila Court, ordered that the case must be transferred from the Coimbatore City Police to the IAF as per provisions of the Air Force Act, 1950. Since both the accused and the survivor were in active service under the IAF and the alleged incident occurred within the premises of the Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) in Coimbatore, the judge observed that only the IAF could carry out further legal proceedings in this case. Earlier, the accused, Flight Lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh, 29, was produced in the court. The All Women Police, Coimbatore Central, arrested him on September 25 based on a complaint of the 28-year-old woman IAF officer and he was remanded in judicial custody for four days. According to the police, the incident occurred in the early hours of September 10 on the AFAC, Coimbatore campus, where both had arrived for a training course. The woman officer, in an FIR registered on September 20 in Coimbatore, alleged that a Flight Lieutenant trespassed into her room and raped her under the influence of alcohol on September 10. She also alleged that her Commandant and senior officers pressured her to withdraw her complaint, and that she was subjected to a two-finger test at the Air Force Hospital. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Women on Thursday wrote to IAF Chief V.R. Chaudhari on the banned two-finger test conducted on the woman officer following her allegations of rape. The NCW said it was “utterly disappointed and strongly condemned the action of IAF doctors conducting the banned test on the victim (sic).” In her letter, NCW chief Rekha Sharma urged the IAF Chief to “take necessary action” and ensure that its medical fraternity is aware of “prevailing guidelines laid down by the government.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-hands-over-tn-rape-case-to-air-force/article36768568.ece
01 October 2021||GURUGRAM,||Hooda flays Haryana govt. over paddy purchase issue||Haryana’s former Chief Minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had expressed concern over alleged mismanagement in purchase of paddy in the State. Mr. Hooda, also the Leader of Opposition, said 14 lakh quintal paddy was lying under the open sky in the mandis but the government was carrying out procurement. “The government itself had announced that it would start procurement from September 25 but there is no clarity on when this would start. While the government is dragging its feet, paddy of the farmers is getting spoiled due to the intermittent rains. Farmers have no other option but to sell their crops below Minimum Support Price,” he said. Addressing a press conference in Rohtak, Mr. Hooda expressed objection to the statement of the government not to buy millet. “Earlier the government encouraged farmers to leave paddy and grow bajra and now it talks about not buying bajra. This is an anti-farmer decision,” he said, adding: “The government is promising to protect Bajra farmers under the 'Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana' but this scheme has pushed vegetable growers to the brink of ruin. Therefore, the government should buy millet and every grain of all crops according to its promise.” Waterlogging issue He said waterlogging remains a major problem facing the farmers even today as crops have suffered extensive damage due to excessive rain. “Farmers have not got their compensation till now and there are many fields in the State that continue to be waterlogged and no arrangement has been made to drain out water. The government should soon compensate the farmers for the damaged crops..,” Mr. Hooda demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hooda-flays-haryana-govt-over-paddy-purchase-issue/article36768533.ece
01 October 2021||GURUGRAM,||Act against group for disrupting namaz: forum||Members of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ forum, on Thursday demanded legal action against a Hindu fringe group for alleged repeated attempts to disrupt jumma namaz (Friday prayers) through intimidation at various locations across the city. A five-member delegation of the forum called on DCP (Headquarters) Aastha Modi and complained that Bharat Mata Vahini members were showing up at namaz locations, designated by the local administration for the purpose of offering Friday prayers, and intimidating imams and using provocative and hurtful language to disrupt the prayers. The delegation handed over a memorandum saying that the group, in its latest attempt, had on September 24 disrupted Friday prayers in Sector 47. “Before this, the group had appeared at consecutive Fridays in Sector 39 and 40 in March last year. They have been successful in getting the prayers stopped during March and April this year,” said the letter. Reacting, Haryana Shiv Sena spokesperson Ritu Raj said his party was not involved in the disruption of the Friday prayers, but they supported the demand that the designated places of namaz be reduced as agreed upon by both parties in 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/act-against-group-for-disrupting-namaz-forum/article36768553.ece

Nadda. He was accompanied by Manipur Works Minister T. Bishwajit and BJP State president A. Sharda. Mr. Biren said that the team had been called to chalk out a strategy for the forthcoming March 2022 Assembly polls in the State. He also said that he would meet Home Minister Amit Shah and urge him to instruct the National Investigation Agency to take up the case of the kidnap and murder of social worker Athuan Abomei in Tamenglong on September 22. Changes are anticipated in the State’s politics in the run-up to the Assembly polls. BJP sources said that some Congress MLAs and former legislators are likely to join the party. Prominent Congress leaders denied this as speculation. Nine tribal MLAs, who are members of the Hill Areas Committee, have been camping in Delhi with their complaint against the non-tabling of the Autonomous District Council (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the monsoon session of the Assembly. Some other BJP MLAs are also in Delhi to air their grievances. Meanwhile, Pradyut Bordoloi, MP and the All India Congress Committee’s observer for Manipur, before leaving Imphal on Thursday, said that the Congress would win the majority in the 2022 elections. The BJP-led government has been a non-performing one, he said. Although drug traffickers were rounded up, they were all released on bail, Mr. Bordoloi alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nadda-summons-manipur-cm-to-new-delhi/article36768584.ece
01 October 2021||Mumbai,||No OBC quota for Maharashtra bypolls||Supreme Court’s March 2021 decision to quash reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local civic bodies in Maharashtra, and terming it ‘statutory’, has shaken up the political circles in the State. The court ruled that total reservation for OBCs, SCs and STs should not cross the 50% ceiling. Following the SC’s rejection of the review petition by Maharashtra government, the State issued an ordinance which, while keeping 27% reservation for OBCs, mandates that total reservation of SCs, STs and OBCs will not cross 50% mark. However, the October 5 bye-elections in Akola, Washim, Dhule, Nandurbar and Nagpur zilla parishads and the very first election for Palghar zilla parishad will, for the first time since 1994, have no OBC reservation. How did it all start? In Maharashtra, OBCs include Denotified Tribes (Vimukta Jati), Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Category. The Mandal commission report relying on the last caste census 1931 had calculated the total OBC population at 52%, based on which 27% reservation to OBCs was extended. With SCs and STs accounting for a combined 22.7% reservation, the apex court limited the total reservation with a 50% cap after the addition of OBC quota. Maharashtra extended the 27% OBC reservation in local civic bodies in 1994. In 2018, Vikas Gawali, a former zilla parishad member from Washim district approached the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court and sought a stay on the election process in Washim and Akola districts citing breach of the 50% cap. The court granted status quo and elections were delayed. Mr. Gawali approached the apex court which passed an interim order directing the State Election Commission to conduct the polls subject to the final order of the pending petition. Mr. Gawali again filed a petition against the interim order. Meanwhile, delayed polls in five zilla parishads and panchayat samitis were held in 2020. Previous verdict referred Mr. Gawali had referred to the 2010 Supreme Court verdict in the case of K. Krishnamurthy and others versus Union of India and others. Though a five-member Constitution Bench headed by the then Chief Justice K. Balakrishnan validated the 27% OBC reservation, the verdict said, “dedicated commissions need to be appointed to conduct a rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness”. It also observed that, “in the absence of updated empirical data, it is well nigh impossible for the Courts to decide whether the reservations in favour of OBC groups are proportionate are not”. The court also fixed the upper limit of reservation at 50%. Effect on OBCs In March 2021, the apex court ruled in favour of Mr. Gawali. It said that the provision of Section 12 (2) (c) of Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, giving 27% reservation to OBCs may be invoked only after complying conditions mentioned above. According to Dr. Hari Narke, a scholar on OBC-related issues and former member of the State Backward Class Commission, the order was given under Article 142 of the Constitution and it affects not only Maharashtra but the entire country. This verdict affected at least 56,000 OBC seats in 28,000 gram panchayats, 350 panchayat samitis, 367 municipal councils, 34 zilla parishads and 27 municipal corporations. “This is going to affect OBCs across the country,” . If any person approaches the court for his/her respective local body polls anywhere in the country, the verdict will have to be implemented,” said Dr. Narke. According to him, conducting OBC census and sharing data from 2011 census is the only way forward. What government did? The Cabinet cleared an amendment in section 12 (2) (c) of Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 which said that “while keeping 27% OBC reservation, it will be ensured that total reservation of all including SC, ST and OBCs will not cross 50% limit”. Political battle The main opposition in the State, the BJP, claimed that MVA government was negligent on OBC reservation issue while the government pointed fingers at BJP-led central government for not sharing the data with the State government. Following the affidavit of Union ministry, the State government has said that it now stands vindicated and BJP should be blamed for the OBC reservation mess. Dr. Narke pointed out that former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had sought empirical data from the Centre but it was denied. He has also countered the Centre’s claim of inaccuracies in the data saying the decision to not share it was taken by the Modi government in June 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-a-first-maharashtra-civic-bypolls-without-any-obc-quota/article36768523.ece
01 October 2021||Mumbai,||‘Fraud accused can undergo surgery at J.J. Hospital’||The Maharashtra government has informed the Bombay High Court that the State-run JJ Hospital in the city has the facility to conduct a pacemaker implantation surgery for businessman Rakesh Wadhawan, who is accused of money laundering in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank fraud case. Mr. Wadhawan, who is in judicial custody, is currently undergoing treatment at the civic-run KEM Hospital. The State prison authority on Wednesday made the submission before a Bench of Justice Bharati Dangre in compliance with a previous query posed by the court while hearing a medical bail plea filed by Mr. Wadhawan. Pacemaker implant Last week, Justice Dangre had asked the prison authorities to inform the court if any government hospital in Mumbai had pacemaker implantation facility after Mr. Wadhawan’s lawyer Abad Ponda told the High Court that the businessman needed to undergo an angioplasty for implantation of a pacemaker urgently. Mr. Ponda had said that KEM Hospital, where the accused had been admitted by the State prison authorities for treatment of multiple ailments, did not have the facility. To this, the Bench had said at the time that if such a facility was not available at any government hospital, then Mr. Wadhawan will have to be granted the option of undergoing the procedure at a private hospital of his choice and the expenses for the same will have to be borne by him. The State prison authorities told the court on Wednesday while the facility was not available at the civic-run KEM, the surgery can be performed at J.J. Hospital. Mr. Wadhawan's medical examination can be conducted at J.J. Hospital to carry out further procedures, it said. Mr. Wadhawan, the founder of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in 2019 on charges of money laundering in the PMC bank scam.The High Court will hear the plea further next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fraud-accused-can-undergo-surgery-at-jj-hospital/article36768524.ece
01 October 2021||Mumbai,||‘Centre shouldn’t show bias in giving aid’||Maharashtra’s Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday said that the Centre should not be biased in extending financial aid to the Marathwada region ravaged by incessant rains. “For some States, the Centre has given relief of thousands of crores without even them seeking aid. The Union government is that of the entire country. It should not be biased,” Mr. Pawar said. “Any demand seeking financial aid to the Centre would be made only after taking stock of the losses suffered by farmers. But ultimately it is the Centre’s decision on how much aid should be given,” Mr. Pawar added. Commenting on the Opposition BJP’s demand to declare “wet drought” in the State, Mr. Pawar said that the State government was collecting all the necessary information. “Our position is to extend aid as per NDRF and SDRF norms. We have received several demands and are also holding talks with crop insurance companies,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been biased about giving aid to Maharashtra. “After Cyclone Tauktae, the PM visited Gujarat but did not even bother about Maharashtra. He gave Rs. 1,000 crore to Gujarat but nothing to Maharashtra,” Mr. Patole said. Mr. Patole said that Maharashtra BJP leaders should meet Mr. Modi seeking help for the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-shouldnt-show-bias-in-giving-aid/article36768582.ece

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Hidden debt rising for partners of China’s BRI plan||A new study has found under-reported debts to the tune of $385 billion in projects carried out in dozens of countries under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with a rise in “hidden” debt on account of an increasing number of deals struck not directly between governments but structured through often opaque arrangements with a range of financing institutions. The study by AidData, a development research lab at the College of William & Mary in the U.S., found that “Chinese debt burdens are substantially larger than research institutions, credit rating agencies, or intergovernmental organisations with surveillance responsibilities previously understood” and “42 countries now have levels of public debt exposure to China in excess of 10% of GDP.” The total debt, the study added, was “systematically under-reported to the World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS) because, in many cases, central government institutions in LMICs [low and middle income countries] are not the primary borrowers responsible for repayment”. It estimated that the average government “is under-reporting its actual and potential repayment obligations to China by an amount that is equivalent to 5.8% of its GDP” and “collectively, these under-reported debts are worth approximately $385 billion.” The report studied 13,427 projects across 165 countries worth $843 billion, in the time period from 2000 to 2017, and examined how President Xi Jinping’s BRI plan, launched in 2013, has changed China’s overseas lending. The big difference between China and other prominent sources of overseas financing was that Chinese banks have used “debt rather than aid to establish a dominant position in the international development finance market”. Since the introduction of the BRI, China “maintained a 31- to-1 ratio of loans to grants and a 9-to-1 ratio of Other Official Flows (OOF) to Official Development Assistance (ODA)”, although Chinese agencies sometimes do not differentiate between loans and grants in public statements of financial assistance. The report found the average loan from China has a 4.2% interest rate, a grace period of less than two years, and a maturity length of less than 10 years. Biggest recipients From 2000 to 2017, Iraq ($8.5 billion), North Korea ($7.17 billion) and Ethiopia ($6.57) were the biggest recipients of ODA, while Russia ($151.8 billion), Venezuela ($ 81.96 billion) and Angola ($50.47 billion) were the biggest recipients of Chinese loans. India ranked 23rd in the list of top recipients of Chinese loans from 2000 to 2017, receiving $8.86 billion, according to the report. What has, however, led to many countries, such as Nepal and Sri Lanka in South Asia, turning to Chinese loans at higher interest rates is the lack of financing options elsewhere for infrastructure projects. This has seen a surge in lending from Chinese institutions over the past two decades. What has changed under the BRI, the study found, was that while earlier most overseas lending involved central government institutions, now nearly 70% of China’s overseas lending is now directed to state-owned companies, state-owned banks, special purpose vehicles, joint ventures, and private sector institutions. These debts “do not appear on government balance sheets in LMICs” although “most of them benefit from explicit or implicit forms of host government liability protection, which has blurred the distinction between private and public debt and introduced major public financial management challenges for LMICs.” The other change with the BRI is the rising number of “mega projects” (worth $500 million or more), which has prompted Chinese banks to work through lending syndicates and financing arrangements to share the risk. The share of projects thus co-financed accounts for 32%, and is another reason behind the debt being “hidden”. Scandals, corruption The report found that Chinese institutions use collateralisation to mitigate risk, for instance with loans collateralised against future commodity export receipts to minimise repayment risk, or later priced at higher interest rates, up to 6%. The report said 35% of the BRI infrastructure project portfolio has encountered major implementation problems, such as corruption scandals or labour violations, with Pakistan topping the list of countries with the most number of projects hit by scandals and corruption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hidden-debt-rising-for-partners-of-chinas-bri-plan/article36767911.ece
01 October 2021||Washington DC,||U.S. Congress scrambles to prevent govt. shutdown||With hours to go before the end of the U.S. fiscal year and funding authorisations, Congress is acting to avert a federal shut down, with both the Senate and House expected to pass short-term measures to keep the government open until December 3. The actions were in part possible because Democrats have dropped their insistence that the funding extension be tied to raising the public debt ceiling (how much the U.S. Treasury can borrow to fund its expenditures), a move Republicans were not willing to support. Congress has time until October 18 to raise the debt ceiling and prevent a possible economic crisis due to the resulting government default. Thursday’s actions to keep the government open come at a time of heightened polarisation on Capitol Hill, with Republican and Democratic lawmakers trying to work out a compromise within and across parties on infrastructure-related legislation. Senators will vote on Thursday not only to keep government funding at current levels but also new funding for the resettlement of Afghan refugees and for disaster relief for recent hurricanes. As The Hindu went to press, parties in the Senate were haggling over measures — including an amendment introduced by Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, seeking to end, after March 31 2023, food, housing and medical aid for some Afghans admitted to the U.S.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-congress-scrambles-to-prevent-govt-shutdown/article36767913.ece
01 October 2021||Washington,||U.S. Senate votes to avert government shutdown||The U.S. Senate approved a stopgap funding Bill Thursday in a rare show of cross-party unity to avert a crippling government shutdown, as Democratic leaders struggled to broker peace among their own warring members over President Joe Biden’s imperiled domestic agenda. The vote to keep the lights on for another two months passed comfortably with opposition Republicans supporting the Democrats, and is expected to be green-lit by the House of Representatives before the midnight deadline. “This is a good outcome, one I’m happy we are getting done,” Chuck Schumer, the top Democratic senator, told colleagues. “With so many things to take care of here in Washington, the last thing the American people need is for the government to grind to a halt.” The rare example of bipartisan cooperation comes with Democratic leaders trying to hammer out a deal over Mr. Biden’s faltering $3.5 trillion social spending package, which has no Republican support, and a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure Bill. Democratic progressives and moderates are deeply entrenched in a war of words over the programmes, as Republicans enjoy the disarray from the sidelines with one eye on next year's midterm elections. The Senate-passed bipartisan infrastructure Bill is due for a crucial vote in the House that appears to have no chance of passing, with the Democrats’ left wing in open revolt. The progressives don’t trust that centrists, who object to the size and scope of the larger social spending package, will honour an agreement to pass the legislation once infrastructure is across the line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-senate-votes-to-avert-government-shutdown/article36768316.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||From Afghanistan to AUKUS, a Biden doctrine takes shape||In early July, when the U.S. was fast-tracking the troop pullout from Afghanistan, President Joe Biden said, “America didn’t go to Afghanistan to nation-build”. He said the U.S. met its strategic objectives in Afghanistan — bringing Osama bin Laden to justice and disrupting al-Qaeda’s networks. On August 31, the last day of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Mr. Biden gave another statement, defending the pullout that led to a quick Taliban victory. According to Mr. Biden, the era of military operations to remake other countries is over. Pragmatic realism An establishment Democrat with decades of experience in foreign policy, Mr. Biden had been a supporter of the U.S.’s regime-change wars. As a Senator, he voted for the 2003 Iraq invasion. He was number 2 in the Obama administration that invaded Libya in 2011. But now, Mr. Biden is distancing his administration from the liberal internationalism of his predecessors and, in a way, following Donald Trump’s strategic reluctance. Mr. Trump was the first American President in decades who did not start a new war. It was Mr. Trump who imposed trade tariffs on China and reached a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban. While Mr. Trump reined in America’s interventionist tendencies and turned the foreign policy focus towards China, his approach was largely transactional. Except on climate change, Mr. Biden hasn’t revoked any of Mr. Trump’s key foreign policy decisions. Rather, he appears to be offering a strategic framework based on pragmatic realism to what Mr. Trump began — the geopolitical contest with China. In 2001, President George W. Bush launched the ‘global war on terror’. Mr. Obama continued it and Mr. Trump used it to target the Iranian power in West Asia. But Mr. Biden doesn’t believe that it’s the U.S.’s responsibility to defeat terrorism globally. He is re-interpreting the war on terror as a war focused on preventing attacks on the American homeland. This approach would allow the U.S. to retreat from other conflict theatres, and refocus its resources on tackling China’s rise. The AUKUS alliance The withdrawal from Afghanistan raised credibility questions on America’s power. There were criticisms that the U.S. abandoned its ally in Afghanistan — the Kabul government. But in Mr. Biden’s new realist world, supporting the Afghan government or fighting the Taliban endlessly doesn’t serve any national security purpose to America. But tackling China’s rise is vital to America’s interests because an increasingly powerful China could challenge the U.S.’s global pre-eminence. After completing the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration did not waste any time to announce its most ambitious new alliance — the AUKUS. Under the AUKUS deal, announced on September 15, Australia would get nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. and the U.K. Australia will also host American bombers on its territory and get access to advanced missile technology. Mr. Biden, by convening the first Quad summit of leaders from India, Australia and Japan, in March had signalled where his focus would be on. But Quad, which has been around for some time, hasn’t acquired any security dimension yet. AUKUS, on the other side, is Washington’s most emphatic effort to rebalance to the Indo-Pacific, a move that would harden the belief in Beijing that the U.S. was seeking to contain China. While Mr. Biden ruled out a new Cold War in his UNGA address on September 21, six days after the AUKUS announcement and three days before the first Quad in-person leaders’ summit, he left no ambiguity on what the focus of his foreign policy would be. It’s not war on terror; nor Russia, America’s traditional foe. It’s going to be China, and that the new great power contest would unfold in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/from-afghanistan-to-aukus-a-biden-doctrine-takes-shape/article36767915.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Tamil prisoners move Lanka’s top court||As many as eight Tamil prisoners in Sri Lanka’s Anuradhapura prison on Thursday petitioned the country’s Supreme Court, seeking relief after a ‘gun-wielding’ Prisons Minister allegedly threatened them a fortnight ago. The prisoners stated that they fear for their lives, asking to be transferred to a prison in the Tamil-majority Northern Province. Jaffna parliamentarian and senior lawyer M.A. Sumanthiran will appear for them in the case, media reports said. On September 15, Lohan Ratwatte, who was State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners’ Rehabilitation, stepped down from the portfolio amid enormous pressure, after allegations of his asking Tamil prisoners to kneel, threatening them at gunpoint, surfaced. Mr. Ratwatte is still a junior Minister in the Rajapaksa administration, overseeing the Gem and Jewellery portfolio, although government critics have demanded that he be sacked from all positions, citing the reported incident that sparked much public outrage. In their petition, the prisoners accused the Minister of asking the detainees to stand in a semi-circle and “ordered them to kneel before him”. “He then started to abuse them in Sinhala saying that His Excellency the President had given him all the power in relation to PTA prisoners and that he could either release them or shoot them dead. He had a pistol in his hand and appeared to be intoxicated,” the petition stated. The Minister’s office earlier denied any wrongdoing on his part. Repeal of PTA The eight Tamil men — who have sought relief from the Supreme Court through Colombo-based lawyer Moahan Balendra — are in the remand following their arrest under Sri Lanka’s infamous Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Rights activists and Tamil political leaders have for long demanded repeal of the PTA, pointing to different governments’ tendency to use the law to target dissidents or arbitrarily detain “terrorism suspects” for long periods without trial. Soon after the violent incident in the prison complex — allegedly involving the Prisons Minister — was reported in the media, the country’s Human Rights Commission started a suo motu investigation. International human rights watchdogs were swift to condemn the Minister’s actions. Human Rights Watch said the incident reflected “the disregard for human rights that prevails under the administration of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and in particular the vulnerable position of people held under the PTA.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tamil-prisoners-move-lankas-top-court/article36767921.ece
01 October 2021||Addis Ababa,||Ethiopia to expel seven UN staff for ‘meddling’||Ethiopia said on Thursday it would expel seven senior UN officials for “meddling” in its affairs, a move that came after aid workers sounded the alarm on humanitarian access to conflict-torn Tigray. The foreign ministry said it had “declared a ‘persona non grata’ for seven individuals who are working for various international NGOs in Ethiopia for meddling in the internal affairs of the country”. “According to the letters addressed to each of the 7 individuals listed below, all of them must leave the territory of Ethiopia within the next 72 hours,” it said on its Facebook page. The statement named seven officials working for various UN agencies. Ethiopia's northern-most region of Tigray has been mired in conflict since November. The United Nations has previously estimated that 4,00,000 people face famine-like conditions there, and fears are growing of deaths from starvation. The UN has said the region remains under a de-facto blockade and warned of a “looming catastrophe” as fighting between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has spread to neighbouring areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ethiopia-to-expel-seven-un-staff-for-meddling/article36767907.ece

A group of six women gathered outside a high school in eastern Kabul demanding the right for girls to return to secondary school. The women unfurled a banner that read “Don't break our pens, don't burn our books, don't close our schools”, before Taliban guards snatched it from them. They pushed back the women protesters, while a foreign journalist was hit with a rifle and blocked from filming.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Should universities avoid teaching controversial texts?||Kannur University has decided to retain lessons on the works of V.D. Savarkar and M.S. Golwalkar — ‘Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?’ by Savarkar and ‘A Bunch of Thoughts’ by Golwalkar — in the post-graduate course, Governance and Politics, after a controversy erupted over the texts in the syllabus. In a conversation moderated by Anuradha Raman , Kuldeep Kumar and Yogendra Yadav discuss the larger implications of regulating academic texts. Edited excerpts: Would it have been justified if Kannur University dropped the writings of Hindutva ideologues? Kuldeep Kumar:Ideas should be fought with ideas; ideas cannot be banned. Second, students at the postgraduate level are mature enough to understand and decide which idea to support and which idea to oppose. So, nothing should be excluded from the curriculum. If a curriculum is being structured for school students, who are of an impressionable age, educationists can decide on the manner of presenting the subject to the students. But at the postgraduate level, the original writings of these thinkers must be made available for discussions. We might like them or dislike them, but nobody can deny that these are important thinkers, especially in today’s India where the ideology they espoused is ruling the country — at the Centre and in some States. Students have to understand what this ideology is, what its implications are, and then decide for themselves. We have witnessed several instances where school and college curricula have succumbed to an ideology. Yogendra, you have faced this when you edited the NCERT textbooks. How important is it to counter ideas with ideas? Yogendra Yadav:To my mind, what happened there violates three fundamental principles. One, it violates the principle of academic autonomy. It is the university’s business to decide what it wishes to teach, not the business of the government of the day [In this case, there was pressure from political parties to drop these writings]. The second is critical pedagogy — students should be introduced to all kinds of ideas and be invited to critically examine them. I think we take a very poor opinion of students’ minds — and these are postgraduate students. But I would apply the same even to Class 12 students. Lastly, it violates the fundamental democratic principle of freedom of expression. In today’s context, it is also imprudent, because it gives ammunition to the current regime, which believes in stifling all sorts of ideas of freedom of expression. The regime can have ammunition to do something similar in some other university and say, ‘Look what the LDF did in Kannur’. You mentioned the earlier episode about the NCERT textbooks. Those were for Classes 9, 10, and 12. Professor Suhas Palshikar and I were the chief editors of those books. A vicious controversy erupted, sparked off by a cartoon that was seen as anti-Ambedkar. It went on to include all other cartoons, which were seen as anti-politician, anti-establishment. The Congress was in power then. Then too, similar principles were violated. There was no respect for the autonomy of NCERT as an institution, for the fact that there were several layers of scrutiny before these textbooks were written. Parliament took a sovereign view of it. The minister decided what he wanted thrown out and got a rather pliable committee to simply enforce his will. In the entire debate, there was little attention to critical pedagogy. Everyone believed that students are empty vessels. Everyone believed that by simply looking at those cartoons, their minds would be vitiated; no one was interested in examining what the textbook actually had to say about Ambedkar’s contribution, and the overall tenor of those books. There was no serious argument on freedom of expression. Kuldeep, you wrote in an article about the Indian tradition of debate and bemoaned the loss of this tradition. KK:I will just add one or two sentences to what Yogendra just said. This cartoon appeared when both Nehru and Ambedkar were alive. Neither of them had any problems with the cartoon. There is a famous quote of Nehru’s where he tells Shankar, the cartoonist, not to spare him. This is the kind of democratic spirit with which India began its journey as an independent nation. Almost all our political parties have laid the ground for the kind of impunity with which Hindutva stifles dissent. Second, this tradition of intellectual debate, popularly known as Shastrarth , was not confined to the hoary past. Intense debates took place between the proponents and opponents of widow remarriage. Even in the 20th century, when the marriageable age of young girls was raised and debated, there were discussions between the orthodox sections of society and the reformists. In the much-maligned courts of Moguls, regular philosophical discussions took place among scholars of various religions. My point is, why should one shy away from debate? But for the past several decades, we have been witnessing a tradition of complaints being filed on the pretext of religious sentiments. It is regrettable that in independent India, we are facing this kind of a situation which is blatantly anti-democratic in spirit. Virtually every government in independent India seems to have taken offence to something or the other. Is it time to look at freedom of expression in the Indian context now? YY:It’s not just the Left Front regime in Kerala or the BJP at the Centre today. The record of Congress regimes on all these principles has been somewhat mixed. The record of the Left Front governments, especially in West Bengal, has been rather embarrassing. So, when we say today that the BJP is doing this, the party can always turn around and say, ‘well, you started it’. I think the real problem is that in our public culture, we don’t have any space for any of the three principles I stated. I suspect no one believes in the principle of academic autonomy. We don’t have procedural ethics at all; we believe in substantive ethics: this needed to be done, it has been done, forget the procedure. Curriculum has always been seen as a political battleground. The idea is to stuff children’s heads with material that can be partisan in the foolish belief that once you paste something onto a textbook, it automatically enters the minds, hearts and souls of the students. And on the freedom of expression, I really suspect that we as a country don’t value it. Political liberalism does not exist. So, when you speak about freedom of expression and say, ‘well I dislike this film, but there is no reason for it to be banned or censored’, you appear to be generous to a fault and needing some correction. Sadly, unlike in western democracies, I think we are weaker and poorer. We have been unable to develop this fundamental tenet of democracy. The tradition of Shastrarth was made famous by Amartya Sen in his The Argumentative Indian . However, in the last more than 100 years, we have been unable to cultivate this as a value. Our Constitution mentions it. But it does not enjoy great popular support. And this is only one more instance of a deeper rupture that we see between constitutional values on the one hand and popular values on the other. We’re looking at something that goes beyond regimes, beyond one university, beyond one vice chancellor, and beyond one episode. Are we looking at a structural malaise now? KK:Yes. On the issue of the Ambedkar cartoon, almost all the political parties ganged up in Parliament. We as a society tend to idolise people. We put them on such a high pedestal that they become demigods. Nobody these days can freely criticise Ambedkar for fear of being dubbed anti-Dalit. Ambedkarites do not tolerate any criticism of Ambedkar. This is bhakti. Ambedkar himself wrote that bhakti is okay in religion, but in politics it leads to dictatorship. This tendency militates against democracy. When you do not counter ideas with ideas and you effectively ban writings, whose loss is it? In many ways, it also helps those whose ideologies you need to engage with to make sense of the present. If you withhold discussions on such contentious issues, the consequences are far-reaching. YY:Clearly, it is society’s loss. And this goes back to the classic argument for freedom of expression given by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty . His argument was that bad arguments should be allowed to flourish; false things should be allowed to be said. Because it’s only by countering falsehood that you establish the truth. By pushing falsehood under the carpet, you only encourage the suspicion that the falsehood was something valuable which has suddenly been taken away. And I suspect that this actually happened during the dominance of secular academia in our country. Although this is not germane to the debate today, I do think that in our anxiety and over-enthusiasm, we played with certain aspects of our history in the belief that if our students get to know it, they might become communal. This tendency to brush under the carpet aspects of our history which were unpleasant actually helped the BJP in the long run. Because it could always say, ‘see, you were never told about it’. The BJP will blow it up as if this was the only thing in history. So, in the long run, society, democracy and good ideas suffer because bad ideas are not being allowed to be stated. To what extent do you think bans help those with contentious ideologies to hold on to them when those ideologies are not introduced in public spheres? KK:Whether it is a university curriculum or the free market where books can be bought, I don’t think banning any book is going to help anybody. Look at the whole debate on the National Register of Citizens. Or the new public distribution rules being changed by the Uttar Pradesh government. If you do not read Golwalkar’s book or Balraj Madhok’s book on so-called Indianisation, you will not understand that these decisions directly flow from the writings and ideas of these thinkers. YY:To my mind, the story is not just saffronisation. I think what the BJP has done and what Kannur University has done should not make us forget the larger context. Because what is happening today is that in universities, colleges and schools, the tinkering with syllabi curricula is not only partisan. One, there is absolute degradation of academic exercise. You have people who have no business to sit in committees sitting in them. Two, what is being dished out in many of these textbooks now is just factually wrong. This is a fanciful history. And three, this is against constitutional values. Now, that’s more serious than the partisan games that parties play when they are in power. No regime should be allowed to do things which go against constitutional values, and this is what is being perpetuated right now. And sadly, this episode of Kannur University will only go on to provide ammunition to the BJP and to those who are acting on behalf of the party in the educational sector to perpetuate crimes which are much worse than what has been done by Kannur University.  We might like or dislike certain thinkers, but nobody can deny that they are important, especially in today’s India where the ideology they espoused is ruling the country.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||At the Quad, forming habits of cooperation||The first in-person summit of the Quad powers — Australia, Japan, India and the United States — has clearly advanced the work begun by the virtual summit in March. The September 24 meeting, hosted by U.S. President Joseph Biden, drew global attention both for its symbolism and substance. The photograph showing the four leaders sitting behind separate desks imaginatively placed in a circular format in the elegant East Room of the White House, conveyed a signal of mutual warmth, purpose and resolve. It is necessary to critically analyse the summit’s outcome in order to appreciate the development and formalisation of a new plurilateral and its direction in the coming years. Self-perceptions The opening remarks by the Quad leaders were remarkably succinct. Mr. Biden portrayed the Quad as a group of democratic partners “who share a worldview and have a common vision for the future”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was confident that the Quad would “play the role of a force for global good”. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison blended a preview of upcoming agreements with a dose of sharp Aussie candour by laying stress on the point that the grouping wanted the Indo-Pacific region to “be always free from coercion”. It was a thinly-veiled criticism of China’s policy. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was the only participant who addressed the U.S. President as “Joe”. He projected the Quad as “an extremely significant initiative”, designed to promote “a free and open international order based on the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific”. Another dig at Beijing. Practical cooperation The joint statement issued following the summit, began with the compromise formulation crafted last March, to emphasise the leaders’ commitment to “a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is also inclusive and resilient”. Promoting security and prosperity in this region is the raison d’être of the Quad, a goal to be achieved through practical cooperation among the four powers. The Washington summit added new areas of collaboration: infrastructure; cybersecurity and space; education and people-to-people relations. On the first, the plan is to promote “sustainable infrastructure”, with a stress on aligning the Quad with the G7’s Build Back Better World (B3W) Partnership, based on the G20’s quality infrastructure investment principles. Here, the Quad can focus on four key B3W elements: digital connectivity, climate, health security and gender equality infrastructure. There was no mention of any specific projects or countries where they are envisaged. However, the formation of an infrastructure coordination group composed of senior officials was announced. It will map and coordinate infrastructure needs and catalyse private-sector investment. On cybersecurity, the Quad will cooperate on combating cyber threats and securing critical infrastructure. On the space front, the plan is to identify new collaboration opportunities, especially sharing of data to monitor climate change, disaster response and preparedness, and sustainable uses of ocean and marine resources. A senior cyber group and a new working group on space will be established. On education, the Quad fellowship programme will award 100 graduates — 25 scholars from each Quad country — opportunities in leading STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programmes in the U.S. This is not a government programme but a philanthropic initiative. The three working groups on vaccines, climate and emerging technologies established last March, have reported progress. On vaccines, the Quad stands committed to donate over 1.2 billion doses globally, although only 79 million doses have been delivered so far. The production of vaccines in India — with the target of “at least 1 billion doses” of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 — is on track. Vaccines are slated for free distribution in the Indo-Pacific region, beginning next February. Ample funding has been assured by Japan and Australia. Besides, new measures are contemplated to conduct research and step-up preparedness to handle future pandemics. The Quad working group on climate change has focused on three thematic areas: climate ambition, clean-energy innovation, and climate adaptation and resilience. The Quad leaders emphasised enhanced action for achieving global net-zero emissions preferably by 2050, with an important caveat — “taking into account national circumstances” — added at India’s instance. A Quad shipping task force has now been launched to build a green-shipping network and green port infrastructure. As regards critical and emerging technologies, a slew of steps is under consideration relating to 5G and beyond 5G networks; supply chains of critical minerals including semiconductors; and emerging advances in biotechnology. To be successful, building the supply chains will need expert resources and coordination from each country. A contact group on Advanced Communications and Artificial Intelligence will focus on standards-development and foundational research. Political facets Cooperation among the Quad members in the six areas mentioned will help the grouping to address the economic and technological challenges posed by China. But what of the pressing strategic, defence and maritime security aspects of the challenge? Those will stay outside the formal framework of the Quad for now. Maritime security will continue to be strengthened through bilateral 2+2 Ministerial tracks; the four-powers Malabar Exercise; and other bilateral or trilateral arrangements such as AUKUS (the new trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S.). Defence cooperation will not be lowered in priority; it will just be handled differently. The Quad wants a positive orientation, rather than be seen as an ‘Asian NATO’. Regionally, the Quad sees the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as “the heart of the Indo-Pacific region”. Together with the small island States in the South Pacific, ASEAN countries will stand to benefit from growing cooperation within the Quad. So will the European Union (EU), whose new EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific was welcomed by the four leaders. On Afghanistan, the decision to “closely coordinate” policies and next steps will be watched as the U.S. comes under strong pressure to show flexibility towards the interim Taliban government. The institutionalisation of the Quad has begun to gather speed. For India, this grouping is critical. It is the first major plurilateral organisation in years where India is on the ground floor, an equal partner of the new P4. It has much to contribute and leverage, beyond its market. This is an opportunity for India to work with the advanced economies to “build habits of cooperation”, while confronting the 21st century challenges in its Indo-Pacific neighbourhood Rajiv Bhatia is Distinguished Fellow, Gateway House.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A State, a ‘clean sweep’ and the art of sanitation||It was on October 2, 2014 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, newly elected, launched a nationwide cleanliness campaign on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary. Coupled with tackling open defecation through behavioural change, the now famous Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or Clean India Mission, aimed to provide every family with sanitation facilities, including toilets, solid and liquid waste disposal systems. For social reformation His call to achieve the goal by October 2, 2019 and make this an appropriate tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, on his 150th birth anniversary was well-received by all Indian citizens and the international community, too. Indeed, this was a historic moment in the development story of India, as this campaign was to become the largest cleanliness drive by any country. This path-breaking idea initiated by the Prime Minister was beyond partisanship and politics. It lit up the spirit of a patriot and became known as a masterstroke to unify a nation that had suffered much at the hands of some divisive forces. This visionary and courageous idea for social reformation inspired me to rally the people of Madhya Pradesh and make open defecation, truly, a thing of the past. Before launching the programme in the State, it was important for me to understand the ground realities. We initiated a comprehensive exercise to identify the sanitation issues people faced through a series of interactions with all identified stakeholders. This was an opportunity for us to initiate social change that the world had never seen before, all the while contributing to the story of an Atmanirbhar India. Driven by the individual Through a succession of such stakeholder interactions, we gathered insights that would go on to inform our strategy to make Madhya Pradesh 100% Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2019. We understood that while people,as individuals, abhor unclean environments and attempt to keep their homes clean, nobody takes the responsibility when it comes to the collective whole. Instead, people believe it is the responsibility of the government to keep their surroundings clean. What the Prime Minister’s idea did was to make Swachhta an individual’s responsibility, both at a personal and public level. We wanted to ride this wave of a renewed public understanding towards cleanliness and ensure that janbhagidari (people’s participation) was the driving force behind the success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in Madhya Pradesh. As the Chief Minister of the State, it would have been much easier for me to issue a directive to only construct toilets, guarantee the provision of piped water supply, and levy fines to offenders to ensure that the goal was achieved. But a lesson I have learnt is not to go in for short-term solutions, but, instead, to address all issues with a long-term view in sight. Hence, I decided upon a multi-pronged strategy involving the construction of toilets, implementing tough regulatory steps such as levying fines for open defecation, and encouraging behavioural change through innovation — both communication-based and engineering solutions. This approach guaranteed the sustenance of changed behaviours and the longevity of the impact of our efforts. The power of simple solutions We capitalised on the age-old understanding that good leadership encourages a sustained change of behaviour. Consequently, we ensured that right — from a Collector to a local level leader at the gram panchayat level — took the message of cleanliness to the people within their precincts. This catapulted the pace of the movement. The more the leaders engaged with the people, the better they were able to open fresh lines of communication and build deeper bonds of trust. What followed was a remarkable change in the attitudes of the people as they began to own the movement at the grassroots and began to evangelise their peers and community members with the message of Swachhta. We encouraged and recognised simple yet path-breaking engineering innovations at the local level. I remember one of our Collectors from Sehore district devised an innovation called ‘Tippy-Tap.’ This is a simple foot-operated device, which uses a can with a hole to dispense water for handwashing. We implemented this ‘tippy-tap’ solution across all anganwadis and schools in Sehore district, and this easy-to-operate solution was welcomed by all. Another simple solution was the installation of a small hook in the toilet to enable seniors and those with disabilities to rise with ease from a squatting position. Following the success of these simple solutions, my belief that simple solutions can bring about lasting change has been strengthened. The record so far As a result of this comprehensive and scientific approach, Urban Madhya Pradesh received its ODF certification on October 2, 2017 — much ahead of time; rural Madhya Pradesh received its ODF certification the following year on October 2, 2018. As of today, it is, therefore, no surprise that Madhya Pradesh ranks third in the country in the cleanliness survey, 2020. Not only this, several of our cities have been consistently spearheading the list of clean and green cities in India. Take Indore, for instance, which has been ranked the cleanest city in the country in Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey) since 2017. Leading from the front lines, Indore has become India’s first ‘Water Plus’ city in Swachh Survekshan 2021. It achieved this feat by treating its wastewater to a satisfactory level, before releasing it into rivers, thus maintaining cleanliness in rivers and drains under its administration. The capital city of Bhopal, which has been known as the ‘city of lakes’, has also shown the way for other State capitals by bagging the title of the cleanest and the greenest capital of the country in the cleanliness survey of 2020. The result is clear: the steps taken by the State government towards realising the Prime Minister’s call to enable cleanliness have become lifesavers during the novel coronavirus pandemic by ensuring reduced interaction during the lockdown, and preventing the transfer of infection. The formula My approach to providing holistic sanitation facilities to the people of Madhya Pradesh emanates from my understanding of travelling and interacting with numerous people and observing and learning from their struggles. Without our “all-hands-on-the-deck” approach and the ‘provision of an integrated sanitation approach that includes water supply, water connections, and waste management’, our efforts to construct toilets and implement regulatory measures alone would have not brought about a tangible behavioural change at the grassroots. The status of ODF Plus received by 355 urban bodies of the State, and the status of ODF double plus received by 71 urban bodies in the past year alone are a reverberating testament to the effectiveness of our strategy. I experience unbridled joy when I see that the collective efforts of the citizens of Madhya Pradesh and the State machinery have brought about an irreversible positive transformation in sanitation, right down to the grassroots, giving credence to Gandhiji’s words — that “sanitation is more important than Independence”.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Making parties constitutional||A political party is an organised group of citizens who hold common views on governance and act as a political unit that seeks to obtain control of government with a view to further the agenda and policy they profess. They are indispensable links between the people and the representative machinery of government. Political parties maintain a continuous connection between the people and those who represent them either in government or in the opposition. Political parties have extralegal growth in almost every democratic country. The American Constitution does not presume the existence of political parties. In Britain too, political parties are still unknown to the law. Nonetheless, Sir Ivor Jennings, in The British Constitution, opined that “a realistic survey of the British Constitution today must begin and end with parties and discuss them at length in the middle”. Similarly, political parties in India are extra-constitutional, but they are the breathing air of the political system. The German model The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949) gives constitutional status to political parties. Article 21 of the Basic Law deals with their status, rights, duties and functions. It provides: “(1) Political parties shall participate in the formation of the political will of the people. They may be freely established. Their internal organisation must conform to democratic principles. They must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds. (2) Parties that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their adherents, seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be unconstitutional... (4) The Federal Constitutional Court shall rule on the question of unconstitutionality... (5) Details shall be regulated by federal laws.” The German model of constitutionalising political parties is more desirable for India than the U.S. and the U.K. models. Section 29A(5) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 is the only major statutory provision dealing with political parties in India. It orders that a political party shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy, and would uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India. Political parties in developed nations maintain high levels of internal democracy. In the U.K., the Conservative Party has the National Conservative Convention as its top body. It has a Central Council and an Executive Committee. The Central Council elects its President, a Chairman and Vice Chairmen at its annual meeting. It also elects an Executive Committee which meets once a month. In the U.S., both the Democratic and the Republican Party have the National Committee as their top decision-making body. The National Committee plays an important role in the presidential election and agenda setting. The Indian Constitution is the one of the longest Constitutions in the world. It even elaborately deals with the co-operative societies. The right to form co-operative societies is a fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(c), but the right to form political parties is not. It is astonishing that such a meticulous Constitution overlooked political parties, the vital players in the political system, for constitutional regulation. Most of the parties are openly caste- or religious-based. Their finances are dubious and opaque. Almost all the parties — the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Samajwadi Party, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, the Indian Union Muslim League, etc. — are family fiefdoms. The Congress high command is only a euphemism for the Gandhi family. There are no periodical in-party elections in Indian parties except in a few like the CPI(M). Political parties are the agents of democracy and safety valves in the political system. They desperately need reform. Hence, it is high time to constitutionalise political parties to ensure in-party democracy, to impart transparency in their finances, and to de-communalise them.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Gathering storm||The Congress party is gripped by a crisis after its Punjab strategy to unseat Captain Amarinder Singh as Chief Minister went haywire. The reformist group within the party has questioned the authority of the family triumvirate comprising Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in a manner it had avoided until now. While the Gandhis were resolute about ejecting Captain Amarinder, they were clueless about what would come afterwards. As it happened, Charanjit Singh Channi emerged as Chief Minister out of a factional scramble, and the party sought to find virtue in his accidental elevation by highlighting his Dalit identity. The Dalits in Punjab are largely with the Congress. Whether the party will accrue additional votes owing to Mr. Channi’s identity remains an open question. Meanwhile, resentment is streaming forth. Navjot Singh Sidhu, who never deserved to be the president of a Congress state unit to begin with, resigned in a huff, embarrassing the Gandhi siblings. Captain Amarinder, now bruised and humiliated, is vengeful and appears willing to do anything to derail the Congress’s prospects in next year’s Assembly election. He could join hands with the BJP or explore other options. Many social fault lines in Punjab may have resurfaced now. Mr. Sidhu has been playing the Sikh communal card, which could have dangerous ramifications. Mr. Gandhi’s impatience with the party old guard is understandable and even justified to a great extent. What he lacks is a coherent strategy and transparent plan to revamp the party. He owned up to the party’s debacle in the 2019 general election and resigned as party president, but continued to retain ultimate authority. He appoints and removes office bearers and Chief Ministers, while posturing that he is above the fray. This is untenable as his authority without accountability is far too evident. If he wants to be the leader of the Congress, it cannot be in the informal and whimsical manner as it is now. It needs to be formal and consultative, for which he needs to return as the party president. Reviving the Congress will require the leadership’s constant engagement with workers, and the management of the egos and ambitions of individual leaders. The Congress cannot be revived by stealth and subterfuge, or by recruiting boastful charlatans. The burden of revitalising it cannot be shifted to the shoulders of random, untested new recruits, as Punjab shows. Mr. Gandhi is taken in by the self-defeatist notion that the Congress as it exists cannot be revved up until there is a purge and parallel induction of outside talent. No knight in shining armour can help the Congress unless it nurtures its roots and respects its workers. The disastrous Punjab experiment underscores that elementary fact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/gathering-storm/article36767890.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Failing on food||The approval of the PM POSHAN scheme by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs until 2025-26 comes at a critical time when real income declines and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the ability of families to ensure good nutrition. The findings in Phase I of the NFHS-5 for 22 States and Union Territories in December 2020 were shocking: childhood stunting rose in 13 States, there was high prevalence of anaemia among children and women, and wasting was a serious concern in 12 States. The slippage over the previous survey period exposes the worsening scourge of malnutrition, threatening to deprive millions of children of a fully productive adult life. It will take a serious effort to address this hidden crisis, backed by strong budgetary commitment. The centrally supported hot meal programme in Government and Government-aided schools, covering 11.8 crore children, will be supplemented with nutritional elements in identified aspirational districts and areas with high anaemia. The scheme, which is proposed to be extended to pre-primary children, provides for social audit, creation of school nutritional gardens to source fresh produce, involvement of farmer-producer organisations as providers, and lays emphasis on local food traditions. While these are positive features, momentum towards eradicating malnutrition hinges crucially on annual budgetary outlays and proof of POSHAN’s working will lie in measurable outcomes. Support for the PM POSHAN, which the Government says has been approved over the five-year period at Rs. 1,30,794 crore, including Rs. 31,733 crore from States and UTs, must remain elastic. While some child growth metrics such as stunting require a longer window to measure, problems such as anaemia and low weight lend themselves to speedy amelioration. The Government must demonstrate that Saksham Anganwadi-Mission POSHAN 2.0, which amalgamates the POSHAN Abhiyan and schemes covering anganwadis, crèches and adolescent girls, is fiscally stronger than its erstwhile component parts. There must be a meaningful increase in the current Budget estimate over the combined past outlay for the subsumed individual schemes. On nutritional planning, the renewed plan should introduce a greater diversity of diets that compensates for micronutrient and protein deficiency. Strong supplementation of nutrition at school, in the community, and at childcare centres is critical at a time when criticism of food inflation has met with a tone-deaf response, and pandemic-induced income declines have depressed essential consumption. The lower offtake of foodgrains for the noon meal scheme during the pandemic over the previous year and patchy food distribution mechanisms in many States should set alarm bells ringing. The future of a generation of Indians is at stake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/failing-on-food/article36767891.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Forfeiture of Mao book set aside||Ahmedabad, Sept. 30: An order of the Gujarat Government forfeiting a Gujarati book captioned “Quotations from Mao Tse Tung” on the ground that some of the passages in the book constituted seditious matter, was set aside on Tuesday by a special Bench of the Gujarat High Court consisting of the Chief Justice, Mr. P.N. Bhagwati, Mr. Justice B.J. Diwan and Mr. Justice D.A. Desai. The court held that the passages in question did not constitute seditious matter and as the publishers of the book had made it clear, the thoughts of Mao Tse Tung as expressed in these passages were presented to the public with a view to enable them to study the principles and practice of Communism. “To condemn them as seditious would be to close the doors of knowledge, to ostracise a philosophy, because it challenged the most cherished values of society and held up for acceptance a new way of life vastly different from that to which our people were presently accustomed. It is not for the Government of the day nor for the Judges presiding over the courts to decide what doctrine or philosophy is good for our people. It is for the people to choose what is best for them and to help them to make a wise and intelligent choice, free propagation of ideas is an essential requisite,” the court observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/forfeiture-of-mao-book-set-aside/article36767900.ece
01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Core sector grew 11.6% in August||India’s core sector output accelerated for a second straight month in August, rising 11.6%, buoyed in part by the year-earlier month’s 6.9% contraction. Four of the eight sectors registered strong double-digit growth, even as output of fertilizers and crude oil declined. The output was also 3.9% higher than the pre-COVID August 2019 level, quicker than July’s 1.6% increase from the comparable pre-pandemic month of 2019. Cement production jumped 36% as compared with a 14.5% contraction in August 2020, while coal and natural gas registered a similar 20.6% surge. Electricity and refinery products expanded by 15.3% and 9.1%, respectively, and steel output grew 5.1%, data from the Office of Economic Adviser, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade showed. All sub-sectors except refinery products and crude oil saw output above pre-COVID levels, noted ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar. “The lull in rains supported the growth in coal, cement and electricity, while higher mobility propped up... petroleum” products, she said. Core sector output had expanded 9.9% in July and 9.3% in June. ‘Govt. spending helps’ CARE chief economist Madan Sabnavis noted that the uptick in steel and cement could be attributed to higher government spending and construction activity. Higher power production was reflective of general buoyant activity in the economy and would have driven up output in mining as well, he said. “On the whole, core sector growth is encouraging as it points to further acceleration during the course of the year as the government gets down to spending more,” Mr. Sabnavis said. Ms. Nayar cautioned that gains in mining, construction and electricity were likely to be washed out by the September rains, even as the statistical effect of the negative base from last year’s lockdown normalised. “Electricity demand has plunged below 1% in the ongoing month, as agricultural and domestic demand subsided with the heavy rainfall. Overall, we expect the core sector growth to moderate to 4-6% in September,” Ms. Nayar observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/core-sector-grew-116-in-august/article36767881.ece

Our merino wool could be used by Indian textiles makers to produce the best product,” he said. Jammu and Kashmir’s Pashmina could similarly be an attractive proposition for Australians, said Mr. Goyal. “We have set out some ambitious targets and timelines to meet and negotiating teams will begin work immediately to reach an important outcome towards expanding the Australia-India trading relationship,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-australia-to-conclude-free-trade-pact-by-end-2022-tehan/article36767883.ece

The balance of payments had registered a $8.1 billion deficit (1% of GDP) in the quarter ended March, Reserve Bank of India data released on Thursday show.  Services exports lift The surplus in the current account in Q1FY22 was primarily on account of a contraction in the trade deficit to $30.7 billion, from $41.7 billion in the preceding quarter, and an increase in net services receipts, the Reserve Bank said. Net services receipts increased, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, on the back of robust performance of net exports of computer and business services. Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians overseas, grew 14.8% from a year earlier to $20.9 billion. Net foreign direct investment recorded inflow of $11.9 billion, against an outflow of $0.5 billion in the year-earlier period. Net foreign portfolio investment was $0.4 billion ($0.6 billion), data showed. Net external commercial borrowings to India recorded inflow of $0.5 billion (outflow of $0.6 billion).

Smriti, who peppered the off-side repeatedly with some gorgeous shots to reach 80 off 144 balls with 15 fours and a six, put on 93 for the first wicket with Shafali Verma (31, 64b). Most of the second session was washed out. When play resumed, Smriti surpassed her previous best of 78. She pulled Tahlia McGrath for a six over deep square-leg and also carted her over mid-wicket for a four. Play halted Giving her company is Punam Raut (16, 57b), the two having added 39 for the unbroken second wicket before rain halted the day’s proceedings in the 45th over. Australia’s decision to put India in on a green strip backfired as Smriti went on the attack. An astounding 16 fours were hit in the first 16 overs, mostly by Smriti, as Meg Lanning shuffled her bowlers around without much success. Debutant Darcie Brown got some special treatment as Smriti hit her for several fours on the off-side as well as a few whipped on the leg-side. Ellyse Perry also took a few overs to find the right length. Smriti reached her run-a-ball fifty with a cover drive off Tahlia McGrath. Not once did the elegant left-hander look like she had muscled any of her strokes, instead they appeared to have been caressed with immaculate timing. Shafali, meanwhile, hit four fours but also looked a bit scratchy and offered a couple of chances. Finally she was gone trying to hit left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux against the turn and offered a sitter to McGrath at mid-off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/smriti-shines-on-rain-hit-opening-day/article36768315.ece
01 October 2021||PARIS,||Ronaldo’s extra-time effort does it for United||Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed a precious last-gasp winner for Manchester United against Villarreal, holder Chelsea was beaten by Juventus, and Barcelona plunged further into crisis with a thumping defeat at Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday. Ronaldo popped up in the last of five minutes of stoppage time to score and give United a 2-1 win at Old Trafford. Jesse Lingard cutely set up Ronaldo to score his record-extending 136th goal in the competition as United bounced back from its defeat to Young Boys in Bern last time out. Superb volley Alex Telles had earlier hauled the host back level with a superb first-time volley from a Bruno Fernandes delivery for his first goal for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Paco Alcacer had given Villarreal the lead in what was a rematch of last season’s Europa League final, won by the Spanish outfit on penalties. Chelsea will still be expected to qualify for the last 16 despite losing 1-0 to Juventus in Turin with Federico Chiesa scoring the only goal of the game 10 seconds into the second half. The star of Italy’s Euro 2020-winning side latched onto Federico Bernardeschi’s assist to beat Edouard Mendy and give Massimiliano Allegri’s team a second straight win in Group H. Ronald Koeman’s Barcelona side already looks at a real risk of an early exit after suffering a second 3-0 defeat in as many games in Group E and finishing the match in Lisbon with 10 men. Uruguayan forward Darwin Nunez starred for Benfica, opening the scoring early on, and completed the rout from the spot, while in between Rafa Silva netted for the Portuguese former European Cup winner. Eric Garcia was sent off for Barcelona, who have now conceded 11 goals in their last two visits to the Estadio da Luz, the scene of the 8-2 annihilation at the hands of Bayern Munich in the 2020 quarterfinals. Bayern followed its victory at the Camp Nou a fortnight ago with a 5-0 home win over Dynamo Kiev, with Robert Lewandowski’s first-half brace setting the Bavarians on their way. All-time third The Pole, who netted the opener from the penalty spot, now has a career tally of 77 Champions League goals, third in the all-time list behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Serge Gnabry, Leroy Sane and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting added further goals after the break for a rampant Bayern.  The results:   Group E: Benfica 3 (Nunez 3, 79-pen, Rafa Silva 69) bt Barcelona 0; Bayern Munich 5 (Lewandowski 12-pen, 27, Gnabry 68, Sane 74, Choupo-Moting 87) bt Dynamo Kyiv 0.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Super Kings become the first team to qualify for playoffs||Josh Hazlewood’s bowling of subtle movement and alterations in speed, length and angles is like a revolving door. You never know what’s in store. Hazlewood, his run-up, load-up and release, in perfect harmony, proved a game-changer with three for 24 as Chennai Super Kings, restricting Sunrisers Hyderabad to 134 for seven, won by six wickets to ensure qualification in their IPL clash at Sharjah on Thursday. Dhoni seals it with a six With two runs required off three balls, CSK skipper M.S. Dhoni wristed paceman Siddharth Kaul over mid-wicket for a rousing six to deliver the winning blow. Earlier, Ruturaj Gaikwad, all footwork, balance and timing, smacked Bhuvneshwar Kumar over mid-wicket for a six. It was excellent batting on a sluggish pitch where a few deliveries kept low. Bhuvneshwar is not at his best in the IPL and Faf du Plessis smashed him over wide long-on. The CSK openers were up and running. du Plessis moves around the crease, goes back to use the depth of the crease and also jumps down the track. Ruturaj (45 off 38) fell to seamer Jason Holder, attempting to clear the in-field. Moeen Ali promised much, but played on to leg-spinner Rashid Khan. Holder made inroads even as the winning line was in sight for CSK. Suresh Raina fell to a yorker. And du Plessis (41 off 36) miscued a pull. Rayudu shines But then, when the intrepid Ambati Rayudu drove Kaul to cover fence and then clubbed Bhuvneshwar over mid-wicket for the maximum, it opened the winning door for CSK. And Dhoni shut it on Sunrisers. In the first half, Hazlewood delivered telling blows with his stump to stump bowling. He dismissed influential opener Jason Roy, after CSK elected to field, with a delivery that moved away, extracted a false shot from Abhishek Sharma with a straighter delivery and had Abdul Samad slicing a widish yorker to point. Dwayne Bravo took out Williamson, who played across one that nipped back. Saha (44), he had pulled and off-driven Deepak Chahar for sixes, was another batsman who succumbed to the playing-across-the-line malice. CSK then closed in like a hungry pack.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hazlewood-bravo-call-the-shots-as-csk-has-srh-in-a-bind/article36768306.ece

In 33-overs-a-side contest — the final commenced at 12 noon — Jolly Rovers, inserted, put up a rather formidable score of 254 for four with openers southpaw Sai Sudharsan (73, 7x4, 3x6) in red-hot form, and skipper Kaushik Gandhi (55, 49b, 4x4, 2x6) putting on 132 runs in 104 deliveries to build a solid base. Then, Ankeet Bawane smashed a 45-ball 67 (6x4, 2x6) to power Rovers to a total from where it could apply pressure. Vijay came up short, ending up at 209 for eight.

01 October 2021||Male,||Sunil Chhetri goes down memory lane||Indian football talisman Sunil Chhetri says he shared the best rapport with former captain Bhaichung Bhutia and striker Jeje Lalpekhlua on the field, thanks to their playing “combination” and “understanding”. The 37-year-old Chhetri is set to appear in his fifth SAFF Championship and before its kick off, he took a walk down the memory lane and picked his favourites from the tournament during a chat with the AIFF. Asked with whom he has shared the best relationship on and off the field, Chhetri said, “As I have played with so many players, it has kept changing. But I am quite fortunate with whom I have enjoyed my relationship on and off the field. If I stick purely to the pitch, I will pick Bhaichung da (Bhutia) and Jeje (Lalpekhlua), and it has more to do with my combination and understanding with them. “But if it’s a mix, and the proximity which we share then it has to be Eugeneson Lyngdoh. Despite him playing for a very short time, I am extremely fond of him, and we are very close. But then I am close to everyone.” When asked which has been his favourite SAFF Championship so far, he picked the 2015 edition. “I will pick the one which we won in Kerala in the 2015-16 edition. The rivalry that we had with Afghanistan in the final, and the build-up to it was simply majestic. “Jeje’s goal in the final against Afghanistan in 2015-16 in Thiruvananthapuram will always be my favourite. It was an extremely tough match, and we were 0-1 down despite having some good chances. The goal was extremely significant, and the manner the superstar flicked it in was sublime. “Most importantly, it came at the right moment. If we hadn’t scored then, maybe we would have panicked and the result could have been different. We eventually went on to win 2-1.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sunil-chhetri-goes-down-memory-lane/article36768363.ece
01 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rupinder and Birendra Lakra announce retirement||Drag-flicker Rupinder Pal Singh and defender Birendra Lakra, who played crucial roles in the Indian hockey team’s historic bronze-winning campaign at the Tokyo Olympics, announced international retirements on Thursday. While Rupinder quit “to make way for youngsters” and announced his decision by posting a statement on his twitter page, Lakra’s retirement was confirmed by Hockey India (HI). It has been learnt from reliable sources that both decided to quit after they were informed they would not find a place in India’s scheme of things going forward and would be ignored for the national camp starting in Bengaluru next week. The 30-year-old Rupinder, regarded as one of the best drag-flickers of the country, represented India in 223 matches. Rupinder scored four crucial goals, including a penalty stroke in the third-place match against Germany, in the Tokyo Olympics. “The past couple of months have been the best days of my life. Standing on the podium in Tokyo along with my teammates is a feeling I will cherish forever,” Rupinder said. “I believe it' is time for me to make way for young players.”  Lakra is yet to make a statement. “A solid defender and one of the most influential Indian men’s hockey team figures, the Odisha star has announced his retirement from the Indian national team. Happy Retirement, Birendra Lakra,” HI tweeted. The 31-year-old Lakra was one of the vice-captains in Tokyo. He was also part of the 2014 gold-winning Incheon Asian Games team and the side that claimed bronze in 2018 Jakarta. Reliable Lakra played 201 matches for India. A reliable centre-back known for his calm and composed attitude, Lakra made his debut in 2012 in a Test series against South Africa and was part of the team that finished last in the 2012 London Games.

01 October 2021||YANKTON (USA),||Deepika misses a medal||World No.2 Deepika Kumari lost to Olympic team bronze winner Michelle Kroppen of Germany in the shoot-off to narrowly miss out on the recurve women’s individual bronze medal in the Archery World Cup Final (WCF) here on Thursday. Deepika shot well but found Kroppen too good in the first two sets. The German put together perfect scores to win 30-28 and 30-29 and take a 4-0 lead. Deepika, who collected 28s in the next three sets, fought back to level the match 5-5 and force a shoot-off. Shooting wide The Indian shot wide for a 6 while Kroppen got a 9. She became the first German to win a WCF medal. Deepika had defeated Olympic team silver medallist Svetlana Gomboeva of Russia 6-4 in the quarterfinals, but lost to another Russian, double Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Elena Osipova, 6-2 in the semifinals. In the semifinals, Osipova shot consistently to win the first two sets 29-27, 29-26 and establish a 4-0 lead. Though Deepika raised her game to get a 10 each in the third and fourth sets, Osipova matched the Indian’s efforts to split points and advance to the final. On Wednesday, Abhishek Verma, the lone Indian compound archer in the fray, crashed out in the men's individual quarterfinals, losing 142-146 to American Braden Gellenthien.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/deepika-misses-a-medal/article36768303.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Pink-ball gazing pays dividends||For the last three months, Smriti Mandhana has had a pink Kookaburra ball in her kit. And, she has been “looking” at it as often as possible. That probably helped, as she took the pink ball on on the opening day of India’s Day-Night Test against Australia as if she had been doing it all her life. That she had had just two training sessions with the pink ball didn’t seem to matter. The elegant left-hander was unbeaten on 80 when rain brought an early end to the first day’s play at Carrara. At a virtual press conference she revealed she had ordered the pink ball while playing The Hundred in England. “I had placed the order for the ball because I knew there was going to be a Test match,” she said, smiling. “I thought I could at least look at the ball and understand (it). I carried it in my kit for three months and I thought I could have a session to use it, but didn’t get the time.” Yet, Smriti, along with her opening partner Shafali Verma, frustrated the Australians. “We enjoy batting with each other (regardless) of the format,” she said. “We back each other. (For instance), when I chased a wide ball outside off-stump, she came up and told me it was going too far away.” She said the Australians bowled too short at the start. “The wicket wasn’t as hard as they would have (wanted),” she said.   Smriti’s tempo was excellent. She was punishing the bad ball and defending the good ones. She sort of counterpunched a fair bit… but we feel we are still in the gameMeg Lanning— Australia captain||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pink-ball-gazing-pays-dividends/article36768310.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Venkatesh considers himself as an all-rounder’||Moments after Venkatesh Iyer — the new kid on the IPL block — displayed his additional utility with the ball to the cricket world beyond the domestic circuit, against Delhi Capitals earlier in the week, the all-rounder acknowledged the help of Anand Rajan, his “bowling coach” during the mid-match interview with the official broadcaster. More of a friend For Rajan, former Madhya Pradesh pacer, Venkatesh has been “more of a friend than a ward”. “Being from the same Tamil community in Indore, I have known him since his childhood. “And even though many have looked at him as a big-hitting batsman, Venkatesh has always considered himself as an all-rounder, so we have been working on his bowling for a long time,” Rajan told The Hindu on Thursday. Despite having set the stage on fire with his batting, Venkatesh had to wait for four games since his debut to prove his worth with the ball. That too due to Andre Russell’s unavailability and Lockie Ferguson’s injury during the Capitals innings. Even after impressing in his two overs, dismissing the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer for his first IPL scalp, Venkatesh had to convince captain Eoin Morgan to trust his ability to deliver at the death. “He told me that during the Time Out, he told the coach coach (Brendon McCullum) to let him bowl since Ferguson could no longer bowl. He was told to approach the captain who would take the call, so he walked up to Morgan who was hesitant but agreed to try him out for another over. Once he did well, Morgan himself threw the ball to him to bowl the crucial 19th over,” said Rajan. Justified the faith Having kept his composure and delivered the yorkers to near-perfection, Venkatesh justified the faith shown in him. While it is understood that the national selection panel has shortlisted him in its long list of “players to watch out for” ahead of the major global events in limited-overs cricket in the next two years, Rajan stresses that Venkatesh is far from being a finished product as a bowler. “During the last few days, he has been seeking suggestions on how to improve bowling wide yorkers. That’s going to be our agenda once he returns to India after the IPL,” Rajan said, adding a sign-off note. “Also, don’t be surprised if he continues to be as effective in the Ranji Trophy as he has been with the white ball.”  Don’t be surprised if he continues to be as effective in the Ranji Trophy as he has been with the white ball — Rajan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/venkatesh-considers-himself-as-an-all-rounder/article36768839.ece

01 October 2021||Dubai,||Indian women’s team lands in UAE||The Indian women’s football team arrived in the city on Thursday for its upcoming friendlies in the UAE and Bahrain, which get underway on Saturday. The friendlies have been planned as part of the team’s preparation for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup, which is set to take place in India next year. The Indian team has been camping in Jamshedpur with help from the government of Jharkhand. The 23-member squad, along with the support staff, travelled from Jamshedpur to New Delhi, before boarding a flight to Dubai. The team will play friendlies against the United Arab Emirates (October 2) and Tunisia (October 4), before travelling to Bahrain, where it will face the hosts on October 10 and Chinese Taipei on Oct. 13. Excited “The girls are all excited to be getting some match time for our Asian Cup preparation. We have trained hard for the last month in Jamshedpur, and now we are ready to test ourselves against some tough opponents,” said head coach Thomas Dennerby. Captain and centre-back Ashalata Devi thanked the authorities for arranging a camp and international matches amid a pandemic. “We know the situation is not easy right now, but the way everything has been arranged to help us set up a long term preparation for the Asian Cup is amazing,” said Ashalata Devi. “Right from the camp being organised by the Jharkhand government with top facilities, to matches scheduled against tough opponents, we have received immense support. “All the girls are extremely thankful for that, and we are all putting in our full effort to be ready for the Asian Cup,” she stated.  The squad:   Goalkeepers: Aditi Chauhan, Maibam Linthoingambi Devi, Shreya Hooda.

01 October 2021||Dubai,||Loved watching Sehwag bat: Stirling||Every budding cricketer has a hero while growing up and it is no different for Ireland batters Paul Stirling, who looked up to Virender Sehwag and Australian Damien Martyn in his formative years. In a virtual interaction arranged by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Stirling recalled the days when he tried to copy Sehwag. Pleasing on the eye “I probably had two batsmen that I loved watching, one was Damien Martyn, he was nice to look up (to), pleasant on the eye, aesthetically pleasing, someone I can never emulate and Virender Sehwag, the other one I watched. (I) loved his play through the off-side (and) tried to copy a lot of his stuff, not very well be it, …but (I) loved watching those two bat, and used to watch Test cricket at home, which was not really the normal thing to do in Belfast as a 10-year-old,” added Stirling, who has played 134 T20s, 3 Tests and 86 T20s. Like Sehwag, despite the outside criticism, Sterling, who made his T20 debut versus Pakistan in 2009, did not change his technique. Was it a conscious effort to not change it? “It is something that you learn as you go on, there would be a lot more noise for Sehwag than there will be for me. I just think it doesn’t, it shouldn’t affect your performance, it only affects your performance, if you actually take it in from outside, it doesn’t help in any way.” Sterling, who had a “sporting” family and a “cricket ground” which was near his house, recollected how he fell in love with the game. “Cricket was mainly the one that I probably fell in love with the most from the earliest age from about five (years old).” Sterling also said that he watched the Indian Premier League games and he was “surprised” to see the wickets at Sharjah. He also stressed that he will have to work equally hard to play both the spinners and the seamers in the T20 World Cup. “Definitely we got to work hard against spin and in nets we got to prepare well but also keep eye on the fact that something that you have your eye on like (while) playing spin, don’t forget the seamers as well and the other factors that come into it, so there is lot of skill (needed) for seamers to be played against as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/loved-watching-sehwag-bat-stirling/article36768538.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Role is to rotate the strike: Bharat||K.S. Bharat may not be an explosive hitter, but that does not necessarily mean that he has no place in Twenty20 cricket. Bharat is tasked with a less glamorous role at Royal Challengers Bangalore, one that requires him to build a strong launch pad for big guns like Glenn Maxwell and A.B. de Villiers. The Andhra Pradesh wicketkeeper-batsman has done his job in the last couple of outings. Steady knocks at one-drop — 44 (35b) against Rajasthan Royals, and 32 (24b) against Mumbai Indians — have come in winning causes. “At No. 3, my role is to rotate the strike and run well. If you keep the scoreboard ticking at 8-9 an over, you have a good base for Maxi (Maxwell) and others coming in later. If we keep wickets in hand, we can go all out in the death,” Bharat said after RCB’s win against Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday. Bharat enjoyed batting alongside Maxwell on Wednesday, with the duo discussing tactics to help each other in the chase. “Maxwell and I spoke about the areas we can target, and boundary options. “We also discussed the number of overs a bowler will bowl, and what lengths he will bowl. We talked tactical matters, which we executed well,” he said. On playing with stars like Virat Kohli, Maxwell and de Villiers, Bharat said, “Each and every individual you play with will add something to your game, and help you understand the game better.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/role-is-to-rotate-the-strike-bharat/article36768308.ece

At one point, India was in danger of losing the match with Mary Ann Gomes looking in serious trouble after R. Vaishali drew her game on the second board. Bhakti Kulkarni’s loss on the third board was a serious setback to India. Thereafter, Mary gained by some unimaginative play by her rival to reach a winning position. Harika, too, raised visions of a comfortable victory after her opponent blundered. But Harika’s late oversight saw the match end in a draw. Mary went on to complete a hard-fought victory to make it 2-2.  The results:   Quarterfinals: Set 1: India drew with Kazakhstan 2-2 (D. Harika drew with Zhansaya Abdumalik; R. Vaishali drew with Dinara Saduakassova; Bhakti Kulkarni lost to Meruert Kamilidenova; Mary Ann Gomes bt Gulmira Dauletova).

01 October 2021||BARCELONA,||Koeman under pressure to save his job||Ronald Koeman needs his Barcelona side to win big when it visits Atlético Madrid to have a shot at saving his job. That is, if he makes it to Saturday. Two embarrassing losses to start the Champions League have left the Dutch coach under extreme pressure before a trip to the capital to face the Spanish league’s titleholder. Losing 3-0 to Bayern Munich, a European juggernaut, two weeks ago was humbling. But to follow that up with another 3-0 loss at Benfica — a team it had not lost to since 1961 — on Wednesday may be too much for the club’s leadership to take. At odds Club president Joan Laporta and Koeman have been at odds since Laporta returned to run the club last March. Laporta went as far as to look for another coach in the off-season before finally settling on keeping Koeman for the second year of his contract. Laporta and Koeman have shared the need to convince Barcelona’s fans to lower expectations since the club was saddled with over a billion euros in debt and unable to pay Lionel Messi’s wages. But the team has hit new lows that even with the exit of the almighty Messi are difficult to take. A sixth-place standing in the Spanish league has almost become respectable for the former champion compared to its dismal showing in the Champions League. Koeman’s tactics against Benfica, however, were also questionable. Instead of replacing Gerard Pique with another defender when he picked up an early yellow card, Koeman shifted Frenkie de Jong into his backline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/koeman-under-pressure-to-save-his-job/article36768355.ece
01 October 2021||New Delhi,||AIBA probe reveals bout manipulation at Rio 2016||More than 10 bouts in the 2016 Rio Olympics boxing competition were manipulated for “money” and other “perceived benefits”, an independent investigation has revealed, prompting the International Boxing Association (AIBA) to promise a “tough” selection process for referees and judges at the upcoming men’s World championship. System in place The first phase report of the McLaren Global Sport Solutions’ independent investigation into boxing, which was accessed by PTI, has been handed to AIBA and revealed that “a system for the manipulation of bouts by officials existed at Rio”. In all, 14 bouts came under the scanner, including two finals. “It was a complete reversal of Santa Clause’s myth of the naughty and the nice. The naughty were gifted an appointment at Rio because they were willing, or under pressure to support any request for manipulation, while the nice were left out,” the report noted referring to the dubious sappointment of officials at the Games. The damning findings of the investigation stated that conspiracy to manipulate Rio results dated back as far back as before the 2012 London Olympics and that a trial run was carried out during the qualifying events for the 2016 edition. “Bouts were manipulated for money, perceived benefit of AIBA, or to thank National Federations and their Olympic committees, and, on occasion, hosts of competitions for their financial support,” it stated. “The investigation to date has concluded that such manipulation involved significant six figure sums on occasion. The manipulation methodology relied upon corruption within the cadre of corrupted R&Js (referees and judges) and the Draw Commission,” it added. The AIBA has promised more stringent mechanism to appoint referees and judges. “AIBA noted the findings regarding the Rio 2016 boxing tournament with concern and confirmed that extensive reforms have been implemented to ensure sporting integrity at current AIBA competitions,” the body stated. Referees, judges and technical officials being appointed to the World Championships in Belgrade from October 24 now face tough selection criteria, including background and other checks conducted by MGSS. The report said that the then AIBA head Ching-Kuo Wu held direct responsibility for the fiasco in Rio.

After holding promising positions on all four boards, India just about managed to win 2.5-1.5 in the second set of the quarterfinals. Even in the first, India had its moments before managing to make it 2-2. India plays formidable Georgia in the semifinals on Friday. In the second set, Tania Sachdev blundered under time-pressure to lose the first decisive game. R. Vaishali drew before D. Harika came up with a clinical finish to help India draw level.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Chris Gayle to miss the remainder of IPL 2021||Kolkata Knight Riders will be keen to pull off its second win of the season against Punjab Kings and get closer to a playoffs berth in IPL 2021 when the two meet on Friday. The intensity of the contest is expected to be high at the Ring of Fire in Dubai. KKR, fourth with 10 points, will look to remain in the top half, while PBKS, with eight points, will be desperate to win its remaining three matches. The Eoin Morgan-led KKR has players who have contributed in key moments to provide a distinct momentum to the side in the Gulf-leg of the event.  Performers like eye-catching all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer, Sunil Narine, Rahul Tripathi, Nitish Rana, Lockie Ferguson and promising spinner Varun Chakravarthy have taken the responsibility at the time of need. The win over the formidable Delhi Capitals and a better head-to-head record (19 wins, nine losses) against PBKS should spur the team, which will play an evening match after two consecutive day encounters. PBKS has enough resources, but it has not managed to seize the important moments. Recovering from its defeat to Mumbai Indians, PBKS will rely on captain K.L. Rahul and Aiden Markram in the batting department while hoping that Nicholas Pooran regains his form. Efficient bowlers in Mohammed Shami, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh and Nathan Ellis have it in them to go for the kill.

Korea will be the overwhelming favourite with Jang Woojin (world-ranked 12) and Lee Sangsu (22) spearheading the attack, but star paddler Sharath Kamal expects India to provide a tough fight, and possibly even a memorable win. “Korea is a strong team. We lost to them in the semifinals of the 2018 Asian Games. But I have been in good form, and the team has been having good confidence especially after the win over Iran the other day. If we can win the semis, we will be the favourite to win the title,” Sharath told The Hindu . First ever medal Earlier on Wednesday night, the men had assured themselves of a bronze — the country’s first ever medal — with a 3-1 win over Iran. Sharath said: “This medal is something I have been chasing for the last 20 years and finally I could get that. Really happy and proud with this achievement.” Meanwhile, the women’s team defeated Chinese Taipei 3-1 for positions 5-8 on Thursday.

01 October 2021||MONACO,||AIU to take over Belarus Olympics case||An investigation into two Belarus team officials, who tried to force sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya on a flight from the Tokyo Olympics, will now be run by track and field authorities. World Athletics said on Thursday that its independent Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) is taking over the case from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). No timetable was given for the investigation. The Belarus team’s treatment of Tsimanouskaya created a diplomatic incident at the Games with Japanese authorities and Poland’s embassy coming to her aid. Team officials Artur Shimak and Yury Maisevich were involved in taking Tsimanouskaya to the airport to send her home to Belarus after she criticised coaches on social media. Tsimanouskaya sought help at the airport because she feared for her safety if she returned to Minsk. Within days, she and her husband got humanitarian visas to stay in Poland. Shimak and Maisevich continued to have contact with Belarus team members in Tokyo until the IOC withdrew their Olympic credentials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aiu-to-take-over-belarus-olympics-case/article36768352.ece

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Arm yourself with twigs||“The sight of a young child and an adult at play brings out a brilliant energy,” says Sreeranjini GS, founder of Kavade, a traditional board game store in Bengaluru. With the installation of permanent structures around the city, Sreeranjini has ensured anyone can enjoy a game or two, even if they have left their boards at home. In December 2019, residents’ associations in Jakkur decided to spruce up the park around the lake, as part of their CSR initiative.Thinking out of the board-game-box, Sreeranjini with Annapurna Kamath of Sathya Foundation and Jalaposhan Trust conceptualised the “scaling up” of some traditional Indian games in that area. “Annapurna explored the possibility of installing game tables along the periphery of the jogger’s path. As this was also next to the children’s play area, we hoped it would foster the participation of different age groups.” The team, their investors and the BBMP were mindful of the fact that these tables would have to weather changes in the season as well as boisterous children. “We zeroed in on permanent stone  tables and benches, with instructions etched in Kannada and English. Since many players would not be familiar with most of the games, we took care to inscribe the rules in a simple, pictorial manner, making them easier to understand.” “While people can bring their pawns from home, the beauty of these games is they can be played with stones, seeds, twigs and other things found in a park.” “We were certain we wanted games that would appeal to adults too; many of the games have their roots in our ancient culture,” she says, adding that some of the traditional Indian games included Sonaikattam, Aadu huli, Morabaraba and Aligulimane , among others. Although the project was completed in February 2020, it was only inaugurated in September that year, owing to the pandemic. While the initiative at Jakkur Lake was the first at a public space, Kavade has installed similar games at CIS School (2016), Miraya Greens resorts (2017) and Nandi Citadel, an apartment complex (2019), in the city. It takes the team two to three months to complete a project from inception to installation, she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/arm-yourself-with-twigs/article36768211.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s meet in court||It was the summer of 1999. The nation was submerged in the overwhelming din of the cricket World Cup, but two 20-year-olds were patiently scaling hitherto unseen summits in tennis. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi became the first Indian pair to win a Grand Slam title and for the country’s tennis fans long starved of a hero, they got not one, but two — “Lee-Hesh”. It was a moment enough to move even the most incurable of cynics. But nothing prepares you for the Everest-today-abyss-tomorrow motif as well as sport does. As quick as a wink, a glorious present and bright future could become a distant past. For the ‘Indian Express’ that went on to lift two more Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, there was simmering discontent beneath the winning partnership. Since then, much dirty linen has been washed in public, all leading to an unsavoury divorce. At the speed and venom of a perfect ace, Indian tennis was split wide open. It is this split between Paes and Bhupathi that seems to be the focus of Break Point , an upcoming docu-series which traces, over seven episodes, the duo’s partnership on and off-court. Inspiring a generation But both Paes and Bhupathi disagree. “It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built. What it means to be number one in a sport at a time when there was no manual on how it could be achieved,” Paes says, joining Bhupathi in a virtual conversation with The Hindu.   Break Point is helmed by husband-wife filmmaker duo Nitish Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who are co-directing a project for the first time. Bhupathi says the pair was approached on several occasions over the years to tell their story, but it was this director combo that clinched the deal. “It didn’t always come down to the right team, the right narrative or the right platform. But when we heard that Nitish and Ashwiny were interested, obviously with their pedigree, it piqued our interest.” From scripting to release, Break Point took one-and-a half years to complete. It involved shooting through the pandemic and multiple lockdowns, and a team working inside a strict bubble. Why a docu-series and not a full-length sports biopic? For Paes, 120 minutes is insufficient to narrate their story of 20 years. “You’ll probably see only one side of it. With Break Point , you’ll see all the highs and lows of our relationship.” Bhupathi believes there is a sort of reality that comes out in a docu-drama. “With us, there has always been this question of ‘what if’ and ‘why’. So we thought it was better to narrate it in first person and clear the air, rather than have someone play us.”  Break Point also features the duo’s families, friends, tennis players and opponents, including Sania Mirza and brothers Bob and Mike Bryan. “Twenty years later, it is so unique to hear their version of our story. It’s not about what’s right or wrong. It’s just about presenting the facts,” adds Paes. But reliving the entire saga and baring it all was disquieting for Bhupathi. “Talking about the highs was easy. Talking about the lows with several cameras and production crew was definitely not ideal for me, but we somehow got it done. Thankfully I had some help at home to deal with all that,” says Bhupathi, who is married to actor and former Miss Universe Lara Dutta. He balks at the prospect of a biopic in the future. “It took us 10 years to get here. Let’s take one step at a time. If there is still buzz around Lee-Hesh, then why not?” Paes on the other hand says he has a lot more to say on his individual journey, his Olympic medal win in 1996, and the relationship with his father Vece Paes, who also won a medal as part of the Indian hockey team at the 1972 Games. “I’m working on a project on those lines...” Mental health The pandemic has spurred the release of several sports docu-dramas that have thrived on streaming platforms. Bhupathi has watched them all: from The Last Dance to The Test . On his list is the recently-released series on his friend and tennis compatriot Mardy Fish, also incidentally titled Untold: Breaking Point. “Yeah, we had a good laugh about that,” Bhupathi chuckles, but quickly turns serious. “The issue about mental health dealt with in that series is so important. I wish we had that kind of help 20 years ago. We had to deal with a whole lot [of it] all by ourselves. I am jealous of the kids today.” Paes and Bhupathi last played together more than a decade ago. But they have grown closer in the process of making Break Point . “We really didn’t have a proper conversation after 2011. Now we’ve been speaking more frequently, working on this project so intimately and passionately. The bond between us has rejuvenated and hopefully we can keep it going,” says Bhupathi. Paes says he shares a true brotherhood with Bhupathi. “We will have our differences, but we will always be close. I know that if I ever need Mahesh, he’s going to be there, and vice-versa. If you put us on a tennis court today, there will be magic.” Break Point streams on Zee5 from October 1.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Life lessons on the road||During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, motorcycle buddies Mohan Mallappa (50) and Babu Vishweshvariah (56) rode from Bengaluru to Wayanad (about 270 kilometres) to deliver cancer medicine for a retired Lieutenant Colonel. They were a part of Riders Republic Motorcycle Club’s (RRMC) eight-member team that carried essential medicines to remote corners of Karnataka and beyond. They could not meet the officer. On their way back, he called to thank them. “A man who has put his life on the line for our country called to thank us. It was very touching,” says Mohan. During the first phase of the lockdown, many people could not get their regular medicines. The elderly especially needed help. Mohan and Babu read an article on a police constable riding a scooter from Bengaluru to Hubballi to deliver a life-saving drug. That inspired them to form a team with the Bengaluru police's support. This team made about 20 deliveries across South India. “We don’t always ride for pleasure; we ride with a purpose,” says Babu of his and Mohan's association with RRMC. Apart from the club's involvement in social services within Bengaluru, it has also adopted two Government schools — in Coorg and Andhra Pradesh. “Whenever we visit them, the children are so excited. They make us start our bikes and rev the engine. It gives them so much joy,” adds Babu. Starting the ride Mohan got into motorcycling in his early 20s. He had a Yamaha RX 100cc exclusively for exploration. Then, he hit the brakes for a while due to work. He restarted in 2013 with a Harley Davidson Super Glide. Babu, who knew Mohan since 2008, used to accompany him on a few rides. Around the mid-2010s, both switched to their current BMW GS Adventure motorcycle. “We mostly ride on alternate weekends. Now, due to the pandemic, we stick to places within Karnataka like Chikmagalur, Mangaluru, and Coorg,” says Babu. But pre-pandemic Mohan and Babu used to ride at least 2,500 kilometres a month. They have also explored Australia, Thailand, and a few countries in Europe. India, however, they say, is the most beautiful motorcycling destination. “Every ride is an adventure, a lesson,” says Babu. Mohan agrees. He, for instance, learnt how to deal with hostility during a ride to Gangtok two years ago. “When I’d stopped for tea in Bihar, a gang of five people wanted to take photos sitting on my bike. I politely refused. One of them was annoyed at this. He was like, ‘Do you know who I am? I can buy this bike right now if I want to!’” Mohan, instead of jumping into the confrontation, assessed the situation. He was outnumbered four to one; he was in an unfamiliar place; and, he and his bike were at risk. So, he calmed them. “I offered them tea and cigarettes. I told them patiently they could take photos standing next to the bike. Because if they accidentally damage any part while sitting on it, I wouldn’t be able to continue my journey. They changed their tone immediately. And, they ended up helping me!” “There are all kinds of people you meet during a journey,” says Babu, “Some are hostile. And, some go out of their way to help you. A long ride teaches you to put up with any kind of weather. Be it rain or shine, sometimes, you just have to keep riding.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/life-lessons-on-the-road/article36768205.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||He clicked with stars||Septuagenarian Ashwath Narayan may have retired as a cinema still photographer, but he remains a busy man. He has images that have captured, actors and directors from 1965 to 2000. “I have around three lakh images and am converting them and the negatives into a digital format,” says Ashwath, adding “This is my way of preserving their legacy.” Ashwath credits his brother for instilling the passion for still photography in him. “He was running the Three Stars Studio in Madras then. It was dedicated to cinema photography. He invited me to take care of his studio as soon as I was done with my Class X exams. One day, a senior photographer did not turn up on set and I was sent to take his place.” Ashwath later realised he was working on the sets of the Kannada film Belli Moda, which featured Kalpana, directed by Puttanna Kanagal. Ever since, Ashwath has seen everything through his lens. “I was the still photographer for 11 films with Puttanna and 15 films with Siddalingiah. I also worked on Guru Shishyaru, Malaya Marhutha... Those days still photography and print reigned; people would wait for cinema content, which was published only on weekends. Photographs would be given a massive display on the news pages. We revelled in that glory.” Ashwath says many filmmakers leaned heavily on still photography to check the continuity of the scenes. Images would be documented in albums, which kept a record of the costume, make up and hairstyle. Many of Ashwath’s images find their way into stories in print and books on cinema even today: 300 of his pictures, are in Dr Rajkumar Samagra Charithre, written by Doddahulluru Rukkoji. The coffee table book won the National Award in the Best Book on Cinema category. While they worked in both black-and-white as well as colour, the former was more challenging, according to Ashwath. “We had to capture every detail and bring the image to life with just those two colours. Technology has unfortunately killed certain nuances of photography. ” He adds, however “We must use technology to document our heritage.” He plans to create a virtual library for cinema, which will give access to anyone with an interest in Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam cinema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/he-clicked-with-stars/article36768174.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||History on my plate||Food is a gateway to the world, a peep hole to the past and a window to ever-evolving cultural scenarios. At the Kitchen Table, an ongoing exhibition at 1ShantiRoad, traces the powerful influence the culinary world exerts. “We started looking at how art can exist in multiple forms and formats, and began putting together artworks that dealt with food in different ways — food products based out of algae, family histories, interventions into existing commercial establishments and more,” says Nihaal Faizal of Reliable Copy who curated the show with Sarasija Subramanian. The works on display include photographs, novels, cookbooks, videos and more, each detailing a facet of human progression, or regression. The wide spectrum of art from different parts of the world encompasses the familiar and light-hearted as well as the understated and cryptic. Straight forward cookbooks and those inspired by children’s literature such as Josh Sutton’sFive Go Feastingbased on Enid Blyton’s Famous Five series and Roald Dahl’sRevolting Recipesshare space with the works of artist Rasheed Araeen whose UK-based restaurant is an extension of his art, and others such as Lantian Xie and David Robbins. A darker, disturbing side is also presented: preparing, presenting and partaking of food as a means of power play. “In the Middle Ages kings would serve all manner of disgusting meals to shock and scare guests, flaunting their control over them. Drawing from this, American artist Candice Lin put together a performance and a feast in 2014, titled Subtleties and Warnings. She sent us her documentation of the event and photographs from the event for At The Kitchen Table,” says Sarasija. Diametrically opposite views of a Japanese POW who was well fed by the Americans versus that of an Italian prisoner who was starved by German captors, are a stark reminder of the socio-political impact of food on culture. There are audio-visual elements to the exhibition too. Videos by Pushpamala N and Gavati take a dig at illusionary standards set by society, while Carolyn Lazard’s entry is a reminder for the inclusion of the differently abled within society’s framework. As a space that has welcomed creative minds to the city over the years, the many visitors to 1ShantiRoad have contributed to the community kitchen on the premises. The dishes and recipes they shared have been collated into the1ShantiRoad Cookbook, with over 70 contributions from artists and other kindred spirits.  At the Kitchen Table is on till October 5, 1Shantiroad Gallery, Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/history-on-my-plate/article36768188.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Working hard to work out hard||There are two things R Manikandan lives for: the chain of Toneez Fitness Centres he established as a 23-year-old, and bodybuilding. Over the past month, he has been consumed by both. After opening three stores of Toneez Wellness in Chennai and Hyderabad, he is now in Uzbekistan, representing India at the 12th World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship, which begins today. This is the third time he will be taking part in this competition, having won the Mr World title twice: gold in 2017 and silver in 2018. “I want Indians to treat bodybuilding like the challenging sport it is,” says Mani, who will be participating in the above 165 centimetre height category. “You have to dedicate your entire self to it. It’s not just one hour in the gym, bodybuilding means thinking about it from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep. Every meal matters, how much water you drink matters, your sleep matters,” he says. As exciting as it is to represent your country internationally, Mani’s story of how he came to do that is perhaps more fascinating. He discusses it over a video call. “It started about 15 years ago, when I was 15 —” he begins when a phone call interrupts him, blasting the Popeye ringtone. Apropos, for a team of bodybuilders. A pause here and he continues. An early start As a 15-year-old living in Guindy, Mani was bullied in school for being overweight. That led him to hit the local gym, where for the first time, he met men obsessed with sculpting their bodies. “I dropped from 120 kilograms to 70, and entered class XI as a much fitter person. But then I thought why not build muscle too,” he says. Impressed by 25-year-olds at the gym who were also competing on stage, Mani followed suit, registering at a State-level bodybuilding competition. “I placed sixth in the senior category, among bodybuilders with years of experience,” recalls Mani, adding that it gave him the push he needed to train more. “All my heroes, from Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Rock, to my coach, Senthil Kumaran Selvarajan were bodybuilders.” For the next two years, he juggled training and entering competitions with schoolwork and preparing for his Class XII board exams. “My parents did not mind. We are from a poor background and they wouldn’t ask me many questions because I worked my way to pay the gym and registration fees. I would work odd jobs, mostly in small shops and housekeeping in hotels, clean restrooms, and so on,” he says. When he graduated, he became the first in his family to do so, and received a scholarship to pursue higher studies. However, a year into engineering college, he dropped out, to work at a gym instead. “I was working two jobs at the time. One as the housekeeping staff at Le Royal Méridien, Chennai and the other as a trainer at a local gym,” he says. As his bodybuilding skills developed, he was promoted to the position of a gym supervisor at Le Royal Méridien. A chance encounter It was at the hotel gym that Mani met Sriram Vasantharajan, owner of Blade Energy Partners. “He was staying there for three months for a project. He had an ACL tear and was in a knee brace. I offered to help with his strength training and within three months, his knee brace was removed,” says Mani. Before Sriram flew back to the US, where he worked, he met Mani again, asking him what his future plans were. “I said I am training for competitions,” said Mani. “But he asked me what my bigger goal is — I thought about it and replied that it was to train others to be fit too. He suggested I open my own gym, but I laughed it off. I was 21 years old and earning 15,000 a month!” However, Sriram offered to invest in his gym and went on to give him seed money for it. “I quit my job the next day and started looking for places to open a gym. Most places took one look at me, and said, come back with your parents,” he laughs. But with help from Sriram’s friends, he opened the first Toneez branch in Nanganallur in 2015. Once business picked up, he returned to his first passion: competing. In 2017, he won Mr Tamil Nadu, Mr South India and Mr World. The current competition in Uzbekistan will be his third attempt, and he is now especially careful about his lifestyle. “You have to be in shape throughout the year,” he explains, “You have to be disciplined, you can’t train just before the competition. If you train for one year, you can gain two kilograms of quality muscle. For 10 kilograms of muscle to show, you would have to train for five years continuously without spoiling your health. That is why I call it the toughest sport in the world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/working-hard-to-work-out-hard/article36768191.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Sound of sass||Nikhita Gandhi cherishes the feedback she is receiving for her recently released single ‘Bad Boy X Bad Girl’ with rap artist Badshah. The video features Toofaan -fame Mrunal Thakur sensuously grooving to this fun number. “I have done singles before but this song is a class apart. This is the first non-film collaboration with Badshah. His music is always of international standard,” says the multilingual playback singer, over the phone from Mumbai. Does Nikhita anticipate more offers to be the voice for Mrunal? “I don’t mind,” laughs Nikhita and adds, “I believe when I sang ‘Burj Khalifa’, Kiara Advani also liked my voice, especially how I started the song; she wanted me to sing more songs for her.” The 2017 title song of Raabta , picturised on Deepika Padukone was the big-ticket number for Nikhita. “I have had the pleasure of singing some phenomenal songs like ‘Raabta’ and a variety of others in Bollywood. My niche is my versatility. Sometimes people say ‘Oh my god, you sang this one? It sounds so different’,” says Nikhita whose repertoire extends to playback singing in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Bengali films. “It doesn't matter who I am singing for, for me the song and the composers are important. I don’t pick according to how big or small the actors are, everybody starts from somewhere and becomes somebody.” If you are a trained singer living in Chennai, you cannot escape the ARR aura. Kolkata-born Nikhita Gandhi, while pursuing dentistry in Chennai, joined AR Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory to learn western classical music in her free time. Looking back She found herself spending more time there as part of the choir. As destiny had it, Rahman heard her voice and gave her a break in Kalyana Samyal Sadham (2013). What followed was a slew of offers from other film industries, an album in Bengali called Kotha and another biggie with Rahman ‘Ladio’ for Shankar’s I . She entered the Telugu film industry with ‘Beautiful Zindagi’ in Yevade Subramanyam . “When a break came from AR Rahman I was not even planning to be a playback singer, I was more into rock, and may have pursued that. Thanks to him, I was put on the singing map and a career in Bollywood got launched,” says Nikhita. With regional songs, what’s her trick to sound like a native singer? “I put myself in the person of that language and try to pretend. It’s sort of mimicry I suppose. I write lyrics in Hindi, it helps in being phonetically correct.” While indie music is considered a stepping stone to Bollywood, Nikhita started her music career as a playback singer first and moved to make independent music, including collaborating with American singer-songwriter Pink Sweat for a remix version of ‘At My Worst’. Nikitha rendered her part in Hinglish. “A lot of people listen to Indian songs even though they don’t understand them. This is a good time for a collaboration between Hindi and English,” says Nikhita who adds that she loves performing Latino numbers as well.  “It doesn't matter who I am singing for, for me the song and the composers are important. I don’t pick according to the big or small actors’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sound-of-sass/article36768195.ece

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Nilgiris as a sundowner||The story of this gin begins in the Nilgiris, five years ago. The late chairman Neelakanta Rao Jagdale of Bengaluru-based Amrut Distilleries was holidaying in Udhagamandalam when he thought of creating a distilled gin using botanicals and spices from South India. After a visit to the Government Medicinal Plant Development Area at Doddabetta, he learnt about the medicinal plants used for therapeutic oils. Amrut’s Nilgiris gin launched in December 2020 is now available in the US, UK, Europe and Singapore. “Our whiskeys are already available in 58 countries. We want to grow further. We are working on new gins with Indian botanicals that highlight the variety of flavours that our country is known for. We are doing trials now to finalise the recipe,” says Nikhil Varma, gin distiller for Amrut. While the Nilgiris gin came with a bouquet of 10 botanicals including juniper berries, coriander seeds, lemongrass, angelica roots, orris roots, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, Nilgiris tea and paan (betel leaves), the new gins will also have unique botanicals and interesting flavour profiles. Nikhil says the Nilgiris mountain range has a vast area dedicated to tea plantations, its tea, which represents the hills was the first choice. “Nilgiris tea gives the floral, yet complex muskiness that stands out. I distilled some green tea and black tea varieties before choosing the right one that has a bit of dryness, florals, and a hint of spices. It adds an extra dimension. We have used Italian juniper berries, a primary botanical with all-purpose flavours of pine, lavender, rose, and citrus. Coriander seeds, a floral spice, complements the soft citrus of juniper and I explored lemon grass to bring the zesty note,” says Nikhil. The last botanical came in the form of betel leaves: the spicy and floral variety from Mysuru and the juicy, sweet variety from Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-nilgiris-as-a-sundowner/article36768193.ece

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||There’s bael in my vodka||Kokum mocktails, bael cocktails, Darjeeling tea coolers and chikoo -flavoured beer now jostle for space on Indian bar and dining menus. Drinks that hero indigenous ingredients are this year’s fastest growing trend, fuelled by a rising interest in regional produce combined with a pandemic-induced hankering for comforting childhood flavours. So bael ka sharbat now has a chic new avatar, as a bael cocktail at Sidecar in Delhi. It is a whiskey or vodka-based alcoholic drink with bael shrub. The inky blue pea flower, which grows wild in parts of India, has found its way into everything from tea to gin-based cocktails. And the Indian olive, or jalpai , infused iced tea has become an epicurean trend for cafe hopping Instagrammers in Imphal, Manipur. Eli Yambem of Manipur-based Dweller Teas says that well-travelled Indians, after experiencing a world of exotic flavours, are now looking for drinks that are both fresh and familiar. He says, “While regional cuisines are a hit, regional drinks too shouldn’t be overlooked. With the drying and preserving techniques that the F&B industry now uses, shelf lives of many seasonal fruits can be extended. The Indian olive, a sour fruit mostly found in the Northeast and in some parts of East and West Bengal for instance, is a highly perishable fruit, and is not well-known. I dried them to make a herbal infusion with roselle and the peel of a locally available lemon. The infusion has a lovely reddish hue and a delicious fragrance.” The Indian olive, like peach, is a stone fruit have a mild spicy fragrance and is extremely sour, which is why it works for Eli’s concoction. Eli adds that besides the drinks, his health-concious younger customers in particular, “want good food that also appeals to the eye and taste buds”. Japtej Ahulwalia and his team of barmen at Origins, a Chennai-based speciality bar, have moved away from artificial syrups and adopted many techniques to turn fresh seasonal fruits into syrups. In some cases they even use flowers like marigold, blue pea, elder flower and lavender, in their cocktails like No Name Cocktail, Black Forest Spritzer . Japtej says, “The end result is appealing both visually and on the palate. Synthetic flavours overshadow the liquor, because of the sweet content and added fragrances. That way, it becomes easy to cheat with cheap liqour in cocktails. We at Origins want cocktail and mocktail lovers to savour not only flavours of the additives, but of the liquor as well.” The other bar in Chennai that makes use of flavours derived from fresh fruits in their drinks is the bar at Novotel called KooX. Meanwhile Maharastra-based Priyanka Save runs Fruzzante, a brand of alco-beverage made from chikoo (Sapodilla) extracts. Being a farmer’s daughter, Priyanka says she knows the highly perishable chikoo like the back of her hand. “With my wine enthusiast husband Nagesh, I decided to overturn the depleted chikoo market after extensive experiments, extraction, fermentation, storage and packaging,” she says. After several trials with by-products, she realised that it is in the nature ofchikooto ferment. “From thereon, I decided to go with a cider-style beverage; that also allowed me to revive tradition and give consumers a chance to appreciate local spirits,” she says. Award-winning mixologist Yangdup Lama, founder of Delhi-based Sidecar, agrees with Priyanka. Now experimenting with fermented millet juice in cocktails, he says, “I take pride in experimenting with locally appreciated flavours. Consumers don’t want to simply gulp down something colourful and sweet anymore. They think of the aroma and taste notes. They want to try new Indian ingredients; it could be a flower or a spice.” Yangdup adds that “the well-travelled — whether in real time or through social media — are always looking at learning to taste and experience something new. I use a lot of vetiver, rhododendron flowers, Darjeeling tea, herbs and chillies to give that experience. Since there is a natural inquisitiveness to try new flavours, it becomes our responsibility to combine regional flavours, whether fruits, herbs and spice, to narrate an exciting story of the place it comes from.” One of the most popular local flavours now is the gondhoraj lebu , a highly scented lemon from West Bengal, with the kick of king chilli ( bhoot jolokia from Northeast India) in close pursuit. However, it is not just unfamiliar ingredients that are being appreciated; people are also redicovering familiar flavours. Nannari , a herbal drink made from the herb roots of the Nannari tree with origins in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, is increasingly finding its place on the menu across southern India. Leaning on childhood memories, Subhasish Borah and Bidisha of Kohuwa Collective a collaborative space and slow food cafe in Guwahati recently introduced thekera sorbot ( kokum sherbet), teteli sorbot (tamarind sherbet) and ou tenga sorbot (elephant apple sherbet). Subhasish says “As a slow food cafe, Bidisha and I wanted to bring back regional drinks. Assamese thekera sorbot is different from the ones made in the coastal region. The kokum found in Assam is kuji thekera which belongs to the garcinia family. We decided to make a drink with elephant apple because we wanted to introduce the unique flavour of this fruit, which is otherwise used as souring agent in curries, in a more versatile manner.” Ankita Sehgal, founder of Jeeru, a Madhya Pradesh-based bottled carbonbated drink, feels that even jeera (cumin) flavoured bottled drinks are slowly gaining popularity. Ankita says, “It has a huge potential as a mocktail mix. Its popularity could be because jeera -flavoured drinks pairs well with all Indian cuisine.” After all, you can’t go wrong when banking on the flavours of the land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/theres-bael-in-my-vodka/article36768201.ece

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Food for the homesick||Nothing. Nothing can possibly be better than a well-made dum biryani, that gets its spices, its rice and its topping of caramelised onions just right. The Kitchen by Chef Deepa, a Velachery-based cloud kitchen run by Deepa Arora and her husband Chef Jugesh Arora, has among its fare a paneer biryani that is flavourful enough to convert die-hard non-vegetarians. The food, as Chef Jugesh describes it, “is Lahori Amritsari cuisine, the kind my father has fond pre-Partition memories of”. The menu is entirely vegetarian and has plenty to explore, from soft and mild bhutte de kebab (corn kebabs) and crisp pani puris to a tangy kadhi pakoda gravy and rich, dry alu gobi . The parathas, like a laccha ghee paratha and an ajwaini ghee paratha, are atta -based (whole wheat flour) and are packed with smears of fragrant ghee to whet your appetite. Unsurprisingly, desserts are as hearty as the rest of the menu, such as a thick jamuni rabri that comes in a glass jar filled with mini gulab jamuns. Chaas and an interesting aam panna , with an added kick from kiwi, are among numerous beverages that come in tall glass bottles. The glass and paper-based packaging, the chef says, is entirely biodegradable.  The Kitchen by Chef Deepa is   available on Swiggy and Zomato.     The number of restaurants and kitchens that home deliver authentic Bengali meals around Chennai can be counted on fingertips. So a new one is always welcome in the fray, especially when it has somewhat lower prices and serves up a more spicy, more homey, and non-fancy-restaurant flavour. Hi Kolkata, a cloud kitchen in Aminjikarai, gets its basics right. From being extra generous in portions of the staple alu bhaja (crispy fried potato slivers) and sweet, yellow pulao to ensuring that the payesh (kheer) is well-condensed and hearty, it takes care of the little details that hit the spot for Bengalis who are homesick but low on budget. The food is varied, from potol dorma (a gravy of stuffed pointed gourds) to curd-based fish curries, and simple with minimal frills. It also helps that a Rs. 600 order is filling enough for two people. Swapan Kumar Dutta and Dilip Kumar Saxena have been running the kitchen for months, with Swapan at the helm. Their plans do not stop here: “We’re setting up a restaurant in Besant Nagar. It will be open in time for — if not before — Durga Puja this year,” says Swapan.  Hi Kolkata is available on Swiggy and Zomato. Call 9884272560       Apsara Reddy’s latest initiative, Turmeric Mantra, began with a focus on podis and pickles, as a means to keep her 86-year-old grandmother’s traditional recipes alive. “ Ammamma is the chief chef, prettily dressed in her crisp cotton saris and supervising our home kitchen from a chair. Our home cooks trained by her team up with women we’ve hired from across South India, each with an expertise in a certain type of pickle,” she says. Turmeric Mantra has now expanded operations to include a weekly delivery kitchen, using these podis and hand-ground spices in traditional Andhra dishes and delivers them around the city. Dishes come in portions to feed four, and start at Rs. 1,200. The menu changes every week. Last week’s menu included a comforting sweet potato and peanut brinjal gravy, Nellore chappala pulusu with generous pieces of fish, a rich mutton kola urundai korma (spicy gravy with minced mutton balls), and cashew gravy. Every order is accompanied with coconut milk steamed rice. Only dive in, however, if you can really handle that Andhra spice, oil and heat.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A league of his own||Kavin has come a long way since his television appearances in shows like Kana Kaanum Kaalangal and Saravanan Meenatchi . And then came Bigg Boss that changed his life drastically. His quick wit and affable personality made him endearing to the audience. Though he made his debut as a lead star in Natpuna Ennanu Theriyuma (2019), it is the upcoming horror-thriller Lift that is set to kick-start his showbiz career and put him on the map. Directed by Vineeth Varaprasad, the film also stars Amritha Aiyer (of Bigil fame) and follows the duo over the course of a frantic night, as they try desperately to make sense of what is hunting them. Ahead of the film’s release on Disney+ Hotstar, the actor joins us for a chat. Excerpts: Were you a fan of horror fans before you signed Lift ?Any particular films you took inspiration from? Horror is a genre that everyone likes. Right from my childhood, I have memories of watching movies like the Evil Dead franchise back-to-back with my family. Even now, we all go together to watch the Conjuring series. For Lift though, I took inspiration from movies like Pizza and the Hindi film Trapped , both of which follow the story of a guy stuck alone. I also went back to watch Madhavan sir’s performance in Yavarum Nalam , in which he is quite extraordinary. Your journey in Bigg Boss Tamil was filled with drama and quite a bit of controversy. But it earned you an immense fan following. Any regrets at all?  There are no regrets! Like you said, if I have some visibility today and my film has little expectations, it is because of Bigg Boss . In fact, I’m a little surprised and emotional that people remember me so long after the show ended. It makes me feel responsible. I need to focus on doing my work and only that. A film likeLiftis solely riding on you without any supporting cast. Did that put pressure on you?  I am nervous about how Lift will be received. But the horror-thrillers I mentioned before have done really well and resonated with the audience. Also, when the script came my way, I was mindful that this is just my second film and I shouldn’t overthink it: I liked the content and had the belief that if done right, it will work with viewers. Why did you decide to be an assistant director on Sivakarthikeyan’s Doctor ?  I have known Nelson [director] anna for a decade now. Before my acting career, I used to spend all my time at his office. When nothing seemed to be working out for me, it was he who offered me a chance to become an assistant director. Would anyone else have done that? I owe him and Sivakarthikeyan anna [who has sung ‘Inna Mylu’ for Lift ) so much for helping me. You were present at the launch of Nelson and Vijay’s Beast .Are you acting in the film?  This is the truth: I am not part of Beast in any capacity. There were initial talks for me to be involved in it, but then my solo projects took shape, and I began focussing on them instead. However, just like little kids watching planes taking off, it was always my dream to watch the shooting of a big-budget film. I never even imagined that I would get to meet Vijay sir in person. So, whenever possible, I visit the set of Beast to just take in all the sights and sounds.  I am nervous about how Lift will be received. But the horror-thrillers I mentioned before have done really well and resonated with the audience||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-league-of-his-own/article36768219.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s meet in court||It was the summer of 1999. The nation was submerged in the overwhelming din of the cricket World Cup, but two 20-year-olds were patiently scaling hitherto unseen summits in tennis. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi became the first Indian pair to win a Grand Slam title and for the country’s tennis fans long starved of a hero, they got not one, but two — “Lee-Hesh”. It was a moment enough to move even the most incurable of cynics. But nothing prepares you for the Everest-today-abyss-tomorrow motif as well as sport does. As quick as a wink, a glorious present and bright future could become a distant past. For the ‘Indian Express’ that went on to lift two more Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, there was simmering discontent beneath the winning partnership. Since then, much dirty linen has been washed in public, all leading to an unsavoury divorce. At the speed and venom of a perfect ace, Indian tennis was split wide open. It is this split between Paes and Bhupathi that seems to be the focus of Break Point , an upcoming docu-series which traces, over seven episodes, the duo’s partnership on and off-court. Inspiring a generation But both Paes and Bhupathi disagree. “It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built. What it means to be number one in a sport at a time when there was no manual on how it could be achieved,” says Paes, joining Bhupathi in a virtual conversation with The Hindu.   Break Point is helmed by husband-wife filmmaker duo Nitish Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who are co-directing a project for the first time. Bhupathi says the pair was approached on several occasions over the years to tell their story, but it was this director combo that clinched the deal. “It didn’t always come down to the right team, the right narrative or the right platform. But when we heard that Nitish and Ashwiny were interested, obviously with their pedigree, it piqued our interest,” says Bhupathi. From scripting to release, Break Point took one-and-a half years to complete. It involved shooting through the pandemic and multiple lockdowns, and a team working inside a strict bubble. Why a docu-series and not a full-length sports biopic? For Paes, 120 minutes is insufficient to narrate their story of 20 years. “You’ll probably see only one side of it. With Break Point , you’ll see all the highs and lows of our relationship.” Bhupathi believes there is a sort of reality that comes out in a docu-drama. “With us, there has always been this question of ‘what if’ and ‘why’. So we thought it was better to narrate it in first person and clear the air, rather than have someone play us.”  Break Point also features the duo’s families, friends, tennis players and opponents, including Sania Mirza and brothers Bob and Mike Bryan. “Twenty years later, it is so unique to hear their version of our story. It’s not about what’s right or wrong. It’s just about presenting the facts,” adds Paes. But reliving the entire saga and baring it all was disquieting for Bhupathi. “Talking about the highs was easy. Talking about the lows with several cameras and production crew was definitely not ideal for me, but we somehow got it done. Thankfully I had some help at home to deal with all that,” says Bhupathi, who is married to actor and former Miss Universe Lara Dutta. He balks at the prospect of a biopic in the future. “It took us 10 years to get here. Let’s take one step at a time. If there is still buzz around Lee-Hesh, then why not?” Paes on the other hand says he has a lot more to say on his individual journey, his Olympic medal win in 1996, and the relationship with his father Vece Paes, who also won a medal as part of the Indian hockey team at the 1972 Games. “I’m working on a project on those lines...” Mental health The pandemic has spurred the release of several sports docu-dramas that have thrived on streaming platforms. Bhupathi has watched them all: from The Last Dance to The Test . On his list is the recently-released series on his friend and tennis compatriot Mardy Fish, also incidentally titled Untold: Breaking Point.  “Yeah, we had a good laugh about that,” Bhupathi chuckles, but quickly turns serious. “The issue about mental health dealt with in that series is so important. I wish we had that kind of help 20 years ago. We had to deal with a whole lot [of it] all by ourselves. I am jealous of the kids today.” Paes and Bhupathi last played together more than a decade ago. But they have grown closer in the process of making Break Point . “We really didn’t have a proper conversation after 2011. Now we’ve been speaking more frequently, working on this project so intimately and passionately. The bond between us has rejuvenated and hopefully we can keep it going,” says Bhupathi. Paes says he shares a true brotherhood with Bhupathi. “We will have our differences, but we will always be close. I know that if I ever need Mahesh, he’s going to be there, and vice-versa. If you put us on a tennis court today, there will be magic.” Break Point streams on Zee5 from October 1.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Working hard to work out hard||There are two things R Manikandan lives for: the chain of Toneez Fitness Centres he established as a 23-year-old, and bodybuilding. Over the past month, he has been consumed by both. After opening three stores of Toneez Wellness in Chennai and Hyderabad, he is now in Uzbekistan, representing India at the 12th World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship, which begins today. This is the third time he will be taking part in this competition, having won the Mr World title twice: gold in 2017 and silver in 2018. “I want Indians to treat bodybuilding like the challenging sport it is,” says Mani, who will be participating in the above 165 centimetre height category. “You have to dedicate your entire self to it. It’s not just one hour in the gym, bodybuilding means thinking about it from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep. Every meal matters, how much water you drink matters, your sleep matters,” he says. As exciting as it is to represent your country internationally, Mani’s story of how he came to do that is perhaps more fascinating. He discusses it over a video call. “It started about 15 years ago, when I was 15 —” he begins when a phone call interrupts him, blasting the Popeye ringtone. Apropos, for a team of bodybuilders. A pause here and he continues. An early start As a 15-year-old living in Guindy, Mani was bullied in school for being overweight. That led him to hit the local gym, where for the first time, he met men obsessed with sculpting their bodies. “I dropped from 120 kilograms to 70, and entered class XI as a much fitter person. But then I thought why not build muscle too,” he says. Impressed by 25-year-olds at the gym who were also competing on stage, Mani followed suit, registering at a State-level bodybuilding competition. “I placed sixth in the senior category, among bodybuilders with years of experience,” recalls Mani, adding that it gave him the push he needed to train more. “All my heroes, from Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Rock, to my coach, Senthil Kumaran Selvarajan were bodybuilders.” For the next two years, he juggled training and entering competitions with schoolwork and preparing for his Class XII board exams. “My parents did not mind. We are from a poor background and they wouldn’t ask me many questions because I worked my way to pay the gym and registration fees. I would work odd jobs, mostly in small shops and housekeeping in hotels, clean restrooms, and so on,” he says. When he graduated, he became the first in his family to do so, and received a scholarship to pursue higher studies. However, a year into engineering college, he dropped out, to work at a gym instead. “I was working two jobs at the time. One as the housekeeping staff at Le Royal Méridien, Chennai and the other as a trainer at a local gym,” he says. As his bodybuilding skills developed, he was promoted to the position of a gym supervisor at Le Royal Méridien. A chance encounter It was at the hotel gym that Mani met Sriram Vasantharajan, owner of Blade Energy Partners. “He was staying there for three months for a project. He had an ACL tear and was in a knee brace. I offered to help with his strength training and within three months, his knee brace was removed,” says Mani. Before Sriram flew back to the US, where he worked, he met Mani again, asking him what his future plans were. “I said I am training for competitions,” said Mani. “But he asked me what my bigger goal is — I thought about it and replied that it was to train others to be fit too. He suggested I open my own gym, but I laughed it off. I was 21 years old and earning 15,000 a month!” However, Sriram offered to invest in his gym and went on to give him seed money for it. “I quit my job the next day and started looking for places to open a gym. Most places took one look at me, and said, come back with your parents,” he laughs. But with help from Sriram’s friends, he opened the first Toneez branch in Nanganallur in 2015. Once business picked up, he returned to his first passion: competing. In 2017, he won Mr Tamil Nadu, Mr South India and Mr World. The current competition in Uzbekistan will be his third attempt, and he is now especially careful about his lifestyle. “You have to be in shape throughout the year,” he explains, “You have to be disciplined, you can’t train just before the competition. If you train for one year, you can gain two kilograms of quality muscle. For 10 kilograms of muscle to show, you would have to train for five years continuously without spoiling your health. That is why I call it the toughest sport in the world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/working-hard-to-work-out-hard/article36768236.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Get out and play||What happens at a school playground post working hours or on a holiday? Do the sporting equipment and arena just gather dust, waiting for the next day of action? In R Shyam Sundar’s imagination, they come alive with activity, like the many artefacts in popular Hollywood film Night at the Museum , with people lining up to discover the joys of outdoor sports. This was the singular thought he had while founding Shareplay in late 2019, with schoolmate Raghunath RN. Along with a young team, the two have forged partnerships with 11 Chennai campuses, with a solitary goal: Creating neighbourhood sports centres for people. “The idea started off with difficulties that we faced when we wanted to go out as a group and play,” recalls Shyam, “We heard of alumni from schools trying to get access to sporting facilities. Shareplay makes that process easier. The aim is not to create sporting champions, but rather to provide an environment where everyone plays.” Badminton and table tennis are among the most in-demand sports among patrons currently. Educational institutions were more than eager to come on board, because this was beyond working hours and meant extra revenue, which in turn helps in the upkeep of the facilities. “It also helps the schools project a sports-friendly image as opposed to being a purely academic-oriented institution,” chips in Raghunath. Part of their programme is a concept called All Play, which is currently present in five city campuses and encourages children to get their feet up and running. “Usually, kids are either very serious about a sport or have nothing to do with it. This concept encourages them to try their hand at multiple sports in one venue, like the one at DAV Gopalapuram. Parents are also encouraged to participate,” adds Raghunath. Currently open in seven city neighbourhoods including Mogappair and Choolaimedu, Shareplay is planning to add 25 localities by the end of the year, including Adyar and Nungambakkam. The team has more plans, like launching a trail park to give runners an experience close to Nature, and golf ranges so that people who are not members of clubs can try out the sport too. “The aim is to reduce entry barriers and develop an accessible sports ecosystem.”  Kicking off… Shareplay, in association with Great Goals, is hosting a football festival at Nathella Vidhyodaya (Ambattur) this Saturday, open to children under the age of 11. Next weekend, the festival will take place in Primrose School, Injambakkam.

The late chairman Neelakanta Rao Jagdale of Bengaluru-based Amrut Distilleries was holidaying in Udhagamandalam when he thought of creating a distilled gin using botanicals and spices from South India. After a visit to the Government Medicinal Plant Development Area at Doddabetta, he learnt about the medicinal plants used for therapeutic oils. Amrut’s Nilgiris gin launched in December 2020 is now available in the US, UK, Europe and Singapore. “Our whiskeys are already available in 58 countries. We want to grow further. We are working on new gins with Indian botanicals that highlight the variety of flavours that our country is known for. We are doing trials now to finalise the recipe,” says Nikhil Varma, gin distiller for Amrut. While the Nilgiris gin came with a bouquet of 10 botanicals including juniper berries, coriander seeds, lemongrass, angelica roots, orris roots, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, Nilgiris tea and paan (betel leaves), the new gins will also have unique botanicals and interesting flavour profiles. Nikhil says the Nilgiris mountain range has a vast area dedicated to tea plantations, its tea, which represents the hills was the first choice. “Nilgiris tea gives the floral, yet complex muskiness that stands out. I distilled some green tea and black tea varieties before choosing the right one that has a bit of dryness, florals, and a hint of spices. It adds an extra dimension. We have used Italian juniper berries, a primary botanical with all-purpose flavours of pine, lavender, rose, and citrus. Coriander seeds, a floral spice, complements the soft citrus of juniper and I explored lemon grass to bring the zesty note,” says Nikhil. The last botanical came in the form of betel leaves: the spicy and floral variety from Mysuru and the juicy, sweet variety from Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-nilgiris-as-a-sundowner/article36768243.ece

They will now fill the journals with their memories of games from their childhood and send it back to Vinita after eight months. “The Travelling Journal is an effort to capture people’s experiences in playing traditional games. It is not merely enough to revive the games, which we have been doing, but also to understand the spirit in which they were played,” says Vinita. Vinita, who founded the Chennai-based toy company in 2002, and has been researching, developing and reviving traditional Indian games, explains that the journal will travel from person to person allowing them to document their recollections in writing, painting, sketching, or in any other form. She recalls a query from a contact in the US who wanted to share it with a Native American grandmother. “I was thrilled at the thought of learning about the games they played.” Another person from New Zealand has also requested to be allowed to share the journal with a Maori.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||There’s bael in my vodka||Kokum mocktails, bael cocktails, Darjeeling tea coolers and chikoo -flavoured beer now jostle for space on Indian bar and dining menus. Drinks that hero indigenous ingredients are this year’s fastest growing trend, fuelled by a rising interest in regional produce combined with a pandemic-induced hankering for comforting childhood flavours. So bael ka sharbat now has a chic new avatar, as a bael cocktail at Sidecar in Delhi. It is a whiskey or vodka-based alcoholic drink with bael shrub. The inky blue pea flower, which grows wild in parts of India, has found its way into everything from tea to gin-based cocktails. And the Indian olive, or jalpai , infused iced tea has become an epicurean trend for cafe hopping Instagrammers in Imphal, Manipur. Eli Yambem of Manipur-based Dweller Teas says that well-travelled Indians, after experiencing a world of exotic flavours, are now looking for drinks that are both fresh and familiar. He says, “While regional cuisines are a hit, regional drinks too shouldn’t be overlooked. With the drying and preserving techniques that the F&B industry now uses, shelf lives of many seasonal fruits can be extended. The Indian olive, a sour fruit mostly found in the Northeast and in some parts of East and West Bengal for instance, is a highly perishable fruit, and is not well-known. I dried them to make a herbal infusion with roselle and the peel of a locally available lemon. The infusion has a lovely reddish hue and a delicious fragrance.” The Indian olive, like peach, is a stone fruit have a mild spicy fragrance and is extremely sour, which is why it works for Eli’s concoction. Eli adds that besides the drinks, his health-concious younger customers in particular, “want good food that also appeals to the eye and taste buds”. Japtej Ahulwalia and his team of barmen at Origins, a Chennai-based speciality bar, have moved away from artificial syrups and adopted many techniques to turn fresh seasonal fruits into syrups. In some cases they even use flowers like marigold, blue pea, elder flower and lavender, in their cocktails like No Name Cocktail, Black Forest Spritzer . Japtej says, “The end result is appealing both visually and on the palate. Synthetic flavours overshadow the liquor, because of the sweet content and added fragrances. That way, it becomes easy to cheat with cheap liqour in cocktails. We at Origins want cocktail and mocktail lovers to savour not only flavours of the additives, but of the liquor as well.” The other bar in Chennai that makes use of flavours derived from fresh fruits in their drinks is the bar at Novotel called KooX. Meanwhile Maharastra-based Priyanka Save runs Fruzzante, a brand of alco-beverage made from chikoo (Sapodilla) extracts. Being a farmer’s daughter, Priyanka says she knows the highly perishable chikoo like the back of her hand. “With my wine enthusiast husband Nagesh, I decided to overturn the depleted chikoo market after extensive experiments, extraction, fermentation, storage and packaging,” she says. After several trials with by-products, she realised that it is in the nature ofchikooto ferment. “From thereon, I decided to go with a cider-style beverage; that also allowed me to revive tradition and give consumers a chance to appreciate local spirits,” she says. Award-winning mixologist Yangdup Lama, founder of Delhi-based Sidecar, agrees with Priyanka. Now experimenting with fermented millet juice in cocktails, he says, “I take pride in experimenting with locally appreciated flavours. Consumers don’t want to simply gulp down something colourful and sweet anymore. They think of the aroma and taste notes. They want to try new Indian ingredients; it could be a flower or a spice.” Yangdup adds that “the well-travelled — whether in real time or through social media — are always looking at learning to taste and experience something new. I use a lot of vetiver, rhododendron flowers, Darjeeling tea, herbs and chillies to give that experience. Since there is a natural inquisitiveness to try new flavours, it becomes our responsibility to combine regional flavours, whether fruits, herbs and spice, to narrate an exciting story of the place it comes from.” One of the most popular local flavours now is the gondhoraj lebu , a highly scented lemon from West Bengal, with the kick of king chilli ( bhoot jolokia from Northeast India) in close pursuit. However, it is not just unfamiliar ingredients that are being appreciated; people are also redicovering familiar flavours. Nannari , a herbal drink made from the herb roots of the Nannari tree with origins in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, is increasingly finding its place on the menu across southern India. Leaning on childhood memories, Subhasish Borah and Bidisha of Kohuwa Collective a collaborative space and slow food cafe in Guwahati recently introduced thekera sorbot ( kokum sherbet), teteli sorbot (tamarind sherbet) and ou tenga sorbot (elephant apple sherbet). Subhasish says “As a slow food cafe, Bidisha and I wanted to bring back regional drinks. Assamese thekera sorbot is different from the ones made in the coastal region. The kokum found in Assam is kuji thekera which belongs to the garcinia family. We decided to make a drink with elephant apple because we wanted to introduce the unique flavour of this fruit, which is otherwise used as souring agent in curries, in a more versatile manner.” Ankita Sehgal, founder of Jeeru, a Madhya Pradesh-based bottled carbonbated drink, feels that even jeera (cumin) flavoured bottled drinks are slowly gaining popularity. Ankita says, “It has a huge potential as a mocktail mix. Its popularity could be because jeera -flavoured drinks pairs well with all Indian cuisine.” After all, you can’t go wrong when banking on the flavours of the land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/theres-bael-in-my-vodka/article36768244.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The man behind the #ValimaiUpdate||What connects former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edapaddi Palanisamy and England cricketer Moeen Ali? Both have been asked Valimai updates in recent times. Starved of news about Thala Ajith Kumar’s upcoming Tamil biggie from its makers, fans of the actor have been posing the question to people from different walks of life. Naturally, “ Valimai update” became a viral trend. So much so that it forced the makers to issue statements, and finally, post the update itself… with official posters and the recently-released teaser — fans seem to be satiated. Heaving a sigh of relief and happy with the response is producer Boney Kapoor, the man in demand among Ajith fans, considering the elusive nature of the star. In a telephonic interview from Mumbai, the producer shares the latest on the film: How have reactions been to the recently-released teaser video? It has been extraordinary. It shows the effort put in by Ajith, Karthikeya, director H Vinoth, and the entire stunt team. How did the team go about shooting the bike stunt sequences, which many say will be a highlight? We waited for over a year to shoot this six-day-long sequence. Ajith was most excited about it, and we did not want to compromise on its quality. We roped in one of the best stunt teams from Russia, and shot the sequence in a place 300 miles from Moscow. Many locals from that little town came along to greet Ajith on the set! As a producer, what went through your mind when so many people were asking about updates? Fans are well within their rights to ask for updates, because they love Ajith a lot. I did not want to mislead them. I wanted to give out material only when there was something concrete at hand. While most of the portions were shot over a year back, we had to patiently wait to complete this crucial sequence. I have always been a directors’ producer. If I have confidence in the director, like I do with Vinoth, I will ensure that the vision is fulfilled. What gave you that confidence in Vinoth, who is relatively new to the industry? His work will talk. He believes in expressing himself through his films. It was Ajith who sent Vinoth to my Mumbai residence to narrate some film ideas a few years back. I remember my wife [the late actor Sridevi] conversing with him in Tamil, and being impressed with his story lines. His vision was clear, and ours has been a happy journey. In fact, my next film will also be with Ajith and Vinoth. As a person producing films since the ‘80s, what do you think is unique about Ajith? Less is more is an adage that fits him well. He never believes in public appearances. This means that the appetite of audiences is never fully fulfilled. We hear you came to Chennai for the first day first show of Ajith’s hit Viswasam (2019) … I have never seen or experienced something like that before. There were thousands of people waiting outside the theatre well past midnight, to try to watch the first show. There were thousands waiting for the next show as well. There are chances of Vijay’s Beast also being released for Pongal 2022. If that happens, two of the biggest stars of Tamil cinema, will clash at the box office. Your thoughts? Well, if it does, Pongal will get brighter for the fans of both stars.  A field day Apart from Valimai , Boney Kapoor also has his hands full with Hindi sports drama Maidaan . Starring Ajay Devgn as a football coach, the film will, in Boney’s words, ‘chronicle the golden period of Indian football that many have forgotten’. He says, “We put up an entire set to shoot the important football matches, but we had to cancel the shoot thrice due to the pandemic and a cyclone. We are in the process of rebuilding that set, and will kickstart shoot in October.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-man-behind-the-valimaiupdate/article36768248.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s meet in court||It was the summer of 1999. The nation was submerged in the overwhelming din of the cricket World Cup, but two 20-year-olds were patiently scaling hitherto unseen summits in tennis. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi became the first Indian pair to win a Grand Slam title and for the country’s tennis fans long starved of a hero, they got not one, but two — “Lee-Hesh”. It was a moment enough to move even the most incurable of cynics. But nothing prepares you for the Everest-today-abyss-tomorrow motif as well as sport does. As quick as a wink, a glorious present and bright future could become a distant past. For the ‘Indian Express’ that went on to lift two more Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, there was simmering discontent beneath the winning partnership. Since then, much dirty linen has been washed in public, all leading to an unsavoury divorce. At the speed and venom of a perfect ace, Indian tennis was split wide open. It is this split between Paes and Bhupathi that seems to be the focus of Break Point , an upcoming docu-series which traces, over seven episodes, the duo’s partnership on and off-court. Inspiring a generation But both Paes and Bhupathi disagree. “It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built. What it means to be number one in a sport at a time when there was no manual on how it could be achieved,” says Paes, joining Bhupathi in a virtual conversation with The Hindu.   Break Point is helmed by husband-wife filmmaker duo Nitish Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who are co-directing a project for the first time. Bhupathi says the pair was approached on several occasions over the years to tell their story, but it was this director combo that clinched the deal. “It didn’t always come down to the right team, the right narrative or the right platform. But when we heard that Nitish and Ashwiny were interested, obviously with their pedigree, it piqued our interest,” says Bhupathi. From scripting to release, Break Point took one-and-a half years to complete. It involved shooting through the pandemic and multiple lockdowns, and a team working inside a strict bubble. Why a docu-series and not a full-length sports biopic? For Paes, 120 minutes is insufficient to narrate their story of 20 years. “You’ll probably see only one side of it. With Break Point , you’ll see all the highs and lows of our relationship.” Bhupathi believes there is a sort of reality that comes out in a docu-drama. “With us, there has always been this question of ‘what if’ and ‘why’. So we thought it was better to narrate it in first person and clear the air, rather than have someone play us.”  Break Point also features the duo’s families, friends, tennis players and opponents, including Sania Mirza and brothers Bob and Mike Bryan. “Twenty years later, it is so unique to hear their version of our story. It’s not about what’s right or wrong. It’s just about presenting the facts,” adds Paes. But reliving the entire saga and baring it all was disquieting for Bhupathi. “Talking about the highs was easy. Talking about the lows with several cameras and production crew was definitely not ideal for me, but we somehow got it done. Thankfully I had some help at home to deal with all that,” says Bhupathi, who is married to actor and former Miss Universe Lara Dutta. He balks at the prospect of a biopic in the future. “It took us 10 years to get here. Let’s take one step at a time. If there is still buzz around Lee-Hesh, then why not?” Paes on the other hand says he has a lot more to say on his individual journey, his Olympic medal win in 1996, and the relationship with his father Vece Paes, who also won a medal as part of the Indian hockey team at the 1972 Games. “I’m working on a project on those lines...” Mental health The pandemic has spurred the release of several sports docu-dramas that have thrived on streaming platforms. Bhupathi has watched them all: from The Last Dance to The Test . On his list is the recently-released series on his friend and tennis compatriot Mardy Fish, also incidentally titled Untold: Breaking Point.  “Yeah, we had a good laugh about that,” Bhupathi chuckles, but quickly turns serious. “The issue about mental health dealt with in that series is so important. I wish we had that kind of help 20 years ago. We had to deal with a whole lot [of it] all by ourselves. I am jealous of the kids today.” Paes and Bhupathi last played together more than a decade ago. But they have grown closer in the process of making Break Point . “We really didn’t have a proper conversation after 2011. Now we’ve been speaking more frequently, working on this project so intimately and passionately. The bond between us has rejuvenated and hopefully we can keep it going,” says Bhupathi. Paes says he shares a true brotherhood with Bhupathi. “We will have our differences, but we will always be close. I know that if I ever need Mahesh, he’s going to be there, and vice-versa. If you put us on a tennis court today, there will be magic.” Break Point streams on Zee5 from October 1.   It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Who are men to empower women?||AR Rahman does not stop working. Among a slew of upcoming projects such as Cobra, Atrangi Re, Ayalaan, Heropanti 2 and Ponniyin Selvan , the composer has also collaborated with Expo 2020 Dubai to conceptualise a state-of-the-art music recording studio in the UAE, and pioneer an all-women ensemble of musicians: The Firdaus Women’s Orchestra. The initiative brings together 50 talented women from across the UAE and wider MENA region to create a unique musical project, mentored by Rahman. The Oscar winner will be part of concerts with the orchestra at Expo 2020 Dubai, during which his compositions will be featured on stage. Described as a fusion of styles and genres, the ensemble comprises women of 23 nationalities, between the ages of 16 and 51, with Yasmina Sabbah as its conductor. Their music will draw on inspiration from the UAE region’s traditions, with instruments such as the oud, rebaba and darbuka. Ahead of the Expo on October 1, Rahman, talks to us from Dubai on this project. You have always stated that you gain more when you mentor someone; is that your motive being part of this initiative? For me, teaching has always been about learning; when you give, you get. The world is in a very divisive place at the moment, and people are always going to fear what they don’t understand. So when this whole idea came up, it was such a great opportunity to get all these women from different nationalities to work together and create something beautiful. People watching them will also be from various parts of the world. From Syria and Lebanon to Oman and Armenia, this idea will hopefully be a culmination point for people to play music together, foster bonds and create understanding. What is different about collaborating with musicians from other cultures, outside India?  It’s been three months so far of rehearsals, and we are also building a studio. I feel in Dubai, everything revolves around progress. It’s a place where I see bikinis and burqas together in hotels; everything is so open and free. It’s a place that embraces everything and everyone, and lets them shine. The orchestra, of course, is all about the talent and expression. There’s quality and commitment to their vision, and coming from India, I feel honoured that I’ve been asked to mentor this initiative. Our first concert is on October 23. The word ‘Firdaus’ means something akin to a ‘garden of paradise’. Why did you choose this name for the orchestra?  In the philosophical context, music has different connotations in different cultures. In some, they refer to it as the unspoken language of God. In others, they say music takes you to a different realm. I wanted to remind everyone that there is a sense of everything coming to us from the creator. It’s also an ode to our mothers in a way; for the sons, it is claimed that paradise is found at the feet of their mother. Finally, it is also meant to bring about a special — not religious — connection; all these women are from different faiths but it is humanity that connects the soul. The term Firdaus seemed complementary to that ideology. You have batted to empower women, be it refusing to use sexist lyrics, or sticking up for your daughter’s viral post last year on her choice of clothing. Is this ensemble an extension of that ideology?  I have to say, kudos to Khatija! Now, we are all wearing burqas in a way with our masks, aren’t we? There is so much freedom; I can walk anywhere and nobody recognises me. Guess she proved a point to everyone after all ( laughs ). As for your question, well, who are men to empower women, first of all? Women don’t need us; they empower themselves. They are world leaders and heads of states today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/who-are-men-to-empower-women/article36768253.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Nilgiris as a sundowner||The story of this Indian gin begins in the Nilgiris, five years ago. The late chairman and managing director Neelakanta Rao Jagdale of Bengaluru-based Amrut Distilleries was holidaying at his summer home in Udhagamandalam when he thought of creating a distilled gin using botanicals and spices from South India. After a visit to the Government Medicinal Plant Development Area at Doddabetta, the highest mountain range in the South, he learnt about the medicinal plants used to manufacture therapeutic oils. “He made multiple trips to the Nilgiris, especially to the Ooty Botanical Garden,” recalls Nikhil Varma, gin distiller and brand ambassador for Amrut. Amrut’s Nilgiris gin launched in December 2020 is now available in the US, UK, Europe and Singapore. And, there are expansion plans on the cards in India and overseas. “Our whiskeys are available in 58 countries. We want to grow further. We are working on new gins with Indian botanicals that highlight the variety of flavours that our country is known for. We are trialling it now to finalise the recipe,” Nikhil adds. While the Nilgiris gin came with a bouquet of 10 botanicals including juniper berries, coriander seeds, lemongrass, angelica roots, orris roots, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, Nilgiris tea and paan (betel leaves), the new gins will also have unique botanicals and interesting flavour profiles. Nikhil explains that as the Nilgiris mountain range has a vast area dedicated to tea plantations, its tea, which represents the hills was the first choice. “A variety of Indian spices grown here offer a range of botanicals with indigenous flavour properties,” explains Nikhil who added that he foraged a wide range of botanicals and distilled them individually or as a compound recipe. “Nilgiris tea gives the floral, yet complex muskiness that stand out. I distilled some green tea and black tea varieties before choosing the right one that has a bit of dryness, florals, and a hint of spices. It adds an extra dimension. We have used Italian juniper berries, a primary botanical with all-purpose flavours of pine, lavender, rose, and citrus which is tasty. Coriander seeds, a floral spice complements the soft citrus of juniper and I explored lemon grass to bring the zesty note.” The other three primary spices are mace, nutmeg and cinnamon. “The slight dryness of mace accentuates the punch of nutmeg and the earthy cinnamon. The two fixatives — orris root gives a dry grass smell and lets other botanicals shine through while the angelica root creates a woody, ‘wet forest’ kind of smell.” For Nikhil, visiting the spice plantations and tea estates of the Nilgiris was a unique experience. “In mint, there is spearmint, peppermint, basil and a whole variety of herbs and spices that I explored in Ooty. And, chillies too. We created a library of botanicals, individual flavour profiles and flavour groups like spicy gin and floral gin, to name a few.” The last botanical came in the form of betel leaves: the spicy and floral variety from Mysuru and the juicy, sweet variety from Kubakonam in Tamil Nadu. Says Nikhil, “Way back in 2015, there were literally no Indian gins. Now, there are more than a dozen Indian gins and we are growing. Every brand brings its own story and creativity. Home-grown brands are challenging other global brands across the world. Now, Nilgiris gin is available in European countries. To represent India is a big thing.” Amrut’s botanical-based distilled gin is currently available in Goa and Karnataka, and will soon be available in Maharashtra and Haryana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-nilgiris-as-a-sundowner/article36768252.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A league of his own||Kavin has come a long way since his television appearances in shows like Kana Kaanum Kaalangal and Saravanan Meenatchi . And then came Bigg Boss that changed his life drastically. His quick wit and affable personality endeared him to the audience. His upcoming horror-thriller Lift that is set to kick-start his showbiz career. Directed by Vineeth Varaprasad, the film also stars Amritha Aiyer (of Bigil fame) and follows the duo over the course of a frantic night, as they desperately try to make sense of what is hunting them. Ahead of the film’s release on Disney+ Hotstar, the actor joins us for a chat. Excerpts: Were you a fan of horror fans before you signed Lift ? Horror is a genre that everyone likes. I have memories of watching movies like the Evil Dead franchise back-to-back with my family. Even now, we all go together to watch the Conjuring series. I took inspiration from movies like Pizza and the Hindi film Trapped , both of which follow the story of a guy stuck alone. I also watched Madhavan sir’s extraordinary performance in Yavarum Nalam.   A film likeLiftis solely riding on you Did that put pressure on you? I am nervous about how Lift will be received. I liked the content and had the belief that if done right, it will work with viewers. Why did you decide to be an assistant director on Sivakarthikeyan’s Doctor ?  I have known Nelson [director] anna for a decade now. When nothing seemed to be working out for me, he offered me a chance to become an assistant director. Would anyone else have done that? I owe him and Sivakarthikeyan anna [who has sung ‘Inna Mylu’ for Lift ) for helping me. You were present at the launch of Nelson and Vijay’s Beast .Are you acting in the film? This is the truth: I am not part of Beast in any capacity. I never even imagined that I would get to meet Vijay sir in person. So, whenever possible, I visit the set of Beast to just take in all the sights and sounds.  I am nervous about how Lift will be received. But the horror-thrillers I mentioned before have done really well and resonated with the audience||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-league-of-his-own/article36768255.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A slice of Kerala in Coimbatore||His classroom is a melting pot of cultures and friendships. E C Sabu has been teaching Malayalam for three decades in the city to a mixed bag of students including advocates, Tamil professors, doctors, homemakers, and teachers who speak Marathi, Konkani, Telugu, Kannada or Urdu. Sabu was awarded the ‘Panditha Sresta Award’ for his service in the education sector by the World Malayalee Council, Coimbatore Province.“It is a recognition of his service to establishing a cultural connect with Kerala,” says C Radhakrishnan, secretary of the council. “I joined CMS School in Coimbatore as a Malayalam teacher in 1990 and, from then on, I have been a part of the seven-month certificate course conducted by the Coimbatore Malayalam Samajam,” adds Sabu who is now principal-in-charge of CMS Higher Secondary School. The two-hour classes conducted over weekends reaches out to a variety of people as there is no age limit. “Every year, we are punctual with the classes. A number of non-native speakers attend to understand Kerala’s art and culture, its landscape, people and literature. There are professionals who learn it for business purposes,” says president of CMS, K Rajagopalan. Sabu’s teaching method begins with easy letters for the first three months and then covers forms, sentences, grammar and translation. One of his students, a Tamil professor, now translates celebrated Malayalam writer Vaikom Mohammed Basheer’s works in Tamil. Another student N Deepa Saravanan, assistant professor of Tamil at Ramakrishna College (Women), is geared up to launch her Tamil book Kader Kaalam , a translation of Malayalam short stories. She joined the course while doing her PhD on comparative literature on the works of Tamil writer Nanjil Nadan and Malayalam writer CV Balakrishnan. “Sabu Sir’s dedication and love for the language pushes us to work hard. We read Malayalam newspapers regularly to improve our vocabulary. ” There are others who join the course after watching Malayalam films or reading Tamil translations of the works of Malayalam literary figures like Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, MT Vasudevan Nair, ONV Kurup, and Basheer. Coimbatore District Collector Dr G S Sameeran who handed the award to E C Sabu says learning any new language gives an opportunity to connect with culture.“There is cultural continuum between North Kerala and this region. Though people here speak Malayalam, they don’t know to read and write. Sabu has helped people to academically learn the language, which is an achievement.” He adds, “There are great writers on both sides of the ghats. One has to read Basheer, Jeymohan, Kalki... it will help connect the dots.” C lasses were discontinued during the pandemic but will resume this year.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||There’s bael in my vodka||Kokum mocktails, bael cocktails, Darjeeling tea coolers and chikoo -flavoured beer now jostle for space on Indian bar and dining menus. Drinks that hero indigenous ingredients are this year’s fastest growing trend, fuelled by a rising interest in regional produce combined with a pandemic-induced hankering for comforting childhood flavours. So bael ka sharbat now has a chic new avatar, as a bael cocktail at Sidecar in Delhi. It is a whiskey or vodka-based alcoholic drink with bael shrub. The inky blue pea flower, which grows wild in parts of India, has found its way into everything from tea to gin-based cocktails. And the Indian olive, or jalpai , infused iced tea has become an epicurean trend for cafe hopping Instagrammers in Imphal, Manipur. Eli Yambem of Manipur-based Dweller Teas says that well-travelled Indians, after experiencing a world of exotic flavours, are now looking for drinks that are both fresh and familiar. He says, “While regional cuisines are a hit, regional drinks too shouldn’t be overlooked. With the drying and preserving techniques that the F&B industry now uses, shelf lives of many seasonal fruits can be extended. The Indian olive, a sour fruit mostly found in the Northeast and in some parts of East and West Bengal for instance, is a highly perishable fruit, and is not well-known. I dried them to make a herbal infusion with roselle and the peel of a locally available lemon. The infusion has a lovely reddish hue and a delicious fragrance.” The Indian olive, like peach, is a stone fruit have a mild spicy fragrance and is extremely sour, which is why it works for Eli’s concoction. Eli adds that besides the drinks, his health-concious younger customers in particular, “want good food that also appeals to the eye and taste buds”. Japtej Ahulwalia and his team of barmen at Origins, a Chennai-based speciality bar, have moved away from artificial syrups and adopted many techniques to turn fresh seasonal fruits into syrups. In some cases they even use flowers like marigold, blue pea, elder flower and lavender, in their cocktails like No Name Cocktail, Black Forest Spritzer . Japtej says, “The end result is appealing both visually and on the palate. Synthetic flavours overshadow the liquor, because of the sweet content and added fragrances. That way, it becomes easy to cheat with cheap liqour in cocktails. We at Origins want cocktail and mocktail lovers to savour not only flavours of the additives, but of the liquor as well.” The other bar in Chennai that makes use of flavours derived from fresh fruits in their drinks is the bar at Novotel called KooX. Meanwhile Maharastra-based Priyanka Save runs Fruzzante, a brand of alco-beverage made from chikoo (Sapodilla) extracts. Being a farmer’s daughter, Priyanka says she knows the highly perishable chikoo like the back of her hand. “With my wine enthusiast husband Nagesh, I decided to overturn the depleted chikoo market after extensive experiments, extraction, fermentation, storage and packaging,” she says. After several trials with by-products, she realised that it is in the nature ofchikooto ferment. “From thereon, I decided to go with a cider-style beverage; that also allowed me to revive tradition and give consumers a chance to appreciate local spirits,” she says. Award-winning mixologist Yangdup Lama, founder of Delhi-based Sidecar, agrees with Priyanka. Now experimenting with fermented millet juice in cocktails, he says, “I take pride in experimenting with locally appreciated flavours. Consumers don’t want to simply gulp down something colourful and sweet anymore. They think of the aroma and taste notes. They want to try new Indian ingredients; it could be a flower or a spice.” Yangdup adds that “the well-travelled — whether in real time or through social media — are always looking at learning to taste and experience something new. I use a lot of vetiver, rhododendron flowers, Darjeeling tea, herbs and chillies to give that experience. Since there is a natural inquisitiveness to try new flavours, it becomes our responsibility to combine regional flavours, whether fruits, herbs and spice, to narrate an exciting story of the place it comes from.” One of the most popular local flavours now is the gondhoraj lebu , a highly scented lemon from West Bengal, with the kick of king chilli ( bhoot jolokia from Northeast India) in close pursuit. However, it is not just unfamiliar ingredients that are being appreciated; people are also redicovering familiar flavours. Nannari , a herbal drink made from the herb roots of the Nannari tree with origins in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, is increasingly finding its place on the menu across southern India. Leaning on childhood memories, Subhasish Borah and Bidisha of Kohuwa Collective a collaborative space and slow food cafe in Guwahati recently introduced thekera sorbot ( kokum sherbet), teteli sorbot (tamarind sherbet) and ou tenga sorbot (elephant apple sherbet). Subhasish says “As a slow food cafe, Bidisha and I wanted to bring back regional drinks. Assamese thekera sorbot is different from the ones made in the coastal region. The kokum found in Assam is kuji thekera which belongs to the garcinia family. We decided to make a drink with elephant apple because we wanted to introduce the unique flavour of this fruit, which is otherwise used as souring agent in curries, in a more versatile manner.” Ankita Sehgal, founder of Jeeru, a Madhya Pradesh-based bottled carbonbated drink, feels that even jeera (cumin) flavoured bottled drinks are slowly gaining popularity. Ankita says, “It has a huge potential as a mocktail mix. Its popularity could be because jeera -flavoured drinks pairs well with all Indian cuisine.” After all, you can’t go wrong when banking on the flavours of the land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/theres-bael-in-my-vodka/article36768254.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the rap battles begin||A regular alfresco Sunday dinner at Bounce in Kompally transformed into an electrifying evening when The Deccan Hype Vol 1 took the stage. Diners were pleasantly surprised to see 15 artistes, two emcees, one DJ, and a range of rap battles such as Pass The Mic command the open entertainment space. After months of continual lockdowns, this high-octane energy was just what local artistes in Hyderabad had been waiting for. As rappers challenged each other in the true tradition of Pass the Mic, the scene changed rapidly with the curious, appreciative crowd adding to the synergy. “They are going to rap in Telugu”, exclaimed a lady. A teenager yelled, asking for hip hop, while another boy begged his parents to wait so he could watch performers beatbox. As the artistes cheered each other on; the enthusiastic crowd spurred some artistes to perform a few of their unreleased tracks. The vibe that evening indicates that the music scene in Hyderabad is opening up for local artistes who don’t do just covers. A few years ago, with no platform, the same artistes would meet up on Necklace Road and perform for each other, and a handful of curious onlookers and passers-by. Discussing the growing audiences, Pramod Seshu, a member of Nawab Gang, a leading group of rappers, says, “Earlier we could not have thought of a gathering like this. We have two categories of audience — live and those who follow us online. While our online presence is strong, our live audience was not. This year, surprisingly, we have shows where people have come up to us, appreciating our lyrics and also admitting they had looked away from this music earlier. We are now invited to perform live sets at clubs and spaces we could not have imagined earlier; the entire community of rap and hip-hop artistes is overwhelmed!” ‘Promote our own talent’ Aside from Bounce Kompally, spaces such as Posh Nosh, Tabula Rasa and Moonshine Project (all in Jubilee Hills) have been actively promoting ‘make in Hyderabad’ events. Ritesh Thodupunuri, a partner at Bounce says, “We have the artistes, we have the talent, so why look elsewhere. This genre of music is different but there is nothing negative about it. The artistes highlight a lot of issues around us. Even as they perform a live set in an open space, a few of them stress on wearing masks and staying safe. It is all about changing perceptions and offering the audience something new to appreciate.” A couple of female artistes who took the stage at the event included rapper Sherni and hip-hop dancer Chandini Seth. Having given her first performance there, Chandni looks forward to performing more often. Does Hyderabad’s warming up to rap have anything to do with the ‘OMG Daddy’ song in a blockbuster Telugu film? Popular Telugu rapper Feroz Israel says that Ala Vaikanthupuram cannot be entirely credited for it. “If movies introduced rap to Hyderabad, then Prabhu Deva’s Premikudu (1994) with ‘Petta Rap’ should get the credit. To say movies do not contribute would be wrong; they definitely help listeners relate to and identify with what we do.” Feroze recalls an event at Tabula Rasa where someone in the audience thanked him for opening his mind to ‘this music.’ A popular emcee, hip-hop artiste, rapper, live looper and beatboxer, Rahul Deval feels it is the quality of content that is making heads turn to this genre. Events like Cypher help and the change of platforms from rooftops to venues can be attributed to this current musical trend, he believes. Rahul says, “We probably started out when Hyderabad was not ready for this music. I remember having to give demos at clubs. Music lovers are warming up to a whole range of genres and hip-hop is definitely one of them.” The strong community of hip hop artistes in Hyderabad recently held a fundraiser for a fellow artiste called Mutant who requires regular dialysis due to his spina bifida condition. When 21-year old Mutant is carried on to the stage to perform, his energy and style makes anyone’s head bob. Pramod shares, “The immense response to support him made us proud of our music and community.”  Aside from Bounce Kompally, Hyderabad spaces such as Posh Nosh, Tabula Rasa and Moonshine Project (all in Jubilee Hills) have been actively promoting ‘make in Hyderabad’ events||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/let-the-rap-battles-begin/article36768269.ece

He can spin together everything from a creamy firecracker to a pull-up cake. And for extra impact, opt for chocolate and butterscotch macaron. Though trained in culinary management from New Zealand, Ashmeet bakes out of his interest and spent a considerable amount of time, teaching and practising before launching his brand Xocolatl during the lockdown last year. As a baker who enjoys creating eye-popping cakes and desserts, he is constantly experimenting. His latest project is a baklava cake (made with filo pastry sheets). Xocolatl also claims to have brought the globally trending ‘pull-up’ cake to Hyderabad. Ashmeet says it is a hit as a children's birthday cake. Except for the macaroon, most of the cakes at Xocolatl are eggless. They have close to 16 varieties of flavours to offer and the price for a basic cake starts at Rs. 1800. Since the cakes come with a lot of frills, Xocolatl also makes sure they take care of delivery.  Contact: @xocolatl_hyd on Instagram 9966622449    The chiffon frosting on Sumaiyah Syed’s cake is the proverbial icing on the cake: her portfolio under the brand name Cremecristaux is a happy fusion of ‘classic meets the trending bakes’. Sumaiyah’s pop cakes are popular for children’s birthday parties. Her cherry and dark chocolate cake, a seasonal delight, is a must-order during the cherry season. For special orders, she also makes a trifle with creamy vanilla custard and pound cakes with blueberry jam and exotic fruits. A no-occasion treat is the lemon vanilla cake roll with cherry filling. Sumaiyah is a self-taught baker who runs the business by herself, and was pleasantly delighted when family and close friends started coaxing to cater to orders. With the strawberry on its way do make sure to try the strawberry rush. Sumaiyah prefers a heads-up of at least four days for her orders. If the order is large a week in advance will make her happier. Cremecristaux takes both individual orders and custom-made hamper orders on Instagram.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s meet in court||It was the summer of 1999. The nation was submerged in the overwhelming din of the cricket World Cup, but two 20-year-olds were patiently scaling hitherto unseen summits in tennis. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi became the first Indian pair to win a Grand Slam title and for the country’s tennis fans long starved of a hero, they got not one, but two — “Lee-Hesh”. It was a moment enough to move even the most incurable of cynics. But nothing prepares you for the Everest-today-abyss-tomorrow motif as well as sport does. For the ‘Indian Express’ that went on to lift two more Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, there was simmering discontent beneath the winning partnership. Since then, much dirty linen has been washed in public, all leading to an unsavoury divorce. At the speed and venom of a perfect ace, Indian tennis was split wide open. It is this split between Paes and Bhupathi that seems to be the focus of Break Point , an upcoming docu-series which traces, over seven episodes, the duo’s partnership on and off-court. Inspiring a generation But both Paes and Bhupathi disagree. “It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built. What it means to be number one in a sport at a time when there was no manual on how it could be achieved,” says Paes, joining Bhupathi in a virtual conversation with The Hindu.   Break Point is helmed by husband-wife filmmaker duo Nitish Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who are co-directing a project for the first time. Bhupathi says the pair was approached on several occasions over the years to tell their story, but it was this director combo that clinched the deal. “It didn’t always come down to the right team, the right narrative or the right platform. But when we heard that Nitish and Ashwiny were interested, obviously with their pedigree, it piqued our interest,” says Bhupathi. From scripting to release, Break Point took one-and-a half years to complete. It involved shooting through the pandemic and multiple lockdowns, and a team working inside a strict bubble. Why a docu-series and not a full-length sports biopic? For Paes, 120 minutes is insufficient to narrate their story of 20 years. “You’ll probably see only one side of it. With Break Point , you’ll see all the highs and lows of our relationship.” Bhupathi believes there is a sort of reality that comes out in a docu-drama. “With us, there has always been this question of ‘what if’ and ‘why’. So we thought it was better to narrate it in first person and clear the air, rather than have someone play us.”  Break Point also features the duo’s families, friends, tennis players and opponents. “Twenty years later, it is so unique to hear their version of our story. It’s not about what’s right or wrong. It’s just about presenting the facts,” adds Paes. But reliving the entire saga and baring it all was disquieting for Bhupathi. “Talking about the highs was easy. Talking about the lows with several cameras and production crew was definitely not ideal for me, but we somehow got it done,” says Bhupathi. Paes and Bhupathi have grown closer in the process of making Break Point . “We really didn’t have a proper conversation after 2011. Now we’ve been speaking more frequently, working on this project intimately and passionately. The bond between us has rejuvenated and hopefully we can keep it going,” says Bhupathi. Paes says he shares a true brotherhood with Bhupathi. “We will have our differences, but we will always be close. I know that if I ever need Mahesh, he’s going to be there, and vice-versa. If you put us on a tennis court today, there will be magic.” Break Point streams on Zee5 from October 1.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘We don’t understand democracy ’||Tuck Jagadish showed actor Nani as a Mandal Revenue Officer. In Republic , the Telugu film directed by Deva Katta and slated to release in theatres on October 1, actor Sai Dharam Tej plays a District Collector who stands his ground despite political pressures. The hero as an agent of change and the good versus evil battle is not new, but Deva Katta hopes Republic can challenge people’s understanding of democracy.  Republic pits Sai Dharam Tej against a powerful politician played by Ramya Krishna. “Most of us don’t have a deep understanding of terms such as autocracy, democracy, socialism, communism or capitalism. We live in a democracy without truly understanding what it entails,” he says. He does not nurture romantic notions that cinema can spark a change in society, but believes that a well thought-out story can make people understand the root cause of problems. Deva Katta says the socio-political thriller emerged from his understanding of social and political scenarios over the years. The director reflects on his journey before elaborating on the film. Born in Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh, he moved with his family to Chennai when he was in Class VII. After completing Engineering in Chennai, he worked in the USA where he studied Filmmaking. Despite an interest in cinema since school, a corporate job was a financial necessity. “Remember those black and white portions in 3 Idiots about the financial crisis in Sharman Joshi’s family? My situation was somewhat similar,” he remarks in a lighter vein. He made his first feature film Vennela (2005) while in the US and then moved to Hyderabad to make Prasthanam (2010), regarded his best work to date. Two democracies Living in India and the US, he says, gave him a ringside view of politics: “I had the privilege of living in one of the most mature democracies in the world, the US, and had the opportunity to compare the foundations of democracy in India and the United States. We often come across NRIs who find it tough to relate to the happenings in India. Aishwarya Rajesh essays one such character in this film.” The idea for Republic emerged eight years ago but took shape as a story only a couple of years ago, when he met Sai Dharam Tej at a gym and mooted the idea of a story exploring the dynamics of democracy. Deva Katta says, “I wanted to narrate this story through a civil servant protagonist because 90% of them want to do good work but end up being crushed by the evil in the system.” While the director’s Prasthanam showed the repercussions of one man’s greed, Autonagar Surya (2014) was the story of a man rising from humble beginnings and fighting for dignity. Deva Katta had always been tuned into social and political happenings, but the research for Republic had him poring over newspaper articles, podcasts such as The Seen and The Unseen by Amit Varma, and books including Colin Wilson’s A Criminal History of Mankind , How to Win an Indian Election by Shivam Shankar Singh, A Feast of Vultures by Josy Joseph and Malevolent Republic by Kapil Satish Komireddy. He also had in-depth discussions with Lok Satta’s founder-president Jaya Prakash Narayana and observed scholar Robert Hunter Wade’s papers on Indian politics.  Republic , Deva Katta says, is a reflection of political happenings but stays neutral, without being for or against any political party: “Politicians are also victims of the system,” he points out. An environmental issue is the central conflict between the different stakeholders in the story. The teaser and trailer have elicited a positive response and netizens and film industry circles have commented that Republic seems to be Deva Katta’s most significant work since Prasthanam . The director agrees: “I had a limited crew and budget while working on Vennela and Prasthanam , but I had so much freedom. Thanks to Sai Dharam Tej who stood by me, I was assured that I could make Republic the way I wanted to, without any pressure to tweak the narration to suit the star’s image.” Deva Katta is confident that Republic will do well in theatres.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Working hard to work out hard||There are two things R Manikandan lives for: the chain of Toneez Fitness Centres he established as a 23-year-old, and bodybuilding. Over the past month, he has been consumed by both. After opening three stores of Toneez Wellness in Chennai and Hyderabad, he is now in Uzbekistan, representing India at the 12th World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship, which begins today. This is the third time he will be taking part in this competition, having won the Mr World title twice: gold in 2017 and silver in 2018. “I want Indians to treat bodybuilding like the challenging sport it is,” says Mani, who will be participating in the above 165 centimetre height category. “You have to dedicate your entire self to it. It’s not just one hour in the gym, bodybuilding means thinking about it from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep. Every meal matters, how much water you drink matters, your sleep matters,” he says. As exciting as it is to represent your country internationally, Mani’s story of how he came to do that is perhaps more fascinating. He discusses it over a video call. “It started about 15 years ago, when I was 15 —” he begins when a phone call interrupts him, blasting the Popeye ringtone. Apropos, for a team of bodybuilders. A pause here and he continues. An early start As a 15-year-old living in Guindy, Mani was bullied in school for being overweight. That led him to hit the local gym, where for the first time, he met men obsessed with sculpting their bodies. “I dropped from 120 kilograms to 70, and entered class XI as a much fitter person. But then I thought why not build muscle too,” he says. Impressed by 25-year-olds at the gym who were also competing on stage, Mani followed suit, registering at a State-level bodybuilding competition. “I placed sixth in the senior category, among bodybuilders with years of experience,” recalls Mani, adding that it gave him the push he needed to train more. “All my heroes, from Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Rock, to my coach, Senthil Kumaran Selvarajan were bodybuilders.” For the next two years, he juggled training and entering competitions with schoolwork and preparing for his Class XII board exams. “My parents did not mind. We are from a poor background and they wouldn’t ask me many questions because I worked my way to pay the gym and registration fees. I would work odd jobs, mostly in small shops and housekeeping in hotels, clean restrooms, and so on,” he says. When he graduated, he became the first in his family to do so, and received a scholarship to pursue higher studies. However, a year into engineering college, he dropped out, to work at a gym instead. “I was working two jobs at the time. One as the housekeeping staff at Le Royal Méridien, Chennai and the other as a trainer at a local gym,” he says. As his bodybuilding skills developed, he was promoted to the position of a gym supervisor at Le Royal Méridien. A chance encounter It was at the hotel gym that Mani met Sriram Vasantharajan, owner of Blade Energy Partners. “He was staying there for three months for a project. He had an ACL tear and was in a knee brace. I offered to help with his strength training and within three months, his knee brace was removed,” says Mani. Before Sriram flew back to the US, where he worked, he met Mani again, asking him what his future plans were. “I said I am training for competitions,” said Mani. “But he asked me what my bigger goal is — I thought about it and replied that it was to train others to be fit too. He suggested I open my own gym, but I laughed it off. I was 21 years old and earning 15,000 a month!” However, Sriram offered to invest in his gym and went on to give him seed money for it. “I quit my job the next day and started looking for places to open a gym. Most places took one look at me, and said, come back with your parents,” he laughs. But with help from Sriram’s friends, he opened the first Toneez branch in Nanganallur in 2015. Once business picked up, he returned to his first passion: competing. In 2017, he won Mr Tamil Nadu, Mr South India and Mr World. The current competition in Uzbekistan will be his third attempt, and he is now especially careful about his lifestyle. “You have to be in shape throughout the year,” he explains, “You have to be disciplined, you can’t train just before the competition. If you train for one year, you can gain two kilograms of quality muscle. For 10 kilograms of muscle to show, you would have to train for five years continuously without spoiling your health. That is why I call it the toughest sport in the world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/working-hard-to-work-out-hard/article36768273.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Aamani dons a new role||If actor Aamani proved her mettle in director Bapu’s Mr Pellam (1993), her performance in SV Krishna Reddy’s films Subhalagnam (1994) and Maavichiguru (1996) made her a household name among Telugu film goers. The actor reprises the role of the money-mad, controlling Kanaka Ratnam in the Telugu daily serial Muthyamantha Muddu, launched a month ago on Zee Telugu. Director Ramjee helms the loves story set in Nellore, with script and dialogues by Rasool. Kanaka Ratnam’s obsession for money stems from her carrying forward her mother’s money-lending business. With a big bindi, colourful bangles and jewellery, the mother of three is sharp-tongued and bossy, asserting her dominance over the family. When her son Govind falls in love with Geetha, a Tamilian, and marries her, Kanaka Ratnam’s battle with her daughter-in-law begins. “Initially I was not interested but when I heard the story, I couldn’t say no. My character has a commanding personality. Portraying varied emotions without making her a negative character is a challenge,” says Aamani. Bengaluru-based Aamani travels to Hyderabad for shoots and credits the team for her Nellore accent in the show. Though transforming into Kanaka Ratnam was easy, the dialogues posed a challenge.“I could get the body language of an overbearing person right but the slang was initially tough.” As for the television stint, she says, “Work flow is a major difference between film and television serials. A film actor gets some rest between shots but the small screen is demanding and keeps actors on their toes.” In her two-and-half decade-long film career, Aamani has also essayed various small roles in Aa Naluguru, Chandamama Kathalu, Middle Class Abbayi, Bharat Ane Nenu and others. She was recently seen as a street vendor and actor Kartikeya’s onscreen mother in Chavu Kaburu Challaga . Actors have to move with the times and accept roles that give them a scope to emote, she says. Citing the examples of Jayasudha and Jayaprada, she says, “They were both stars in Telugu films and later did varied roles. Jayasudha made a mark as a mother in so many movies. If you stick to your own image you can never grow as an artiste. Essaying different roles is a challenge but it is also quite fulfilling.” While Aamani’s foray into Telugu television is new, she is familiar to Tamil audiences as Rathinavalli in the serial Poove Unkaaga . She discontinued the project after a year due to her mother’s hospitalisation from COVID-19. When her mother’s health deteriorated, Aamani found herself cash-strapped. “My money was locked and no one helped me. But Arvind sir (Allu Arvind of Geetha Arts) immediately sent money to be given for a project. It was my money but what mattered was that he gave it when I needed it the most.” She spends more than 25 days in Hyderabad for shootings. “I miss my children — seven year old Nihal and five year old Vibha. Whenever I get a small break I am back in Bengaluru to be with them.” Aamani looks forward to her next project Arrdham, a Telugu-Tamil bilingual film.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/aamani-dons-a-new-role/article36768266.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Sound of sass||Nikhita Gandhi cherishes the feedback she is receiving for her recently released single ‘Bad Boy X Bad Girl’ with rap artist Badshah. The video features Toofaan -fame Mrunal Thakur sensuously grooving to this fun number. “I have done singles before but this song is a class apart. This is the first non-film collaboration with Badshah. His music is always of international standard,” says the multilingual playback singer, over the phone from Mumbai. Does Nikhita anticipate more offers to be the voice for Mrunal? “I don’t mind,” laughs Nikhita and adds, “I believe when I sang ‘Burj Khalifa’, Kiara Advani also liked my voice, especially how I started the song; she wanted me to sing more songs for her.” The 2017 title song of Raabta , picturised on Deepika Padukone was the big-ticket number for Nikhita. “I have had the pleasure of singing some phenomenal songs like ‘Raabta’ and a variety of others in Bollywood. My niche is my versatility. Sometimes people say ‘Oh my god, you sang this one? It sounds so different’,” says Nikhita whose repertoire extends to playback singing in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Bengali films. “It doesn't matter who I am singing for, for me the song and the composers are important. I don’t pick according to how big or small the actors are, everybody starts from somewhere and becomes somebody.” If you are a trained singer living in Chennai, you cannot escape the ARR aura. Kolkata-born Nikhita Gandhi, while pursuing dentistry in Chennai, joined AR Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory to learn western classical music in her free time. Looking back She found herself spending more time there as part of the choir. As destiny had it, Rahman heard her voice and gave her a break in Kalyana Samyal Sadham (2013). What followed was a slew of offers from other film industries, an album in Bengali called Kotha and another biggie with Rahman ‘Ladio’ for Shankar’s I . She entered the Telugu film industry with ‘Beautiful Zindagi’ in Yevade Subramanyam . “When a break came from AR Rahman I was not even planning to be a playback singer, I was more into rock, and may have pursued that. Thanks to him, I was put on the singing map and a career in Bollywood got launched,” says Nikhita. With regional songs, what’s her trick to sound like a native singer? “I put myself in the person of that language and try to pretend. It’s sort of mimicry I suppose. I write lyrics in Hindi, it helps in being phonetically correct.” While indie music is considered a stepping stone to Bollywood, Nikhita started her music career as a playback singer first and moved to make independent music, including collaborating with American singer-songwriter Pink Sweat for a remix version of ‘At My Worst’. Nikitha rendered her part in Hinglish. “A lot of people listen to Indian songs even though they don’t understand them. This is a good time for a collaboration between Hindi and English,” says Nikhita who adds that she loves performing Latino numbers as well.  “It doesn't matter who I am singing for, for me the song and the composers are important. I don’t pick according to the big or small actors’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sound-of-sass/article36768272.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Nilgiris as a sundowner||The story of this gin begins in the Nilgiris, five years ago. The late chairman Neelakanta Rao Jagdale of Bengaluru-based Amrut Distilleries was holidaying in Udhagamandalam when he thought of creating a distilled gin using botanicals and spices from South India. After a visit to the Government Medicinal Plant Development Area at Doddabetta, he learnt about the medicinal plants used for therapeutic oils. Amrut’s Nilgiris gin launched in December 2020 is now available in the US, UK, Europe and Singapore. “Our whiskeys are already available in 58 countries. We want to grow further. We are working on new gins with Indian botanicals that highlight the variety of flavours that our country is known for. We are doing trials now to finalise the recipe,” says Nikhil Varma, gin distiller for Amrut. While the Nilgiris gin came with a bouquet of 10 botanicals including juniper berries, coriander seeds, lemongrass, angelica roots, orris roots, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, Nilgiris tea and paan (betel leaves), the new gins will also have unique botanicals and interesting flavour profiles. Nikhil says the Nilgiris mountain range has a vast area dedicated to tea plantations, its tea, which represents the hills was the first choice. “Nilgiris tea gives the floral, yet complex muskiness that stands out. I distilled some green tea and black tea varieties before choosing the right one that has a bit of dryness, florals, and a hint of spices. It adds an extra dimension. We have used Italian juniper berries, a primary botanical with all-purpose flavours of pine, lavender, rose, and citrus. Coriander seeds, a floral spice, complements the soft citrus of juniper and I explored lemon grass to bring the zesty note,” says Nikhil. The last botanical came in the form of betel leaves: the spicy and floral variety from Mysuru and the juicy, sweet variety from Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-nilgiris-as-a-sundowner/article36768275.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Do you know the history of Golconda?||This weekend, 18 actors of Hyderabad’s Nishumbita theatre group will play a total of 182 characters in 90 minutes to narrate the origin of the Golconda kingdom and other stories associated with it. The presentation, titled Golakonda, will incorporate puppetry, Telangana’s traditional art forms such as burra katha, dappu dance and Perini with Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam. Nishumbita’s founder-director Rammohan Holagundi says the theatrical production combines dance ballet and docudrama. “One tends to think what else is there to discover about Golconda fort,” Holagundi says. “The production journey, however, led us to lesser known stories.” Golconda was earlier called golla konda , named after shepherds ( gollolu in Telugu) exploring the hillock ( konda ), after they discovered a deity. “ Golakonda looks at the origin story of the kingdom, before tracing the rise of the Asif Jahi dynasty, Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah’s romance with Bhagmati, Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah’s quest for power, the construction of Charminar, how Hyderabad was affected by plague (in 1911) and more.” During the pandemic, members of Nishumbita began research for the production. Elderly men and women aged 85 and above, living in the vicinity of the fort, shared the stories they had heard while growing up. Archival books were referred to and historians and academicians consulted to verify facts. “We did not want to go wrong with history. There were cases of date mismatches and we went through rounds of verification. We did not limit ourselves to the Internet,” says Holagundi. The research also brought to the fore lesser known facts. For instance River Musi was earlier called Narva. With Golakonda , Nishumbita is hopeful that Hyderabad theatre lovers will return up to patronise stage plays.   Golakonda will be staged on October 2 and 3; 7 pm, at Nishumbita School of Drama, Begumpet. Tickets priced at Rs. 100 can be purchased via Google Pay number 7995556341.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/do-you-know-the-history-of-golconda/article36768271.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||There’s bael in my vodka||Kokum mocktails, bael cocktails, Darjeeling tea coolers and chikoo -flavoured beer now jostle for space on Indian bar and dining menus. Drinks that hero indigenous ingredients are this year’s fastest growing trend, fuelled by a rising interest in regional produce combined with a pandemic-induced hankering for comforting childhood flavours. So bael ka sharbat now has a chic new avatar, as a bael cocktail at Sidecar in Delhi. It is a whiskey or vodka-based alcoholic drink with bael shrub. The inky blue pea flower, which grows wild in parts of India, has found its way into everything from tea to gin-based cocktails. And the Indian olive, or jalpai , infused iced tea has become an epicurean trend for cafe hopping Instagrammers in Imphal, Manipur. Eli Yambem of Manipur-based Dweller Teas says that well-travelled Indians, after experiencing a world of exotic flavours, are now looking for drinks that are both fresh and familiar. He says, “While regional cuisines are a hit, regional drinks too shouldn’t be overlooked. With the drying and preserving techniques that the F&B industry now uses, shelf lives of many seasonal fruits can be extended. The Indian olive, a sour fruit mostly found in the Northeast and in some parts of East and West Bengal for instance, is a highly perishable fruit, and is not well-known. I dried them to make a herbal infusion with roselle and the peel of a locally available lemon. The infusion has a lovely reddish hue and a delicious fragrance.” The Indian olive, like peach, is a stone fruit have a mild spicy fragrance and is extremely sour, which is why it works for Eli’s concoction. Eli adds that besides the drinks, his health-concious younger customers in particular, “want good food that also appeals to the eye and taste buds”. Japtej Ahulwalia and his team of barmen at Origins, a Chennai-based speciality bar, have moved away from artificial syrups and adopted many techniques to turn fresh seasonal fruits into syrups. In some cases they even use flowers like marigold, blue pea, elder flower and lavender, in their cocktails like No Name Cocktail, Black Forest Spritzer . Japtej says, “The end result is appealing both visually and on the palate. Synthetic flavours overshadow the liquor, because of the sweet content and added fragrances. That way, it becomes easy to cheat with cheap liqour in cocktails. We at Origins want cocktail and mocktail lovers to savour not only flavours of the additives, but of the liquor as well.” The other bar in Chennai that makes use of flavours derived from fresh fruits in their drinks is the bar at Novotel called KooX. Meanwhile Maharastra-based Priyanka Save runs Fruzzante, a brand of alco-beverage made from chikoo (Sapodilla) extracts. Being a farmer’s daughter, Priyanka says she knows the highly perishable chikoo like the back of her hand. “With my wine enthusiast husband Nagesh, I decided to overturn the depleted chikoo market after extensive experiments, extraction, fermentation, storage and packaging,” she says. After several trials with by-products, she realised that it is in the nature ofchikooto ferment. “From thereon, I decided to go with a cider-style beverage; that also allowed me to revive tradition and give consumers a chance to appreciate local spirits,” she says. Award-winning mixologist Yangdup Lama, founder of Delhi-based Sidecar, agrees with Priyanka. Now experimenting with fermented millet juice in cocktails, he says, “I take pride in experimenting with locally appreciated flavours. Consumers don’t want to simply gulp down something colourful and sweet anymore. They think of the aroma and taste notes. They want to try new Indian ingredients; it could be a flower or a spice.” Yangdup adds that “the well-travelled — whether in real time or through social media — are always looking at learning to taste and experience something new. I use a lot of vetiver, rhododendron flowers, Darjeeling tea, herbs and chillies to give that experience. Since there is a natural inquisitiveness to try new flavours, it becomes our responsibility to combine regional flavours, whether fruits, herbs and spice, to narrate an exciting story of the place it comes from.” One of the most popular local flavours now is the gondhoraj lebu , a highly scented lemon from West Bengal, with the kick of king chilli ( bhoot jolokia from Northeast India) in close pursuit. However, it is not just unfamiliar ingredients that are being appreciated; people are also redicovering familiar flavours. Nannari , a herbal drink made from the herb roots of the Nannari tree with origins in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, is increasingly finding its place on the menu across southern India. Leaning on childhood memories, Subhasish Borah and Bidisha of Kohuwa Collective a collaborative space and slow food cafe in Guwahati recently introduced thekera sorbot ( kokum sherbet), teteli sorbot (tamarind sherbet) and ou tenga sorbot (elephant apple sherbet). Subhasish says “As a slow food cafe, Bidisha and I wanted to bring back regional drinks. Assamese thekera sorbot is different from the ones made in the coastal region. The kokum found in Assam is kuji thekera which belongs to the garcinia family. We decided to make a drink with elephant apple because we wanted to introduce the unique flavour of this fruit, which is otherwise used as souring agent in curries, in a more versatile manner.” Ankita Sehgal, founder of Jeeru, a Madhya Pradesh-based bottled carbonbated drink, feels that even jeera (cumin) flavoured bottled drinks are slowly gaining popularity. Ankita says, “It has a huge potential as a mocktail mix. Its popularity could be because jeera -flavoured drinks pairs well with all Indian cuisine.” After all, you can’t go wrong when banking on the flavours of the land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/theres-bael-in-my-vodka/article36768279.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s meet in court||It was the summer of 1999. The nation was submerged in the overwhelming din of the cricket World Cup, but two 20-year-olds were patiently scaling hitherto unseen summits in tennis. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi became the first Indian pair to win a Grand Slam title and for the country’s tennis fans long starved of a hero, they got not one, but two — “Lee-Hesh”. It was a moment enough to move even the most incurable of cynics. But nothing prepares you for the Everest-today-abyss-tomorrow motif as well as sport does. As quick as a wink, a glorious present and bright future could become a distant past. For the ‘Indian Express’ that went on to lift two more Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, there was simmering discontent beneath the winning partnership. Since then, much dirty linen has been washed in public, all leading to an unsavoury divorce. At the speed and venom of a perfect ace, Indian tennis was split wide open. It is this split between Paes and Bhupathi that seems to be the focus of Break Point , an upcoming docu-series which traces, over seven episodes, the duo’s partnership on and off court. Inspiring a generation But both Paes and Bhupathi disagree. “It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built. What it means to be number one in a sport at a time when there was no manual on how it could be achieved,” Paes says, joining Bhupathi in a virtual conversation with The Hindu.   Break Point is helmed by husband-wife filmmaker duo Nitish Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who are co-directing a project for the first time. Bhupathi says the pair was approached on several occasions over the years to tell their story, but it was this director combo that clinched the deal. “It didn’t always come down to the right team, the right narrative or the right platform. But when we heard that Nitish and Ashwiny were interested, obviously with their pedigree, it piqued our interest.” From scripting to release, Break Point took one-and-a half years to complete. It involved shooting through the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple lockdowns, and a team working inside a strict bubble. Why a docu-series and not a full-length sports biopic? For Paes, 120 minutes is insufficient to narrate their story of 20 years. “You’ll probably see only one side of it. With Break Point , you’ll see all the highs and lows of our relationship.” Bhupathi believes there is a sort of reality that comes out in a docu-drama. “With us, there has always been this question of ‘what if’ and ‘why’. So we thought it was better to narrate it in first person and clear the air, rather than have someone play us.”  Break Point also features the duo’s families, friends, tennis players and opponents, including Sania Mirza and brothers Bob and Mike Bryan. “Twenty years later, it is so unique to hear their version of our story. It’s not about what’s right or wrong. It’s just about presenting the facts,” adds Paes. But reliving the entire saga and baring it all was disquieting for Bhupathi. “Talking about the highs was easy. Talking about the lows with several cameras and production crew was definitely not ideal for me, but we somehow got it done. Thankfully, I had some help at home to deal with all that,” says Bhupathi, who is married to Bollywood actor and former Miss Universe Lara Dutta. He balks at the prospect of a biopic in the future. “It took us 10 years to get here. Let’s take one step at a time. If there is still buzz around Lee-Hesh, then why not?” Paes on the other hand says he has a lot more to say on his individual journey, his Olympic medal win in 1996, and the relationship with his father Vece Paes, who also won a medal as part of the Indian hockey team at the 1972 Games. “I’m working on a project on those lines...” Mental health The pandemic has spurred the release of several sports docu-dramas that have thrived on streaming platforms. Bhupathi has watched them all: from The Last Dance to The Test . On his list is the recently-released series on his friend and tennis compatriot Mardy Fish, also incidentally titled Untold: Breaking Point. “Yeah, we had a good laugh about that,” Bhupathi chuckles, but quickly turns serious. “The issue about mental health dealt with in that series is so important. I wish we had that kind of help 20 years ago. We had to deal with a whole lot [of it] all by ourselves. I am jealous of the kids today.” Paes and Bhupathi last played together more than a decade ago. But they have grown closer in the process of making Break Point . “We really didn’t have a proper conversation after 2011. Now we’ve been speaking more frequently, working on this project so intimately and passionately. The bond between us has rejuvenated and hopefully we can keep it going,” says Bhupathi. Paes says he shares a true brotherhood with Bhupathi. “We will have our differences, but we will always be close. I know that if I ever need Mahesh, he’s going to be there, and vice-versa. If you put us on a tennis court today, there will be magic.” Break Point streams   on Zee5 from today.   It’s not just the split but also about inspiring the next generation, and showing them how champions are built.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Working hard to work out hard||There are two things R. Manikandan lives for: the chain of Toneez Fitness Centres he established as a 23-year-old, and bodybuilding. Over the past month, he has been consumed by both. After opening three stores of Toneez Wellness in Chennai and Hyderabad, he is now in Uzbekistan, representing India at the 12th World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship, which begins on Friday. This is the third time he will be taking part in this competition, having won the Mr World title twice: gold in 2017 and silver in 2018. “I want Indians to treat bodybuilding like the challenging sport it is,” says Manikandan, who will be participating in the above 165 centimetre height category. “You have to dedicate your entire self to it. It’s not just one hour in the gym, bodybuilding means thinking about it from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep. Every meal matters, how much water you drink matters, your sleep matters,” he says. As exciting as it is to represent your country internationally, Mani’s story of how he came to do that is perhaps more fascinating. He discusses it over a video call. “It started about 15 years ago, when I was 15,” he begins when a phone call interrupts him, blasting the Popeye ringtone. Apropos, for a team of bodybuilders. A pause here and he continues. An early start As a 15-year-old living in Guindy, Manikandan was bullied in school for being overweight. That led him to hit the local gym, where for the first time, he met men obsessed with sculpting their bodies. “I dropped from 120 kilograms to 70, and entered Class XI as a much fitter person. But then I thought why not build muscle too,” he says. Impressed by 25-year-olds at the gym who were also competing on stage, Manikandan followed suit, registering at a State-level bodybuilding competition. “I placed sixth in the senior category, among bodybuilders with years of experience,” he recalls, adding that it gave him the push he needed to train more. “All my heroes, from Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Rock, to my coach, Senthil Kumaran Selvarajan were bodybuilders.” For the next two years, he juggled training and entering competitions with schoolwork and preparing for the Class XII board exams. “My parents did not mind. We are from a poor background and they wouldn’t ask me many questions because I worked my way to pay the gym and registration fees. I would work odd jobs, mostly in small shops and housekeeping in hotels, clean restrooms, and so on,” he says. When he graduated, he became the first in his family to do so, and received a scholarship to pursue higher studies. However, a year into engineering college, he dropped out, to work at a gym instead. “I was working two jobs at the time. One as the housekeeping staff at Le Royal Méridien, Chennai, and the other as a trainer at a local gym,” he says. As his bodybuilding skills developed, he was promoted to the position of a gym supervisor at Le Royal Méridien. A chance encounter It was at the hotel gym that Manikandan met Sriram Vasantharajan, owner of Blade Energy Partners. “He was staying there for three months for a project. He had an ACL tear and was in a knee brace. I offered to help with his strength training and within three months, his knee brace was removed,” says Manikandan. Before Sriram flew back to the U.S., where he worked, he met Manikandan again, asking him what his future plans were. “I said I am training for competitions. But he asked me what my bigger goal is — I thought about it and replied that it was to train others to be fit too. He suggested I open my own gym, but I laughed it off. I was 21 years old and earning 15,000 a month,” he said. However, Sriram offered to invest in his gym and went on to give him seed money for it. “I quit my job the next day and started looking for places to open a gym. Most places took one look at me, and said, come back with your parents,” he laughs. But with help from Sriram’s friends, he opened the first Toneez branch in Nanganallur in 2015. Once business picked up, he returned to his first passion: competing. In 2017, he won Mr Tamil Nadu, Mr South India and Mr World. The current competition in Uzbekistan will be his third attempt, and he is now especially careful about his lifestyle. “You have to be in shape throughout the year,” he explains, “You have to be disciplined, you can’t train just before the competition. If you train for one year, you can gain two kilograms of quality muscle. For 10 kilograms of muscle to show, you would have to train for five years continuously without spoiling your health.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Bhuvan’s secret Did Stella tell?||Story so far: Bhuvan’s plans of feeding Mrs Miranda’s kittens fail when Baba sends Dhanush back to his house.  When Bhuvan woke up the next morning, Baba was not to be seen. “Popo Singh got Baba a temporary job delivering groceries to stranded labourers at construction sites,” said Aai, arranging a dozen colourful masks on the floor. “What are you doing?” “I am clicking pictures of my masks and sending them to a few clients. I think I will stitch and sell masks until this epidemic ends.” “But you are an expert in making designer blouses. You shouldn’t be undertaking such small jobs,” said Bhuvan. “No job is small, Bhuvan. I will stitch strong masks and earn some money.” Bhuvan hugged Aai and kissed her. “Can I use your phone? I want to talk to Stella.” “Why can’t you talk to her through the window?” “It’s a secret, Aai!” She tossed him the phone. “Make it quick!” Making plans Bhuvan caught the phone and went to the kitchen to call Stella, who was the only kid in the street who had a phone. She answered after the third ring. “I am going to feed the kittens. Do you want to come?” “I am not going anywhere and neither should you!” “The kittens will starve…” “Tell your parents! They will do something.” “No! Aai will never let me walk home alone from school again.” “Let me think of something…” Bhuvan ended the conversation. Since Aai was watching television, he parked himself by the front door, watching the chickens and the stray mongrels outside till he heard a familiar laugh on the street. It was Popo Singh. “Popo Uncle!” He heard Stella call out to him. “What is it, Stella?” he asked, stopping in the middle of the street. A warning Bhuvan couldn’t hear anything more, as Aai fiddled with the TV’s volume right then. A few minutes later, he watched nervously as Popo Singh stopped outside his house and met his eyes. “Are you enjoying your holidays?” “Yes,” said Bhuvan. “Don’t step out of the house! Stay home! Stay safe!” Bhuvan’s ears turned red. He picked up Aai’s phone and dialled Stella’s number.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A celebration of diversity||Srjan, Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra Odissi Nrityabasa, Bhubaneshwar, which has been regularly promoting Odissi, hosted a virtual 27th edition of the OMC Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra Award Festival, dedicated to Laxmipriya Mohapatra, the first woman Odissi dancer, who passed away in March this year. The governor of Odisha, Prof. Ganeshi Lal, presented the award to veteran actor Binodini Devi for her commitment to the field of theatre. The Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra Yuva Pratibha Samman was given to Odissi dancer Arushi Mudgal and mardal artiste Ramchandra Behra. The five-day festival, curated by Ratikant Mohapatra, showcased a classical dance and music performance each evening. Odissi exponent Sharmila Mukherjee, a disciple of Kelucharan Mohapatra, opened the festival with a performance marked by the signature style of her guru. It was followed by a violin recital by Sangeeta Shankar, daughter and disciple of Dr. N. Rajam. Moving abhinaya Invoking the blessings of Jagannatha and Saraswati through Mangalacharan, composed and sung by Debashish Sircar, Sharmila proceeded to ‘Visaarini’, exploring the visual imagery of raag Darbari through her own choreography, before depicting the mental agony of a Khandita Nayika through her moving abhinaya in Jayadeva’s Ashtapadi ‘Yahi Madhava yahi Keshava’, the original choreography of her guru with music by Bhuvaneshwar Mishra rendered rivetingly by Debashish. The melodious music was enhanced also by Satchidananda Das on the mardal, Srinivas Satpathy on the flute, Agnimitra Behera on the violin, and Chandrachoor Bhattacharya on the sitar. Soulful rendition This was followed by the timely raag Abhogi, rendered soulfully on the violin by Sangeeta Shankar, who opened with a brief auchar (introductory alap) in the Bada Khayal format of Hindustani classical, exploring the deepest reaches of the pensive raag through her imaginative badhat and behelawa of the slow composition set to Vilambit Ektaal and intricate taans in Drut Teentaal composition in the gayaki ang. The climax came as a contrast, with a jet-speed jhala in tantrakari ang. Sangeeta concluded her performance with a bandishi thumri in Khamaj, ably accompanied on the tabla by Ajit Pathak. Kathak by Nikkita Banawalikar was among the remarkable solo dance performances. Groomed under the watchful eyes of guru Shama Bhate, Nikkita has total command on nrittang, the tala-paksha with rhythmic pieces and crisp footwork concluding with ‘aavartan,’ with 33 pirouettes presented with precision and elan. Her subtle abhinaya on thumri Khamaj, ‘Kahe rokat dagar’, composed by Bindadin Maharaj, was also commendable. Nikkita was ably accompanied on the tabla by Tanay Rege, with vocal support by Aditya Apte, and lehera on the harmonium by Omkar Agnihotri. The vibrant Sattriya by Anvesha Mohanta and Bharatanatyam by Amita Mallick had their own signature charm. Amita’s Ambika pallavi from Lalitha Sahasranamam in praise of Devi, based on raag Tilang and Adi tala, was followed by ‘Krishna Anubhavam’ in ragamalika (Adi tala), presenting the majestic nature of Krishna. Then came the ‘Shiva-Shambho’ in Revathi concluding with the Tulasidas Bhajan ‘Thumak chalat Ramchandra…’ in Yamuna Kalyani Adi (Tisra Nadai). Amita impressed with her clean lines and abhinaya. Mature approach Hindustani vocalist Manjusha Patil left the audience mesmerised with her maturity in the measured rendering of raag Nand with the traditional slow and medium tempo compositions, bringing out every nuance and giving the raag the attention it deserved. The flute recital by Abhiram Nanda, initiated into music by Pt. Mohinimohan Patnaik and further groomed under Pt. Hari Prasad Chaurasia at his Brindavan Gurukul in Bhubaneshwar, will be remembered for a melodious Madhuvanti. Accompanied on the tabla by Biswaranjan Nanda, Abhiram delighted with his tunefulness till the concluding Dhun in Pahadi. Rupak Kumar Parida is one of the most sought-after and versatile Odissi singers today. His pleasing voice and perfect sense of rhythm pervaded the medley of beautiful songs in a variety of raags and taals. There were compositions by Gopal Krishna Patnaik, Jayadeva’s Ashtapadi composed by Raghunath Panigrahi in Bihag, and Odia songs including ‘Sa-Champu’ in Simhendramadhyam. The speciality of Champu is that each line opens with the same letter, in this case, ‘Sa’. Rupak was ably accompanied on the mardal by Satchidanand Das and on the harmonium by Muralidhar Swain. The finale saw neo-classical performances in Odissi conceptualised and choreographed by Ratikant Mohapatra and presented by the Srjan Ensemble. Opening with an invocation to Ganesha, they performed Parameshwari pallavi, and what was called an experimental piece titled, ‘Shiva Shangsanam’, with a novel style of execution. Pushing the boundaries of Odissi, envisioned by Srjan’s founder Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra, they also presented ‘Maati’, based on the poetic works of Radha Mohan Gadanayak.

This year’s edition, the 13th, organised by Narada Gana Sabha Trust, Kalakendra, and Bharata Ilango Foundation for Asian Culture, features 525 artistes, from India and abroad, and 18 types of string instruments, including mandolin, santoor, sarod, surbahar, Hawaiian guitar, Navtar and several types of veena. Besides solos, a special segment showcased artistes belonging to one family. The 16-day festival ends on October 3. Among the participating artistes was vainika Sahana S.V. from Mysuru, who presented an extensive raga essay, a crisp tanam, and a Tyagaraja kriti in Pantuvarali. She brought out the subtle nuances of the raga through her unhurried delineation, with the tanam providing a grand entry into the popular ‘Shiva Shiva Shiva enarada’. After presenting the kriti with its sahitya bhavam, Sahana ventured into a lengthy swaraprastara on the charanam line ‘Agamamula nutiyinchi’, weaving her swara matrices expertly. Saraswati in swaras Thrissur-based senior veena artiste A. Ananthapadmanabhan displayed his expertise, his flying fingers on the frets performing magic. His Saraswati essay was a picture of beauty. He chose Tyagaraja’s ‘Anuragamule’ for a brisk rendition without sacrificing the soul of the song. The extensive swarakalpana segment at ‘Vagavagaga bhujiyinche’ had interesting permutations and combinations. He concluded with the popular Bharati song ‘Chinnanchiru kiliye’ in ragamalika, and a pacy thillana in Madhuvanti. In the 30 minutes they were given, both artistes displayed ample expertise.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Replete with bhava||It is not every day that we get to enjoy a gottuvadyam recital. Thus, the concert by Allam Durgaprasad, for Paalam TV (Mudhra), was particularly enjoyable. He succeeded in producing a nadham of rare resonance and ensured sruti shuddham . With control and mastery over the instrument, every phrase he played was rich in bhava. The opening phrases of Nattai laid a good foundation for the concert, with Dikshitar’s ‘Mahaganapathim’ with a charming chittaswaram offering an auspicious beginning. The swaraprastara was at the pallavi. Durgaprasad is the son of well-known gottuvadyam exponent Allam Koteswara Rao and disciple of the legendary Narayana Iyengar. Elaborate raga alapana The masterpiece was raga Purvikalyani, which saw Durgaprasad weaving interesting raga patterns on the instrument. After a lengthy, yet tranquil alapana, he played a rich tanam, before launching Ramanathapuran (Poochi) Srinivasa Iyengar’s ‘Paramapavana rama’, again with a chittaswaram. The swaras were at the charanam, ‘Kanakambaradhara’. The sprightly thani by Sherthalai Ananthakrishnan (mridangam) and Ghatam Karthick enriched the recital immensely. Another elaborate alapana and a mini tanam that Durgaprasad offered was for Mayamalavagowla. The kriti was the majestic ‘Devadeva kalayamithe’ by Swati Tirunal. Swaraprastara at ‘Jagarupa Nibhachela’ also had a short ragamalika segment. The introduction for Ragam Mohanakalyani was unique, with the instrument giving it a special hue. Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar’s ‘Bhuvaneswariya’ was a vibrant rendering. After a short and sweet Ritigowla, the artiste played Subbaraya Sastri’s masterpiece, ‘Janani ninnuvina’ (misra chapu), which has a lovely chittaswaram and an equally appealing chittaswara sahityam. Earlier, Durgaprasad had offered Saint Tyagaraja’s Saraswathi Manohari piece, ‘Enthavedukondu’ in a lilting Desadi talam. In the concluding segment, he presented Purandaradasa’s ‘Jagadoddharana’ in Kapi. The rendition was majestic and melodious, perhaps as its venerable composer intended it to be. ‘Vaishnava janato’ in Mishra Pilu made for a fitting finale. The concert is available on YouTube.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Remembering a Tamil theatre pioneer||Komal Swaminathan was one of contemporary Tamil stage’s most powerful playwrights. Born in 1935 in Karaikudi, he finished his graduation in Madurai and came to Madras in the mid-1950s driven by a passion for theatre. While in college, he was a Congress activist who had made a name for himself with his fiery stage speeches. It was a time when Tamil theatre was undergoing a metamorphosis of sorts, marked by the advent of amateur theatre. The genres of the plays being staged too started undergoing a change, with more social themes being presented, as compared to the earlier eras. Against this backdrop, theatre legend S.V. Sahasranamam started the Seva Stage Nataka Kalvi Nilayam, a drama school in 1957 to teach aspirants various aspects of stagecraft. Komal Swaminathan joined the institution, which had 26 students on its rolls. Classes were handled by several well-known personalities in the field of Tamil literature and theatre such as Prof Khi.Va. Jagannathan, S.D. Subramania Yogi and Avvai Shanmugam, besides Sahasranamam himself. Training included discussions on various aspects of theatre, workshops, and visits to performances. Sahasranamam considered Komal to be one of the brightest students of his batch. The duo shared a special bond, with Komal looking up to Sahasranamam as a true mentor. In his memoirs, Parandhu Pona Pakkangal , Komal writes that his debut work as a playwright, Pudhiya Paadhai, was, rather interestingly, first staged by a group of Gujaratis (belonging to the Khedawal community) from Sowcarpet. Their forefathers had migrated to Madras decades ago and they were fluent in Tamil. Sahasranamam watched the inauguration of the play, which was staged as part of a month-long drama festival organised by theatre enthusiast Partha of the Sport and Pastime magazine. He suggested that it be staged by his group Seva Stage and thus began Komal’s formal journey into the world of Tamil theatre. He went on to write two more scripts for Seva Stage, Minnal Kolam and Thillainayagam . His association with Tamil cinema started around this time, when he joined as assistant to director K.S. Gopalakrishnan and worked on several movies such as Karpagam , Kai Kodutha Deivam and Suhaagan , the Hindi remake of Sarada .  His own theatre group With Sahasranamam’s encouragement, Komal started his own theatre group, Stage Friends, in 1971, with many actors from Seva Stage. The first play under this banner, Sannidhi Theru, was inaugurated on January 23 that year. Over the course of the next few years, he wrote several comedies and family dramas such as Nawab Narkali , Jesus Varuvaar , Perumaale Saatchi and Kodu Illa Kolangal (which was actor Sathyaraj’s stage debut). En Veedu, En Kanavan, En Kuzhandhai was another successful play he wrote at this time, featuring legendary comedienne Manorama in a completely different avatar, that of matriarch of a large household. It was later shot and telecast by Doordarshan for Diwali in 1985 and became the talk of the town. (see box)   Swarga Bhoomi , inaugurated in the late 1970s, dealt with the Naxalite movement. It was an important play in Komal’s career, as he started focusing more on social issues. His most celebrated work, Thaneer Thaneer , premiered in October 1980, running into controversy even before its launch, with the police refusing the mandatory permission that had to be obtained before staging a play, probably because it highlighted official apathy towards people’s issues. The permission eventually came through just a few hours before the inaugural show. The movie version, directed by K. Balachander, won the National Award in 1981 for best Tamil film. The success of Thaneer Thaneer was followed by several critically acclaimed plays such as Nalliravil Petrom , Oru Indhiya Kanavu, and Grama Rajyam . Komal wrote 33 plays in all, of which 27 were performed by Stage Friends. Between 1991 and 1995, he also served as the editor of Subamangala, and it was under his editorship that it became a well-known literary magazine. A recipient of several awards, including the Kalaimamani, Komal Swaminathan passed away in October 1995. In recent years, his legacy has been actively carried forward by his daughter Dharini Komal, who revived Thaneer Thaneer in 2013 and intends to bring back his other works to stage.  The writer, a heritage buff and amateur Tamil theatre artiste,   is part of the cast in Dharini Komal’s latest production.   With Sahasranamam’s encouragement, Komal started his own theatre group, Stage Friends, in 1971, with many actors from Seva Stage||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/remembering-a-tamil-theatre-pioneer/article36768128.ece

Besides solos, a special segment showcased artistes belonging to one family. The 16-day festival ends on October 3. Among the participating artistes was vainika Sahana S.V. from Mysuru, who presented an extensive raga essay, a crisp tanam, and a Tyagaraja kriti in Pantuvarali. She brought out the subtle nuances of the raga through her unhurried delineation, with the tanam providing a grand entry into the popular ‘Shiva Shiva Shiva enarada’. After presenting the kriti with its sahitya bhavam, Sahana ventured into a lengthy swaraprastara on the charanam line ‘Agamamula nutiyinchi’, weaving her swara matrices expertly. Saraswati in swaras Thrissur-based senior veena artiste A. Ananthapadmanabhan displayed his expertise, his flying fingers on the frets performing magic. His Saraswati essay was a picture of beauty. He chose Tyagaraja’s ‘Anuragamule’ for a brisk rendition without sacrificing the soul of the song. The extensive swarakalpana segment at ‘Vagavagaga bhujiyinche’ had interesting permutations and combinations. He concluded with the popular Bharati song ‘Chinnanchiru kiliye’ in ragamalika, and a pacy thillana in Madhuvanti. In the 30 minutes they were given, both artistes displayed ample expertise.

01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Replete with bhava||It is not every day that we get to enjoy a gottuvadyam recital. Thus, the concert by Allam Durgaprasad, for Paalam TV (Mudhra), was particularly enjoyable. He succeeded in producing a nadham of rare resonance and ensured sruti shuddham . With control and mastery over the instrument, every phrase he played was rich in bhava. The opening phrases of Nattai laid a good foundation for the concert, with Dikshitar’s ‘Mahaganapathim’ with a charming chittaswaram offering an auspicious beginning. The swaraprastara was at the pallavi. Durgaprasad is the son of well-known gottuvadyam exponent Allam Koteswara Rao and disciple of the legendary Narayana Iyengar. Elaborate raga alapana The masterpiece was raga Purvikalyani, which saw Durgaprasad weaving interesting raga patterns on the instrument. After a lengthy, yet tranquil alapana, he played a rich tanam, before launching Ramanathapuran (Poochi) Srinivasa Iyengar’s ‘Paramapavana rama’, again with a chittaswaram. The swaras were at the charanam, ‘Kanakambaradhara’. The sprightly thani by Sherthalai Ananthakrishnan (mridangam) and Ghatam Karthick enriched the recital immensely. Another elaborate alapana and a mini tanam that Durgaprasad offered was for Mayamalavagowla. The kriti was the majestic ‘Devadeva kalayamithe’ by Swati Tirunal. Swaraprastara at ‘Jagarupa Nibhachela’ also had a short ragamalika segment. The introduction for Ragam Mohanakalyani was unique, with the instrument giving it a special hue. Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar’s ‘Bhuvaneswariya’ was a vibrant rendering. After a short and sweet Ritigowla, the artiste played Subbaraya Sastri’s masterpiece, ‘Janani ninnuvina’ (misra chapu), which has a lovely chittaswaram and an equally appealing chittaswara sahityam. Earlier, Durgaprasad had offered Saint Tyagaraja’s Saraswathi Manohari piece, ‘Enthavedukondu’ in a lilting Desadi talam. In the concluding segment, he presented Purandaradasa’s ‘Jagadoddharana’ in Kapi. The rendition was majestic and melodious, perhaps as its venerable composer intended it to be. ‘Vaishnava janato’ in Mishra Pilu made for a fitting finale. The concert is available on YouTube. The Chennai-based writer specialises in Carnatic music.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/replete-with-bhava/article36768164.ece
01 October 2021||October 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Remembering a Tamil theatre pioneer||Komal Swaminathan was one of contemporary Tamil stage’s most powerful playwrights. Born in 1935 in Karaikudi, he finished his graduation in Madurai and came to Madras in the mid-1950s driven by a passion for theatre. While in college, he was a Congress activist who had made a name for himself with his fiery stage speeches. It was a time when Tamil theatre was undergoing a metamorphosis of sorts, marked by the advent of amateur theatre. The genres of the plays being staged too started undergoing a change, with more social themes being presented, as compared to the earlier eras. Against this backdrop, theatre legend S.V. Sahasranamam started the Seva Stage Nataka Kalvi Nilayam, a drama school in 1957 to teach aspirants various aspects of stagecraft. Komal Swaminathan joined the institution, which had 26 students on its rolls. Classes were handled by several well-known personalities in the field of Tamil literature and theatre such as Prof Khi.Va. Jagannathan, S.D. Subramania Yogi and Avvai Shanmugam, besides Sahasranamam himself. Training included discussions on various aspects of theatre, workshops, and visits to performances. Sahasranamam considered Komal to be one of the brightest students of his batch. The duo shared a special bond, with Komal looking up to Sahasranamam as a true mentor. In his memoirs, Parandhu Pona Pakkangal , Komal writes that his debut work as a playwright, Pudhiya Paadhai, was, rather interestingly, first staged by a group of Gujaratis (belonging to the Khedawal community) from Sowcarpet. Their forefathers had migrated to Madras decades ago and they were fluent in Tamil. Sahasranamam watched the inauguration of the play, which was staged as part of a month-long drama festival organised by theatre enthusiast Partha of the Sport and Pastime magazine. He suggested that it be staged by his group Seva Stage and thus began Komal’s formal journey into the world of Tamil theatre. He went on to write two more scripts for Seva Stage, Minnal Kolam and Thillainayagam . His association with Tamil cinema started around this time, when he joined as assistant to director K.S. Gopalakrishnan and worked on several movies such as Karpagam , Kai Kodutha Deivam and Suhaagan , the Hindi remake of Sarada .  His own theatre group With Sahasranamam’s encouragement, Komal started his own theatre group, Stage Friends, in 1971, with many actors from Seva Stage. The first play under this banner, Sannidhi Theru, was inaugurated on January 23 that year. Over the course of the next few years, he wrote several comedies and family dramas such as Nawab Narkali , Jesus Varuvaar , Perumaale Saatchi and Kodu Illa Kolangal (which was actor Sathyaraj’s stage debut). En Veedu, En Kanavan, En Kuzhandhai was another successful play he wrote at this time, featuring legendary comedienne Manorama in a completely different avatar, that of matriarch of a large household. It was later shot and telecast by Doordarshan for Diwali in 1985 and became the talk of the town. (see box)   Swarga Bhoomi , inaugurated in the late 1970s, dealt with the Naxalite movement. It was an important play in Komal’s career, as he started focusing more on social issues. His most celebrated work, Thaneer Thaneer , premiered in October 1980, running into controversy even before its launch, with the police refusing the mandatory permission that had to be obtained before staging a play, probably because it highlighted official apathy towards people’s issues. The permission eventually came through just a few hours before the inaugural show. The movie version, directed by K. Balachander, won the National Award in 1981 for best Tamil film. The success of Thaneer Thaneer was followed by several critically acclaimed plays such as Nalliravil Petrom , Oru Indhiya Kanavu, and Grama Rajyam . Komal wrote 33 plays in all, of which 27 were performed by Stage Friends. Between 1991 and 1995, he also served as the editor of Subamangala, and it was under his editorship that it became a well-known literary magazine. A recipient of several awards, including the Kalaimamani, Komal Swaminathan passed away in October 1995. In recent years, his legacy has been actively carried forward by his daughter Dharini Komal, who revived Thaneer Thaneer in 2013 and intends to bring back his other works to stage.  The writer, a heritage buff and amateur Tamil theatre artiste,   is part of the cast in Dharini Komal’s latest production.   With Sahasranamam’s encouragement, Komal started his own theatre group, Stage Friends, in 1971, with many actors from Seva Stage||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/remembering-a-tamil-theatre-pioneer/article36768161.ece

Dianna was born on July 28 in Mauritius with cyanosis, a condition where colour of the skin turns blue or grey in colour. She was eventually diagnosed with valvular pulmonary atresia — a defect of the heart where the valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the lungs doesn’t open at all. With the help of Mauritian government, Dianna was flown to Mumbai on August 12. At the hospital she was stabilized and in less than 24 hours she was readied for the cardiac procedure. But, before the start of the procedure, Dianna suffered a severe cardiac arrest, which needed immediate shock treatment. Baby Dianna’s condition was grim, so temporary pacemaker was inserted. Gradually, her heart regained its own rhythm and the pacemaker was removed. She was shifted to Neonatal intensive care unit. In the next 10 days, the infant overcame all the neonatal problems (Acute kidney failure). She was also coming back to normal neurological functioning, despite having a long duration of CPR and cardiac arrest. Once Dianna was stabilised, Dr. Bhushan Chavan went ahead with the procedure, perforation and balloon pulmonary valvotomy (widening of a narrowed pulmonary valve by using a balloon catheter inside the valve).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rare-surgery-for-infant-from-mauritius/article36768525.ece

01 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||Meghalaya lawmakers get extortion demand from extremist group||Several lawmakers in Meghalaya have received extortion demands from an extremist group, police said. The State police confirmed that a few MLAs and MDCs (Members of District Council) have lodged a complaint after receiving a diktat from the outlawed Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) to pay Rs. 10 lakh each or face the consequences. The outfit, believed to be operating out of bases in adjoining Bangladesh, used a phone with a Bangladeshi number to send the extortion messages via WhatsApp to the elected representatives. Investigation on “We are investigating the case after receiving the complaint from some of the lawmakers. We are ready to provide them with protection if they need,” a senior police officer said from State capital Shillong. The HNLC, lying dormant for some time, was back in news after allegedly exploding bombs in Shillong and Khliehriat in the East Jaintia Hills district a couple of months ago. Shillong also spiralled into chaos a month ago after Cheristerfield Thangkhiew, a former HNLC reader, was killed in an “encounter” with the police. Titosstarwell Chyne, the Chief Executive Member of Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, said he was unaware of extortion messages received by the MDCs. “None of my colleagues have told me anything,” he said. The issue of extortion demands served on the lawmakers was first raised by former Chief Minister Mukul Sangma of the Congress. He had also indicated some Ministers received the extortion demands. Dr. Sangma had also alerted the National People’s Party-led coalition government about the regrouping of extremists in the Garo Hills region of Meghalaya. The objective of the HNLC, claiming to represent the matrilineal Khasi-Jaintia ethnic group, is to liberate Meghalaya from the alleged domination of “outsiders”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/meghalaya-lawmakers-get-extortion-demand/article36768784.ece
