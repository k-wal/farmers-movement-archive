13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Expert panel clears Covaxin for emergency use in 2-18 age group||Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin (BBV152) has been recommended for emergency use authorisation (EUA) for 2-18-year-olds by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO). Covaxin is the country’s first indigenous, whole-virion, inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Medical Research Council (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV). If given the green signal, it will emerge as the first COVID-19 vaccine globally to be used for vaccinating children as young as 2 years. Data submitted In a statement issued on Tuesday, the company said it had submitted data from clinical trials in the 2-18 age group to the CDSCO. The positive recommendations, after due review by the SEC, were submitted to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). A senior Central Government official stated that the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech had completed phase-2 and phase-3 trials of Covaxin on children below 18 in September, and submitted the trial data. The trials were done on the age groups of 2-6, 6-12 and 12 -18. Experts maintained that two doses of Covaxin could be administered to children within a gap of 28 days. For adults, the government has set 4-6 weeks between the two shots.  “This represents one of the first approvals worldwide for COVID-19 vaccines for the 2-18 age group,” the Bharat Biotech statement claimed. The company was awaiting further regulatory approvals from the CDSCO prior to product launch and market availability of the vaccine for children. Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, founder and director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, highlighted, “India has always been known as a vaccine and a medicine drug producer but never a medicine or a drug developer. This is the first time that a vaccine has been entirely developed and produced in India, and its efficacy and safety have been proven to be high so much so that it is now being trialled in children.” The vaccine would lead to protection of children. “Currently, adults have been vaccinated but children have been left exposed to the virus. This vaccine will bring about a positive change,’’ he stressed. Dr. Bipin Singh, assistant professor, School of Engineering & Technology, BML Munjal University (BMU), noted that the approval of the vaccine for children aged 2-18 years was promising. It would have been better if the vaccine was first approved for children within the age bracket of 10-18 years. The recommendations were based on a larger and diverse pool of clinical trails data and long-term evaluations, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/expert-panel-clears-covaxin-for-emergency-use-in-2-18-age-group/article36976765.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||Demand skyrockets, Govt. lifts cap on flights||In a move that is likely to bring relief to passengers from the skyrocketing air fares this festive season, the Government on Tuesday allowed airlines to operate 100% of their pre-COVID flights from October 18. This is the first time the Government has lifted the cap on the number of flights airlines can operate since the resumption of domestic flights on May 25, 2020. Over the past 18 months, the Government has been regulating the number of flights airlines can operate in tandem with passenger demand by imposing a cap of 30% to 85%. At present, airlines are allowed to operate 85% of the pre-COVID flight schedule approved by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “After review of the current status of scheduled domestic operations vis-a-vis passenger demand for air travel... it has been decided to restore the scheduled domestic air operations with effect from 18.10.2021 without any capacity restriction,” an order from the Ministry of Civil Aviation read. With the Durga Puja and Navaratri festivities beginning, last weekend saw massive crowds at two of the biggest airports in the country — New Delhi and Mumbai. Saturday also saw the number of air travellers breach the three lakh-mark for the first time since the COVID-19 second wave. This is 70% of pre-COVID numbers of nearly 4.25 lakh domestic passengers a day. A cap on capacity amid rising demand led to airfares skyrocketing. A Delhi-Bengaluru flight booked in the next three weeks will cost Rs. 12,900 to Rs. 14,900; a Delhi-Patna flight booked in the next three weeks will cost Rs. 9,600 to Rs. 10,300 and a Chennai-Delhi flight in the same period costs Rs. 13,700 to Rs. 14,700. Airfares taper down after Deepavali on November 4. “It is a welcome move as we believe that with recent pent-up demand, combined with the coming festive season, it will be great to operate flights on pre-pandemic levels. We are bullish about the overall growth and demand for domestic travel,” IndiGo said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-lifts-cap-on-number-of-flights-airlines-can-operate/article36976755.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Retail inflation falls to 4.35%; industrial output growth up||India’s retail inflation cooled off to a five-month low of 4.35% in September, thanks to a sharp dip in food price inflation, while industrial output growth accelerated to 11.9% in August, driven largely by a statistical effect of a low base — August 2020 had recorded a 7.1% contraction. Economists cautioned against reading too much into these encouraging official data prints yet, with adverse headwinds lurking on both fronts. Food inflation based on the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) fell to just 0.68% in September after having declined to a seven-month low of 3.1% in August. While vegetables recorded a negative inflation of 22.5%, price rise in oils and fats remained sticky at 34.2% and in the range of 7%-8.75% for key protein sources such as pulses, eggs and meat. However, core inflation, which doesn’t include food and fuel price trends, remained elevated at 5.8% for the third month in a row, and economists said the moderation in the inflation rate could be transient, with rising energy, metals and logistics costs being key risk factors. “A high base is expected to temporarily dampen the consumer price inflation for October and November to below 4%, before an upturn resumes in the remainder of this fiscal,” ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said, emphasising that barring food and housing, most sectors recorded a flat or higher inflation reading in September. Food price trajectory Food prices’ trajectory will continue to remain important as some vegetable prices have reversed direction and sequentially picked up in October, noted Sreejith Balasubramanian, economist at IDFC Asset Management Company. “Commodity prices, particularly of crude oil and their partially offsetting impacts on inflation and consumption demand at a time when the economy’s aggregate demand is still below the pre-pandemic level will also be crucial,” he said. Manufacturing grew 9.7%, electricity by 16% and mining output rose a sharp 23.6% in August, but each of these sectors had recorded negative growth rates in 2020. Overall, however, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) actually declined in August from July, noted Ms. Nayar. “The improvement was limited to primary goods and consumer non-durables, with all the other categories reporting a moderation in growth in August relative to July,” she said, adding that the IIP was 3.9% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Consumer durables’ production remained below pre-COVID levels, “highlighting the enduring impact of the pandemic on big-ticket demand”, she underlined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/retail-inflation-falls-to-435-industrial-output-growth-up/article36976767.ece
13 October 2021||HUBBALLI,||Bommai talks to C.R. Ballari on Hangal candidature||With the candidature of Channabasappa R. Ballari, elder brother of Byadgi MLA Virupakshappa Ballari, likely to affect the prospects of the BJP candidate in the Hangal byelections, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai held meetings with leaders of the party from Hangal, the Panchamasali community and the candidate himself in Davangere on Tuesday. Mr. Bommai seems to have negotiated a truce among those involved. The Chief Minister, who reached the guesthouse of GM Institute of Technology on Monday night itself, held closed door meetings with MPs G.M. Siddeshwar and Shivakumar Udasi and Ministers Sunil Kumar, B.C. Patil and Muniratna and others. And, on Tuesday morning, he held meetings with Lingayat Panchamasali leaders Chandrashekhar Pujar and B.C. Umapathy and Ranebennur MLA Arun Kumar Pujar, who is also from Panchamasli Lingayat community. And, subsequently, Mr. Bommai also held discussions with independent candidate Mr. Channabasappa Ballari, a former government official and brother of Byadgi MLA [Virupakshappa Ballari]. Mr. Channabasappa Ballari reportedly came to Davangere on being invited by the Chief Minister for talks. Mr. Bommai told presspersons that he had come to Davangere for having discussions with Davangere leaders on some issues and also for reviewing preparations for the byelections to Hangal. “I had elaborate discussions with Davangere leaders on development issues and with Hangal leaders on the byelections. We have our strategy and we will win both the seats,” he said. Mr. Bommai said that he shares a good rapport with Mr. Channabasappa Ballari and he was close to the Udasi family too. “We have known each other for 40 years now. As I told him that I am coming to Davangere and wanted to meet him, he came there out of love and respect for my father. I had discussions with him. And, he will take a decision after discussing it with community leaders and followers,” he said. Going by indications it is evident that Mr. Channabasappa Ballari may withdraw his candidature on Wednesday, the last day for withdrawal of nomination papers. He, however, has not made any official announcement yet. He told presspersons that he will take the final decision after discussing the issue with leaders of Lingayat Panchamasali community. He said that he was an aspirant for BJP ticket, but did not know why he was not considered. “I am contesting as an independent due to pressure from the community. I will announce my decision on Wednesday after discussions with community leaders. I am a friend of the Chief Minister. As Mr. Bommai is the Chief Minister, any debacle for the party in the election will not bring a good name to him. I will act according to what the community says,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Siddeshwar said that he was 99% sure that Mr. Channabasappa Ballari will withdraw his candidature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bommai-talks-to-cr-ballari-on-hangal-candidature/article36976966.ece
13 October 2021||HYDERABAD,||No scope for power cuts in State: Minister||Minister for Energy G. Jagdish Reddy has asserted that there was no scope for imposing power cuts in the State at present. The State had coal reserves to meet the energy demand for the next 200 years and there was no scope for power cuts for even a minute, he said. The Minister, in an informal chat with reporters who met him this morning, said coal production and crisis that was gripping the country because of the Central government’s policies. “The Centre owes a response to the coal supply crisis engulfing the country at present,” he said. The State government on its part was prepared with plans for supply of power to Hyderabad and other places and a network had been put in place for the purpose. Hydel power generation too was contributing significant chunk to meet the demand. Power generation from Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar, Ramagundam, Bhupalpally, Kothagudem and Manuguru was sufficient to meet the requirements of the State. He cited how the government could successfully meet the demand last year when it peaked to 16,000 MW. He expressed concern that the country was likely to face severe problems on account of the unilateral decisions being taken by the Centre. The Centre should take the responsibility in the event of Telangana facing power shortages in the coming days. “Experts are expressing concern that artificial scarcity of coal is being created as part of efforts to privatize power sector,” he said adding that the Centre should refrain from usurping the rights of the States and ensure that their rights were protected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-scope-for-power-cuts-in-the-state-says-minister-for-energy/article36977162.ece

13 October 2021||HYDERABAD,||No clarity on KRMB project components||The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has asked Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to handover all projects, canal systems, hydel stations, barrages, pump-houses and regulators listed in Schedule 2 of the gazette notification issued on the purview of the board so that their management is taken over by it from October 14. However, the two States are yet to give their official consent for the formal handover of the components. Sources stated that the two States are expected to give their consent for handing over at least some of the components, if not all, before or on the appointed day for the implementation of the Board’s purview, including the management of projects and their irrigation and hydel components. The meeting chaired by KRMB Chairman M.P. Singh and attended Special Chief (Irrigation) of Telangana Rajat Kumar, Secretary (Water Resources) of AP J. Syamala Rao, engineers-in-chief C. Muralidhar (Telangana), C. Narayana Reddy (AP) and others discussed a report submitted by a sub-committee of the board comprising two each of Chief Engineers of Irrigation and Genco from the two States and five officials of the board on the project systems to be taken over initially. The two States have also agreed to handover the detailed project reports of all projects in the Basin to the river board. Officials the two States expressed their reluctance to handover their hydel stations and schemes taken for diversion of Godavari to Krishna Basin to the board. Telangana put across its view again that hydel generation holds key in its plans to meet the needs of irrigation since it was being met mostly through lift irrigation schemes unlike AP. Telangana reiterated that there was no need to handover the hydel stations under its control at Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala since the activity was incidental to the release of water for drinking and irrigation needs and release of flood. Authorities of were of the view that hydel generation be left to the States by following the water release protocols and not resorting to generation without the board’s nod from time to time. Further, the Telangana side is said to have reiterated before the board that unlike in the Godavari Basin there were many complexities in the Krishna Basin and in the absence of clarity on project and component-wise water allocation their management by the board would lead to more differences. Besides, Telangana is also hopeful of the Centre’s intervention to put-off the gazette implementation at least for a few months till some contentious issues such as hydel generation, diversion schemes were sorted out, since it has made a plea to the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Jal Shakti Minister recently.

13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM slams ‘selective’ reading of rights issues||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday noted that the biggest infringement of human rights occurred when seen through a political prism, and warned against a “selective” interpretation of rights’ issues. Addressing the 28th foundation day of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) virtually, he “cautioned against the selective interpretation of human rights and using human rights to diminish the image of the country,” according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. Mr. Modi stated that some people were interpreting human rights from their own perspective as per “their selfish interests”. Human rights were being damaged due to the tendency of some to see violation of rights in some situations and not in other, similar situations. “This selective behaviour is equally damaging for democracy.” Duties were as important as rights, and these two should not be discussed separately. The government had worked to ensure the dignity of the poor as that was linked closely to the concept of human rights, he pointed out. He listed out schemes, such as opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, as examples. The government had addressed the injustice meted out to women over the years. “For decades, Muslim women had been demanding a law against triple talaq. We have given new rights to Muslim women by enacting a law against triple talaq,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-slams-selective-reading-of-rights-issues/article36976762.ece

13 October 2021||Lucknow,||Farmers plan to hold series of protests||At the final prayers for the four farmers and one journalist killed in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Tikonia on Tuesday, BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait demanded the arrest of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra. The Minister’s son Ashish Mishra was sent to three-day police custody on Monday for the murder charge against him. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and RLD president Jayant Chaudhary reached Tikonia and offered their respects at the ‘antim ardas’ ceremony of the five who were among the eight killed in the violent incident involving the convoy of Mr. Ajay Mishra. Mr. Tikait, who had on October 4 mediated between the protesting farmers and the UP government leading to the easing of tensions, on Tuesday said the andolan would go on till Mr. Ajay Mishra resigns, and demanded that he be arrested on charges of criminal conspiracy and sent to Agra jail along with his son to minimise chances of their influencing the case. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has planned a series of protests demanding action in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is a part of the SKM, said a rail roko has been planned for six hours on October 18. On October 15, the farmers would hold an effigy burning event and a big ‘panchayat’ would be held in Lucknow on October 26, Mr. Tikait said. The ashes of the farmers who were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri would be taken through other districts in urns and immersed in a river on October 24. Ms. Priyanka tweeted that the struggle would go on till the farmers and Kashyap “get justice”. Mr. Tikait questioned the treatment given to Ashish Mishra by the police, calling it a “red carpet arrest” and compared the remand to handing over a “bouquet” to him. Mr. Tikait was also questioned by several quarters for compromising “too soon” after the government had ceded to some of the farmers’ demands, including filing a murder case against Mr. Ashish Mishra. Many of the farmers who had arrived in Tikonia on October 4 were prepared for a long-drawn protest but had made their way back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-to-hold-a-series-of-protests/article36976655.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Malabar exercise could expand: U.S. Admiral||As the Quad group of countries began Phase II of the Malabar naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday said the exercise could expand and it was up to the “partners inside the Quad” to discuss that. “With respect to the Malabar, the exercise could expand in the future. It is up to the partners inside the Quad to discuss that. But there are multiple exercises that go on in the Indo-Pacific and globally every year, which bring in like-minded partners and allies to work together…,” Admiral Gilday said in a virtual interaction with a small group of journalists. He is on a five-day official visit to India from October 11. Stating that the India-U.S. relationship was central to a peaceful, free and stable Indo-Pacific, the Admiral said what they want to do “was really key on those capabilities that we find, which fill gaps between each other’s Navies”. High-end operations “Cyber would be among an area that we want to continue to refine in terms of working together as well as high-end operations, whether they be in the air, on the sea and under the sea.” On Tuesday, Admiral Gilday met Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh; Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat; and Minister of State for External Affairs. The discussions were primarily focused on the Indian Ocean, he said. He is also scheduled to embark on the U.S. Navy Carrier Strike Group, participating in Exercise Malabar, off the east coast of India along with an Indian delegation. To a question from The Hindu on the operationalisation of the various foundational agreements, Admiral Gilday said they moved out “very aggressively” with respect to the implementation. Stating that the agreements were significant in making the two sides more inter-operable, he referred to the use of each other’s airfields, ports and refuelling capabilities as examples. “They are operational now... Our communications and logistics agreements are alive, well and blossoming.” India had now signed all four foundational agreements with the U.S. — the logistics agreement in 2016, the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018 and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial cooperation (BECA) in 2020. While the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) was signed a long time ago, an extension to it, the Industrial Security Annex (ISA), was signed in 2019. Malabar Phase-II While Phase-I of Malabar was held in August and hosted by the U.S. Navy near Guam, Phase-II was being held between October 12 and 15 in the Bay of Bengal. Phase-II would build upon the synergy, coordination and inter-operability developed during Phase-I of the exercise and would focus on advanced surface and anti-submarine warfare exercises, seamanship evolutions and weapon firings, the Navy said. “The 25th edition of Malabar, being conducted in two phases, while observing all protocols during the pandemic, is reflective of the commitment of the participating countries to support a free, open, inclusive Indo-Pacific as well as a rules-based international order,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malabar-exercise-could-expand-us-admiral/article36976673.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. announces plastic waste recycling targets||The Environment Ministry has issued draft rules that mandate producers of plastic packaging material to collect all of their produce by 2024 and ensure that a minimum percentage of it be recycled as well as used in subsequent supply. It has also specified a system whereby makers and users of plastic packaging could collect certificates — called Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) certificates — and trade in them. The notification was expected to come into force by December 6 and, as of now, was open to public feedback. Only a fraction of plastic that cannot be recycled — such as multi-layered multi-material plastics — would be eligible to be sent for end-of-life disposal such as road construction, waste to energy, waste to oil and cement kilns. Only methods prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) would be permitted for their disposal. Plastic packaging, as per the rules made public on October 6, fall into three categories. The first is “rigid” plastic; category 2 is “flexible plastic packaging of single layer or multilayer (more than one layer with different types of plastic), plastic sheets and covers made of plastic sheet, carry bags (including carry bags made of compostable plastics), plastic sachet or pouches; and the third category is called multilayered plastic packaging, which has at least one layer of plastic and at least one layer of material other than plastic. Producers of plastic would be obliged to declare to the government, via a centralised website, how much plastic they produce annually. Companies would have to collect at least 35% of the target in 2021-22, 70% by 2022-23 and 100% by 2024. In 2024, a minimum 50% of their rigid plastic (category 1) would have to be recycled as would 30% of their category 2 and 3 plastic. Every year would see progressively higher targets and after 2026-27, 80% of their category 1 and 60% of the other two categories would need to be recycled. If entities cannot fulfil their obligations, they would on a “case by case basis” be permitted to buy certificates making up for their shortfall from organisations that have used recycled content in excess of their obligation. The CPCB would develop a “mechanism” for such exchanges on an online portal. Non-compliance would not invite a traditional fine. Instead an “environmental compensation” would be levied, though the rules do not specify how much this compensation would be.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-announces-plastic-waste-recycling-targets/article36976704.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||Modi scared to call China out: Cong.||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scared to call out China as an “aggressor”, the Congress alleged on Tuesday as the 13th round of senior military commander talks between India and China ended in a stalemate on Sunday last. It also questioned Mr. Modi’s “continued” silence in spite of fresh incursions by Chinese forces in Barahoti, Uttarakhand and the upper reaches of Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. During a press conference at the party headquarters, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the Ministry of External Affairs’ statement released on Monday raised some elementary questions. The Ministry had maintained that the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) had been caused by “unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter the status quo and in violation of bilateral agreements”. “Why did the Prime Minister lie to the country when he said that no one transgressed into the Indian territory?” Mr. Khera asked. ‘A clear failure’ Pointing to the August 30 incident, when 100 Chinese army personnel reportedly entered five km into Indian sovereign territory near Barahoti crossing in the Tun Jun La pass in Uttarakhand and stayed on for nearly three hours, he observed that it was a clear failure by the government and its agencies in guarding India’s security and sovereignty. Chinese incursions over the past couple of years had happened in almost all sectors — Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh — and the Chinese had been consolidating their infrastructure along the LAC. “The implications of the Chinese incursions are extremely critical, especially when the PLA [People’s Liberation Army]  isn’t even open to discuss de-escalation in two extremely strategic and critical sectors for India, Depsang and Daulat Beg Oldi sectors.” After the 12th round of military talks in August, it was agreed that there would be a mutual troop pullback from the Gogra area. “There has been massive troop consolidation by China along the Daulat Beg Oldi Sector. The PLA has also upgraded its weapons system in the region. It has been reported that at least in one location along the Demchok sector, they have the advanced S-400 air defence missile system that poses a threat to aircraft within a 400 km vicinity,” Mr. Khera added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-too-scared-to-call-china-out/article36976679.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Doctors cautiously welcome booster dose plan||While the Union Health Ministry has adopted a wait and watch policy, the medical fraternity has cautiously welcomed the recent observation by the World Health Organization (WHO) that persons with weaker immune systems should receive an additional shot of approved COVID-19 vaccines. The recommendation followed a four-day meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation and a final report was to be issued in December. “Persons who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed at any age will benefit from the booster shots as they are unable to generate adequate levels of immune response to the standard dose regimen. The same is likely to be true for many of the elderly above 65 years of age,” said Professor K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). Dr. Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said there was scientific evidence that a booster dose did help in augmenting the immunity of a person against COVID-19 and this was more relevant in the case of the immunocompromised. “As such, this group is more prone towards getting severe infections and suffering serious outcomes in comparison to a healthier population,” he pointed out. Dr. Ayush Gupta, consultant, pulmonology, critical care and sleep medicine at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, noted: “Although it sounds scientifically reasonable to do so, the evidence regarding the same is not very robust. We routinely give booster dose of vaccination for respiratory diseases like annual flu shots. However, the status in the vaccine is modified every year depending upon the prevalent strain in the community. This is not valid for COVID-19, as the same vaccine is being given for the booster dose as well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/doctors-cautiously-welcome-booster-dose-plan/article36976701.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Anticipatory bail can be set aside: SC||The Supreme Court has held that a superior court can set aside an anticipatory bail order if there was enough material to suggest that factors like gravity of the offence and the role of the accused in the crime were not considered by the lower court. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said a court, while considering an application for grant of anticipatory bail, had to consider the nature of the offence, the role of the person, the likelihood of his influencing the course of investigation, etc. The apex court judgment set aside an anticipatory bail granted by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in a murder case. The High Court had granted the bail, despite refusal by the trial court earlier. A man was shot dead by two men while a third held him down over a rivalry. “Courts ought to be generally guided by considerations such as the nature and gravity of the offences, the role attributed to the applicant and the facts of the case, while considering whether to grant anticipatory bail,” Justice Chandrachud wrote in the judgment. The court reiterated the settled law that an appellate or superior court could set aside anticipatory bail granted by a lower court on the ground that the latter “did not consider material facts or crucial circumstances”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anticipatory-bail-can-be-set-aside-sc/article36976706.ece
13 October 2021||JAIPUR,||Duty of Opposition is to visit spot of strife: Rajasthan CM||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday criticised the comparison being made between a Dalit man’s killing in Hanumangarh district in the State and the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri of Uttar Pradesh. He said the BJP leaders making the comparison lacked sense in reacting to violent incidents. A 29-year-old Dalit man was beaten to death by a group of persons at Prempura village last week and his body dumped outside his house. The assailants recorded the assault on video and circulated it on social media. Police have so far arrested seven persons in the case. While affirming that prompt action was taken and the accused apprehended, Mr. Gehlot questioned the wisdom of BJP leaders’ demanding that Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi visit the village. “Why should they visit a Congress-ruled State? It is the Opposition which should go there and point out the shortcomings, if any,” he told reporters after a function at the Secretariat here. The Prime Minister, the Home Minister or the BJP national president should come to Hanumangarh to see what happened there, Mr. Gehlot said. No BJP leader had gone to the house of the deceased, he pointed out. “The Opposition leaders are sitting here in Jaipur and want to remain in the news. They are making useless comments on social media. Only today they have thought of sending a delegation [to Prempura],” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/duty-of-opposition-is-to-visit-spot-of-strife-rajasthan-cm/article36976659.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||Judges appointed to Madras, Allahabad and Gauhati HCs||The Law Ministry on Tuesday notified the appointment of 15 lawyers and two judicial officers as judges of the Madras, the Allahabad and the Gauhati High Courts. Judicial officer Marli Vankung, who has been appointed as a judge of the Gauhati HC, is not only the first woman judge from Mizoram but also the first High Court judge from the State. Between August 8 and September 1, the Supreme Court Collegium had processed over 100 names recommended by various High Courts and had finally sent 68 names to the Government for appointment to 12 High Courts. On August 24, the Collegium recommended eight lawyers who have now been appointed as judges in the Allahabad High Court. They are Chandra Kumar Rai, Krishan Pahal, Sameer Jain, Ashutosh Srivastava, Subhash Vidyarthi, Brij Raj Singh, Shree Prakash Singh and Vikas Budhwar. On September 1, the Collegium recommended the names of advocates Sundaram Srimathy, D. Bharatha Chakravarthy, R. Vijayakumar and Mohammad Shaffiq for the Madras High Court. For the Gauhati High Court, the Collegium had on the same day recommended advocates Devashis Baruah, Kakheto Sema, Arun Dev Choudhury along with judicial officers Malasri Nandi and Marli Vankung. Three additional judges of the Gauhati High Court — Soumitra Saikia, Parthivjyoti Saikia and S.

13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi to launch master plan for multimodal connectivity||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a national master plan for multimodal connectivity called ‘PM GatiShakti’ on Wednesday, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Tuesday. The PMO said infrastructure development had faced many problems for decades, including a lack of coordination between departments leading to multiple agencies digging up roads for laying cables, pipelines, etc. “This not only caused great inconvenience but was also a wasteful expenditure… PM GatiShakti will address the past issues through institutionalising holistic planning for stakeholders for major infrastructure projects.” Infrastructure plans would be designed and executed with a common vision, instead of being made in silos, it said. The master plan would cover projects of many Ministries and State Governments, including Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, UDAN, textile clusters, defence corridors, electronic parks, industrial corridors, fishing clusters and agricultural zones. Movement of people and goods would be made seamless with the multimodal connectivity envisaged under the master plan, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-to-launch-master-plan-for-multi-modal-connectivity/article36976669.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Veer Savarkar an icon of Indian history, will remain so: Rajnath||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said there was a campaign going on to “defame” the legacy of Veer Savarkar over the years, and there was a lack of correct information about him that needed to be addressed. He was speaking at the launch of the book Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition by Information Commissioner Uday Mahurkar and academic Chirayu Pandit. At the same function, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh described Savarkar as an “icon of Indian history”, and that it had been at the request of Mahatma Gandhi that Savarkar had filed a mercy petition to the British. ‘Spreading lies’ “Many are spreading lies about Savarkar that he apologised to the British. However, the truth is that this petition was filed as legal rights at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi so that he could come out of jail and join the freedom movement,” the Defence Minister said. “He was an icon of Indian history and will remain so. There can be differences of opinions about him, but to look down on him as inferior is not appropriate and justifiable. He was a freedom fighter and a staunch nationalist, but people who follow the Marxist and Leninist ideology are the ones who accuse Savarkar of being a fascist...,” Mr. Singh said, adding that hatred towards him was illogical and unplaced. “Savarkar was very forthright in saying that India’s relations with other countries should depend on how conducive they are to India’s security and its interests, irrespective of what kind of government there was,” Mr. Singh added. “Savarkar was India’s first military strategic affairs expert of the 20th century, who gave the country a robust defence and diplomatic doctrine,” Mr. Singh said. Mr. Bhagwat said Savarkar’s ideology of Hindutva never suggested differentiation between people on the basis of their culture and “methodology of worshipping god”. “Savarkar used to ask why do we differentiate when we are sons of the same mother land... The different methodologies of worship have been the tradition of our country. We have been fighting for the country together,” he said, adding that this was his Hindutva. Underlining that Savarkar was not an enemy of Muslims, Mr. Bhagwat said he had written many ghazal s in Urdu. “He didn’t hate Muslims, he knew Urdu too. There are many thoughts in a democracy. Those who do not know the generosity of Savarkar’s ideas, they defame him. Savarkar had given a statement that Gandhi ji is needed by the country. Gandhi ji should work keeping in good health because he is needed. Ambedkar ji and Gandhi ji have been appreciated by all, but petty people have made frivolous allegations against Savarkar,” he said. “Hindutva is one which is eternal,” he said, adding that “talk of separatism cannot be a matter of privilege”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/veer-savarkar-an-icon-of-indian-history-will-remain-so-rajnath/article36976676.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supreme Court comes down on repeated petitions to modify verdict||The Supreme Court has belled the cat on the “clever move” to repeatedly file miscellaneous applications to “modify” or “clarify” its judgments. The court said such conduct on the part of some litigants has no legal foundation. It should be firmly discouraged. Such machinations reduce litigation to a gambit. In the past few years, private parties with “resources”, corporates and even the government have returned, time and again, to the Supreme Court after a judgment to “clarify” or “modify” the verdict. The move has seen brakes pulled on the implementation of the judgment and, far worse, the case being dragged on in court for years after the verdict. The court views this as a deliberate move to avoid compliance with the judgment. “The hallmark of a judicial pronouncement is its stability and finality. Judicial verdicts are not like sand dunes, which are subject to the vagaries of wind and weather,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and B.V. Nagarathna observed in a recent order. The court saw in the filing of repeated applications, “styled as miscellaneous applications”, after the pronouncement of final judgment the emergence of a “disturbing trend”. “Applications are becoming a preferred course to those with resources to pursue strategies to avoid compliance with judicial decisions. A judicial pronouncement cannot be subject to modification once the judgment has been pronounced, by filing a miscellaneous application. Filing of a miscellaneous application seeking modification/clarification of a judgment is not envisaged in law. Further, it is a settled legal principle that one cannot do indirectly what one cannot do directly,” the court noted. Abuse of process The court referred to its earlier judgments that called these “miscellaneous applications” an attempt for review of the entire judgment in the guise of a “clarification”. “It is an application seeking in substance a review of the judgment. By disguising the application as one for ‘clarification’, the attempt is to seek a hearing in the open court, avoiding the procedure governing the review petitions which, as per the rules of this court, are to be dealt with in chambers. Such an attempt on the part of the applicant has to be deprecated,” the court had said. The apex court had held that just by describing an application as one for “clarification” or “modification”, though it is really one of review, a party cannot be permitted to circumvent or bypass the circulation procedure and indirectly obtain a hearing. “In a country governed by the rule of law, finality of the judgment is absolutely imperative, and great sanctity is attached to the finality of the judgment. Permitting the parties to reopen the concluded judgments of this court by filing repeated interlocutory applications is clearly an abuse of the process of law,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-comes-down-on-repeated-petitions-to-modify-verdict/article36976692.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘PhD requirement postponed till 2023’||Candidates for recruitment as assistant professors this year will not be required to have a PhD. The Centre has amended University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations to delay the mandatory requirement of a PhD to July 2023. In a letter to all university Vice Chancellors on Tuesday, UGC Member Secretary Rajnish Jain said the decision was taken in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the plan to postpone the mandatory requirement would help the campaign to fill vacant faculty positions at Central Universities. The assistant professor is an entry-level position in universities, which could be filled by Master’s degree holders who had qualified through the UGC’s National Eligibility Test. In 2018, the Centre brought in the UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education) Regulation, which required that all candidates for the assistant professor position had a doctoral degree. It gave a three year period for the transition, saying the mandatory requirement would be introduced from July 1, 2021 for the 2021-22 academic year. However, UGC has now decided to put this requirement on hold for another two years, giving prospective university faculty more time to complete their PhDs. In an interaction with presspersons on September 30, the Education Minister said the requirement was one of the hurdles to filling up vacant faculty positions, as many candidates were not PhD degree holders. There are more than 6,000 sanctioned positions, which are vacant at the Central universities alone and Mr. Pradhan had given them an October-end deadline to fill these seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/phd-requirement-postponed-till-2023/article36976708.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress silent on some atrocities: BJP||The BJP on Tuesday questioned Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over what they termed as the duo’s silence on atrocities against Dalits in Congress-ruled States. At a press conference at the party headquarters here, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “Both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra project themselves as champions of Dalit rights but why are they silent on atrocities against the Scheduled Castes in Rajasthan and other States?” Citing alleged incidents of atrocities against members of the Scheduled Caste (SC) communities in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the BJP said those who project themselves as champions of Dalit rights are ignoring such incidents. Mr. Patra also asked why leaders from various political parties, who went on “political tourism” in Uttar Pradesh in the wake of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, did not visit Congress-ruled States when incidents of atrocities against Dalits are reported from these States. Echoing similar sentiments, BJP general secretary Dushyant Gautam alleged that it was the Congress party that showed disrespect to Dalit icon BR Ambedkar and never gave him his due respect during its rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-silent-on-some-atrocities-bjp/article36976650.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||MHA begins talks with Gorkha leaders, West Bengal Govt.||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday began tripartite talks with Gorkha representatives from the Darjeeling hills, and the Terai and Dooars regions, and the Government of West Bengal. The MHA said in a statement that “the talks aimed at resolving the issues related to the Gorkhas”, and are chaired by Home Minister Amit Shah. The Gorkha delegation was led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Darjeeling, Raju Bista, who highlighted various issues concerning the Gorkhas and the region. Mr. Bista told The Hindu that Mr. Shah heard their demands and asked them to come up with practical solutions under the framework of the Constitution in the next meeting that’s expected to be held in November. When asked if the delegation comprising BJP legislators and alliance partners raised the demand for Gorkhaland (a separate State for Gorkhas), Mr. Bista said, “It is a 100-year-old demand. We specifically mentioned though that this meeting is not about the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), which is an unconstitutional body, where the members are chosen arbitrarily by the Mamata [Banerjee] government. We presented our demands, now they will hear the West Bengal government in the next meeting.” “The Home Minister said that he has heard our demand and next they will call the West Bengal government. He also asked us to come prepared with some more options and practical solutions under the Constitution for the next meeting,” said Mr. Bista. The Chief Secretary of West Bengal did not appear for the meeting. The State was represented by Krishna Gupta, Principal Resident Commissioner in Delhi. When asked why non-BJP parties were not called for the meeting, Mr. Bista said, “The West Bengal government will anyway present their side in the next meeting,” adding this was the first occasion when formal tripartite talks on the Gorkha issue had been called.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mha-begins-talks-with-gorkha-leaders-west-bengal-govt/article36976664.ece
13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. lifts cap on flights airlines can operate||Over the past 18 months, the Government has been regulating the number of flights airlines can operate in tandem with passenger demand by imposing a cap of 30% to 85%. At present, airlines are allowed to operate 85% of the pre-COVID flight schedule approved by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “After review of the current status of scheduled domestic operations vis-a-vis passenger demand for air travel... it has been decided to restore the scheduled domestic air operations with effect from 18.10.2021 without any capacity restriction,” an order from the Ministry of Civil Aviation read. Skyrocketing airfare With the Durga Puja and Navaratri festivities beginning, last weekend saw massive crowds at two of the biggest airports in the country — New Delhi and Mumbai. This compelled both airports to announce reopening of passenger terminal buildings which had thus far remained shut in view of modest travel demand. Saturday also saw the number of air travellers breach the three lakh-mark for the first time since the COVID-19 second wave. This is 70% of pre-COVID numbers of nearly 4.25 lakh domestic passengers a day. A cap on capacity amid rising demand led to airfares skyrocketing. A Delhi-Bengaluru flight booked in the next three weeks will cost Rs. 12,900 to Rs. 14,900; a Delhi-Patna flight booked in the next three weeks will cost Rs. 9,600 to Rs. 10,300 and a Chennai-Delhi flight in the same period costs Rs. 13,700 to Rs. 14,700. Airfares taper down after Deepavali on November 4. ‘Welcome move’ “It is a welcome move as we believe that with recent pent-up demand, combined with the coming festive season, it will be great to operate flights on pre-pandemic levels. We are bullish about the overall growth and demand for domestic travel,” IndiGo said in a statement. “Recently, the market has seen a great bounce-back to over three lakh daily air travellers. So, the numbers support the government move to add capacity. A cap of 85% would have led to capacity constraints and higher airfares on peak routes as demand is likely to shoot up further for Deepavali and New Year. So, in all it’s a great move for both passengers and airlines,” said Aloke Bajpai, Group CEO and Co-founder, ixigo. “With the festive season round the corner, we believe that the measure is well-timed and a strong step in boosting the country’s travel and tourism sentiments. The strong vaccination drive and a decline in active cases have led to a positive travel sentiment, and this newly announced measure is set to further enable the safe and seamless recovery of the sector,” according to Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder, EaseMyTrip.com.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-lifts-cap-on-flights-airlines-can-operate/article36976665.ece
13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||PM slams ‘selective’ reading of rights issues||Duties were as important as rights, and these two should not be discussed separately. The government had worked to ensure the dignity of the poor as that was linked closely to the concept of human rights, he pointed out. He listed out schemes such as toilet construction under Swachh Bharat Mission and bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana as examples. The government had addressed the injustice meted out to women over the years. “For decades, Muslim women had been demanding a law against triple talaq. We have given new rights to Muslim women by enacting a law against triple talaq,” he observed. Home Minister Amit Shah, addressing the gathering in person earlier, noted that the NHRC had disposed 20 lakh cases and recommended compensation of Rs. 205 crore in total in its 28 years. Mr. Shah stressed that he wanted to bring to the attention of human rights activists that the Modi government had focused on the rights of the 60 crore poor in the country, which was something that had been left out of the conversation of those who speak for human rights. ‘Condemn violence’ NHRC chairperson Justice (retired) Arun Kumar Mishra remarked that it was unfortunate that political violence was still prevalent in the world. It was inappropriate to refer to “terrorists” as “freedom fighters”, he said. He called on social organisations and human rights defenders to condemn political violence and terrorism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-slams-selective-reading-of-rights-issues/article36976653.ece
13 October 2021||Srinagar,||5 militants killed in Shopian operation||Five militants, including three affiliates of The Resistance Front (TRF) that was behind the recent civilian killings in the Valley, were killed and two multi-storey houses were damaged in multiple anti-militancy operations in south Kashmir’s Shopian on Tuesday. Three militants were killed in Shopian’s Tulran area, where an anti-militancy operation was launched on Monday evening. The militants were trapped inside a residential house and refused to surrender “despite repeated offers by the security forces”. “Out of three killed terrorists, one terrorist has been identified as Mukhtar Shah of Ganderbal, who shifted to Shopian after killing street hawker Virendra Paswan of Bihar [last week],” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Two multi-storey residential houses were damaged after security forces used explosives to flush out militants. Three cowsheds and apple boxes were also destroyed in the fire. Hours later, two militants were killed in an encounter at Shopian’s Feripora area. In the Jammu province’s Pir Panjal valley, the anti-militancy operation entered the second day on Tuesday to nab the armed militants who killed five soldiers, including a Junior Commissioned Officer, in the Poonch-Rajouri belt. A total of 12 persons, including seven militants and five soldiers, were killed in five separate encounters in the Union Territory since Monday. The General Officer Commanding (GoC), 15 Corps, Lieutenant General D.P. Pandey, on Tuesday said he would not like to connect these operations with any of the events that took place in Srinagar or elsewhere. However, he noted that the civilian killings were highly condemnable. “Security forces and people need to be very careful to keep the communal harmony intact,” he pointed out. The Army was alert and ready to foil any attempt of infiltration on the Line of Control, he added. NIA raids The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday launched raids on the cadre of militant outfits in the Kashmir Valley. An NIA spokesman said they conducted searches at 16 locations. “The raids were made in connection with a terrorism conspiracy case, pertaining to conspiracy for conducting violent terrorist acts in J&K.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5-militants-killed-in-shopian-operation/article36976661.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Orders of Rs. 65,000 cr. moved to new DPSUs||Ahead of the formal launch of the seven new Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSU), formed out the erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has converted all pending orders with the 41 factories under it into deemed contracts worth over Rs. 65,000 crore for the new companies, according to defence officials. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally launch the seven new DPSUs on October 15 via videoconferencing. On June 16, the Union Cabinet approved a long-awaited reform plan to corporatise the OFB, following which effective October 1, all its assets, employees and management were transferred to the seven DPSUs. “All the indents previously placed on the OFB by various Services, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and state police have been converted into deemed contracts numbering 66 with a cumulative value of more than Rs. 65,000 crore,” a defence official said. Consultations held This process had been smoothly concluded following months of extensive consultations with all the stakeholders prior to the unveiling of the new defence companies, the official stated. In addition, it was also decided that 60% of the annual price of the indents would be paid by the Services to the new DPSUs as mobilisation advance, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/orders-of-rs-65000-cr-moved-to-new-dpsus/article36976747.ece

Manufacturing growth Manufacturing grew 9.7%, electricity by 16% and mining output rose a sharp 23.6% in August, but each of these sectors had recorded negative growth rates in 2020. Overall, however, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) actually declined in August from July, noted Ms. Nayar. “The improvement was limited to primary goods and consumer non-durables, with all the other categories reporting a moderation in growth in August relative to July,” she said, adding that the IIP was 3.9% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Consumer durables’ production remained below pre-COVID levels, “highlighting the enduring impact of the pandemic on big-ticket demand”, she underlined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/retail-inflation-falls-to-five-month-low-of-435/article36976749.ece
13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Modi for ‘humanitarian help’ to Afghanistan||“A unified international response based on UNSC Resolution 2593 is necessary to improve the situation in Afghanistan,” he said in a set of social media messages after he attended the G20 meeting, called to discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Addressing the virtual meeting, Mr. Modi referred to good people-to-people contacts between India and Afghanistan and informed the Italy-led deliberation that India had implemented over 500 development projects in Afghanistan in the last two decades. The Prime Minister supported the role of the United Nations in solving the current crisis in Afghanistan, and also highlighted the harmony between the UN and the G20 in this regard. “The Prime Minister also underlined the need to ensure that the Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally. He emphasised on the need to ensure our joint fight against the nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and arms in the region,” said an official statement released after Mr. Modi’s speech at the meeting.  The call for humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan has become stronger in recent weeks as the country faces a grim winter ahead because of food and medicine shortages. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had called for similar humanitarian measures in his speech at a high level meeting in the UN last month on the situation in Afghanistan. Taliban’s foreign affairs spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on Monday the Taliban (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) would protect those who wish to help the country at present. “We are committed to protecting humanitarian workers and diplomats so that they are able to work in a safe environment,” said Mr. Balkhi after a delegation led by the Taliban Foreign Minister, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, met with Germany’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Jasper Weick in Doha on Monday. India’s position on Afghanistan articulated by Mr. Modi on Tuesday shows consistency as India has not yet recognised the Taliban set-up in Kabul as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. However, Germany became the latest G20 member-state to engage with Mr. Muttaqi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-for-humanitarian-help-to-afghanistan/article36976666.ece

13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. nod for fertilizer subsidy||The Centre has approved an additional fertilizer subsidy of Rs. 28,655 crore for the rabi or winter planting season, which runs from October 2021 to March 2022. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the new nutrient-based subsidy rates for phosphatic and potassic fertilisers on Tuesday. Unlike urea where the Centre sets a fixed maximum retail price, non-urea fertilizer prices are decontrolled, with the government fixing nutrient-based subsidy rates instead. The subsidy is paid to fertilizer companies as compensation for selling their products to farmers below market prices. Thus, the price a farmer pays for a 50-kg bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), the most popular fertilizer after urea, would continue to remain at Rs. 1,200. The increased subsidy would offset the hike in global rates of DAP, nitrogen, phosphate and potassic fertilizers. The Cabinet also approved the Rs. 2.77-lakh crore Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 and the Rs. 1.41-lakh crore Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 — both of which were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 1. It also gave the green signal to a proposal to affiliate 100 government and private schools with the Sainik School Society, run by the Defence Ministry. They would admit 5,000 students in Class 6 from the next academic year 2022-23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-nod-for-fertilizer-subsidy/article36976677.ece

13 October 2021||New Delhi,||HC rejects pleas challenging Rakesh Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner||Dismissing petitions challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that there was no irregularity, illegality or infirmity in his selection. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said that the procedure adopted for appointment of the 1984-batch IPS officer was being followed for “nearly over a decade” and some “free movement of joints” has to be given to authorities in such matters in view of the unique requirements of the national capital. The petitions were filed by one Sadre Alam and another by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), an NGO. Mr. Asthana took charge as the Commissioner of Delhi Police on July 28. His appointment came just days before his superannuation on July 31. He will have a tenure of one year. His appointment has been contested on the ground that the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) in appointing him was “completely illegal on multiple grounds”. Mr. Alam said the appointment was “in clear and blatant breach” of the directions of the Supreme Court of India as Mr. Asthana “did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months”, and that no Union Public Service Commission panel was formed for the purpose. ‘Demoralising effect’ Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the CPIL, said that Centre’s stand that it found no eligible officers in the Union Territory cadre for the appointment was “astounding” and had a “demoralising effect”. Earlier, the Centre had said that the appointment was done in “public interest” taking into account the Capital’s policing issues which not only had national security but also cross-border implications. The Centre, in an affidavit, had said best attempts were made to find a suitable Indian Police Service officer having diverse experience of policing in a vast State or Central Investigating Agency or National Security or Para-military force from the options available in AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram, Union Territories) cadre. However, as AGMUT cadre comprised those from the Union Territories and small Northeastern States, it was felt that requisite experience of working and supervising the central investigating agency/para-military force and police force of a large State having diverse political and law and order problem was lacking in the present pool of available officers, the Centre said. Mr. Asthana had stated that apart from the CPIL, another NGO named Common Cause had been selectively campaigning against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-rejects-pleas-challenging-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-commissioner/article36976668.ece

13 October 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||ED investigating properties accumulated by Jamtara online fraudsters||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started a probe into the accumulation of huge properties by online fraudsters at Jamtara, widely dubbed as the country’s cybercrime capital, following a request from the Jharkhand Police. “We had reported to the ED about 14 such people, who did not apparently have any known sources of income, yet they boasted of immoveable properties any upper middle class person would envy. The ED has already begun a probe. Action has been taken against two persons, and three others will soon be booked. The agency is in the process of rounding up others,” Jamtara Superintendent of Police Deepak Kumar Sinha told The Hindu over phone. He said, “We are keeping a close watch on these swindlers. Some people have amassed immoveable properties in their names while others have done it in someone else’s name to evade action by law enforcement agencies.” “In addition to the 14 names, another list of 12 people has been prepared and will soon be handed over to ED for further probe,” Mr. Sinha said. The initial investigation by Jamtara district police has found that criminals have bought vehicles, shops and residential houses in the names of benamis. Many of them have not even passed matriculation, but have learnt tricks of manipulation with technical advice from experts for executing white-collar crimes. I-T to be kept in loop “As part of our drive, we focus on certain properties held by suspects. Subsequently, we verify who possess them and if we find evidence of ill-gotten wealth, we intensify our investigation. The Income Tax department will also be kept in the loop,” said Jamtara police chief. Police have detected properties worth Rs. 2 crore belonging to one of persons whose name figures in the list referred to the ED. “But, as per our estimate, his total wealth would not be less than Rs. 10 crore,” said Mr. Sinha. After the district police turned its focus on tracking properties accumulated by the fraudsters, some of them reportedly bought flats, hotels and plots outside Jharkhand to dodge the local police. “This is where ED would come into the investigation process,” said the Jamtara SP. Jamtara has earned the dubious distinction of being the cybercrime capital of the country with youth finding online fraud as a source of earning quick money. They have mastered phishing by operating from remote locations and keeping out of sight of the law enforcement agencies. Over the past several years, police from many States have visited Jamtara in search of such fraudsters. During the past one year, 300 people involved in cybercrime have been caught and sent to jail in Jamtara and the police have a list of 1,200 fraudsters.  Some people have amassed immoveable properties in their names, while others have done it in someone else’s name to evade action Deepak Kumar Sinha Jamtara Superintendent of Police||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-investigating-properties-accumulated-by-jamtara-online-fraudsters/article36976693.ece

The State Bank of India, Chennai Circle, donated a rescue vehicle to “Kaaval Karangal”. The initiative was started by Greater Chennai Police last March with an objective to extend support to the homeless and uncared for citizens. The keys of the vehicle were handed over by R. Radhakrishna, chief general manager, SBI Chennai Circle, to Mr. Jiwal in the presence of Vinod Jaiswal, general manager and other senior officials from the police department and the bank. After flagging off the vehicle, the Commissioner said: “So far, 944 homeless or uncared persons were rescued under the initiative and 691 of them were sheltered in care homes. As many as 63 were reunited with their families and 60 are being given psychological treatment at the hospitals. Over 130 who died were given a decent burial.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/944-homeless-persons-rescued/article36976865.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Garbage, sewage ruining Madipakkam lake||The Madipakkam Lake, which was rejuvenated a few years ago, is fast becoming a picture of neglect with waste being thrown into the lake and sewage let into it. Abutting Karthikeyapuram on one side and Ayyappan Nagar on the other, the waterbody is a hub of activity every day in the mornings and evenings with people walking, exercising and socialising. Spot-billed pelicans and cormorants can be seen flocking the lake. But now garbage is dumped into the lake and sewage flows through the rainwater inlet. In recent weeks, the dumping of waste has reached serious proportions, say a few regular walkers. Empty liquor bottles, plastic cups, empty food packets, small plastic bags, and used sand bags lay discarded on the bund of the lake or near the walkway. “In fact, a lot of garbage is dumped near the entrance of the lake near the Srinivasa Perumal temple. That entrance provides easy access to walkers to Keelkattalai. Sometimes, it becomes impossible to even stand there,” Rajan M., a frequent walker at the lake, said. During multiple visits to the lake, which is an important groundwater source to the surrounding localities, buffaloes were seen swimming in the waters, after somehow making their way through the mesh fence put up around the lake. The empty space in the cut up fence was covered with logs recently but they had vanished by Monday. Those who frequent the lake and people who use the path to commute from one side to another as it cuts down the walking distance between the localities, want lights to be put up around the walkway for safety during evenings and at night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garbage-sewage-ruining-madipakkam-lake/article36976861.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Money multiplying racket busted, five arrested||A five-member gang that allegedly cheated more than 18,000 people in Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruppur in the guise of investment in a money-doubling scheme was arrested. Assistant Commissioner of Police, Neelankarai, K.N. Sudarshan, said: “In this case, the accused had modest educational background but they have cheated well-educated people using a unique modus operandi in the city and several parts of the State. We have arrested five persons and further investigation is on to trace a woman accomplice.” The main accused Sathish Kumar, 35, is a school dropout. The gang members started their operations in the guise of multi-level marketing (MLM) a decade ago and cheated several investors in the western districts and later they expanded their operations. Modus operandi They appointed team leaders to canvas and bring the investors to the firm on a commission basis, the police said. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, R. Kamalakannan, inspector of police in Neelankarai station, said the accused would lure people claiming to possess a stock of iridium with a firm called ‘John MacNan’ in Germany and were willing to sell the item. They promised to give up to Rs. 10 lakh on an investment of Rs. 10,000 from the proceeds from the sale. But they failed to give the returns as promised. They set up an office in a posh bungalow on East Coast Road in Neelankarai with a few computer peripherals and pretended to be busy with paper work needed to bring the sale proceeds from Germany. They conducted “business meetings” with team leaders and canvassed investments. At a meeting held on Sunday, a team leader questioned the accused about the promised returns, which resulted in a commotion. Based on a complaint given by K. Chalapathy, 53, of Mogappair, police rounded up the gang at the bungalow and arrested five of them — Satish Kumar, 35, and Raja, 37, of Tiruppur, Mohan Kumar, 47, and Saravana Kumar, 43, of Coimbatore and Balakrishnan, 50, of Tiruchi. Laptops, desktops and two cars were seized from them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/money-multiplying-racket-busted-five-arrested/article36976854.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Biomining begins at Perungudi dump||Greater Chennai Corporation on Tuesday announced the launch of the dump reclamation project in the city. Municipal Administration Minister K.N. Nehru and Health Minister Ma. Subramanian launched the biomining project in Perungudi dump in the presence of Municipal Administration and Water Supply Secretary Shiv Das Meena and Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. The Perungudi dump reclamation project, using biomining technology, hopes to reclaim 94.42 acres of land that has been polluted because of 16,26,038 cubic metres of municipal solid waste. The total area of Perungudi dump is 225 acres, which is an encroachment on the Pallikaranai marshland. Residents in the area have been protesting against the dumping of waste for the past few decades. Tenders floated The Corporation floated a tender in November 2020, dividing the reclamation of the dump into six packages. Of the six packages, packages 3, 4 and 5 were awarded to Zigma Global Environ Solutions, which is said to be one of the largest biomining companies in India. In package 3, biomining will be carried out on 35.5 acres of the dump. In package 4, an area of 22.36 acres will be covered. In package 5, another 36.56 acres of land will be reclaimed. The project was awarded in February 2021 and is set to be completed within 39 months, the officials said. Zigma started the commercial production of the package 5 in October 2021. Officials said reclamation of land at the dump would help reduce the carbon dioxide emission by 3,75,342 tonne every year. The process will produce refuse derived fuel (RDF) which will be used as an alternative fuel to coal in cement plants. The processing of RDF in Perungudi dump is expected to result in the savings of 2,29,557 tonnes of carbon, which is equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 2,81,248 acres of forests in one year or planting of 37,95,774 tree seedlings grown for 10 years, officials said. Machine commissioned In Kodungaiyur dump in north Chennai, Mr. Nehru and HR and CE Minister P.K. Sekarbabu launched the processing machine for construction debris. Dumping of construction debris has led to the accumulation of a huge quantity of waste in Kodungaiyur dump.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/biomining-begins-at-perungudi-dump/article36976858.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GCC cancels contract following allegations of irregularities||The Greater Chennai Corporation on Tuesday said that it was cancelling the Rs. 1.18-crore contract awarded to a company for the annual maintenance of 419 battery-operated vehicles (BOVs). The move followed a complaint by the non-governmental organisation Arappor Iyakkam , alleging “fixing” of tenders to favour a particular company. The organisation said the conditions of the tenders were framed in such a way that only one company qualified in the technical bid while others, which included some manufacturers of BOVs, were rejected. The tenders were floated as four separate packages in July 2021 and were finalised and awarded in September 2021 to Coimbatore-based Best and Fast Metal Fab, which was the only company to qualify for the technical bid and enter the financial bid. According to Arappor Iyakkam , an “irrational” condition was imposed that the bidders should have supplied at least 50 vehicles on an average during three financial years from April 2016 to March 2019. Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of the organisation, said while it was common to expect experience in recent three years, it was strange that a period from 2016 to 2019 was mentioned. Elimination “Many local bodies in the State began using battery-operated vehicles extensively only in the past three years. It is okay if there was an option of having experience either in the last three years or from 2016 to 2019. However, seeking experience only from 2016 to 2019 is done with an intention to eliminate other companies,” Mr. Jayaram Venkatesan alleged. The organisation said that the recent financial year of 2020-2021 was excluded in the eligibility condition pertaining to annual turnover of the bidder.  Importantly, the organisation alleged that the awarding of the contract was in violation of the tender conditions relating to conflicts of interest and the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act. Appreciating GCC’s recent initiatives to bring transparency to the tender process, Arappor Iyakkam urged for stringent action against officials exploiting other loopholes to “fix” tenders. Sources from GCC said that Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi had ordered cancellation of the contract based as preliminary inquiries confirmed the conflict of interest between two firms that took part in the bidding. Meanwhile, a detailed inquiry would be conducted by Deputy Commissioner of Health Manish S. Narnaware to prevent such instances in the future and take appropriate action against those involved, including the contractor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gcc-cancels-contract-following-allegations-of-irregularities/article36976872.ece

13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu releases draft Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy||The State government on Tuesday released the draft version of its Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy in the public domain to invite feedback from all stakeholders. An announcement was earlier made during the budget that the State government will formulate a new Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, which has been demanded for long by activists and the civil society. Basic amenities The draft policy, which has been uploaded on the website of Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (TNUHDB), appeared to focus more on community engagement from the initial stages of the resettlement process and ensuring that the areas where the communities are to be resettled fulfilled the basic amenities from a holistic perspective that included employment, healthcare and education. The draft said that the policy will be applicable for involuntary resettlements involving evictions from encroached areas by non-titleholders. The policy mandated the formation of “Resettlement Committees” for each resettlement scheme with representation of women, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes from the affected areas and voluntary organisations, apart from officials from different departments involved. It also mandated the constitution of State-level and district-level habitat Development Committees to focus on facilitating inter-departmental coordination, creating basic amenities to ensure sustainable livelihood, ensure delivery of welfare schemes, and redress grievances. The draft policy said that the resettlement location must be decided in such a way that the travelling time by bus or train should not be more than 30 minutes to reach the nearest urban area. Lands affected by industrial pollution, environmental degradation, and lands that fell under buffer zones of ecologically sensitive zones must be avoided as resettlement locations, it also said. According to the policy, the projected affected families must be engaged from the early stages of the resettlement with more focus on dissemination of information and confidence building measures. The enumeration exercise must include tenants living in affected areas. Identification of vulnerable families with elders, people with disabilities, women receiving social security pensions, and identification of educational needs of children living in the affected areas should be part of the enumeration process, the policy said. A Resettlement and Rehabilitation Scheme (RRS) must be formulated for every resettlement project, which has to be subjected to public consultation. The Resettlement Committees should meet once every month after the finalisation of RRS to track the progress of resettlement. Entitlement matrix The policy included an entitlement matrix with the list of things the people to be resettled will be entitled to. This included subsistence allowance, shifting allowance, employment assistance, availability of public facilities like anganwadis, community halls etc. The policy also focussed on capacity building to sensitise officials on the issues involved in the resettlement and conduct of social audit after two years of resettlement. Stakeholders can provide feedback through an online form available on the website of TNUHDB till October 27. While concerns have been raised about the non-availability of the draft in Tamil, officials from TNUHDB said that a Tamil version will be made available in two days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-releases-draft-resettlement-and-rehabilitation-policy/article36976879.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK gearing up to face challenging times||The results of the rural local bodies elections in nine districts have not come as a huge surprise to the AIADMK, which is gradually coming to terms with the reality after losing power five months ago. The local bodies elections invariably go in favour of the party in power, says a senior leader, who is in charge of one of the key northern districts. But the leadership, he says, is conscious of the party’s basic strength — an extensive organisational network — and aware of the need for building on the strength so that the party can bounce back in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. Many others hold a similar view. However, the functionaries concede that the party’s strength needs to be maintained at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Naam Tamilar Katchi, the Pattali Makkal Katchi and the Makkal Needhi Maiam are keen on expanding their vote base, making use of the opportunity presented by the Assembly election verdict. “These parties sense that the vote base of the AIADMK, which is bereft of any charismatic leader, should be vulnerable to erosion now. In such circumstances, it is challenging to keep the party going and sustain our base,” says another leader from a western district. ‘Tremendous show’ What the leaders keep on saying is that the AIADMK performed “tremendously” in the Assembly election, compared with the 2019 Lok Sabha election. It will be able to do so in the coming years even if it has to face difficult times. The long-standing members are not oblivious to the fact that in the Assembly election, the party drew a blank in nine districts, including Chennai, Tiruchi and Ramanathapuram. These nine districts account for 54 constituencies. The party captured 22 seats in 2016. It has to widen its social base among the Backward Classes and re-build its network in these districts. In the Assembly election, about 45% of the party’s candidates in the general seats belonged to three communities: Vanniyakula Kshatriya, Mukkalothar and Gounders. “You don’t find such a lopsided representation in the DMK, which accommodates a greater number of Backward Classes or non-Brahmin communities than what we do,” says a veteran from the Cauvery delta region. ‘No review’ Many participants of the meeting, held at the party headquarters on Monday, were disappointed that even at the meeting, no review of the party’s performance took place. Instead, all those who were allowed to speak were asked to stick to the agenda: the preparations for the party’s golden jubilee celebration. J.C.D. Prabhakar, a member of the steering committee, reiterated his suggestion that the building, which houses the party’s headquarters, be named after founder and former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran. Former Ramanathapuram MP A. Anwhar Raajhaa expressed his disapproval in strong terms of even senior leaders praising the DMK in and outside the Assembly. His point was that those who voted for the AIADMK wanted the party’s representatives to highlight the government’s shortcomings. The meeting did not discuss the subject of selecting the next chairman of the presidium. However, the leadership did not forget to send out one message — no compromise with V.K Sasikala, former interim general secretary, who is reportedly planning to resume her political activity later this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-gearing-up-to-face-challenging-times/article36976839.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MoU signed for setting up logistics park in Tiruvallur||A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to set up a multi-modal logistics park (MMLP), spread over 158 acre, at Mappedu in Tiruvallur at a cost of Rs. 1,200 crore was signed between the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), National Highways Logistics Management Limited (NHLML) and the Chennai Port Trust (CPT) in Chennai on Tuesday. While the MoU was signed in the presence of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in the Secretariat in Chennai, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh participated from Delhi in the virtual event. The MMLP, to be set up close to Chennai Peripheral Ring Road, would connect the airport and the Chennai, Kamarajar and Kattupalli ports and would house state-of-the-art facilities for logistics. The park would lead to new employment opportunities for about 10,000 youth, Mr. Stalin said.

13 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors at Gleneagles perform complex heart valve replacement||Doctors at Gleneagles Global Health City (GGHC) hospital here have replaced an infected heart valve of a person with a homograft aortic valve through a complex procedure, which necessitated the reduction of his body temperature to 18 degrees Celsius to pause the blood flow in the body for around eight minutes. The patient, a 39-year-old teacher from Oman, was having recurrent infection of the aortic valve, reportedly due to an unexplained fever and a dental procedure, a statement by the hospital said. Despite undergoing three heart surgeries earlier, infection recurred around the replaced mechanical valve. To add to the complication, the infection resulted in the patient developing a pseudo aneurysm of the aorta, which referred to the ballooning of the aorta. After complications worsened, he was referred to GGHC. Anto Sahayaraj, senior consultant, cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, GGHC, said the situation demanded a complex and careful treatment strategy. “The main challenge was to get to the centre of the patient’s heart in a setting of a densely scarred chest, due to previous cardiac surgeries and with a pseudoaneurysm ready to burst, sitting right under the breast bone,” he said. He said the doctors decided to go for a homograft aortic valve instead of the conventional mechanical or bioprosthetic valve as the possibility of reinfection was less. Homograft aortic valves are human valves taken from the harvested heart of brain-dead persons and cryogenically preserved at around -70 degrees celsius in liquid nitrogen. “The patient had suffered a stroke a few months ago. As we wanted to take all possible precautions, we continued the blood flow to the brain,” Dr. Sahayaraj said. During the procedure, the pseudo aortic aneurysm was controlled first, following which the infected mechanical valve was removed, infection surrounding it was cleared and the homograft aortic valve was implanted. Susan George, senior consultant, cardiology, GGHC, said the surgery was extremely challenging and utmost care was taken to ensure that the patient was safe from any further risk of infection. Subramanian Swaminathan, director, Infectious Diseases, GGHC, said that the complex procedure was necessary as the patient was not responding to conventional treatment. The patient, who finished the procedure in the first week of September, flew back home after two weeks of post-operative care, the statement said. Alok Khullar, CEO, GGHC, lauded the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-at-gleneagles-perform-complex-heart-valve-replacement/article36976873.ece

Justice T.V. Thamilselvi adjourned the hearing in the petition filed by doctors S. Rajathy Fathima, M. Shahul Hameed Badusa and M. Manimozhi of Ramanathapuram district. The doctors challenged a Government Order issued in 2019. As per the order, no incentive marks were awarded to doctors attached to CEmONC centres. The petitioners said that a committee constituted under the chairmanship of former Madras High Court Judge A.

IOC was also seeking to produce ethanol from refinery effluent gases in addition to the conventional modes of using agri products and agri residues as feedstocks, he added. To reduce India’s dependence on imported LPG, the Research and Development Centre had developed solar and photo volatile cookers. Mr. Sailendra said IOC had issued 158 Letters of Intent till date in Tamil Nadu to set up 158 CBG plants with a capacity to produce around 680 tonne of CBG per day. He said the Namakkal plant had the capacity to produce 15 tonne a day. At present, the plant produced 4.5 tonne of CBG a day along with 0.6 MW of power, processing 250 tonne of feedstock a day. Of the 4.5 tonne of CBG, three tonne was being supplied to industries and 1.5 tonne was being sold through the retail network of five pumps to more than 200 vehicles and four buses, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ioc-working-on-increasing-ethanol-production/article36976961.ece

13 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Form a fresh committee to carry out delimitation of wards’||Former Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) M. Ramadass on Tuesday urged the government to form a fresh committee to carry out delimitation exercise for local bodies polls. In a statement, he said the panel could examine the findings of the 2016 committee and suggest fresh delimitation of wards and reserve wards for OBC, Women, SC and ST. The committee, if needed, could use the projected population of 2021 for delimitation. The committee should be given a time limit of 45 days to present its report before the government, political parties and the State Election Commission. After the publication of the final report in the gazette, none should question the delimitation exercise. The SEC should immediately approach the Supreme Court to seek permission for the conduct of the polls in the next three months, he said. While urging the SEC, government and political parties to work jointly for the conduct of the polls, Mr. Ramadass said, “The SEC, undoubtedly, is a statutory body. But its activities should be beyond public criticism and free from discrepancies and deficiencies. In implementing its rules and regulations, the SEC should work in consonance with the political and social reality and avoid alleged autocratic behaviour.” The political parties should also understand the legal “constraints” under which the SEC operates. They should develop a “genuine” interest in holding the poll. Political parties should consider local bodies polls as a positive opportunity to accommodate and empower their grassroot workers with positions of authority and social respect thereby keeping them "happy." “With the elected representatives in place in local bodies, the government can facilitate decentralised planning, solution to area-based problems, mitigation of poverty, ensure clean and healthy Puducherry and productive implementation of State and Central schemes,” Mr. Ramadass added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/form-fresh-panel-for-delimitation-of-wards/article36977137.ece

13 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tomato, onion prices go up in city markets||The prices of tomatoes and Bellary onion are seeing a spike in the Tiruchi wholesale market due to dwindling arrivals from States such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, where the crops have been reportedly hit by widespread rain. The price of tomatoes ruled between Rs. 35-Rs. 45, depending on quality, in the city markets on Tuesday. This was more than double the rate that prevailed just about 10 days ago, traders said. US Karuppaiah, president of Gandhi Market United Corporation-approved Permanent and Platform Traders’ Association, said widespread rain in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, besides Theni and Dindigul districts in Tamil Nadu, had affected the tomato yield and, hence, arrivals had come down. On Tuesday, a kilo of top quality Bellary onion was being sold at Rs. 45, up by Rs. 15 a kg over the past 10 days, at the market. Prior to that, the price range of Bellary onion was Rs. 20 to Rs. 15 a kg for over three months, A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association, said. Mr. Thangaraj attributed the price rise to the rain in Karnataka and Maharashtra, which damaged part of the Bellary onions crop in the two States. “Realising this, traders in Maharashtra have begun stocking up leading to an artificial short supply. Arrivals from Nasik to the market has dwindled to just about 100 tonnes against the normal supply of about 250 tonnes a day,” Mr.Thangaraj said. Although the market was getting about 150 tonnes of onion from Karnataka, the quality of the rain-hit crop was not good. “We have to sell it within three to four days. Besides, about 15% to 20% of the consignments are damaged,” Mr. Thangaraj said. However, there was a glut of small onion in the market. The shallots were being sold in the range of Rs. 10 to Rs. 25 a kg depending on the quality. Traders in the market predicted that the prices of both onion and tomatoes would depend on the monsoon. If there was more heavy rain, the prices could still climb up in the coming days, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tomato-onion-prices-go-up-in-tiruchi-markets/article36976919.ece

13 October 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||MDT23 sighted for first time in over five days||After evading the eagle-eyed trackers of the Forest Department for over five days, tiger MDT23, the animal believed to be behind the deaths of two herders in Gudalur and the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), was seen in a camera trap image on Tuesday. Forest Department officials confirmed that the tiger was seen in a camera trap image on Tuesday, but declined to reveal the location to ensure the safety of the animal. “It has got into its home territory encompassing Gudalur, Bospara, Masinagudi and Singara, through which it continues to move,” said a senior official of the Department. Shekar Kumar Niraj, Chief Wildlife Warden of Tamil Nadu, who is leading efforts to track, locate and tranquillize the animal safely in the MTR, said a team of veterinarians and forest staff were deployed to the area where the image of the tiger was captured. He said the team spotted the animal and tried to dart it with a tranquillizer, but the animal managed to escape into the undergrowth. Forest Department officials said MDT23 looked to be in good health, but could possibly be in a condition that has rendered it unable to hunt wild game. Modified strategy “On Wednesday, one or two teams will be deployed in the same area to try and locate the tiger while camera traps in surrounding ranges will also be checked and the strategy to safely capture the animal modified,” Mr. Niraj said. The Forest Department advised residents in hamlets in Gudalur and in the fringes of the MTR to stay away from forested areas and to not graze their cattle in the fringes. The district administration was informed of MDT23’s movements. The police department was also informed to help patrol villages bordering the tiger reserve and ensure that people do not put themselves at risk of a problematic interaction with the animal. This is the seventeenth day that the operation to capture the tiger has been on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mdt23-sighted-for-first-time-in-over-five-days/article36976847.ece

Lecturers in many colleges are yet to receive copies of the syllabus and chalk out the timetable for the first-years. A majority of the colleges conducted orientation programmes for the first-year students on Tuesday and asked them to return to college once the timetables were finalised. Classes for second- and third-year students, which reopened after a break, took place as scheduled. “We are yet to receive the syllabus, which needs to be aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP). Once we get it, we will be able to give students the choice for their open electives,” a city-based government college principal said. A lecturer pointed out that the university had scheduled a meeting on Wednesday to apprise them of the syllabus under the NEP. “It would have been easier for the students and lecturers if this programme was conducted before the college reopened for students,” the lecturer said. The principal of another city-based college said that the lecturers have been instructed to orally inform students to return later this month. “Our teachers do not need any preparation for the second and third-year classes, but to teach the first-year students as per NEP they need more training. So we will delay the commencement of classes,” she said. Revision time Ramesh A., a first-year B.Com student of a government college in Bengaluru, said the lecturers had asked the students to report to college after October 21. “They have told us that we would receive messages when the timetable is fixed. We have been asked to revise our second-year PU syllabus at home till then,” he said. Lingaraja Gandhi, Vice-Chancellor of BCU, said that the syllabus was approved bythe academic council on Tuesday. “As per the University Grants Commission, they need to conduct a week-long orientation programme that is given to colleges. Even without the syllabus, the colleges could have started the orientation programme. We have met the challenges and quickly approved the syllabus,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/first-year-students-told-to-return-once-timetables-are-fixed/article36976806.ece

13 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Contractor held for theft||The Vijayanagar police arrested a 45-year-old civil contractor who allegedly burgled the house of his relatives, robbing valuables to repay the heavy loan he had incurred. Based on the complaint, the police tracked down the accused based on the technical evidence and arrested Srinivas B., a resident of MC Layout. Srinivas confessed to the police that he had incurred a huge loan and was unable to repay it since he had no income or work. He kept watch on the house of his relative, Mahadevaiah. After the wife of the complainant stepped out to attend her yoga class on September 30 evening, leaving the keys in a flower pot outside the house, he broke in and escaped with 260 grams of gold valuables worth Rs. 10 lakh. Based on a complaint filed by Mahadevaiah, the police analysed the CCTV camera footage and tracked down Srinivas. He was wearing a full face helmet to conceal his identity, a police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/contractor-held-for-theft/article36976801.ece
13 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Migratory birds declining, lake-dependent resident birds increasing’||Migratory bird numbers are declining in Bengaluru, while many lake-dependent resident bird numbers seem to be on the rise in the past five years, a new study on the impact of urbanisation on bird populations in Bengaluru has found. The paper, ‘Relationship between lake area and distance from the city centre on lake dependent resident and migratory birds in urban Bengaluru, a tropical mega-city in Southern India,’ was published in the Journal of Urban Ecology.  Author Harini Nagendra, faculty, Azim Premji University, said Bengaluru’s lakes have gone through multiple phases of creation, renewal, loss, and restoration, impacting bird diversity. A release said the study is unique because it uses data collected and uploaded to the eBird portal by citizen scientists. The size of the lake area and its distance from the city centre are correlated to the number of bird species that come there. Larger lakes support more species. As the distance from the city centre increased i.e., urbanisation decreases, the number of bird species increases. The study also found that larger lakes support more diversity as they are likely to have more resting and breeding spaces, feeding resources, and microhabitats. Lakes in the centre of the city have less bird diversity compared to those on the outskirts, probably because of better habitat conditions, breeding and feeding opportunities, it said. Ravi Jambhekar, Visiting Scientist, Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc. and the other author, said, “Our study finds that migratory birds are declining but resident bird populations are increasing. We speculate that the decline behind migratory bird populations might be because of some changes in breeding grounds but lake restoration and creation of islands in lakes is helping resident birds. More species-level studies are required to understand the mechanisms behind these patterns.” “Birds that nest in tree canopies such as cormorants, painted stork, Brahminy kite, and egrets are increasing. This might be because of the availability of nesting sites on the islands created with tall trees. Many of these species are also piscivores and another reason for their increase could be the increase of fish in the lakes,” the release added. Lesser ducks The study also found that nine of the ten duck species found in the city are declining, which is reflected in the migratory sites. The decline in duck populations might be associated with urban pressure on their breeding grounds, perhaps from feral dogs and cats or other unknown forms of stress, it said. “Fish-eating birds such as cormorants and Oriental darters are increasing in the city. Rejuvenating lakes in terms of dredging, creating islands, and introducing fish stock might increase food availability in the lakes, helping these birds maintain stable populations in cities,” the release added. The other author Kulbhushan Singh Suryawanshi, scientist, Nature Conservation Foundation, said, “Our research shows that the pied kingfisher is declining; they nest in holes excavated on vertical mud banks, and these banks have disappeared as the edges of our lakes are covered in concrete or stones to make walking paths. With careful planning, we can make our urban lakes friendlier for the birds to live in,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/migratory-birds-declining-lake-dependent-resident-birds-increasing/article36976807.ece

13 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Growers seek disease-proof areca variety||All India Areca Growers Association based in Puttur in Dakshina Kannada has urged the government to develop Yellow Leaf Disease-resistant variety of arecanut. Stating that Yellow Leaf Disease is gradually spreading in the State to newer plantations in Puttur and Bantwal taluks in Dakshina Kannada, president of the association Ashok Kinila and general secretary Mahesh Puchchappady said in a letter written to legislators of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. They said that a few plants in the affected regions are immune to Yellow Leaf Disease. Hence, scientists should explore developing new varieties from such plants. Yellow Leaf Disease was first noticed in Kerala in 1914. All these years, the disease was predominantly seen in Sullia region of Dakshina Kannada and Koppa and Sringeri regions of Chikkamagaluru district. The spread to other locations now has created panic among farmers who are dependent on arecanut for their livelihood, they said. Though the Kasaragod-based Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) has a regional station at Vitla in Dakshina Kannada, it lacks the facility to carry out research, they said and added that inadequate funding is also one of the reasons for the lack of focus on research. Hence, the government should extend financial assistance to find a solution to Yellow Leaf Disease in arecanut plantations, including the development of disease-resistant arecanut variety. They said that though the CPCRI has submitted a project to the State Horticulture Department on the need to establish a disease diagnostic laboratory at CPCRI’s Vitla Regional Station and on the management of the disease, the State Government is yet to give its approval, the association said. The project, estimated to cost Rs. 3.10 crore, proposed the establishment of a state-of-the-art disease diagnostic laboratory at a cost of Rs. 1.04 crore and management of the disease at a cost of Rs. 2.05 crore. Mr. Puchchappady told The Hindu that the Prime Minister had recently released 35 new varieties of different crops to meet the aspirations of the farmers. Now, arecanut farmers also want a disease-resistant variety to tackle the disease in their plantations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/growers-seek-disease-proof-areca-variety/article36977314.ece
13 October 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Much-needed road bridge coming up for river island||Responding to the decades-old demand of the residents of Hattikudru — a river island on the Varahi — for better connectivity to the mainland, Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (KNNL) is building a road bridge connecting the southern part of the island with panchayat headquarters Basruru in Kundapur taluk of Udupi district. Hattikudru, spread across about 500 acres, was already connected to the mainland on the northern side to Hattiangadi, a pilgrim place. However, residents had to take a detour of about 14 km via Kundapur or use boats to reach Basruru. The island, with about 300 households, has a population of around 2,500. The KNNL, which manages the irrigation requirements of the region, responded to the public demand and also to a letter from the former Legislative Council Chairman K. Pratapchandra Shetty. Launched on December 27, 2019, the work was expected to be completed in 12 months, but it got delayed following COVID-19, engineers said. When The Hindu visited the site on Monday, more than 50% of the work on the bridge had been completed from the Basruru side, while the remaining work towards Hattikudru was going on. Pedestrians crossed the Varahi branch using a coffer bund and the bridge that is under construction. Hitherto, Konkan Railway’s bridge on Mangaluru-Mumbai line provided pedestrian passage to Basruru and Kundapur. KNNL assistant executive engineer N.G. Bhat said that the 315-metre-long bridge was being built on seven spans of 45 metres each with support at every 15-metre interval. The continuous type deck slab bridge has a 7.5-metre-wide carriageway with 0.9-metre-wide footpaths/utility space on either sides. Being executed at an estimated cost of Rs. 19 crore by Philip D’costa & Co. of Kundapur, the bridge is expected to be ready by January next year. A resident on the island Narendra Udupa said that the new bridge would be of great help for the residents to travel to Udupi, Tirthahalli and Shivamogga. Another resident, Pradeep Kanchan, said that access to various facilities, including the panchayat, educational institution and banks, would now become easier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/much-needed-road-bridge-coming-up-for-river-island/article36977320.ece

13 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Extend illumination by 10 days, say stakeholders in Mysuru||The Federation of Organisations and Associations of Mysuru has urged the State government to extend the Dasara illumination by another 10 days instead of ending it after Vijayadashami festival on October 15 as a tourism promotion initiative since tourists will continue to pour into the city even after the conclusion of the festivities. The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation had announced that it would end the illumination after the Dasara finale on Friday. This year, the illumination has been done on a total stretch of 102-km, covering most parts of the city, besides special illumination at 40 junctions. A big draw Compared to last year, the illumination is expansive this year since no other events barring the cultural events at the palace are being organised. The illumination has been a big draw and the roads are witnessing heavy traffic in the evenings with a large number of people turning up daily. The illumination has helped initiatives like Ambari, the hop-on- hop-off buses introduced by KSTDC, getting good response with passengers keen to watch the city coming alive in lights on the go, travelling on the rooftop of the four double-decker buses. Appreciation The Federation expressed happiness over the way the Dasara illumination has been done this year and therefore the government can consider extending it by another 10 days as it would help to promote tourism which was affected because of two back-to-back COVID-19 waves and lockdowns. The extension of illumination can help hotels get bookings, improving their occupancy besides improving businesses of those depending on tourism. Another reason cited by the Federation is that continuous rains has hampered people from venturing out of their homes to watch the illumination. The CESC had earlier extended the illumination till 10.30 p.m. but limited it again till 10 p.m. citing the night curfew rules.

13 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Lack of publicity for cultural programmes||A slew of artists from various troupes and schools presented a variety of cultural programmes as part of Dasara at Kalamandira in city on Tuesday. Organised by the Department of Kannada and Culture, it featured sugama sangeetha, bhava geethe, devotional songs, folk songs, dance-drama, classical dance including Bharatnatya, Yakshagana etc. But lack of publicity and adequate coverage about the programme ensured that the performances were viewed by only a handful of people. The cultural event was similar in scale and scope to the dawn-to-dusk programme conducted in front of the palace from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. a few days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lack-of-publicity-for-cultural-programmes/article36977047.ece
13 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Pilot of wildlife estimation exercise begins in Bandipur||The All India Tiger and Mega Herbivore Estimation 2020-21 got under way at Bandipur on Tuesday. The exercise is held once in four years, and this is the pilot for the fifth one. The earlier ones were held in 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2017. A release from Bandipur Tiger Reserve said this year’s exercise entailed the use of MSTRIPES (Management System for Tiger, Intensive Patrolling and Ecological Status) app, and apart from tiger count the exercise would also throw up data on mega herbivores, including elephants and gaurs. The release stated that the exercise was being taken up as per the directions of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), and unlike in the past it was not a synchronised census taking place across the country simultaneously. Bandipur Tiger Reserve director Natesh said the NTCA has ordered the completion of the exercise by December-end. The Forest Department staff were trained on the protocols and procedures to be followed and this obviated the reliance on volunteers, who would get one-day training which, the authorities said, was inadequate. Hence, this year’s endeavour is expected to come up with more robust data. A master training programme was conducted at Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu in August and the trained staff have teamed up with experts from Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and others, the press release said. The use of MSTRIPES and ECOLOGICAL app has ensured the data is digitised and uploaded in real time to the Tiger Cell in the State, which will forward it to the WII foranalysis and interpretation. The pilot will continue till October 30. An official said that apart from direct sightings, indirect signs such as tiger scat and pug marks would be included. As a result of the tiger estimation exercise, the authorities said there would be no safari on October 26 and 27. Bandipur had 126 individual tigers based on camera trap images in the 2017 exercise. The dates of the all-India synchronous enumeration are yet to be announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pilot-of-wildlife-estimation-exercise-begins-in-bandipur/article36977049.ece
13 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Elderly women rescued from collapsed house||Two women were rescued from a house that collapsed at Ittigegud in Mysuru on Monday evening. Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) officials said a portion of the two-storeyed building on Periyatambi Road that housed three persons including the two women collapsed during the rains. While their relative, a man in the thirties, was not present in the house, a team from MCC’s Abhaya team rushed to the spot on receiving information and managed to bring the two elderly women out of the collapsed house safely. The women have been identified as Raniamma and Poojamani, both of whom are in their sixties. They were trapped in a portion of the ground floor that had not collapsed when the Abhaya team rescued them. Though dampness was visible on the structure of the house, MCC officials said the residents had not noticed any cracks or threat to the structure. The inmates, however, have been shifted to their relatives’ house, but they were requesting the MCC officials for assistance in removal of furniture and other items from the house. The ward corporator Chayadevi visited the spot and inspected the collapsed house and assured the elderly women of assistance. MCC officials said residents of the locality claimed that the house was more than 85 years old. However, efforts were underway to verify the records in the MCC to ascertain the year when the house was built.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/elderly-women-rescued-from-collapsed-house/article36977040.ece
13 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Why the secrecy: activist||The pilot for the tiger and mega herbivore estimation under way in Bandipur has received flak from wildlife activist Joseph Hoover, who said it was shrouded in secrecy. He questioned whether the estimation of the national animal should be conducted secretively without the media being informed and with the involvement of only one NGO. Interestingly, the Bandipur park authorities had claimed in a press release that the current exercise was the actual enumeration, but they subsequently issued a corrigendum saying that it was a pilot. Meanwhile, some senior officials of the Forest Department were unaware of the exercise and one of them said it was field testing for an app that had to be refined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-the-secrecy-activist/article36977050.ece

Yediyurappa and Siddaramaiah had met each other “secretly” and alleged that the I-T raids on an aide of the BJP leader were carried out at the behest of the party’s central leadership after that to rein him in. Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters that Mr. Siddaramaiah had “conspired” to destabilise the BJP in Karnataka by holding secret parleys with Mr .Yediyurappa, who recently resigned as the Chief Minister. The BJP’s central leadership learnt about the meeting between the two former Chief Ministers and had the I-T Department raid the premises belonging to Mr. Yediyurappa and his son B.Y. Vijayendra’s aide, the JD(S) leader alleged. He said there was no doubt that the I-T raids were politically motivated to “checkmate” Mr. Yediyurappa. He even claimed that Mr. Siddaramaiah’s recent visit to New Delhi to meet Congress leader Sonia Gandhi was to brief his party’s leadership about the meeting with Mr. Yediyurappa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/raids-after-bsy-met-siddaramaiah-says-hdk/article36976812.ece
13 October 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Breakwater construction in progress||Construction of groyne fields (pulimuttu) at Ambalappuzha is making good progress. Thirty breakwaters with a total length of 5.4 km are being built from Komana to Punnapra in the district at a cost of Rs. 54 crore sanctioned under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The project also includes the construction of a 345-m sea wall. Haran Babu, deputy general manager, Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation, said the construction of six breakwaters had been completed. “The groyne fields will reduce the energy of waves reaching the shoreline. It will prevent coastal erosion and help in sand formation,” said Mr. Babu. The breakwaters are constructed using tetrapods of two and five tonnes. After laying granite stones of different sizes, tetrapods are placed above them. Groynes are constructed 100 metres apart without hampering the flow of floodwaters into the sea through existing channels. Each groyne has a length of 40 metres from shore into the sea and 20 metres width. 760 families to benefit The construction of the breakwaters will benefit 760 families directly and indirectly in Punnapra South, Ambalappuzha North and Ambalappuzha South grama panchayats in the Ambalappuzha Assembly constituency. Tetrapods are used as an alternative for granite boulders, which were widely used for constructing breakwaters. However, the acute shortage of granite in the State forced the authorities to look for alternatives. Tetrapods minimise the use of granite in the construction of breakwaters. 114 in all The State Government last year decided to set up 114 breakwaters at five places off the Alappuzha coast at a cost of Rs. 184 crore under the KIIFB after sea erosion became severe in coastal areas of the district. Apart from Ambalappuzha, breakwaters are built in the Haripad and Alappuzha Assembly constituencies. The structures will directly benefit 625 families and indirectly between 1,500 and 2,000 families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/breakwater-construction-in-progress/article36977009.ece

13 October 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Traffic quagmire at Vyttila gives commuters a nightmare||The mounting traffic chaos at Vyttila Junction, over 10 months after a six-lane flyover was commissioned at what is the biggest traffic intersection in Kerala, has led to fears that the quagmire will worsen when schools and other educational institutions reopen in November. Traffic police, civic officials and others have expressed outrage at the inordinate delay by the State Government and PWD (NH wing) in lessening the extent of the unscientific roundabout and expansive medians beneath the flyover. “It is shocking that assurances by the PWD and the State Government to rectify grave discrepancies in the design of the structures beneath the flyover have not materialised, despite serpentine snarls and chaotic traffic movement at the junction. The least that they should do is to make optimal use of the space available beneath the flyover, which the PWD unduly raised by building concrete formations,” said Sunitha Dixon, chairperson of Kochi Corporation’s Works Standing Committee and the councillor representing Vyttila Division. “Minister for Public Works Mohamed Riyas, who did a site inspection of Vyttila and convened meetings to arrive at short and long-term solutions to end traffic snarls at the junction, must urgently intervene and ensure that the slew of decisions taken at the meetings are implemented. He must also pull up PWD (NH Wing) officials concerned who failed to act on the decisions taken early this year. This is because both political and official apathy is evident in the inordinate delay in chipping away parts of the roundabout and medians, which would have streamlined traffic flow at the busiest junction in Kerala,” she said. Ms. Dixon expressed outrage over the absence of footpaths, despite thousands of pedestrians converging at the junction every day. The government has also not acted, despite land being set apart at the Vyttila Mobility Hub, to build a road linking Kaniampuzha Road and Vyttila-Thripunithura Road. Police peeved at inaction A senior police official expressed dismay at nothing being done, despite the traffic police being forced to close down the road on the northern side of the roundabout and diverting vehicles from SA Road to Thripunithura through an alternative track on the southern side. “Faulty engineering by the PWD has thrown movement of traffic and pedestrians at the junction into disarray. Sadly, the department has not stepped in to set things right, despite short and long-term solutions being zeroed in, at a site visit-cum-meeting held by top officials of the police, Kochi Corporation, district administration and people’s representatives.” While slamming the PWD for not acting on requests by the police, he said the department erred even while assessing the traffic pattern at the junction, since the flyover caters to just 30% of vehicles, mostly long-distance ones. The rest have to jostle for space and wait on end at the signal junction beneath. Palarivattom model In the meantime, an official who played a key role in readying the traffic-movement plan beneath the Palarivattom Junction wherein vehicles through Civil Line Road rely on a pair of U-turns constructed beneath the four-lane flyover, said such a system must be adopted, at least on the Palarivattom side of the Vyttila Junction, where traffic hold-ups are acute. “This can be done if an approximately two-lane width of space is chipped off from the hefty concrete median that the PWD built beneath the flyover, beneath spans which have adequate vertical clearance to carry heavy vehicles. Likewise, vehicles from Kaniampuzha Road must be diverted through the Vyttila Hub, since their direct entry into Vyttila Junction is worsening traffic hold ups,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-quagmire-at-vyttila-gives-commuters-a-nightmare/article36977288.ece
13 October 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Two held on charge of cheating people of crores in loan scam||The Ernakulam Central police on Tuesday arrested two persons accused of cheating people of crores of rupees on the promise of securing bank loans in Kerala. The arrested were identified as Lingamoorthy, a.k.a. Ramalingam (53), and Shanmukhavel Namashivayam (40), both residents of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu. They were arrested from Pudukkottai by a team led by Ernakulam Central Inspector S. Vijayasankar. The accused had launched a company named Money Max Home Fin on MG Road in January 2020. The highlight of their advertising was the promise to secure bank loans irrespective of CIBIL score against a commission of 10%. They also sought a processing time of five months to get the loans approved. The police said that the accused plotted the fraud meticulously. They took a house on rent at Cheranalloor and the first accused then secured an Aadhaar card in that address. The same address was used for the agreement of the rented office and, later, for all their office operations. This posed a tough task for the police in tracking down their real address. The accused conjured up and executed the fraud in five months. They hired local people as office staff, while the office furniture and other paraphernalia were taken on rent, according to the police. Accused abscond For the next five months, they took the victims for a ride using this facade and kept collecting documents and advances from them. One day, they suddenly absconded with the crores of rupees they had collected as advance, the police said. Several victims have since petitioned the police about the fraud. However, it took the police a while to locate the accused as they had pre-empted the possibilities for that along the way. The police, however, managed to track them down in Tamil Nadu with the help of the cyber cell. A hunt is on for others possibly involved in the scam. A team led by Central Assistant Commissioner C. Jayakumar and Mr. Vijayasankar and comprising of sub inspector Premkumar, assistant sub inspector E.M. Shaji, senior civil police officer Aneesh, civil police officers Ignatius, Reji, and Rajesh made the arrest. The accused were produced in court and remanded in custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-held-on-charge-of-cheating-people-of-crores-in-loan-scam/article36977296.ece
13 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||ASAP Cells to come up in all educational institutions in district||The Additional Skill Acquisition Programme (ASAP) Kerala is on an expansion mode in the district targeting to set up ASAP Cells in all educational institutions. So far, ASAP Cells have been set up in 92 out of the 102 educational institutions in the district, including polytechnics, engineering colleges, self-financing colleges, and arts and science colleges. “The aim is to create awareness among the student community and bring them into the skill development ecosystem. We will assess their employability and industry requirements and design courses accordingly. Besides, we will also arrange for internship, interactions with experts, placements, and pre-placement grooming. In short, ASAP Cells will function as a bridge between the job aspirants and the industry,” said Shanthanu Pradip, district programme manager, ASAP, Ernakulam. Plans are also afoot to further strengthen ASAP Kerala’s two community skill parks at Kalamasserry and Perumbavoor. The idea is to launch more new courses and bring in more participants to both the parks. ASAP has now institutionalised its online courses, and runs three online courses in the district. The online coding course lasting 200 hours being run in association with the ICT Academy under the Kerala State IT Mission is attended by 111 persons across five batches. The 150-hour GST Accounting Assistant programme, certified by the Union Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship’s National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF), being held in association with the Bombay Stock Exchange is attended by 50 in two batches. The course is being held for those with accounting and commerce backgrounds. A new online course in cybersecurity for 320 hours has just been launched for 30 participants, mostly from technology and computer science fields. “Our focus is predominantly on NSQF level-four courses and upwards and those with industry relevance. The biggest advantage of our courses is that they come embedded with internships,” said Mr. Pradip. Admissions are under way for offline courses in automobile technology and fashion technology at the Perumbavoor community skill park and NSQF level-four fitness course at the Kalamasserry park. Though Plus Two has been set as the eligibility criteria for the fitness course, the 40 participants mostly include sportspersons, athletes, fitness and gym trainers, fitness centre entrepreneurs, nutritionists, psychologists, and other professionals. The Kalamasserry park also offers a 150-hour course in Communicative English Trainer for graduates. Among the new courses lined up for launch include Urban Cooperative Banking to be held in association with the Indian Institute of Banking and Finance, Accounting Technicians to be held along with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, training in operating micro drones, and accounts assistant. “We will also shortly roll out a training course in hybrid technology associated with electric vehicles for engineering students. A few more seats are available in the batch of 40 students,” said Mr. Pradip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/asap-cells-to-come-up-in-all-educational-institutions-in-district/article36977281.ece

13 October 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Drug seizures on the rise in rural limits||The Ernakulam Rural Police had hatched a perfect plan and pulled it off meticulously, leading to the arrest of two persons with possession of 31 kg of ganja smuggled in via a courier company on Monday. The courier company operator had no clue about the suspicious parcel and the ensuing drama till the vehicle carrying the parcels for the day came to his firm's doorstep. “Police in plain clothes were aboard that vehicle and they alerted us about the suspicious parcel that came in three packs and about the persons who were to turn up for it. They then positioned at various places and caught the two as they emerged out of the firm,” said the operator on condition of anonymity. He suspected the number given for contact to be that of one of the accused though the name given, Vimal, was obviously fake. “Usually, when the original recipient does not come to collect the parcel, he or she informs us that someone else will instead. In this case, we got no such calls,” he said. Modus operandi It was perhaps the first such incident in which ganja was smuggled in as parcel in Ernakulam rural limits. Though the modus operandi in the latest case was novel, flow of drugs, however, is no longer new to Ernakulam rural limits. In the last two-and-a-half years alone, rural police have seized 260-odd kilograms of ganja, 200 grams of hashish oil, 2.25kg of MDMA, 200g of brown sugar, 75 LSD stamps and so on. “We makes these seizures while in transit thanks to our strong intelligence network, though it does not mean that the entire consignments are for consumption within the rural district limits. Majority of the seizures are made along the highway at Angamaly while being transported elsewhere,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). For instance, in November last year, the Ernakulam rural police, in association with the District Anti-Narcotic Special Action Force, seized 140 kg of ganja in two separate operations. In the first, the police team chased down three accused in two cars at Angamaly and seized from them 105 kg of ganja in 50 tightly sealed packs. Their interrogation led to the seizure of another 35 kg of ganja found hidden in 17 similarly sealed packets in a rented house at Avoli in Ernakulam rural limits. Smuggled in from AP The ganja seized was reportedly being smuggled from Andhra Pradesh to Thodupuzha in Idukki. They had procured it from the tribal belt of Annavaram near Visakhapatnam and the rented house was used to stock the contraband.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drug-seizures-on-the-rise-in-rural-limits/article36977294.ece
13 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Caprolactam consignments from FACT flagged off||The first lorry loads of caprolactam produced at the public sector Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore, after a gap of over seven years, was flagged off here on Monday by Union Minister Bhagwanth Khuba. The Minister also rededicated the renovated plant to the nation, the reopening of which marks a major landmark for the fertilizer producer. According to FACT sources, two loads of 25 tonnes and 17 tonnes were despatched to a company in Gujarat. The rededication of the plant is a great moment for FACT as the company has been on the revival path over the past three years. The restarting of the petrochemical product will add about Rs. 600 crore to the annual turnover and caprolactam from the company would be a major import substitution, the sources added.

13 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Look out for reptiles during rainy days||The heavy rain lashing across the State for the past few days may invite some unwelcome guests, snakes, to your homes. With their hiding places and natural habitats being flooded, there is the high possibility of snakes, lizards, centipedes, and amphibians moving to safety, especially warm and dry places. The chances of encountering these reptiles in peripheral areas of houses like verandas, car porches, and abandoned structures, and also in shoe racks are high these days, says Sandeep Das, a herpetologist. During the monsoon, when rain gradually picks up, animals living in burrows and crevices would get time to move out of their resting places and shift to safe locations. However, an unexpected downpour would catch them off-guard, forcing them to seek refuge at secure places. Verandas and car porches would be their choices, explains Mr. Das. Spectacled Cobra, Common Krait, Russel’s Viper, and Saw-scaled Viper, the big four venomous snakes, and the non-venomous Indian Python are some of the common snakes to be expected, he says. The Forest Department has made the services of over 800 trained snake handlers available across the State, says Y. Muhammad Anwar, State nodal officer for snake rescue, and training of snake handlers. Once snakes are sighted, the services of the locally available volunteers can be obtained from the app SARPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/look-out-for-reptiles-during-rainy-days/article36977019.ece
13 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||SIT formed to probe ganja smuggling||A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed to probe the seizure of 31 kgs of ganja smuggled in as a parcel through a courier company in Perumbavoor on Monday. District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik formed the SIT headed by the Perumbavoor DySP. Two persons were also arrested in the joint raid conducted by the rural police and the District Anti-Narcotics Special Action Force. “We have picked up two more suspects from the Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border in connection with the case. They were Malayalis who had reportedly gone to Andhra Pradesh to procure ganja and their arrests will be recorded once they are brought here. We are expecting to make more arrests in the coming days,” said Mr. Karthik. While smuggling in of synthetic drugs through couriers is nothing new, this is probably for the first time such a route is being adopted for ganja, at least in Ernakulam rural limits. “We are now planning to keep a close eye on courier firms and even probe the possibility of similar couriers being made by the same racket in the past,” said Mr. Karthik. Though in the instant case, the parcel was found couriered from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, it could have been originally sourced from somewhere else. The police are probing the address and the number given for contact on the parcel. The person to whom the courier was addressed wasn't the one who came to collect it. Whether the arrested themselves had sent it as a parcel from Andhra Pradesh also remains to be verified since that was a lot safer considering the extensive checking to be evaded if it was to be smuggled in personally. The rural police are also planning to attach the properties of the accused involved in NDPS cases. Meanwhile, the accused were produced in court and remanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sit-formed-to-probe-ganja-smuggling/article36977295.ece

The supplementary exam was held on August 6. The students had taken up the issue of delay in the publication of the results before the university authorities. They have also written to Minister for Higher Education R. Bindu seeking her intervention. “We have not been able to apply for the postgraduate programmes and remain tense as we may lose a year for no fault of ours,” said a group of students who had requested the authorities to speed up the publication of the results. The registration for the online admission process for postgraduate programmes had ended on October 8, they said. The university authorities pointed out that the supplementary exam was held amidst the pandemic situation in August. At the earliest “We have cleared the backlog of the results, which had got delayed owing to the COVID-19 situation. We have assured the students that the results of the supplementary exams would be published at the earliest,” they said. On their fears about losing a year, the authorities said that only a few students had appeared for the supplementary exam and efforts were on to release the results as soon as possible. The examination wing is slowly coming back to normalcy after being hit by various pandemic-related hurdles, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/delay-in-results-puts-mgu-students-in-a-spot/article36977007.ece
13 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Enthronement of Catholicos challenged||A writ petition was filed by two parishioners of the St. Mary's Orthodox church, Piravom, on Tuesday challenging the enthronement of Catholicos of the East at Parumala on October 15. K.A. John and another person alleged that the enthronement of Catholicos was going to be held without canonically inviting the Patriarch of Antioch. They contended that the canonical invitation for the Patriarch for the consecration was a mandatory condition. The decision of the synod of the Malanakara Orthodox Syrian Church to enthrone the Catholicos was against the 1934 constitution of the Malankara Church and orders of the Supreme Court. The petitioners said urgent steps were being taken to enthrone the Catholicos on October 15. Therefore, they had submitted representation to the State Government to ensure that no law was violated. If it took place, it would amount to a clear violation of the Supreme Court verdict. The petition pointed out that there was no question of non-recognition of the Patriarch by the Malankara Church in view of the Supreme Court judgment in the K.S. Varghese case. Kuriakose Mar Clemis, president, Malankara Syrian Christian Association, and Yuhanon Mar Diascorose, secretary, episcopal synod, could not take the stand that the Malankara Church would not recognise the Patriarch. The synod decision without complying with the apex court order was illegal and unlawful.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/enthronement-of-catholicos-challenged/article36976717.ece
13 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Administrative stalemate holding up crematorium||For the people of Paingottoor panchayat, an idyllic village on the eastern suburbs of Ernakulam bordering the neighbouring Idukki district, the trauma of the loss of dear ones goes beyond their very death. The panchayat with considerable forest cover and the population being largely made up of poor migrant farmers, majority of the residents do not have land of their own to either bury or cremate the bodies. Their only option being to take the bodies to the municipal crematorium either at Muvattuzha or Thodupuzha located around 17 km and 16 km away respectively. Though Kothamangalam block panchayat had identified around 50 cents of excess land in Neduvakkad in ward 3 of Paingottoor panchayat for an electric crematorium in association with Paingottoor panchayat back in 2016-17, it has been a case of continued disruption. The land was hilly and had to be levelled for which two contractors were engaged. By the time, it was over, allegations of corruption in the sale of earth were levelled, leading to a police case disrupting the work. "Then as the last governing committee was about to inaugurate the construction, the revenue department put both the Kothamangalam block panchayat and Paingottoor pabchayat in the dock for having initiated the project on land not included in their asset register," said Sabu Mathai, a four-time councillor now representing Neduvakkad ward. The new governing committee had included the project in their plans by estimating the value of the land to be paid to the revenue department to go ahead with the construction. However, a new stumbling block emerged in the form administrative stalemate after the opposition Left Democratic Front successfully brought about a no-trust motion against panchayat president Cissy Jaison of the United Democratic Front president. So, the project will hardly see any progress till after October 20 when a new president is expected to be elected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/administrative-stalemate-holding-up-crematorium/article36977284.ece

The four-member family who got trapped in a bathroom on the first floor of the house was rescued by Fire and Rescue Services personnel. “We found a man with severe burn injuries in the space between the car porch and the gate. We summoned an ambulance and rushed him to a nearby hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries,” said a firefighter. Initially, the victim was unidentified. The fire force was met with a raging fire in the car porch and the adjoining room probably after the old furniture dumped in the porch caught fire. The houseowner, Suneer, dealt in old furniture. But before the firefighters could fully focus on dousing the fire, local people alerted them that the family of four in the house had been trapped inside the bathroom. “We approached the bathroom through the sunshade and found the family in the bathroom, which was slowly getting engulfed in smoke. We placed an extension ladder on the sunshade and then cut the iron rod of the ventilator using a hydraulic cutter since rescuing the family, including two young children, through the door was not possible,” said the firefighter. Initially, the 14-year-old girl was rescued followed by her mother, 12-year-old boy and then the father. By the time, the firefighters fully doused the fire, the car in the porch was fully gutted so as the porch and the adjoining room. Though fully engulfed in smoke, the rest of the home was largely unaffected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-dies-of-burns-in-freak-incident-at-maradu/article36977292.ece

What sparked off a dispute is a recent report of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M) that said the multi-storey twin complex was unfit and unsafe for operations and required immediate renovation. Other political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have also stepped up their agitation demanding a judicial investigation into the construction of the terminal, which was inaugurated with much fanfare by former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in June 2015. District-level Congress leaders alleged that the Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) had decided to hand over the terminal complex to Mukkom-based company ALIF Builders for commercial purposes, knowing fully well the contents of the IIT-M report. Large-scale corruption was involved in the construction of the project and the leasing of the commercial space, said District Congress Committee (DCC) president K. Praveen Kumar. Now, the Opposition parties have likened the KSRTC twin towers to the Palarivattom flyover in Kochi, demolished after it was declared unsafe and a new one built in its place. ‘Make report public’ The Congress and the BJP, which took out protest marches to the KSRTC bus station, have decided to step up their agitation in the coming days. Both have demanded that the government make public the IIT-M report on structural flaws in the construction of the terminal. BJP district president V.K. Sajeevan said a conspiracy had been hatched to relocate the bus station from Mavoor Road permanently and turn the KSRTC complex into a fully private commercial hub.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-terminal-bjp-congress-up-the-ante/article36976983.ece

Several low-lying regions in the city were submerged. The most affected areas were Puthiyangadi, Pantheerankavu, Nellikode, Kacheri, Chevayur, Valayanad and Vengeri villages in the city. The Revenue Department has opened four camps at Civil Station U.P. School, Vengeri U.P. School, Providence Women’s College, and Puthiyangadi G.M.U.P. School in Kozhikode taluk to relocate affected families. More camps would be opened in case of any eventualities, said District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy. Several families in Viyyur, Chengottukkavu, Payyoli, and Chemmencherry villages in Koyilandy taluk had to bear the fury of the rain after their houses were flooded. They have been relocated to the houses of their relatives. Mr. Reddy chaired a meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority with District Police Chief (Kozhikode City) A.V. George, District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) A. Srinivas and Revenue officials to take stock of the situation. Tahsildars were instructed to set up camps as and when required in case of evacuation of people. Roads waterlogged The busy stretches of Mavoor Road and Kozhikode Mini Bypass were flooded from morning onwards, throwing vehicular traffic out of gear. Traffic was diverted along the Kozhikode Bypass and the Florican Road route after the Balussery State Highway was flooded at Vengeri and Thadambattuthazham. The urban wholesale market at Vengeri was virtually closed. Many of the city roads and areas such as Beach Road, Moonnalingal, Mundikkalthazham and Thadambattuthazham were waterlogged. A wall collapsed in Chinthavalappu in the city. The sub-treasury office at Mananchira was flooded and its functioning had to be stopped. As water splashed from a springhead from below the surface, the staff were seen busy cleaning the floors. As most of the documents were stored in a safe place above the surface, it did not lead to serious losses. The threat of heavy landslips triggered by rain and floods loomed in the hill regions. Landslips were reported in Mavoor, Chathamangalam and Peruvayal grama panchayats. An autorickshaw and two two-wheelers were destroyed when the wall of a house collapsed in Chathamangalam South Arayankot. Many hectares of paddy fields and plantain farms were flooded in Mavoor and Chathamangalam. Chittarippilakkal Road in Chathamangalam grama panchayat caved in from both sides. The retaining wall of a house collapsed at Panangod in Mavoor grama panchayat. Residents of Koombara Anakkallumpara in Koodaranhi are in the grip of fear as rocks and soil came flowing from top of the hill. There are many quarries in the area where a landslip was reported a couple of years ago. Rise in water level The district administration said boat facilities had been arranged to evacuate people in case the water level rises. Teams attached to the Department of Fire and Rescue Services were also activated in case of natural calamities. Measures will be taken to prevent people from entering waterbodies as the water level is likely to rise. Panchayats have been directed in this regard. People should be prepared to move away from landslip-prone areas, said officials. The district recorded 216 mm of rainfall on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rain-leaves-behind-trail-of-destruction/article36976989.ece

In his report to the Kerala High Court recently, M. Manoj, Sabarimala Special Commissioner and District Judge, submitted that the system and software with the domain name www.sabarimala.org be entrusted to the TDB. “It is suggested that the TDB, the trustee of the deity, has the duty to effectively manage the property of the deity, provide puja booking facilities to devotees, augment income of the deity, generate maximum donations for Annadanam, and for that purpose, it should exercise control of the web portal/web application for booking online virtual queue slots for Sabarimala darsan and the domain name www.sabarimala.org, developed by the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS),” stated the report. In the report, the official further calls for shifting the discretionary quota of the virtual queue slots to the direct control of the TDB, which may post officers from its cadre or from deputation from the Kerala Government . He also seeks a direction to the board to procure online cloud storage server facility to host the portal while the TCS be directed to operate it as per directions of the board. Sharing of data The TDB and the TCS may be directed to share the data of pilgrims required by the Kerala Police as part of effective crowd management verification of virtual queue coupons.

Replying to a calling attention motion by Kadakampally Surendran on the interminable delays in the implementation of various phases of the master plan for the MCH, she said that the project has indeed been delayed and that the SPV responsible for the project, Inkel Ltd., has been warned of stringent measures if the work on the master plan is not hastened. Mr. Surendran said that the Rs. 717.29 crore master plan for the infrastructural development of MCH in four phases had been given administrative sanction in March 2018. The first phase of the project, estimated at Rs. 58.37 crore, which involved essentially the development of roads to MCH, a flyover bridge and a multi-level parking facility for MCH, should have been completed in August 2020. ‘Inefficiency’ He said it was solely the inefficiency of INKEL which resulted in the delay and urged the Minister to take up the time-bound completion of the master plan. Ms. George said that 90% of the roadworks and 60% of the work on the flyover had been completed, while the tender processes for the construction of the multi-level parking lot was yet to be called. She said that to ensure the time-bound completion of the master plan, a nodal officer in charge of implementation and a special officer for the completion of all KIIFB projects under the Health Department had been appointed.

13 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Huge response to Space Habitat Challenge||Imagine living on Titan - Saturn's largest moon - or the planet Mars, or the exoplanet which goes by the name TRAPPIST-1e. The thrilling stuff of science fiction, right? But it could some day turn into reality; leaving planet Earth to colonise a faraway planet or a big-enough moon. But how will these strange, inhospitable environments be tamed? That's exactly what around 1,100 students across Kerala set out to do last week as part of World Space Week (WSW) celebrations - designing ‘space habitats’ for space pioneers of the future. Team Exploding Stars from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) (Shantanu Shakya, Soumyadip Bhunia, Moksh Bhateja and Jyoti Bhramar Manjul) took home the first prize in the college division for designing a space habitat on Mars. Their habitat was 'located' in the the Martian valley Reull Vallis. Team Astroholics Team Astroholics from Arya Central School, Thiruvananthapuram, (Ashwin S., Nikhil S. Pillai, Lalit Karthikeyan M. A., Vaishnavi S. Nair and Avany Abhilash Soni) bagged the first prize in the school category. They designed a habitat near the Kraken Mare on Titan. Focussing on the need for self-sufficient habitats, the winning entries sought to present innovative ideas for shelter, farming and production units, transportation, energy and communication networks and water and waste-management facilities. The Space Habitat Challenge saw participation by 1,100 students from the State in 252 teams. The top five teams from both categories presented their works before a panel of experts on October 9. The teams were encouraged to undertake research into habitable conditions on extraterrestrial bodies, choose a suitable planet or moon to set up a sustainable habitat and study the infrastructure required to facilitate human life there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/huge-response-to-space-habitat-challenge/article36977325.ece

Bindu has directed college principals to expedite the ongoing vaccination drive for students to complete the process in time for the full-scale reopening of colleges in the State on October 18. Convening an online meeting on Tuesday to review the preparedness to resume offline classes for junior batches, Dr. Bindu directed the heads of institutions to enforce COVID-19 guidelines without fail and to plan class sessions in a manner that minimised the chance of crowding. An orientation programme must be held to emphasise the norms. Classrooms, libraries, laboratories and other facilities must be regularly sanitised. College managements must also ensure the availability of thermal scanners, hand sanitisers, masks, and hand wash on campuses. In view of a spate of atrocities against women, Dr. Bindu instructed principals to prioritise gender sensitisation programmes in colleges. Comprehensive classes must be organised. Besides, the functioning of complaints redressal cells must be accorded importance. Training programme A training programme will soon be organised under the aegis of the Kerala State Higher Education Council for teachers in charge of such cells. Counselling centres must also be set up in each institution to ensure the well-being of students. Referring to the growing clamour among the student community for college excursions, the Minister discouraged such activities in view of the inclement weather and the worrying pandemic situation. In full swing With colleges set to function in full swing, Dr. Bindu also urged college managements to focus of infrastructure development. Efforts must also be made to undergo NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) accreditation at the earliest, she said. Director of Collegiate Education V.

13 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Opposition stages walkout over CZMP||The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) walked out of the Assembly on Tuesday to spotlight the Government’s “failure” to submit a coastal zone management plan (CZMP) for approval from the Centre. Seeking the leave of the House to move an adjournment motion on the subject, Congress legislator K. Babu said thousands of houses abutting the sea, lake or river in the State did not qualify for panchayat or municipal registration because of the inordinate delay in finalising the CZMP as mandated by the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) provision. Coastal population The “apathy” had cost coastal dwellers dear. A majority of the “victims” are traditional fishers. With no house numbers, a bulk of the coastal population was beyond the ambit of Government welfare schemes and various State subsidies, Mr. Babu said. The coastal zone regulations promulgated by the Centre in 2019 required coastal States to submit a CZMP to qualify for exemptions from the harsh provisions that regulated construction and development along the coast and river banks and lake shores. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan asked: “Maharashtra has done, why not Kerala? The Chief Minister's excuse that COVID-19 has delayed the plan finalisation has no merit. Even government schemes to provide free housing for the poor have eluded the coastal community because of the stalemate over the CZMP and CRZ,” he said. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the State Government had constituted an expert committee to rectify the anomalies in the CZMP submitted by the National Centre for Earth Sciences Studies. It would present its findings soon. 161 coastal panchayats The Government has declared 161 coastal panchayats with more than 2,061 persons per square kilometre as urban localities. The localities would fall under CRZ 3 A zone, which allowed for development 50 m away from the high tide line, he said. The Government has used the same 2011 Census criteria to categorise another 90 panchayats as cities. Residents Residents living near rivers, lakes, wetlands and paddies (pokkali) and mangrove forests could expect to get similar relaxations, he added. The State Government has formulated location specifics for the CZMPs for Vembanadu lake and 1,800 odd islets. The thrust of the State's CZMP was to encourage development without endangering the coastal environment, said Mr. Vijayan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/opposition-stages-walkout-over-czmp/article36977023.ece

The number of jobs did not matter. Even if one, it should not be ignored, Mr. Vijayan said in his request.

Balagopal has said. The Finance Department had last month issued a circular that required local self-governments to open accounts in the Special Treasury Savings Bank (TSB) within April 1, 2022, for the purpose. The order had apparently contravened an earlier decision of the Local Self-Government Department allowing local bodies to maintain their funds in banks. Responding to questions, Mr. Balagopal said maintaining unused funds in treasury accounts would enable better financial management. Currently, many local self government institutions maintained multiple accounts in cooperative banks and nationalised banks. His comments came a day after Local Self-Government Minister M.V. Govindan replied affirmatively to a question on if the order posed a challenge to the autonomy of local bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-measure-for-fiscal-management-balagopal/article36977025.ece

13 October 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Highest rain in a decade in Bengaluru||The rain that wreaked havoc on Monday (October 11) at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) was the highest rainfall recorded in a decade. Geeta Agnihotri, head of the Meteorological Department in Bengaluru, told The Hindu that 178.3 mm of rainfall was recorded at the airport in 24 hours. Due to a sudden downpour on October 11 evening, roads leading to the terminal were inundated. Movement of vehicles was badly hit for several hours on the approaching roads. Some of the taxis broke down owing to waterlogging. The flooding of the roads had many passengers relying on a tractor to reach the airport. “The observatory at the international airport started functioning in 2011. Since then, the highest rainfall recorded in the premises was on October 11. More rainfall was also recorded in several parts of Tumakuru district such as Bargur and Sira,” she said. Drainage system After videos of the flooded roads went viral on social media, some sections criticised the drainage system. The Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) has maintained that the drainage system was working well and said that sudden high intensity rain caused waterlogging for a short duration.“A very heavy, unprecedented downpour on the evening of October 11 caused waterlogging in parts of the kerb side of KIA. Since it began operations in 2008, the airport has not seen such unprecedented rain on a single day. Though the drainage system in the kerb area is working well, the sudden high intensity rain caused waterlogging for a short duration. Our team was immediately pressed into action and the issue has been resolved. There was waterlogging at one of the junctions and our traffic staff was present to redirect traffic,” said a spokesperson of BIAL. Due to bad weather and poor visibility, 20 departing flights between 5.30 p.m to 11.59 p.m were hit on Monday. The forecast from the Meteorological Centre suggests that Bengaluru and neighbouring areas will have generally cloudy sky and few spells of rain/thundershowers. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be 28 and 21 degrees Celsius respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/highest-rain-in-a-decade-in-bengaluru/article36976753.ece

13 October 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||With resignations galore, MAA affairs get murkier||Artistes wept in the open, got emotional, and questioned the morality of the winning team and fairness of the election results while resigning from the Movie Artistes Association (MAA), making the month-long election episode murkier. All 11 winners from the Prakash Raj panel resigned from their posts, asking the newly-elected president Manchu Vishnu to appoint members of his choice against the vacancies for smooth functioning of the body. Their resignation comes in wake of Mr. Prakash Raj himself giving up his MAA membership citing certain new ‘local, non-local rules’ coming into effect. Mr. Prakash Raj described the resignations as a dignified decision to ensure smooth functioning of the association as the two earlier teams proved that a mixed MAA team was found to be indulging more in fighting than solving issues. He also offered to withdraw his resignation as MAA member if the new team promised not to bring in a new law preventing non-Telugus from contesting association elections. However, he did not hide his anger while charging Mr Vishnu’s team of indiscipline, rowdiness and violent behaviour for their resignations. Senior actor and newly-elected vice-president Banerjee wept at the press conference saying Mr. Mohan Babu abused him using foul language despite Mr Vishnu trying to calm him down. “Why should I stay in the association facing such insults and when my family feels humiliated,” he asked, adding that Mr. Mohan Babu’s wife had even personally called him up to express apologies. Young actor Tanish also got emotional, speaking of the abuses hurled at him but said he was personally close to Mr Vishnu and his brother Manoj and would continue to remain so. He was resigning as EC member as he was unable to face such personal pressures, he said. Actor-writer Uttej alleged ex-president Naresh’s behaviour was objectionable throughout the poll campaign. Senior members mum While the members wash their dirty linen in public, seniors and respected members of the fraternity have kept mum and refused to be dragged into this controversy. But their agony was evident as they said that the vulgarity which crept into the campaign was avoidable. This time, MAA elections took a regionally divisive flavour with Mr Vishnu’s team campaigning on ‘Telugu vs non-local’ plank, questioning the nativity of Mr. Prakash Raj. Senior actors see the election as a fight between Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu camps to showcase their hold on the Telugu film industry.  Why should I stay in the association facing such insults (from Mohan Babu) and when my family feels humiliated?

13 October 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Banking on expert’s advice to wean youth away from ganja||Drums load of ganja seized over the years is stored as evidence in a room at the Telangana Prohibition and Excise Station in Dhoolpet. A little away from there, another room in the station has been teeming with youngsters from the past few weeks on most afternoons. All of them are explained about the “after party” effects — dangerous consequences of smoking ganja. The Dhoolpet Excise officials, through Nasha Mukt Bharat campaign, have temporarily recruited a clinical psychologist who explains the youngsters how smoking ganja saps motivation to take up various activities in life, their chances of becoming infertile or how the substance affects potency, and how it can lead to delusions, paranoia etc. Some of them experiencing the physiological effects have sought help from the officials and the psychologist. From September of this year, the Excise department officials in collaboration with the State Police department have intensified efforts to apprehend people who transport and peddle ganja. Besides them, consumers who try to buy ganja in the Dhoolpet limits too are caught. A little over 410 youngsters were caught from September 21 to October 12, said K Naveen Kumar, Superintendent, Dhoolpet Excise Station. Most of them were in the 18-25 age group. After landing in their dragnet, the youngsters are counselled about the consequences of getting addicted to ganja. Until a few weeks, the Excise officials relied on videos and other material to counsel — which was loaded with emotional aspects. From the past two weeks, a clinical psychologist has been tasked with the job. The Clinical Psychologist is Rachel Nandi. “I explain them how its consumption can effect their academics, social life, work productivity. Increase in tolerance (quantity of ganja consumption) can impair cognitive functions such as logical thinking, judgment, concentration, problem solving abilities. Effects on fertility, and how ganja consumption can lead to hallucinations, paranoia, too are explained,” said Ms Rachel. Since parents too are present at the sessions, the highest and swift response is from the elders who want to save their kids from the addiction. A few of the youngsters too have approached the Excise officials and the psychologists, seeking help to get out of the bait. The Excise Superintendent said that they will continue to catch the transporters, peddlers, and consumers of ganja. The counselling too will continue. PD Act invoked The Hyderabad City Police on Tuesday said that the Preventive Detention Act has been invoked against as many as 23 drug offenders in its five zones. The public was requested to share any information in this regard at 9490616555 by Whatsapp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/weaning-the-youth-from-ganja-addiction/article36976712.ece

Siddaramaiah’s visit Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah, late on Tuesday, visited Gadikeshwar and interacted with people. He criticised the district administration for doing nothing to protect the people. “As many as 50 villages in the region are affected by repeated earthquakes.

The government was supposed to make alternative arrangements for people to stay, but it has hardly done anything in this regard,” he said. Airing their anger against the district administration for not making alternative arrangements for people in the earthquake-prone villages to stay, hundreds of people, led by Sharan Prakash Patil and other Congress leaders, blocked Umarga-Sulepet State Highway on Monday. Mr. Patil alleged that the government had no concern about people’s lives and demanded that district in-charge Minister Murugesh Nirani visit the tremor-hit villages and make staying arrangements for people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mild-tremors-continue-in-kalaburagi/article36976713.ece
13 October 2021||KALPETTA,ANDHRA PRADESH||In Wayanad, Buddha on a paddy field||Praseed Kumar Thayyil, a progressive farmer from Wayanad, has showcased his new rice paddy art work, an image of Buddha, with varying hues of rice varieties on the huge canvas that is his farmland. The Japanese art form called Tanbo art, or rice paddy art, makes use of thousands of rice shoots strategically grown to produce a 3D art work. Mr. Kumar says he created the work on 30 cents of land of his 2.5 acres of paddy field at Kazhambuvayal near Nambikolly under the Nenmeni Krishi Bhavan to sensitise youths to take up agriculture as a profession. He has also cultivated 52 varieties of rice plants with medicinal properties, collected from various parts of the country, in the remaining area. For the paddy artwork, he used four varieties of rice plants — Nazar Bath, a rice variety with purple leaves, and Rakthasali, Chinnar and Jeerakasala, varieties with dark and light greenish leaves, to create the 3D image. While Nazar Bath was procured from Maharashtra, the Chinnar variety was sourced from Tamil Nadu, Rakthasali from Kollam and Jeerakasala, an endemic aromatic rice variety, from Wayanad itself.   Farmers in Japan and China began using paddy art to beautify their fields some three decades ago. It attracted tourists and the farmers earned a good income from tourism, besides returns from rice cultivation, he points out. “Wayanad, a hill station, is emerging as a major tourism destination in the country. If the farmers in the district can attract tourists to their paddy fields, they can also earn a better income,” he says. He claims that on average, more than 50 people, including students, farmers and tourists from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, visit his site every day. This is the fifth consecutive year that Mr. Kumar is creating artworks on his rice field. He has spent nearly Rs. 10,000 for the art. S. Prasad, an artist from Sulthan Bathery, drew the outline with the assistance of 15 workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/in-wayanad-buddha-on-a-paddy-field/article36976725.ece

13 October 2021||NALGONDA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Universities neglected under KCR’||“For a sanctioned strength of 10 professors, the vacancy is 10. There are just six associate professors, whereas the requirement is 21. The pathetic situation of Mahatma Gandhi University, like other universities in the State, is because of KCR’s neglect towards education and employment system,” alleged Y.S. Sharmila, founder YSR Telangana Party. Speaking to media persons at the MGU, in her visit to Nalgonda on Tuesday, she said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had been consistent to achieve ‘vacant university’ status to the State universities. The Osmania University had about 67% empty offices and Palamuru and Kakatiya Universities too were reeling under staff crunch, she said. Participating in her weekly deeksha here, Ms. Sharmila spoke about employment and education. She recalled that the MGU in Nalgonda was opened for education to poor by former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, but it had assumed a dire shape under TRS rule, she said. “University students who are being provided poor quality education and graduates who are waiting for employment notifications, are suffering because of lack of visionary leadership,” she said. Ms. Sharmila said, “Telangana which started with the aspiration of a ‘bangaru Telangana’ has become a ‘bar Telangana’ under KCR.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/universities-neglected-under-kcr/article36977103.ece
13 October 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP govt. committed to SHGs’ welfare: Minister||Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Minister Anil Kumar Yadav has asserted that the YSR Congress Party government was committed to the welfare of women Self Help Groups(SHGs). Outlining the various steps taken by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government to strengthen financially the 78 lakh women entrepreneurs in the State by providing Rs. 12,759 crore in keeping with the YSRCP’s poll promise, he told a media conference here that the opposition Telugu Desam Party had done a disservice to women by not providing the promised loan waiver in the run up to the 2014 Assembly elections and scrapping the ‘Sunna Vadi’(zero interest scheme) in 2016. Zero interest scheme The credit of providing succour to women through YSR Aasara scheme went to the ruling YSRCP which also took upon its shoulders the responsibility of reviving the ‘Sunna Vaddi’(zero interest) scheme and earmarked Rs. 2.362 crore for the purpose and helped the SHGs make a turnaround, he added. Leader of opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu and actor-politician Pawan Kalyan of Jana Sena Party, who only make whirlwind visits to the State, had no moral right to point a finger at the government, he said. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had launched various women-centric welfare schemes, including YSR Cheyutha, and provided houses free of cost to them. But the previous TDP government had saddled the beneficiaries of TIDCO housing scheme with debts, the TDP leader added. The opposition TDP had betrayed the women by putting legal hurdles to the housing scheme for the poor in the State, he charged. On the other hand, the ruling YSRCP had given a pride of place for women by giving more than 50% of the posts at various levels including in local bodies and various finance corporations to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-govt-committed-to-shgs-welfare-minister/article36977096.ece

Floodwaters inundated low-lying areas, damaged houses and disrupted road traffic in several districts. At Karipur in Malappuram, two children, one a seven-year-old and the other aged eight months, died when the wall of a house collapsed in heavy rain following a mudslide from a nearby hillock. A journalist working for a vernacular daily was crushed to death after a tree fell on him while he was travelling on a two-wheeler at Pandalam in Pathanamthitta. In Kollam, a 66-year-old man drowned in a swollen canal near the Nagamala estate. Isolated heavy rainfall is likely to continue in the State till October 16 under the influence of cyclonic circulations persisting over both the Arabian Sea and the Andaman Sea, according to the weather office here.  Revenue Minister K. Rajan said 27 relief camps had been opened to accommodate families displaced by the floods and instructions had been issued to open more camps wherever needed. He said six teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were positioned in Thrissur, Alappuzha, Idukki, and Wayanad to respond to emergency situations. Families in places prone to landslips and flooding would be relocated to safer places. The State police have also been put on stand-by for rescue and relief work. In Thrissur, people living along the banks of the swollen Chalakudy river were evacuated when floodwaters entered many houses after the sluice valves of Peringalkuthu dam were opened in the earlier hours on Tuesday.

13 October 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Over a lakh visit Durga temple||Thousands of devotees thronged the Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam on the sixth day of Dasara celebrations here on Tuesday. The presiding deity was adorned as Saraswati Devi, with a ‘veena’ on her lap and blessing devotees. The people consider ‘Moola Nakshatram’ an auspicious star as it is the ‘Janma Nakshatram’ of the goddess. About one lakh devotees had darshan of the deity by 6 p.m. The temple authorities estimate that more than one and half lakh devotees would have darshan by night. The temple priests threw open the temple for darshan at around 1.30 a.m. Devotees waited in queue lines since Monday night. After taking a holy dip in the Krishna, they entered the queue lines at the Vinayaka temple. Though all queue lines were turned into general darshan lines for speedy movement, the devotees waited for hours together in serpentine queues. Bhavanis were seen taking dip in river Krishna. The temple authorities decided not to encourage Bhavani Deeksha this year in view of COVID pandemic. The officials stopped operating special vehicles for the VIPs, media and others to the temple in view of the heavy rush since morning.

13 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Congress forms campaign panel for Badvel bypoll||All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary C.D. Meyyappan has been appointed as the Advisor and Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) working presidents N. Thulasi Reddy and Shaik Mastan Vali as the in-charges for the Badvel bypoll. The party has constituted a 24-member campaign committee with K. Vinay Kumar as its convener. APCC president S. Sailajanath on Tuesday urged the State government to improve facilities in the government hospitals to enable the economically poor sections to gain access to quality treatment. In a statement, he said the YSRCP government created a hype about Nadu-Nedu programme that was supposed to have improved the infrastructure in educational institutions and hospitals, but the scheme impact was ‘nil’ on the health sector. On May 31 this year, Mr. Sailajanath said, the Chief Minister laid the foundation stone for construction of 14 medical colleges in the State. The proposal was to build total 16 medical colleges in the State. “But in the last 130 days, not a brick has been laid for the project,” he said. The APCC chief said adequate budget was allocated to the health sector by the government. In 2021-22 budget, funds of Rs. 13,830.44 crore was allocated to the health sector as against Rs. 9,426.49 crore last financial year. “Funds were also allocated for implementation of the YSR Aarogyasri, 104 and 108 schemes, but they did not serve any purpose,” he said. He said merely increasing the number of medical colleges would not help and that the government should also focus on improving the infrastructure facilities. In a separate statement, Mr. Thulasi Reddy slammed the State government for what he alleged cutting down on the benefits of various sections. “The government is unable to pay salaries to its employees, but it talks about creating three capitals in the State,” he ridiculed. “There was a slash of Rs. 5,000 for every farmer family benefiting from the Rythu Bharosa scheme and 9 lakh ration cards have been removed, 3 lakh pensions have been reduced and there was a cut in the irrigation budget. People will soon have to suffer power cuts as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-forms-campaign-panel-for-badvel-bypoll/article36977118.ece

13 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Exchange of fire in Odisha another setback to Maoists in AOB region||With three more Maoists being killed in an alleged exchange of fire with the security forces near the Tulasipahad area in Odisha on Tuesday, the cadres have received another major setback in the Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) region this year. Among the three, two are said to be women and the exchange of fire took place in the Tulasi Reserve Forest near the Odisha-Chhattisgarh border. The deceased, said to be the members of the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC), were part of the team being led by Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Aruna. This was the fourth exchange of fire after the major encounter in Teegalametta in Koyyuru in June this year, in which six Maoists including top leaders such as Ashok and Ranadev were killed by the the Greyhounds, the anti-naxal force of Andhra Pradesh. Thereafter, there were two more exchanges of fire on the Andhra side of the AOB and another on the Odisha side. In September, Maoist senior leader Dubashi Sankar was arrested by the Odisha Police in Koraput. Senior leaders such as Jalandhar Reddy alias Krishna and Chikkudu Chinna Rao alias Sudheer surrendered before the Andhra Pradesh police this year. The leadership has weakened with most of them dying in exchanges of fire and many surrendering before the police in the recent times. The onus is of leading the cadres now on Uday, Aruna, Kakuri Pandana alias Jagan and Suresh. According to police, there are hardly about 15 to 20 cadres and leaders left in the AOB region and they depend on the cadres imported from Chhattisgarh. The recruitment has almost dried down in the region and after the Koyyuru encounter, it is learnt that the Maoist leadership is trying to crossover to Chhattisgarh with the remaining cadres. They are now focussing on the Odisha-Chhattisgarh border region. The security forces are making deep inroads into the AOB region on both the sides, including in Maoist strongholds in Visakaha Agency and in the Swabhiman Anchaal in the cut-off region. The AOB is no longer a safe haven and this appears to be factor to look towards Chhattisgarh, said a senior police officer who is engaged in anti-Maoist operations. On Tuesday, heavy fire was exchanged between the combined security forces of Odisha comprising Special Operations Group (SOG) and District Voluntary Force (DVF), and the Maoists in three to four places in the same area and it lasted over an hour. As per the IG (Operations) Amitabh Thakur, going by the heavy firing, it was estimated that the Maoist strength could be between 15 to 20 members. It is learnt that the group was being led by senior Maoist leader Suresh and the Maoist had triggered a landmine too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/exchange-of-fire-in-odisha-another-setback-to-maoists-in-aob-region/article36977120.ece

13 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Operation of additional Vistadome coaches to Araku likely soon||The operation of additional Vistadome coaches to Araku is likely to become a reality soon with the railways conducting a trial run of the LHB rake from Visakhapatnam to Araku on Tuesday, according to reliable sources. One new Vistadome coach with large glass windows arrived early this month and three more arrived subsequently in Visakhapatnam. They are parked in the coaching depot. The lone Vistadome coach, introduced in 2017, has a ‘self-generating battery’ and its coupling is ‘screw type’. It is being attached to the Visakhapatnam – Kirandul passenger, up to Araku ever since. It has been in great demand ever since. The new Vistadome coaches have CBC (Centre Buffer Coupler) and do not have a battery. These new LHB type Vistadome coaches requires an EOG (End On Generator). It is learnt that the railway officials are planning to conduct another trial run from Araku to Koraput in the next few days, and once that was completed the train can be operated with LHB coaches. Divisional Railway Manager Anup Kumar Satpathy told The Hindu , earlier this month, that there were plans to run the Araku train with LHB coaches before the commencement of the tourist season. Meanwhile, tourists are in favour of the Vistadome coaches being run as an independent tourist train from Visakhapatnam to Araku, instead of attaching them to the Kirandul passenger. A HOG (Head On Generator) can be attached to this train to do away with the need of an EOG. The HOG can draw power from the overhead lines and supply it to the coaches, say sources familiar with the functioning of the railways. “The dedicated train can leave early in the mornings from Visakhapatam and start from Araku around 4 p.m., on its return journey, so that it covers the tunnels and breathtaking valleys before dusk. This is important to ensure full patronage to the Vistadome coaches on the return journey. The regular delay in the arrival of the return train at Araku from Kirandul had been deterring tourists from opting to pay high fare on the Vistadome as they cannot enjoy the beautiful views of nature after dark,” say tourists. “A mini pantry service should also be introduced on the tourist train to enable tourists enjoy the sylvan surroundings, as they munch snacks,” they add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/operation-of-additional-vistadome-coaches-to-araku-likely-soon/article36977156.ece

The cameras have the ability to detect or capture the face of the intruder clearly. “We will not openly install these cameras. These are concealed cameras. A criminal cannot sight these cameras at all. If at all, any suspicious movement occurs nearby the house, the police control room would immediately receive an alert. Police team nearby would rush to the spot,” said Mr. Penta Rao. People leaving to their native places and on vacations, can put a request for LHMS, he said.Apart from LHMS, the police are also cautioning people, especially women, to avoid possible chain snatching while going to temples on the occasion of Navaratri festival.

Vijaya Sai Reddy. According to him, the government has urged the High Court to take up the matter, give it a patient hearing and dispose of the case, at the earliest. “We are aware that people residing in that area have been suffering and to give it a logical conclusion we have submitted a plan based on the recommendations made by the committee to probe into issue,” he said. “To protect the interest of the residents, we have proposed to give alternative land and as well as provide partial regularisation. The plan proposed is a combination of alternative land and partial regularisation, so that the interest of both the parties – the residents and the Simhachalam Devasthanam – is protected,” said Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy. He said to protect the temple land from encroachment, a boundary wall with 22-km circumference is being build around the Simhachalam hill. The project has been sanctioned and we will provide a pathway along the boundary wall, which will serve the purpose of ‘Giri Pradakshina’, he said. There are several cases pending in the Andhra Pradesh High Court pertaining to this issue, which has been hanging fire since over last three decades. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to find a solution to the issue within 100 days after coming to power. Earlier, Forum for Development of North Andhra (FDNA) had urged the Chief Minister to provide a solution based on the ‘Gilman Survey’ of 1903. According to the Gilman Survey, only 39.5 acres in Adavivaram panchayat belonged to the Simhachalam devasthanam while the rest were ‘jeerayati’, ‘banjar’, ‘poramboke’ and forest lands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-keen-to-settle-panchagrama-issue-vijaya-sai/article36977121.ece

He urged dairy farmers to utilise the subsidies being given on animal feed supplied through Rythu Bharasa Kendras in the district.

The official machinery ramped up the vaccination drive to prevent the spread of coronavirus during the long festive season (October-December) which got under way with hordes of shoppers flocking to markets and business centres in Kothagudem, Palvancha, Manuguru and other major towns in the district. To achieve 100% vaccination in the district, around 30,000 vaccine doses need to be administered daily within the tentative time frame, sources said. A little over 5.07 lakh persons of the district’s eligible population of 7.67 lakh people had taken the first dose till Monday. Around 1.49 lakh persons have received the second dose, sources added. Field-level functionaries and health workers are facing a tough task to ensure cent per cent inoculation in remote tribal pockets, mostly in temporary tribal settlements, in Bhadrachalam Agency and elsewhere in the district, sources added. The field health workers, including Accredited Social Health Activists and ANMs, are putting in extra efforts to get tribal people in far-flung habitations vaccinated by addressing vaccine hesitancy and highlighting the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. In Khammam district, 188 gram panchayats have achieved 100% vaccination coverage, sources said. Over 31,000 vaccine doses were administered in the district in past 48 hours as part of the stepped-up drive. District Immunisation Officer, Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Nagendra Prasad told The Hindu that dozens of teams of health workers and other field-level functionaries are working relentlessly in the tribal heartland to ensure total vaccination of the entire eligible population.

13 October 2021||ETIGADDAKISHTAPUR,TELANGANA||Some oustees seek houses instead of plots||It was demand draft for Rs. 5.04 lakh drawn in the name of District Collector of Siddipet. Mentioning as A/C Payee dated 13/05/2021, the DD was drawn by Byagari Pochaiah, a resident of Etigaddakishtapur village newly established at Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony at Mutrajpally. Soon after the DD was drawn it was handed over to sarpanch D. Pratap Reddy. He was not alone, there are more than 40 persons from this village alone who drew DDs in the name of Collector, Siddipet, with a hope that they would be allotted houses in the R&R Colony. All these 40 plus families have opted for house-sites instead of constructed double bedroom houses in the colony and took Rs. 5.04 lakh from the government in lieu of houses. However they changed their mind and preferred houses when Mr. Pratap Reddy said there were some vacant houses in the colony and interested can pay the amount to make an appeal to authorities in this regard. From the beginning, the officials have handed over the responsibility of allotment of houses to oustees to sarpanches and other local elected representatives who convinced them to vacate villages. As the sarpanch informed them, they had drawn DDs in the name of Collector and handed over them to the sarpanch. “We are not always having access to higher officials. As the sarpanch is the regular communicator between officials and us, we have trusted him and handed over the DDs to him. Now it is being indicated that we have to vacate these houses and we do not know what will be our fate. We are not yet shown the plots to construct houses,” said S. Chandrasekhar, one of the oustees who dreaw a DD. “The Siddipet RDO has informed me that there are some houses vacant and they can be allotted to those who wish to have them. He said that they can draw the DD s in the name of Collector. These oustees entered houses with the complete knowledge of officials. When I tried to hand over the demand drafts, the RDO is not accepting to take them. Instead, there are indications that these oustees need to be vacated. They have already invested in the houses they occupied, though not allotted, to get them repaired and modified. We do not know what to do now,” Mr. Pratap Reddy said while admitting that there was no proof to show that the RDO had informed him as it was always verbal communication. He also pointed out that there was no official allotment so far as no house was registered to oustees and many of them got modifications to them without registration. When contacted, Collector P.

13 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KCR betrayed youngsters: Revanth||Backwardness of Mahabubanagar and neglect of its irrigation projects by the government were on focus at the ‘Vidyarthi Nirudyoga Jung Siren' of the Telangana Congress that also saw TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy connecting his ‘local boy’ image to the large turnout at Amistapur. The enthusiastic participants cheered the Congress leaders as they targeted the TRS government for ‘betraying’ youngsters with false promises and now using police to suppress them for raising their just demands. Mr. Reddy said the district produced stalwarts like Suravaram Pratap Reddy, Boorgula Ramakrishn Rao, S. Jaipal Reddy, Mallikarjun Goud and Mallu Anantha Ramulu but the TRS leaders had defamed this great district with land grabbing and creating sand mafia. Targeting Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the TPCC president said that the former had left Mahabubnagar in the lurch after getting elected Parliament member. “He did not have the gratitude to pay back to the backward area that sent him to Parliament,” Mr. Reddy charged. In fact, KCR provided an opportunity to Andhra Pradesh to call the pending irrigation projects of the district illegal, he alleged. The TPCC chief said KCR did not complete Bheema, Nettampadu, Koyal Sagar, and other irrigation projects although Congress leader Vamshichand Reddy had raised the issue in the Assembly several times seeking Rs. 1,000 crore for their completion. He said Congress leader Nagam Janardhan Reddy fought with Chandrababu Naidu while Chinna Reddy fought with Kiran Kumar Reddy regarding the backwardness of Mahabubnagar district despite being Ministers but the present TRS leaders did not have the guts to raise their voice with KCR. CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka alleged that though Congress started all the projects the TRS government neglected them giving scope to Andhra Pradesh to term them illegal due to the neglect of KCR. Mr. Madhu Yaskhi Goud demanded that all the 1.91 lakh government jobs be filled to assuage the angry youngsters who fought for separate Telangana and the TRS should provide unemployment allowance of Rs. 3,016 from December 2018 to nearly 60 lakh jobless as promised. Downtrodden were being forced away from education as the government had failed to released fee reimbursement. Earlier, Mr. Revanth Reddy warned the police officials who were deliberately targeting ongress workers. Tension prevailed at Jadcherla when the police blocked the roads preventing Congress leaders’ entry into Jadcherla and Mahabubnagar and asking them to go directly to the venue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-betrayed-youngsters/article36977188.ece

Return to offices To queries, Mr.Aroll said 50% of IT employees may return to offices in Hyderabad by December. At present, about 10% of the employees are working from office with the rest continuing to work from home (WFH). The number of employees working from office varies from 5% for large companies to 70-80% for small companies. Though the fear of more COVID waves remain, one of the factors that could pave the way for shift from WFH will be the number of people who have been vaccinated as well as availability of vaccines for those who are yet to be inoculated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hysea-to-conduct-infra-summit-on-oct-22/article36977274.ece
13 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Guidelines on forest protection soon’||The State Government has resolved to announce guidelines pertaining to protection of forest lands and the extent of land on which podu cultivation is likely to be permitted in a couple of days, Tribal Welfare Minister Satyavati Rathod said. The Minister said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao constituted a Cabinet sub-committee on the podu lands issue as part of efforts to evolve a permanent solution to the podu cultivation and the Cabinet panel had submitted its report to the government after holding deliberations with stakeholders. “A major step towards the effective implementation of ROFR (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act has been taken. The government has focused on steps to benefit eligible tribals as well as other dependent on forests,” she said participating in a review meeting with senior officials on Tuesday. She expressed concern that the previous government had not taken steps to resolve the issues in time bound manner. This could be seen from the manner in which forest pattas were given in Bayyaram in the past on the lands under the possession of Revenue department. Problems were also encountered as the officials concerned failed to demarcate the boundaries of the lands assigned in the past. The Chief Minister however favoured steps to ensure that forests should not suffer degradation on account of podu cultivation and the interests of tribals should be protected at the same time. Forests were spread over as much as 66 lakh acres across the State according to records of which, pattas were given on three lakh acres. Podu cultivation was being practiced in six lakh acres and the Chief Minister was firm that forests were protected. Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar held a meeting with senior officials to discuss the Podu lands issue to decide the modalities that should be adopted in the coming days. The meeting follows the assurance of the Chief Minister that applications would be received from eligible people from third week of this month. The meeting discussed the model of application process that should be followed and issues like forest boundaries that should be included in the applications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/guidelines-on-forest-protection-soon/article36977186.ece

Karnan on Tuesday. At a meeting with officials of banks in the district, the Collector instructed them to furnish details of bank accounts through which transactions of Rs. 1 lakh or more were conducted.

13 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Palm-sized Mahishamardini sculpture discovered||A palm-sized sculpture of Mahishamardini discovered on the outskirts of Pangal near Nalgonda has been identified as belonging to Vishnukundin era. The Vishnukundin dynasty ruled for two centuries between 420 and 624 AD and a few relics of their rule were found during excavation at Yeleswaram in 1963-64. The sculpture was discovered by some farmers of Dandempalli village while they were digging a channel for irrigation purpose. After examining the sculpture, archeologist E. Sivanagireddy traced its origins by finding similarities with another stone sculpture of the goddess from Keesaragutta datable to the 4th-5th centuries AD. The small carving on a soapstone measures 10 x 5 x 2 cms and shows the Goddess Mahishamardhini engaged in slaying the demon Mahishasura in the form of a buffalo. She is seen trampling the head of the demon and twisting its tail and at the same time driving a sula into the head. The other two arms hold sankhu and chakra. The simple drapery, ornaments and the turban like head gear clearly reveals the early iconography, says Mr. Sivanagireddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/palm-sized-mahishamardini-sculpture-discovered/article36977167.ece

13 October 2021||New Delhi,||Avoid using vehicles for at least one day a week: CM to Delhiites||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday appealed to citizens to avoid using their vehicles for at least one day a week and switch off their engines while waiting at traffic signals. These are among measures as part of the Delhi government’s campaigns against air pollution in the Capital. Stubble burning had begun in neighbouring States, the Chief Minister told a digital briefing, as a result of which air pollution levels had spiked in the city. “Pollution levels stay within the safe limits throughout but during this time of the year, they start to increase gradually. One can go and check my tweets in the last 3-4 days and observe how the pollution levels have been on the rise,” he said. “The reason behind this is the fact that the governments of neighbouring States did not try at all to help their farmers manage stubble and they have been forced to burn it. It is very evident in NASA’s satellite images. Thanks to all of this, Delhi will have to again bear incessant pollution in winter,” the CM said. Because of the active participation of Delhiites in the government’s campaigns in the past, both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels had reduced by 25%. However, he added, the fight had not ended there. After having put forward a 10-point winter action plan that detailed how the Delhi government would work to curb pollution, Mr. Kejriwal sought public support to check pollution this winter. “Today I am here to seek the support of the people of Delhi once again. We all need to take responsibility and work towards reducing pollution at our own levels, in our own capacity. I want to urge all the people to contribute to three major campaigns,” he said. “Firstly, last year, we launched a campaign called ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ whose results were much appreciated. People just need to turn the car engine off at the red light, and turn it on when the light becomes green. This will reduce pollution and save fuel,” he said. This campaign, Mr. Kejriwal said, would formally begin on October 18. The Petroleum Conservation Research Association, according to the Chief Minister, had presented data positing that switching off engines at the red light saves around Rs. 250 crore annually and reduces pollution by 13%-20%. Secondly, he said, everyone could try to use public transport or carpool and avoid using vehicles at least once a week. Experts had said that doing so more than once a week or at least once would help bring down the levels of pollution and help save fuel too. “Third, we developed the Green Delhi app last year that has resolved around 23,000 complaints so far. We all have to submit a complaint of any kind of pollution, be it industrial, vehicular, or garbage burning. Our team will act on it and reach the location to deal with the complaint,” the CM said. “If we start to follow these three solutions then we will be making great progress in our fight,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/avoid-using-vehicles-for-at-least-one-day-a-week-cm-to-delhiites/article36977240.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pakistani terrorist arrested in the Capital||The Delhi Police Special Cell claims to have foiled terror strikes in the city during the festival season following the arrest of a Pakistani terrorist from east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar on Monday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said the accused has been identified as Mohammed Ashraf and was living in India as Ali Ahmed Noori, 40, for the past 15 years. He is a resident of Punjab in Pakistan and was member of a sleeper cell, the police said. An AK-47 rifle with two magazines, 60 sophisticated pistols with 50 rounds and a hand grenade have been recovered at his instance. The arms and ammunition were buried by the Yamuna river. Kashmir terror strikes The police said he was tasked by his Pakistani handler to orchestrate terror strikes during the festival season and the recovered arms and ammunition were arranged by the handler. He is suspected to have been involved in the Jammu and Kashmir terror strikes. The police are trying to ascertain his involvement in terror activities in the last 15 years. The police said that they received an input two months ago about an active sleeper cell headed by a Pakistani national. Following this, sources were activated and the identity of the man was established. “A tip-off was received that he had been directed to undertake terror attacks in India, and that he was in the advanced stage of procuring arms and explosives. Further, he had managed to obtain Indian identities and had been living in Delhi under the cover of a Peer Maulana,” Mr. Kushwah said. Acting on a tip-off, Ashraf was arrested from Laxmi Nagar on Monday. “He used to act as a Maulana who used to ‘cure’ people’s illnesses. He used to keep changing his lodging place,” the officer said. ISI handler According to the police, Ashraf received training from a Pakistan ISI handler in Sialkot in 2004. He entered India via the Siliguri border. “He went to Ajmer and befriended a maulvi at a local masjid in 2006. He then accompanied the maulvi to Delhi. Here, in the Walled City, he started Tilawat [daily wages prayer job] at local factories,” Mr. Kushwah said. His permanent address on the documents is of Bihar and current address is that of Delhi. The police said that he has also travelled to Thailand and Saudi Arabia.  He used to act as a Maulana who used to cure people’s illnesses.

13 October 2021||New Delhi,||GRAP measures to kick in when air quality deteriorates: officials||Measures under “very poor” and “severe” category of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to control air pollution will kick in only when the air quality deteriorates further and stays in prescribed levels for 48 hours, according to officials. Last year, the erstwhile EPCA (Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority) had ordered States to implement measures under “very poor” and “severe” category of GRAP in NCR cities from October 15 in anticipation of bad air, before the air quality actually deteriorated to the prescribed levels. This is not likely to happen this year. “This year, we have been constantly issuing directions to States to control air pollution. Also, the air quality has been not that bad till now. So, the government won’t be pre-emptively announcing measures under GRAP from October 15. The ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ category measures will come into effect when the air quality deteriorates and stays in prescribed levels for 48 hours,” an official said. Till last year, the Supreme Court-appointed EPCA used to order States to implement GRAP measures. The EPCA was dissolved and replaced by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) last year. A sub-committee of the CAQM is looking into the implementation of the GRAP, the official said.

13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Unitech promoters’ case: FIR registered after SC order||The Delhi Police Crime Branch on Tuesday registered a case after 32 officials of Tihar Jail number 7 were found to be complicit with Unitech’s imprisoned ex-promoters Ajay Chandra and Sanjay Chandra, officials said on Tuesday. The Supreme Court had on October 6 directed suspension of Tihar jail officials, registration of case against them and full-fledged probe into their collusion with the jailed promoters, based on Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana’s report. ED status report “Accordingly, letters have been sent to the Director General, Tihar jail and the Home Ministry for necessary action in this regard,” he said. The police said that on August 26, the apex court took note of the status report filed by the Enforcement Directorate, which highlighted certain disturbing facts relating to the manner in which the premises of Central Jail Tihar had been misused by jail inmates — Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra — after which the court transferred both the brothers from Central Jail Tihar, Delhi, to Arthur Road Jail and Taloja Central Jail in Mumbai. Conduct inquiry The court had also directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to conduct an inquiry in the matter after which Mr. Asthana visited Tihar jail and questioned officials. The court had also directed that the officials of Tihar jail who have been prima facie found to be complicit in the course of the inquiry be placed under suspension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/unitech-promoters-case-fir-registered-after-sc-order/article36977236.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Buying electricity at higher rates to avoid cut’||The Delhi government is buying electricity at higher rates to make sure that there is no power cut in the city, Power Minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday. He claimed that neighbouring States that produce electricity are finding it difficult to supply the required power to the city due to a shortage of coal. “All coal-reliant power plants in Delhi are non-functional. The Delhi government buys electricity from power plants located outside the city, which too run on coal. The BJP is spreading rumours on this. The Central government-run NTPC, the largest producer of electricity, has halved the power generation in its plants across the country for the last few days,” Mr. Jain said. The Minister said that the Centre should clarify its stand on the issue. “On the one hand, the Central government says there is no shortage of coal and on the other, it says that the responsibility of coal will now be handled by the Union Minister. The Centre should make it clear whether there is a shortage of coal or not or it is being done intentionally,” Mr. Jain said. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on October 9 written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the coal shortage, which he alleged was continuing for the third consecutive month, affecting power generation from major plants supplying electricity to Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/buying-electricity-at-higher-rates-to-avoid-cut/article36977245.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘60 lakh people without cards not getting rations as claimed by govt.’||Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Tuesday said that if the Delhi government really wants to provide rations through doorstep delivery, it should also provide rations to those who do not have ration cards. There were as many as 60 lakh people who had applied for ration cards but were not getting the due rations despite the Delhi government’s claim that they were, he said. “Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is creating an illusion that the Central government is not allowing him to deliver ration to the poor, whereas the truth is people are getting the ration smoothly from the ration shops and no one has any difficulty,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged. “On the other hand, there are people who do not have a ration card. More than 60 lakh people have applied for ration cards in Delhi and the government could not make their ration cards in the last seven years,” he said. The Delhi government had announced that it would give free ration to such people and said this ration would be distributed from schools, but it wasn’t, the LoP claimed. Hundreds of tonnes of foodgrains had rotten lying in these schools, he also alleged. If the Delhi government was really sympathetic to the poor, Mr. Bidhuri said, it should deliver ration door-to-door to people without ration cards under the doorstep delivery scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/60-lakh-people-without-cards-not-getting-rations-as-claimed-by-govt/article36977250.ece

13 October 2021||New Delhi,||HC raps govt. over petty cases against juveniles||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday came down heavily on the Delhi government for failing to comply with its order on terminating all cases against juveniles, where inquiries are pending in alleged petty offences, before the Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) and have remained inconclusive for over a year. A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani also said that the Delhi government has not complied with its direction to apprise it of the number of cases where inquiries are pending in each JJB here for six months to one year. Over 400 minors The Delhi government showed a chart where there was a difference of 409 minors in the number of juveniles produced before the JJB and released thereafter. To this, the High Court said, “Where are these 409 juveniles? They have fallen through the cracks. These 409 [minors] will be lost in the system. We shudder to think what awaits us. What is happening? What happened to these 409 and where are they?” The court reminded the government of its September 29 judgment, which said the child must be produced before the JJB within 24 hours of becoming a subject of processes under the JJ Act. When the court asked when will all the juveniles, allegedly involved in petty offences and against whom inquires are pending, be produced before the JJB, the government counsel said it will be done in 10 days. “You should have done it by now. We are surprised at what JJBs are doing. Are they not aware of our order? They must comply with our order. By now, the JJB should have directed the police to produce all juveniles before the board,” the court said, adding, “We cannot turn a blind eye to it”. The court had termed the high pendency of cases as “completely unacceptable”, and directed immediate release of any such detained children whose case inquiry remains inconclusive for longer than one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-raps-govt-over-petty-cases-against-juveniles/article36977229.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||Spas unhappy with cross-gender massage ban||With the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) announcing a ban on “cross-gender massages” for spas and massage centres falling under its jurisdiction on Monday, establishment owners and spa associations voiced their discontent and said that the new rules would be “difficult to follow”. A spa owner from south Delhi said his establishment has been “shut since the second lockdown” was initiated. “Earlier, my establishment was shut for close to 10 months because of the first lockdown. If we have to reopen, we will have to hire trained staffers according to the new policy and that will add to the ongoing financial struggle. Cross-gender massages happen all over the world and the new rules will definitely leave many unemployed. It is wrong,” he said. Pooja Chatterjee, president of Delhi Wellness Spa Association (DWSA), said that a “fresh petition will be filed” against the new rules. Previously, a plea challenging the ban on cross-gender massages was filed by Association of Wellness Ayurveda & Spa (AWAS) in the Delhi High Court. “We are waiting for the decision of the writ petition. Don’t you think that members of the LGBTQIA society will have an issue with these rules? We are not going to tolerate this ban on cross-gender massages and the separation of male and female sections. It is not possible,” said Ms. Chatterjee. Cites Madras HC order Ravi Tandon, vice president of the DWSA and owner of two city-based spas, cited the Madras High Court order that had ruled in favour of cross-gender massages in 2019. He added, “Nobody can discriminate on the basis of gender, I don’t understand how these new rules can be approved. There is a clear order from the Madras High Court that banning of cross-gender massages was not the solution to stop illegal sex trade.” The Madras High Court’s 2019 order had also stated that “sexual favours” were not limited to the heterosexual domain and that it could continue in a same gender setup. Lovely Verma, a transgender, stated that the new rules for spas will “definitely affect” her choice”. “Although I identify as a woman, I don’t think I will get to choose the gender of the massage therapist that I am comfortable with. Will there be a transgender person for us? What provisions have been put in place for the LGBTQ community,” she questioned.  We are not going to tolerate this ban on cross-gender massages and the separation of male and female sections.

13 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Will never give house on rent again’||As news of Mohammed Ashraf’s arrest broke on Tuesday, the family it impacted was that of Nadira in Geeta Colony’s Aram Park. The present address on Ashraf’s Indian ID was that of hers. She was worried if the arrest would impact her family. “This man had come to us around 10-12 years ago and stayed on rent at our house for less than a year. He was alone and had come without any family members,” she said from behind an iron mesh in her house in a cramped lane in Aram Park. He had told the family that his name was Ali and a few months later, he asked for help. Their address on his ID “He said he wanted to get his Aadhaar card made and needed documents of the house for address. My husband didn’t suspect anything,” she said. “We were only helping. How can one guess who the person might turn out to be?” Ms. Nadira’s husband, who runs a tailoring shop on the ground floor of their triple-storey residence, shut shop on Tuesday because of the media frenzy. “I sent my son outside in the street to ensure people don’t think we have locked ourselves up or are at fault. It’s a small area and people judge. I hope our image is not ruined,” she said. Ms. Nadira is so scared that she has decided to ask two of her tenants to leave their rooms. “I have started doubting everyone. We’ll ask these tenants to vacate as well. I’ll never give the house on rent again. We will never help anyone again,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/will-never-give-house-on-rent-again/article36977231.ece
13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sisodia seeks guidelines from Union Health Minister||Amid clamour from the Delhi BJP and the Delhi Congress to allow Chhath Puja celebrations in the Capital, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday wrote to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya to issue guidelines on the conduct of the festival. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority, in an order on September 30, had prohibited Chhath at riverbanks, waterbodies and other public places in view of COVID-19. Mr. Sisodia, in his letter, requested the Minister to consult health experts and issue guidelines so that all devotees from north India can celebrate the festival keeping their safety in mind. Mr. Sisodia, while demanding a lift on the ban, said the people of Purvanchal are eagerly waiting to celebrate Chhath with their family and loved ones like every year; therefore, the Central government should allow the celebration. “For the last 18 months, Delhi as well as the entire nation has had to bear with the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year too, in view of COVID-19, decisions on the celebration of Chhath across the country were taken as per the instructions of the Centre,” he said. ‘Dislike for Poorvanchalis’ Meanwhile, the Delhi Congress alleged that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had an antipathy towards the people of Poorvanchal. Delhi Congress Chief Ch. Anil Kumar said there had been an anti-Poorvanchali attitude during the lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 when the government provided no help to lakhs of Poorvanchalis who fled the city on foot to their villages. “When permission could be given to open liquor shops and movie halls, hold marriages, Ramlila and Durga Puja festivals, why Chhath Puja has been banned? ” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sisodia-seeks-guidelines-from-union-health-minister/article36977248.ece
13 October 2021||New Delhi,||Manoj Tiwari injured during protest over Chhath Puja||North-east Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari and several party workers were injured during a protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Tuesday demanding that the Delhi government reverse its decision to ban Chhath Puja. Addressing protestors, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta accused the government of being anti-Hindu, and said that it was rather strange to ban Chhath Puja celebrations when markets, shops, cinema halls and even swimming pools in the city were open. “Chhath Puja is like a ‘sanjeevani’ for about 80 lakh Poorvanchalis in Delhi. The city is running on full stream with weekly bazars , malls and even swimming pools being reopened. Then why can’t Chhath be celebrated under the same rules,” Mr. Tiwari asked. Mr. Tiwari suffered injuries after facing a water cannon which had been put in place as a crowd control measure by the police outside Mr. Kejriwal’s residence. The BJP leader was treated at Safdurjung Hospital before being discharged. The party alleged that several other BJP workers also got injured during the agitation. “The BJP is opposing this decision because it is an attack on Poorvanchalis’ religious feelings and we are with them at this hour. The party will celebrate the festival with fully COVID-19 safety guidelines in mind. The fact is Mr. Kejriwal is running away from his responsibilities,” Mr. Gupta said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/manoj-tiwari-injured-during-protest-over-chhath-puja/article36977247.ece

According to sources, the L-G appreciated the efforts made so far, including setting up of Jal Shakti Kendras, GIS mapping of waterbodies, documentation and preparation of action plan, and revival of waterbodies. He, however, stressed on encroachment-free upkeep of watershed and catchment areas of waterbodies for sustainable and enhanced water harvesting and groundwater recharge. While reviewing the action taken report, sources said, the officials concerned were instructed to put in place strict timelines and compress the existing projections with activity-wise incremental plans that could be monitored at the micro level and reviewed at least once a month. Compulsory rainwater harvesting and use of recycled water for non-potable purposes and dual piping in gated colonies were also emphasised upon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/baijal-reviews-progress-of-jal-shakti-abhiyan-in-delhi/article36977238.ece

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Satish Kumar said that the accused has been identified as Jasbir Arya who allegedly strangulated his wife, Megha Arya, to death on October 2.

13 October 2021||Doha,||Taliban meet EU-U.S. team in Qatar||The Taliban held their first face-to-face talks with a joint U.S.-EU delegation on Tuesday in Qatar as Brussels pledged €1 billion ($1.2 billion) in aid for Afghanistan. The hardline Islamists are seeking recognition, as well as assistance to avoid a humanitarian disaster, after they returned to power in August following the withdrawal of U.S. troops after 20 years of war. Economic collapse UN chief Antonio Guterres earlier urged the world to donate to drought-hit and impoverished Afghanistan to head off economic collapse, but also slammed the Taliban’s “broken” promises to Afghan women and girls. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU aid package, meant “to avert a major humanitarian and socio-economic collapse”, at a virtual G20 summit hosted by Italy on Tuesday. She stressed the funds are “direct support” for Afghans and would be channelled to international organisations working on the ground, not to the Taliban’s interim government which Brussels does not recognise. “We have been clear about our conditions for any engagement with the Afghan authorities, including on the respect of human rights,” she said. “So far, the reports speak for themselves. But the Afghan people should not pay the price of the Taliban's actions.” The Taliban badly need assistance as Afghanistan’s economy is in a parlous state with most aid cut off even as winter nears, food prices rising and unemployment spiking. EU countries are wary at the prospect of a surge of Afghan asylum-seekers trying to enter the bloc, as happened in 2015 with Syrians fleeing their war. Brussels’ calculation is that donating money to help stabilise Afghanistan and assist countries between it and Europe could stem any flow. The direct talks held in Doha on Tuesday were facilitated by Qatar, which has long hosted a Taliban political office. ‘Positive relationships’ “I think engaging with them (the Taliban) is the most important now,” said Mutlaq Al-Qahtani, a special envoy to Qatar’s Foreign Minister, who brushed aside the question of whether to recognise a Taliban government. “A priority as we speak now is the humanitarian (situation), is education, is free passage” of people wishing to leave, he told the Global Security Forum conference in Doha. EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said the meeting with the Taliban would “allow the U.S. and European side to address issues” including respect for women’s rights and preventing Afghanistan becoming a haven for “terrorist” groups. “This is an informal exchange at technical level. It does not constitute recognition of the ‘interim government’,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-meet-eu-us-team-in-qatar/article36976641.ece
13 October 2021||Beijing,||China launches biodiversity fund||China on Tuesday pledged to inject $233 million into a new fund to protect biodiversity in developing countries during a key UN conservation summit, despite disagreements among major donors on the initiative. Beijing — the world’s biggest polluter — has sought to play a more prominent role internationally on biodiversity conservation in recent years. Its pledge came as delegates from about 195 countries gathered in the southern Chinese city of Kunming for the first of a two-part summit on safeguarding plants, animals and ecosystems. The summit aims to establish a new accord setting out targets for 2030 and 2050. “China will take the lead in establishing the Kunming biodiversity fund with a capital contribution of 1.5 billion yuan ($233 million) to support the cause of biodiversity conservation in developing countries,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a speech delivered via video link at the COP15 leaders’ summit. “China calls on... all parties to contribute to the fund.” ‘30 by 30’ agenda A key proposal being debated at the conference is the “30 by 30” agenda that would afford 30% of the Earth’s land and oceans protected status by 2030. Global spending to protect and restore nature needs to triple this decade to about $350 billion annually by 2030 and $536 billion by 2050 to meet this target, a UN report said in May. But some rich country donors say a new fund for conservation is unnecessary because the United Nations’ Global Environment Facility already helps developing nations finance green projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-launches-biodiversity-fund/article36976637.ece
13 October 2021||Paris,||France unveils $35 bn revival plan||French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday unveiled a five-year, €30 billion ($35 billion) investment plan for developing innovative technology and industrial activity, including building small nuclear reactors, electric cars and greener airplanes. The goal of the state-funded France 2030 plan is to boost France’s economic growth over the next decade amid growing global competition with China and the U.S., Mr. Macron said. The money will start being spent next year, he said. “If us, Europeans, and especially us, the French, want to be able to choose our future, it is key that we win... the battle for independence and better living conditions,” Mr. Macron said. The plan includes €8 billion to develop energy technology that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Macron said the funding would finance the building of small, modular nuclear reactors in France, which relies on nuclear power for 70% of its electricity. Carbon-neutral EU leaders have agreed that nuclear energy could be part of the 27-nation bloc’s commitment to making its economy carbon-neutral by 2050, giving member countries the option of using it in their national energy mixes. The issue led to heated debates within the EU, however, with Germany and some other countries arguing that nuclear power should not be included in plans to finance greener energy because it requires mining and long-term storage of radioactive waste. In his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Macron also vowed to make France by 2030 “the leader of green hydrogen” power, a form of energy which does not emit carbon dioxide and can be used in industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing that currently rely on fossil fuels. The plan calls for €4 billion to be used to develop about 2 million electric and hybrid cars by the end of the decade. In addition, France will “massively invest” in building its first “low-carbon plane” by 2030. The plan also provides money to develop by 2026 a reusable launch system to propel spacecrafts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-unveils-35-bn-revival-plan/article36976646.ece
13 October 2021||London,||U.K. govt. botched up initial COVID response: MPs’ probe||U.K. lawmakers said on Tuesday that the government’s response when Covid-19 swept into Europe cost lives and was “one of the most important public health failures” in the country’s history. In a damning assessment, a cross-party group of MPs found that official pandemic planning was too focused on influenza and had failed to learn the lessons from prior outbreaks of SARS, MERS and Ebola. The 151-page study comes ahead of an independent public inquiry into the government’s coronavirus handling due to begin next year. The MPs said Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government had waited too long to act in early 2020. Leading advisors had pushed a “deliberate policy” to take a “gradual and incremental approach” to interventions such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns, said the report. That approach led to a higher death toll. Avoidable deaths There was a “policy approach of fatalism about the prospects for COVID in the community”, contributing to avoidable deaths in care homes after thousands of elderly patients were discharged without testing. But the report also praised the government’s rapid launch of a mass vaccination campaign against COVID in December, arguing that had “redeemed” some of the earlier failings. Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, called the report overall “laughable”. “This is an attempt to ignore and gaslight bereaved families, who will see it as a slap in the face," she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-govt-botched-up-initial-covid-response-mps-probe/article36976643.ece
13 October 2021||Paris,||‘Seas will rise for centuries to come’||Even if humanity beats the odds and caps global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, seas will rise for centuries to come and swamp cities currently home to half-a-billion people, researchers warned Tuesday. In a world that heats up another half-degree above that benchmark, an additional 200 million of today’s urban dwellers would regularly find themselves knee-deep in sea water and more vulnerable to devastating storm surges, they reported in Environmental Research Letters. Worst hit in any scenario will be Asia, which accounts for nine of the 10 mega-cities at highest risk. Land home to more than half the populations of Bangladesh and Vietnam fall below the long-term high tide line, in a world with even a 2 degrees Celsius rise. Built-up areas in China, India and Indonesia would also face devastation. Most projections for sea level rise run to the end of the century. But oceans will continue to swell for hundreds of years beyond 2100 — fed by melting ice sheets, heat trapped in the ocean and the dynamics of warming water — no matter how aggressively greenhouse gas emissions are drawn down.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/seas-will-rise-for-centuries-to-come/article36976644.ece
13 October 2021||Washington DC,||IMF Board decides not to sack its chief Kristalina Georgieva||The International Monetary Fund’s Executive Board has backed its embattled managing director (MD), Kristalina Georgieva, who has faced accusations of meddling with figures in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report in 2018 at China’s behest, when she was CEO of the World Bank. The Board’s decision was announced weeks after an independent inquiry concluded that Ms. Georgieva and then World Bank President Jim Yong Kim had pressured Bank staff so that China could get a better business ranking. “Having looked at all the evidence presented, the Executive Board reaffirms its full confidence in the Managing Director’s leadership and ability to continue to effectively carry out her duties,” said a statement released Monday night by the 24-member board, which has been divided over the issue. Ms. Georgieva at one point “became directly involved in efforts to improve China’s ranking,” a report from WilmerHale, the law firm conducting the probe, had found. Ms Georgieva had denied that she asked for data to be changed. The IMF Board said the report did not “conclusively demonstrate” that the MD had played an “improper role” in the production of the Doing Business Report 2018, and took note that the World Bank was investigating potential staff misconduct with regard to the report. U.S. and Japan Key E.U. countries, including France and Germany, together with China and Russia had backed Ms. Georgieva with the IMF’s two largest shareholders - the U.S. and Japan – toeing a harder line on the issue. The U.S.’s economic relationship with China has largely been adversarial in recent years. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke with Ms. Georgieva on Monday and told her that the inquiry’s findings had “raised legitimate issues and concerns,” though there was no basis for a change in IMF leadership right now, the Treasury Department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/imf-board-decides-not-to-sack-its-chief-kristalina-georgieva/article36976746.ece
13 October 2021||Washington,||Georgieva stays at IMF helm despite scandal||Kristalina Georgieva was secured in her job at the helm of the International Monetary Fund on Monday, after the Washington-based crisis lender’s board reaffirmed its confidence in the scandal-hit Bulgarian economist. Ms. Georgieva’s role at the institution was called into question after the September 16 publication of the findings of an investigation carried out at the request of the ethics committee of the World Bank, where Ms. Georgieva had previously held a senior role. Favouring China The investigation by law firm WilmerHale concluded that Ms. Georgieva had manipulated data in favor of China while at the global body, which she has denied. Drawn out uncertainty over whether Ms. Georgieva would keep her job ended on Monday when the IMF board said it “reaffirms its full confidence in the Managing Director’s leadership and ability to continue to carry out her duties.” WilmerHale's controversial findings center on the drafting of the 2018 and 2020 editions of the World Bank report that ranks countries according to their ease of doing business. The push came while bank leadership was engaged in sensitive negotiations with Beijing over increasing the bank’s lending capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/georgieva-stays-at-imf-helm-despite-scandal/article36976639.ece

In an apparent continued effort to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul, Mr. Kim also used his speech at a rare exhibition of weapons systems on Monday to stress that his military might isn’t targeted at South Korea. “The U.S. is continuing to create tensions with its wrong judgments and actions,” he said. Calling the U.S. a “source” of instability on the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Kim said his country’s objective is possessing an “invincible military capability” that no one can dare challenge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kim-ups-the-military-ante-against-us/article36976648.ece

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||The sanctions cloud over India-U.S. ties||The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhari, recently said that the delivery of the S-400 Triumf air defence systems from Russia is expected according to schedule. In response, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman hoped that both the U.S. and India could resolve the issue. The “issue” here is that receiving the missile systems could attract for India sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), enacted by the U.S. Congress. Ms. Sherman emphasised that the U.S. thinks it’s “dangerous” for “any country that decides to use the S-400”. India is scheduled to receive five squadrons of the surface-to-air missile systems under the $5.43 billion (Rs. 40,000 crore) agreement it signed three years ago. Enactment of CAATSA Even though CAATSA was signed into law by then President Donald Trump in 2017, India stuck to its guns, signed the agreement with Russia a year later, and paid an advance in 2019. The missile systems were originally scheduled to be delivered between 2020 and 2023 and the supplies are expected to commence now. Both New Delhi and Washington have been in conversations over the deal. India has stressed on the tactical importance of the defence missile systems considering the environment in the Indian subcontinent. The CAATSA was passed when the U.S. sought to discourage trade in the defence and intelligence sectors of Russia, a country perceived to have interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Act mandates the President to impose at least five of the 12 sanctions on persons engaged in a “significant transaction” with Russian defence and intelligence sectors. These sanctions include suspending export licence, banning American equity/debt investments in entities, prohibiting loans from U.S. financial institutions and opposing loans from international finance institutions. The Act also built in a safety valve in the form of a presidential waiver. This was written into the law after much persuasion and is interpreted as one crafted to accommodate countries like India. Policy planners on either side are aware of the law and the provisions to work around it. Ms. Sherman and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who came to India earlier this year, cannot be expected to announce whether India can secure a waiver from President Joe Biden when the time comes for the White House to make a decision. The “modified waiver authority” allows the President to waive sanctions in certain circumstances. He has to decide whether the move is in American interest; does not endanger the country’s national security; and affect its military operations in an adverse manner. In addition, he has to determine whether the country in question is taking steps to bring down its inventory of defence equipment from Russia and cooperating with Washington on matters of critical security. There are a few more provisions including one that allows for sanctions waivers for 180 days, provided the administration certifies that the country in question is scaling back its ties with Russia. The debate in the U.S. hovers around the efficacy of such sanctions against India when the geopolitical situation in the region is undergoing a change. Today, there is a growing relationship between China and Russia with both countries seeking to expand engagement in Afghanistan from where the U.S. withdrew its military after two decades of war. India turned sullen over the manner in which the U.S. negotiated the exit deal with the Taliban. Yet, on the strategic plane, India remained on course by agreeing to the upgrading of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and sharing the same vision as the U.S. on the Indo-Pacific construct. Sanctions have the tremendous potential of pulling down the upward trajectory of the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and India, which now spans 50 sectors, especially in the field of defence. The U.S.’s apprehension is that bringing India under a sanctions regime could push New Delhi towards its traditional military hardware supplier, Russia. Till about a decade ago, an influential segment of the Indian political leadership and top bureaucracy remained wary of deeper engagement with the U.S. Sanctions can stir up the latent belief that Washington cannot be relied upon as a partner. Decrease in imports Over the last decade, India’s military purchase from Russia has steadily declined. India’s import of arms decreased by 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20 and Russia was the most affected supplier, according to a report by the Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI. In recent years, though, there have been some big-ticket deals worth $15 billion including S400, Ka-226-T utility helicopters, BrahMos missiles and production of AK-203 assault rifles. On the other hand, over the past decade, government-to-government deals with the U.S. touched $20 billion and deals worth nearly $10 billion are under negotiation. The U.S. designated India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016. It later gave India Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 which allows access to critical technologies. Today, manufacturers in both countries are exploring ways to co-develop and co-produce military equipment. What next? There are advocates in the U.S. who strongly favour imposing sanctions on India following the U.S.’s decision to impose restrictions on its NATO ally, Turkey. China was the first country to attract the provision after it procured the S-400. Should India be treated with a different yardstick? A section of influential lawmakers in the Democratic Party hold a different view. There are three clear steps in this regard. The first is the presidential determination on waiver; the second is the referral to the Congressional Committees; and the third is clearance by these panels. While referral to the Armed Services is spelled out, it is a distinct possibility that this will be sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committees. This powerful committee, headed by Senator Bob Menendez, wrote to Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin ahead of his visit to New Delhi in March this year that he must inform India of the perils of the deal, while a Republican, Todd Young, on the panel argued against it. The CAATSA test will determine the course of the India-U.S. strategic partnership. Will the Biden administration sail through opposition within his party in allowing India a clear passage? While the administration will have to do the heavy lifting, the role of Indian-Americans should be significant just as they rallied around to support the historic Civil Nuclear Deal in the face of stiff resistance from Democrats opposed to nuclear proliferation.

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Taking the lid off illicit financial flows||The Pandora Papers, published on October 3, once again expose the illegal activities of the rich and the mighty across the world. The Pandora Papers investigation is “the world’s largest-ever journalistic collaboration, involving more than 600 journalists from 150 media outlets in 117 countries”. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has researched and analysed the approximately 12 million documents in order to unravel the functioning of the global financial architecture which helps illicit financial flows, in turn enabling the rich to throw a cloak over their incomes and activities. Given the complexity of the tax laws and the loopholes available, some of the deft moves may be strictly legal, but not necessarily morally justified. The ICIJ says that while some of the files date to the 1970s, most of those it reviewed were created between 1996 and 2020. The ICIJ has also said that the “data trove covers more than 330 politicians and 130 Forbes billionaires, as well as celebrities... drug dealers, royal family members and leaders of religious groups around the world”. History of leaked data Since at least 2008, files indicating the manipulations by the rich have been stolen from financial institutions. In 2017, the Paradise Papers were leaked out mostly from the more than 100-year-old offshore law firm, Appleby, which operates globally. In 2016, the Panama Papers were obtained by hacking the server of the Panamanian financial firm, Mossack Fonseca. In these exposés, the British Virgin Island (BVI) figured prominently. The leaked documents from Luxembourg, the “Luxembourg Leaks”, appeared in 2014. In 2008, a former employee of the LGT Bank of Liechtenstein offered information to tax authorities. There were Indian names also but the Indian government accepted the data only under pressure from the Supreme Court. The same year, Hervé Falciani obtained confidential data on HSBC bank accounts from remote servers and gave the data to then French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde (she later became chief of the International Monetary Fund to then move on as President of the European Central Bank) who passed it on to the various governments, including India. In the United States, in the mid-2000s, UBS Bank and Bradley Birkenfeld, who was acting as a private banker on its behalf, were prosecuted for enabling U.S. citizens to spirit away their income and wealth. A large extent of the illicit financial flows have a link to New York City and London, the biggest financial centres in the world that allow financial institutions such as big banks to operate with ease. The leaked data show that these entities move the funds of the rich and the powerful via tax havens; Delaware in the U.S. is a tax haven. The big financial entities operating from these cities have been prosecuted for committing illegalities. In 2012, an investigation into the London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR — crucial in calculating interest rates — led to the fining of leading banks such as Barclays, UBS, Rabobank and the Royal Bank of Scotland for manipulation. These banks also operate a large number of subsidiaries in tax havens to help illicit financial flows. Themodus operandi The leaked papers now and even earlier have exposed the international financial architecture and illicit financial flows. For instance, Panama Papers highlighted the template used in other tax havens. The Pandora Papers once again confirm this pattern. Tax havens enable the rich to hide the true ownership of assets by using: trusts, shell companies and the process of ‘layering’. Financial firms offer their services to work this out for the rich. They provide ready-made shell companies with directors, create trusts and ‘layer’ the movement of funds. Only the moneyed can afford these services. The process of layering involves moving funds from one shell-company in one tax haven to another in another tax haven and liquidating the previous company. This way, money is moved through several tax havens to the ultimate destination. Since the trail is erased at each step, it becomes difficult for authorities to track the flow of funds. It appears that most of the rich in the world use such manipulations to lower their tax liability even if their income is legally earned. The Panama Papers revealed the names globally of current and former leaders, politicians and public officials, billionaires, celebrities, sports stars, small and big businesses and professionals. Is it that the rich move their funds to tax havens because of high tax rates? Not really. Even citizens of countries with low tax rates use tax havens. Over the three decades, tax havens have enabled capital to become highly mobile, forcing nations to lower tax rates to attract capital. This has led to the ‘race to the bottom’, resulting in a shortage of resources with governments to provide public goods, etc., in turn adversely impacting the poor. The specificity of the Papers The Pandora Papers, unlike the previous cases mentioned above, are not from any one tax haven; they are leaked records from 14 offshore services firms. The data pertains to an estimated 29,000 beneficiaries. The 2.94 terabytes of data have exposed the financial secrets of over 330 politicians and public officials, from more than 90 countries and territories. These include 35 current and former country leaders. Singer Shakira and former Indian cricket captain Sachin Tendulkar are among the celebrities and sport stars named in the investigation. Others include the King of Jordan, the Presidents of Ukraine, Kenya and Ecuador, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Surprisingly there are few names from the United States, even though it has the largest number of billionaires. The very powerful who need to be onboard to curb illicit financial flows (as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD is trying) are the beneficiaries of the system and would not want a foolproof system to be put in place to check it. With the current global financial architecture, black income generation cannot be checked. Revelations suggest that funds are moved out of national jurisdiction to spirit them away from the reach of creditors and not just governments. Many fraudsters are in jail but have not paid their creditors even though they have funds abroad. Strictly speaking, not all the activity being exposed by the Pandora Papers may be illegal due to tax evasion or the hiding of proceeds of crime. The authorities will have to prove if the law of the land has been violated. Each country will have to conduct its investigations and prove what part of the activity broke any of their laws. In the United Kingdom, the laws regarding financial dealings are very favourable to the rich and their manipulations. It is no wonder, in the recent past, that several Indian fraudsters have thus fled to London to escape the Indian law. A large number of rich Indians have bought property in the U.K. Thousands of foreigners buy or rent property in the U.K. because no questions are asked about the sources of funds; this has enriched the U.K. by $100 billion. India’s investigations Many Indians have become non-resident Indians or have made some relative into an NRI who can operate shell companies and trusts outside the purview of Indian tax authorities. That is why prosecution has been difficult in the earlier cases of data leakage from tax havens. The Supreme Court of India-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up in 2014 has not been able to make a dent. The Government’s focus on the unorganised sector as the source of black income generation is also misplaced since data indicate that it is the organised sector that has been the real culprit and also spirits out a part of its black incomes. An interesting recent development (October 8) has been the agreement among almost 140 countries to levy a 15% minimum tax rate on corporates. Though it is a long shot, this may dent the international financial architecture. Other steps needed to tackle the curse of illicit financial flows are ending banking secrecy and a Tobin tax on transactions; neither of which the OECD countries are likely to agree to.

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Do not breathe easy on the silicosis prevention policy||Long before COVID-19 hit, countless workers engaged in mines, construction and factories in India were silently dying of exposure to dust, utmost exploitation and apathy. They continue to do so. Rajasthan’s pioneering model One State — Rajasthan — with the top-most share of over 17% in value of mineral production in the country and a long history of civil society activism, was the first to notify silicosis as an ‘epidemic’ in 2015, under the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act, 1957. In 2019, it announced a formal Pneumoconiosis Policy, only next to Haryana. Silicosis is part of the pneumoconiosis family of diseases, described by the policy as “occupational diseases due to dust exposure... are incurable, cause permanent disability and are ‘totally preventable by available control measures and technology’ (emphasis added)”. A ‘silicosis portal’ was hosted by the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment and a system of worker self-registration, diagnosis through district-level pneumoconiosis boards and compensation from the District Mineral Foundation Trust (DMFT) funds to which mine owners contribute, was put in place. In just two years, the State has officially certified and compensated over 25,000 patients of silicosis, of which 5,500 have already died of the disease. Gaps in the system But even this ‘pioneering model’ stops short of where it matters the most. In the mining sector alone, none of the silicosis cases diagnosed has been notified by mine owners or reported by the examining doctors to the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS), Ministry of Labour and Employment. But this is what they are legally required to do, according to Section 25 of the erstwhile Mines Act, 1952 and Section 12 of the now-effective Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code, 2020. Why is notifying cases to the DGMS important? Only that would shift the paradigm from compensation to prevention, and fix the responsibility on mine owners, who now continue to slip away despite violating safety and preventive protocols. The DGMS, the sole enforcement authority for health and safety in mines, can take action against mine owners only if it knows who they are, and in turn, whom they employ. But only 10%-20% of the over 33,100 mining leases and quarry licences in Rajasthan are DGMS-registered. So the present system is designed to ‘consume’ the worker and dispense with him with a small compensation while the mine owner sits back and continues to hire the next able worker — an inhuman cycle, which the Government is complicit in. Labour Code dilutions Persistent attempts to establish the employer-worker relationship on record have drawn a blank, given that the mine-owning community is a major revenue contributor to the State. That said, the immediate impetus for silicosis prevention could come from two related places in the OSHWC Code. Section 6 of the Code makes it mandatory for all employers to provide annual health checks free of cost “to such employees of such age or such class of employees of establishments or such class of establishments, as may be prescribed by the appropriate Government”. Section 20 gives powers to the DGMS to conduct health and occupational surveys in mines. Positive as they sound, these sections are severely diluted from the earlier Mines Act provisions, which in turn, were simply never implemented. The draft Central rule 6 corresponding to Section 6 of the Code fixes an age floor of 45 years for workers in all establishments (including mines) to be eligible for these health checks, though Rules 92 to 102 provide for initial and periodic examinations of all mine workers from their time of joining — which is an anomaly. Two, Section 20 places no obligation on the mine owner to provide any form of rehabilitation in terms of alternative employment in the mine, or payment of a disability allowance/lump sum compensation for a worker found medically unfit. These paragraphs in the earlier Mines Act linked to the Workmen’s Compensation Act (also subsumed), have been deleted. A ‘medically unfit’ worker is thus expected to leave the job and fend for themselves or subsist on the compensation of Rs. 3 lakh provided in Rajasthan from the DMFT — and not even that, perhaps, in other States. Steps for prevention State governments need to be alive to these dreadful regressions and use their powers to contain the damage. Rajasthan could lead the way by establishing a robust system of preventive annual health checks as a real and regular feature of the silicosis prevention plan. One, the related State departments, in close dialogue with the DGMS, must urgently draw up detailed guidelines for district-wise health surveys. The State rules under the OSHWC Code must take care to ensure the health checks are provided to all workers in all establishments, irrespective of age. The State Advisory Board (Section 17 of the Code), along with technical committees, must be quickly constituted, with workers and their representatives having a say in them. Two, local manufacturers must be incentivised to innovate and develop low-cost dust-suppressant and wet-drilling mechanisms that could either be subsidised or provided free of cost to the mine owners. Existing prototypes must be tested and scaled up. Three, the DMFT funds are both underutilised and spent in an entirely ad hoc manner. A Centre for Science and Environment report shows Rajasthan had Rs. 3,514 crore under DMFTs in 2020 of which only approximately Rs. 750 crore was spent. Their haphazard allocation for non-mineworker-related expenditure must be replaced by a streamlined and accountable system for the direct benefit of mineworkers under clearly defined budget heads such as prevention (including innovation fund and subsidy for wet drilling equipment), disability compensation, solatium, administrative expenses and others. But even this planning will be incomplete without bringing worker-employer identification on record. A systematic identification ultimately lies in the hands of the authorities and their will to enforce the law in this regard and a rising among the workers for their rights. No more time must be lost in bringing prevention to the heart of the pneumoconiosis policy.

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Free power at a big price||With elections around the corner in many States, political parties are competing with one another in promising free power, with the Aam Aadmi Party in the lead. Promises are for free power up to 300 units/month for households, free electricity for farmers and waivers of pending bills. Who stands to gain and lose from such promises?  Problems with free power Let us first look at subsidised electricity supply to agriculture. Supported by state subsidy, electricity tariff to agriculture is low in most States – often less than Rs. 1/unit – and is free in some States such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. While this helps in ensuring food security and promoting rural livelihood, free power has many adverse impacts. There is inefficient use of electricity and water, neglect of service quality by the distribution companies leading to frequent outages and motor burn outs, and high subsidy burden on the State governments. Since nearly three-fourth of the agriculture connections in the country are unmetered, consumption estimates are often inflated by distribution companies to increase subsidy demand and project low distribution losses. Any metering effort faces resistance as it is perceived as the first step towards levying charges. The experience over the past 15 years highlights that revoking the decision to provide free power requires significant political will. Opting-out schemes are being made but do not seem to have uptake. Free power provision along with issues of metering make implementation of Direct Benefit Transfer difficult. All this leaves farmers, distribution companies and State governments frustrated. Providing subsidised low tariff for small consumers is necessary, considering the rising costs of electricity supply. The current cost is around Rs. 7-8/unit, which is not affordable for many small households. The situation is worse due to the economic slowdown and the pandemic. Basic requirements of a small household, such as lighting, fans, mobile charging and TV, require only about 50 units/month, which increases to about 100 units/month with a refrigerator. A low tariff — say, at half the cost of supply — can be justified for such consumers. The monthly consumption will be 200-300 units only if the household has high-end appliances like air-conditioners. But free power is already being provided for consumption up to 200 units/month in Delhi and Punjab. Due to free power in Delhi, the total state subsidy amounts to 11% of the total expenses. In Tamil Nadu, where free power is available to households, half of the total subsidy is earmarked for this. If there is further increase in number and consumption limits of free power, the subsidy burden on State governments will substantially increase. There are already issues with metering and billing of households. This will also increase, especially since distribution companies are likely to pay limited attention to low-revenue consumers. Roof-top solar and energy efficiency are good environment-friendly options for homes but providing free power to well-off households will discourage them from taking these up. The familiar, tragic story of free or low-tariff agriculture supply is going to play out in this segment too, with poor consumers becoming the ultimate losers. Limiting free power beneficiaries Good power supply and service are necessary to improve quality of life and encourage productive activities. This in turn requires financially stable distribution companies and accountability measures for quality service for all, especially small and rural consumers. Free or low-tariff power is at best a short-term relief, which should be provided to those who desperately need it. A government which has the long-term interest of the people in mind should work to limit free power beneficiaries. There are some ideas which would help in this journey. A fixed rebate of up to Rs. 200/month for residential consumers can be provided in the electricity bill. The impact on small consumers will be significant, compared to big. As the rebate is delinked from consumption, distribution companies won’t have an incentive to inflate consumption. A similar rebate can be extended to home-based enterprises, which in most States pay high tariff. There can be additional rebates for adopting energy-efficient appliances like refrigerators, combined with State-level bulk procurement programmes to reduce the cost. The atmosphere of mutual mistrust between small consumers and distribution companies has to change. There should be quick resolution of arrears and one-time offers for settlements. If a bill amounts to more than three times that of previous bills, the distribution company should resolve it, without waiting for complaints. We hope that people question the wisdom of broad-brush promises such as free power, which cannot be sustained in the long run.

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Boost tourism through disruption||The Indian tourism and hospitality sector were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and saw substantial job loss. How do we pull this sector out of the COVID-19 trap? The Government of India recently announced financial support for more than 11,000 registered tourist guides/travel and tourism stakeholders. It also said once international travel resumes, the first five lakh tourists will be issued visas free of charge. In the pre-pandemic period too, many initiatives were adopted to promote the tourism sector, such as providing e-visas under various categories for people from particular countries, Global Media Campaigns, the Heritage Trail and the Paryatan Parv celebration. These measures are welcome. However, we need other long-term measures too, to tap the potential of this sector. What we need is disruptive innovation strategy which has the potential to create employment opportunities and increase revenue through private sector growth. The Startup India initiative has boosted entrepreneurship. However, the travel and tourism startups need a bigger push. Innovative startups should be encouraged. Support from the government for ideation and access to finance are required. A sector with potential As per the estimates of the erstwhile Planning Commission, an investment of Rs. 1 million generates 78 jobs in the tourism sector. In the manufacturing sector, it results in just 18 jobs and in the agriculture sector, 45. The tourism sector, unlike many other sectors, can grow with smaller capital investments and that too without any industrial gestation period. There is need to train the workforce in India, so that workers can develop the skills to perform jobs in the travel and tourism sector. The growth in this sector has multiplier effects on income generation as it is employment-intensive with less capital investment. The India Skill Report, 2019, estimates the Indian workforce to increase to about 600 million by 2022 from the current 473 million in view of the fourth industrial revolution. The tourism sector will have a major role to play in providing employment opportunities. India improved its competitiveness in travel and tourism, from occupying the 65th position in 2013 and then the 40th position in 2017 and then the 34th position in 2019, as per the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report of 2019. But international arrivals have remained comparatively low, at around 9 to 10 million. Thus, there is a need to highlight the significance of public-private partnership to improve infrastructure and tackle the problem of end connectivity, which negatively affect the experiences of international travellers. The travel and tourism industry in India is also fragmented, hindering the ability of the sector to achieve its potential. This area needs to be nudged to embrace the digital revolution, so as to promote public-private initiatives, medium and small and sized enterprises’ growth while ensuring that India follows best practices from across the world. Use of blockchain technology Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. There are examples worldwide on blockchain-based money solutions to kick-start local tourism industries, for instance. Blockchain enables the tracking of items through complex supply chains. Indian start-ups could also explore strategies along these lines. Blockchain ledger coupled with IOT devices for healthcare could have a positive impact on medical tourism. There are challenges too with the advent of disruptive technologies. The government and regulators need to collaborate and design innovative mechanisms to address the challenges of these technologies, for smooth growth of the sector.

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Jabbing children||As a milestone, the Subject Expert Committee’s (SEC) recommendation to the Drugs Controller to grant emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Covaxin among children aged 2-18 years, is huge. If the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) goes ahead and grants approval, it will be the first vaccine to be administered to children in India. While one other vaccine, ZyCoV-D, has been granted EUA, it is still to be administered. Trials have started with the Serum Institute’s Covovax for children, extending the timeline of any other COVID-19 vaccine for actual use in children. On the front of it, it seems like a tremendous achievement within a short period. While the data seem to have convinced the SEC that there is cause to make its considered recommendation, none of that is yet in the public domain, at the time of SEC’s announcement. Bharat Biotech presented interim data from the phase II/III trials to the DCGI, as the safety follow-up is longer in this case. One month after the two doses, an immunogenicity check and safety follow up are done, according to reports. The company claimed the data indicated that the vaccine used — the same product and presentation as the adult vaccine — was safe. The two-dose Covaxin was administered to 525 children 28 days apart, after it received the nod to conduct trials on children in May this year. A possibly unintended but welcome outcome of the pandemic is the stress on being transparent about scientific data generated in trials. Data from other vaccine trials have routinely been posted in the public realm, not just with state regulators. Working on vaccine or drug regimens with children is challenging on many fronts; to start with, it is not merely a case of sizing down adult dosage for children. Children have distinct developmental and physiological differences, and WHO recommends that clinical trials in children are essential to develop age-specific, empirically verified therapies and interventions to determine the best possible treatments for them. Their bodies work in very different ways and they undergo many changes as they grow from infancy towards adolescence and adulthood, calling for age de-escalation studies in trials, beginning with an older age group, and working towards the youngest group. Another question experts are raising is whether the cohort of 525 children is large enough to wing an EUA, or if incremental numbers should be added, given the size of the target paediatric/teen population. Many of these questions are easily addressed with publication of the data. While a recommendation is only that, it has indeed raised extraordinary expectations in the community.

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Yahya promises new govt.||President Yahya Khan of Pakistan to-day [New Delhi, Oct. 12] promised his people a new Central Government by the beginning of the new year, but gave no indication about its likely composition and character. In a 40-minute broadcast over Radio Pakistan, he said the constitution he planned to promulgate would be published by December 20 and the reconstituted National Assembly would be called into session on December 27. He said, “to accelerate the process of transfer of power the Central Government will be formed soon after the inaugural session of the National Assembly.” Gen. Yahya Khan sought to preempt criticism of his proposals by calling upon political leaders to take note of the alleged threat to Pakistan’s integrity from India and declaring that “on no account should the people’s attention be diverted from the basic issues of defence of the country and restoration of democracy.” He prefaced his constitutional proposals with a tirade against India, which, he alleged, had moved forward army formations and air force units to positions close to Pakistan’s borders. He claimed that there existed a “serious possibility of aggression by India against Pakistan.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/yahya-promises-new-govt/article36976494.ece
13 October 2021||Washington DC,||IMF pegs India growth at 9.5%, urges lower debt-to-GDP ratio||The IMF has projected that India will grow at 9.5% and 8.5% this fiscal year and next, after a contraction of 7.3% last year. It has projected global growth at 5.9% this year and 4.9% in 2022 in its latest World Economic Outlook, unveiled at the start of the World Bank IMF Annual Meetings. While the India numbers remain unchanged from the IMF’s July forecast — which had already incorporated a downgrade of 3 percentage points from the April forecast — there has been a nominal downward revision for world output growth in 2021 (from 6%). “India is doing well in terms of vaccination rates and that’s certainly helpful,” IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said, adding that the July forecast had already incorporated the impacts of the devastating second wave. The Indian economy continued to face challenges, such as those from the financial market and from the virus not having disappeared yet, Ms. Gopinath said. Last week, in a report on South Asia, the World Bank had projected 8.3% growth for India this fiscal . In response to a question on whether the fiscal deficit in India was a concern, the lead author of the report, Mahlar Nabar, said there was potentially more room for support at the moment. “We think that there’s still room to provide more support if needed, if the pandemic takes a turn for the worse and to provide it in a targeted manner to the worst-affected households and firms,” he said. However, there would need to be “a credible medium-term strategy” to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to make room for future development and infrastructure needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/imf-pegs-india-growth-at-95-urges-lower-debt-to-gdp-ratio/article36976467.ece
13 October 2021||Mumbai,||Tata Motors to raise $1 billion for new electric vehicle unit||Tata Motors Ltd. (TML) said it had entered into a binding agreement whereby TPG Rise Climate along with its co-investor ADQ, will invest Rs. 7,500 crore [$1 billion] in a new subsidiary to focus exclusively on electric vehicles (EVs). TPG Rise Climate and ADQ will be allotted compulsorily convertible instruments to secure between 11% and 15% stake in the firm, currently named Tata Motors EVco. This values the firm up to $9.1 billion, Tata Motors Group CFO P.B. Balaji told the media. He added that TML would invest Rs. 15,000 crore in the next 5 years in the EVco and the timing of the next round of funding would be decided later. The EV unit will be TML’s second subsidiary, after Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles company (PVco) that was hived off as a 100% subsidiary. ‘PV firm to manufacture’ TML said the new firm would leverage existing investments and capabilities of TML and would channelise future investments into EVs, dedicated battery EV platforms, advanced automotive technologies, and ‘catalyse investments in charging infrastructure and battery technologies’. Over five years, the electric vehicle company would create a portfolio of 10 EVs and, along with Tata Power, catalyse charging infrastructure to spur EV adoption, TML said in a filing. Interestingly, all manufacturing for the new firm will be done by the PVco, which will also take care of distribution.  It is expected that the first round of capital infusion would be completed by March 2022 and the entire funds would be infused by the third quarter of FY23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tata-motors-to-raise-1-billion-for-new-electric-vehicle-unit/article36976476.ece

So far in 2021, about 850 start-ups have attracted a whopping $26 billion in funding. Almost 80% of these firms have been in the space of e-commerce, marketplaces, consumer services, fintech, EdTech and logistics. Post funding, these new enterprises are actively scaling up their leaderships, according to data from Xpheno, a specialist staffing firm. “Any VC firm that invests upwards of $30 million would insist on a leadership expansion,” said B.S.

Sindhu feels confident as she resumes the journey to realise another dream — be World No. 1 — when she competes in the Denmark Open from October 19. She has been training for her first major event since the Olympics under Korean Park Tae-Sang, who was with her at Tokyo. Biggest challenge World No. 7 Sindhu told The Hindu, after another gruelling session at Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday, “Once you start playing consistently and keep winning, you have every chance of reaching the top,” she said. “The biggest challenge when I am back on the circuit (having skipped the Sudirman Cup and the ongoing Uber Cup) will be staying focused and putting into action the new tactics I have picked up. “Park and my father have been constantly reviewing my game, watching videos of recent matches and providing inputs,” Sindhu said. “The competition is really tough and I am aware that my games have been studied. I have to change tactics accordingly, to suit the opponent’s game, style and tactics. We also have a Plan B if things go wrong,” Sindhu said. On the hectic schedule ahead, Sindhu said: “We have to be mentally and physically stronger to be consistent. As always, every single day matters.” Target Paris Coach Park sees this is as the beginning of preparations for the 2024 Paris Olympics. “Sindhu being so good in attack, the emphasis now is on drops and half-smashes. We are already seeing a huge change in her game as she is very strong in defence too,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-resumes-journey-to-the-crest/article36976784.ece
13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Can stuttering Delhi Capitals halt Kolkata Knight Riders’ march?||Kolkata Knight Riders takes the field against Delhi Capitals in the IPL Qualifier 2 at Sharjah on Wednesday buoyed by winning momentum. Confidence in the KKR camp will be sky high, after the side pulled off an impressive four-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Eliminator on Monday. True match-winner In West Indian Sunil Narine, who shone with bat and ball against RCB, KKR possesses a true match-winner. KKR captain Eoin Morgan, who stated that Narine is “consistently exceptional every time he takes the field”, will be doubly pleased to have Varun Chakravarthy as the second spinner. The duo is a handful in the middle overs, choking the opposition batsmen with tight lines. The batting is in safe hands as well, with the likes of Venkatesh Iyer, Nitish Rana and Shubman Gill in good form. The unit has peaked at the right time, after a stuttering start to its campaign. The team is yet to take a call on the availability of all-rounder Andre Russell, who suffered an injury earlier in the tournament. “Andre has a Grade 2 hamstring tear. He has worked incredibly hard along with our medical team with intensive rehabilitation to try and get himself back on the park. We’ll take a decision on whether he is fit to play,” Morgan stated on Monday. While KKR is on a three-match winning streak, DC has lost its last two outings. The Qualifier 1 outing on Sunday, against Chennai Super Kings, did not end well for DC. No clear roles England pacer Tom Curran, given the ball for the final over, succumbed to a marauding M.S. Dhoni. That DC captain Rishabh Pant trusted Curran over experienced speedster Kagiso Rabada shows that the side has yet to define clear roles for players. A few days earlier, DC suffered a last-ball defeat to RCB in the league stage. The team management could consider replacing Curran with Marcus Stoinis in the playing eleven. DC, which topped the league stage, will pull out all the stops to stay in the hunt for a maiden IPL title.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/confident-knight-riders-battle-capitals-for-a-place-in-the-final/article36976742.ece
13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Kohli needs to take some of the blame, but not all of it||So Virat Kohli finishes as the RCB captain without leading his team to the title. He has already called time on leading the country in the T20 after the World Cup in November, and he might be tempted to bow out as captain in the white ball game altogether. He doesn’t need to decide now; anything that reduces his workload can only be good for Indian cricket as it will free up the best batsman in the world. Kohli, one of the most successful of international captains, with a win percentage of nearly 64 in all formats combined, will thus find an asterisk against his captaincy record in domestic cricket. He was a terrific captain for RCB when things were going well, but less so at other times. As India’s Test wins in Australia in particular, and later England (under Kohli’s captaincy) showed, a team is more than a collection of individuals. Falling short RCB have often been a collection of outstanding individuals but fell short year after year. Kohli must take some of the blame. You can argue that the KKR defeat on Monday was hastened by three sixes in succession by Sunil Narine, and that sort of thing can happen any time. True. But under pressure, RCB didn’t have anybody hitting sixes, and bad luck in different forms cannot be a perennial excuse (not that the RCB are saying this). The IPL is about winning, and not just taking part. Corporates tend to be impatient, looking for a quick ego-massaging win. This was exemplified by the RCB sacking their first CEO midway through the inaugural season. No corporate honcho who has paid millions to acquire a franchise and everything that goes with it, the glamour and power, is likely to have an excess of patience. That Kohli jumped before he was pushed is a tribute to his standing in the game and his marketability, two qualities more important to his owners than either a pleasing cover drive or an innovative pull. The latter qualities will be retained by RCB — Kohli told us that in 2016 when he led the team into the final, and then again after the defeat that knocked them out of the tournament this year. Such loyalty is rare in professional sport. Lacking balance In the early years, RCB lacked balance both during the auctions and in the ground, with ego rather than cricket thinking dominating. They got it wrong in the inaugural year, picking established Test players (Jacques Kallis, Rahul Dravid, Wasim Jaffar) who played T20 as a shorter version of Test cricket. It was a time when all teams were feeling their way in the new format, convinced it was a batsman’s game, and unsure just what the tactics ought to be. But by the time Kohli took over in 2013 as a 24-year-old India captain-in-waiting, things had settled down to a large extent. Bowling had come into its own and bowlers had worked out how to deal with marauding batsmen. I think it was Dravid who pointed out an important aspect of T20 cricket: that, while a bowler has a guaranteed 24 deliveries, a batsman might have 60 one day and just one on another. And although RCB invested in bowlers like Dale Steyn, Zaheer Khan and Mitchell Starc, the chopping and changing meant that there was neither a balanced attack nor a settled team. Interestingly, the players RCB let go, like Dravid, Gayle or K.L. Rahul did well for the teams that grabbed them. This suggests a management failure. Can’t buy success There is some relief for the purist in knowing that all the money you spend cannot guarantee success. Balance, trust, understanding, communication all matter. Rajasthan Royals who won the inaugural tournament spent less than the others but chose wisely, with Shane Warne as captain. When Kohli took over, and in his early years in charge, he had the three best batsmen in the competition, Chris Gayle, A.B. de Villiers and himself. RCB got themselves into a position where if two of these three struck, then the remaining batsmen were not necessary. But crucially, if none of them did, then they often lacked the batsmen who were necessary. Not surprisingly, they have recorded both the highest (263 for 5) and the lowest (49) totals in the tournament. RCB’s is a cautionary tale for teams in the competition. Of the original eight, Delhi and Punjab are the only other teams not to win the title. Next year, there will be two new teams and in December-January another auction and later another chance on the field of play. Each of these requires a special set of skills. Some teams have it down to a fine art. RCB are still looking for the magic formula.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-needs-to-take-some-of-the-blame-but-not-all-of-it/article36976482.ece
13 October 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Impacting youngsters more rewarding than winning’||He is the most decorated driver with 100 Grand Prix wins. He has seven World titles and is already the greatest Formula One driver statistically. Even as he fights for an unprecedented eighth title, the Mercedes driver is eyeing something bigger — to make the sport more diverse and inclusive. In a media interaction on Tuesday, the reigning World champion spoke about his activism, his legacy and this year’s close title battle with Max Verstappen.  How important is the work you are doing on inclusivity and diversity for your legacy? Legacy is something that I have struggled to contemplate because you don't grow up thinking about legacy. You grew up with dreams and aspirations of achieving something great. But what I realised in these past couple of years is that we have this societal problem and it’s all over the world. I realise that I have an opportunity and platform to be able to spark change. I have already achieved so much. But when I look back after five or 10 years, I want to be watching TV and seeing a diverse pit crew, a diverse paddock. I want to see F1 looking more like its audience. After years of domination, how does it feel to be locked in such a close battle with Max Verstappen? It's exciting and intense. Of course, different championships weigh differently on you because there's a different journey every time. And I think these last two years are very heavy in terms of the whole societal push for diversity and inclusion. It is as time-consuming as trying to win a world championship and even more important. It's been a super exciting championship. It started off strong and then we had this real bad patch of difficult races. Obviously, a lot of points were left on the table from both sides. It is crazy we have six races left and we are still close. It is an emotional roller coaster because one minute, you are in the lead of the championship and feel great. And then the next meeting I am behind. I'm conscious because I have lost a championship before by one point. I am literally driving on the edge of my seat and driving with my life. Do these close battles motivate you? Absolutely. When I was younger, that's what I loved most and I think that's what fans love. To see two teams so close in performance makes me happy because it means that I can make even more of a difference. Even if it's only that 1% in the split-second decisions you make. I'm fighting against youngsters who are passionate and hungry. I'm having to dig deeper and I love being reminded of that every day, every weekend. How do you manage to raise the bar every year after all the success you have had? Yeah, that's not easy. The way that I have managed to do this is through constantly challenging our processes and just communicating with my engineers how we can stay tight as a unit, continue to inspire each other, better use our time, understand and prepare better for every single race. In my personal life, it's like, how do I manage my energy. I am finding things that make me happy. So working on this project, working on Mission 44, brings me joy. I love the fact that what I'm working on can potentially have a real tangible impact on young kids for the future. And I'm already seeing my team go from 3% diversity last year to 6%. Winning championships is a good thing, but, impacting youngsters, is way more rewarding than any championship. How has Petronas, your team’s title and technical partner, helped maintain a competitive advantage over the years? Through sheer hard work and determination and focus. We have the best testing lab and testing bench for developing products. We have a little lab that's at every single race of the year, even on race weekends, where samples are constantly being taken from the cars. We work in different climates, mostly in high pressure, high temperature environments. It's the perfect place for us to be.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/impacting-youngsters-more-rewarding-than-winning/article36976739.ece

13 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rupal dazzles while winning the girls’ under-18 title||Rupal ran a sensational race to clock the season’s 10th fastest time for girls under-18 in the world to win the title in the National Open 400m championship at the Nehru Sports Complex here on Tuesday. The Uttar Pradesh girl clocked 53.73 seconds to finish almost five seconds faster than her nearest challengers Tamil Nadu’s P. R. Neeharika and Karnataka’s Nayana Kokare. In the process, Rupal’s personal best proved to be sixth fastest among women this season in India. Her previous best was 55.37, recorded in under-16 category in the 2019 National junior meet in Guntur. This March, Rupal clocked 58.02 in the North Zone meet. Later, Ayush Dabas easily staved off the challenges of Surendra Selvamani and Harpreet Singh Gill to maintain his reputation in the men’s section. Ayush, the firm favourite, clocked 46.86 seconds, to stay comfortably ahead of Selvamani (47.76) and Gill (48.13). Abrar Choudhary (J&K) made up for a slow start to beat Pankaj (Rajasthan) with a fine burst in the homestretch in boys’ under-20. Karnataka’s Rihan C. H. (49.02) stayed beyond the reach of the Rajasthan duo Sonu Chaudhary and Shivam to claim the honours in the under-18 section. The women’s section proved a disappointment. There were only six entries and all three finishers made it to the podium. Tamil Nadu’s Kanista Teena was an impressive winner in the girls’ under-16 section where she beat Karnataka’s Priyanka Olekar, the fastest runner in the heats and the semifinals.

13 October 2021||MALE,||A must-win game for India against Maldives||India, still unbeaten but hugely disappointing so far, takes on Maldives in its last round-robin league match of the SAFF Championships here on Wednesday, knowing well that nothing less than a victory will save it from elimination. A draw or a loss will put India out of reckoning for a place in the final of the regional tournament and that will be the worst result for the team in recent memory, which could also raise questions about head coach Igor Stimac’s continuation. The worst performance for seven-time champion India before this edition was a third-place finish in 2003 and it has either won or finished runner-up in 11 previous editions. All the four top sides in the five-team tournament remain in contention for the October 16 final. With five points from two draws and one win, India is currently third below Maldives and Nepal, both with six points from three matches. Nepal plays Bangladesh (fourth with four points) also on Wednesday. Two-time winner and defending champion Maldives has never been an easy opponent for India in the regional tournament. Led by veteran Ali Ashfaq, one of the best strikers in the region, Maldives has regrouped after losing its opener to Nepal, beating Bangladesh 2-0 and Sri Lanka 1-0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-must-win-game-for-india-against-maldives/article36976781.ece

There are stories that you don’t even hear of people’s lives that you have touched.” de Villiers said Kohli’s contribution goes beyond his performance as a skipper or a batter. “I have known you on the field but away from it as well.

Which I still believe will come your way.”  You make people believe in themselves, which is much more important than winning a trophy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-were-very-lucky-to-have-had-you-at-the-front/article36976733.ece
13 October 2021||Berlin,||Germany first team to make the grade||As Germany became the first country to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, its former under-21 team coach was crying tears of joy after his first win in charge of Turkey. Stefan Kuntz was unable to keep his emotions in check after Burak Yilmaz’s penalty in the ninth minute of injury time earned Turkey a dramatic 2-1 win in Latvia to keep its qualification hopes alive. Germany booked its place on Monday with an error-strewn 4-0 win in North Macedonia. The goals all came in the second half as the home team tired, and the win went some way to atoning for Germany’s surprise 2-1 loss to North Macedonia in Duisburg in March. In Rotterdam, Memphis Depay scored twice, had two assists and missed a penalty as the Netherlands overpowered Gibraltar 6-0 to remain on course for qualification, two points ahead of Norway and four points ahead of Turkey in Group G. Croatia and Russia are assured of at least a playoff place after their respective results in Group H. Croatia midfielder Luka Modric scored from a free kick to salvage a 2-2 draw with Slovakia, and Russia capitalised with a 2-1 win over old rival Slovenia to move top of the group.   The results: Group E: Belarus 0 lost to Czech Republic 2 (Schick 22, Hlozek 65); Estonia 0 lost to Wales 1 (Moore 12).   Group G: Latvia 1 (Demiral 70-og) lost to Turkey 2 (Dursun 76, B. Yilmaz 90+9-pen); the Netherlands 6 (Van Dijk 9, Depay 21, 45+3-pen, Dumfries 48, Danjuma 75, Malen 86) bt Gibraltar 0; Norway 2 (Elyounoussi 29, 90+6) bt Montenegro 0.   Group H: Croatia 2 (Kramaric 25, Modric 71) drew with Slovakia 2 (Schranz 20, Haraslin 45); Cyprus 2 (Papoulis 7, Sotiriou 80) drew with Malta 2 (Muscat 53, Degabriele 90+8); Slovenia 1 (Ilicic 40) lost to Russia 2 (Diveyev 28, Dzhikiya 32).   Group J: Iceland 4 (Thordarson 19, Gudmundsson 35-pen, 79-pen, Gudjohnsen 89) bt Liechtenstein 0; North Macedonia 0 lost to Germany 4 (Havertz 50, Werner 70, 73, Musiala 83); Romania 1 (Mitrita 26) bt Armenia 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/germany-first-team-to-make-the-grade/article36976745.ece
13 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Chandralal wants more hostels dedicated to boxing||At the start of the decade, Kerala was a force to be reckoned with in women’s boxing. The State lifted the national championship twice and produced a world champion in K.C. Lekha, a world championship bronze medallist in C.V.Aswathy Mol and an Asian bronze medallist in Aswathy Prabha, besides a few multiple gold medallists at national level With modest facilities Dronacharya awardee D. Chandralal had single handedly made Kerala a powerhouse in women’s boxing. Boxing until then was considered a North or North-Eastern sport but Chandralal’s girls busted that myth. The genial coach has now been honoured with Olympian Suresh Babu memorial lifetime achievement award by the State Government for his contribution to uplift women’s boxing in the State. But it saddens him that the sport which has produced the State’s only world champion stands neglected by the authorities. The SAI centres in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram used to be the hubs of women’s boxing in the State. But surprisingly boxing is no longer a part of SAI’s STC programme. There are also no specialised hostels for women’s boxing under the Kerala State Sports Council. “Obviously the standard has declined. Now we don’t have a single boxer who can win medal at the nationals. The present day boxers are not dedicated as they look for short term success. Most of them are martial art practitioners who don’t have the wherewithal to do hard work. They just disappear after a year or two when they find it tough to compete at national level,” said the former Indian coach who is now working with the GV Raja Sports School. Patience “We need more hostels dedicated to boxing. Success cannot come overnight the trainees need to be nurtured and coaches have to be patient. There has to be some check on the fly by night martial arts academies which churn out half baked boxers . At the GV Raja school after the pandemic we are starting from scratch. We have just finished our selection trials so it will take a few years for us to produce new winners,” said Chandralal who was the personal coach of former world champion L.Saritha Devi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chandralal-wants-more-hostels-dedicated-to-boxing/article36976998.ece

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Nature of Brahman||The Upanishads are the basis for any sastra vichara, by which alone the quest for the Ultimate Truth that they call Brahman is undertaken by the jiva. Even at the outset, the focus of the Brahmasutra is on the nature of Brahman. The discussion is based on both inferential knowledge, that is, anumana pramana, and scriptural knowledge, sabda pramana, pointed out Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal in a discourse. The second sutra, janmadhyasya etc, is shown to explain the ‘tatastha’ lakshana or a temporary quality of Brahman. The relevant text is the Taittiriya Upanishad passage “That from which these beings are born, that by which when born they live, that into which when departing they enter. That seek to know. That is Brahman”. This sutra refers to the creative side of the Absolute. Adi Sankara shows that Brahman’s jagat karanatvam is unique and this lakshana is exclusive and it also affirms His Sarvajnatva is beyond doubt. Brahman stands beyond Maya and Prakriti even when engaged in creation. Maya and prakriti are achetana while Brahman alone is chetana. Brahman’s jagat ‘kartrutvam’ also establishes His Sarvajnatva. For, whoever is a karta should know how to do the work and he can do it and he will do it. He knows why he has to do it. Only Parameswara can be jagat karana and also jagat karta on all these counts. Then the question of how Brahman is the source of scriptures is taken up. Vedas are self revelatory and are held as the highest authority for all knowledge. The Brihadaranyaka states that from Brahman all the Vedas are ‘breathed forth.’ The analogy used in this context is of how just as when a man breathes, there is no special effort on his part, so also Brahman breathes forth the Vedas naturally without effort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/nature-of-brahman/article36976680.ece

13 October 2021||October 13 2021 00:00 IST,||How the river runs through it||“The environment is everyone’s business,” says documentary filmmaker Shridhar Sudhir, and few would disagree. Speaking to us about the second edition of the All Living Things Environmental Film Festival (ALT EFF), where his 2021 documentary, Moving Upstream: Ganga , is being screened, he says this is an event that ‘engages the public on the environment and social issues of our time’. Contrary to the Ganga’s stereotypical association with religion, often the central focus of films on the subject, his film  traces Siddharth Agarwal’s (an aerospace engineer from IIT, Kharagpur) 3,000-kilometre walk from Ganga Sagar in West Bengal to Gangotri, the source of the river. “It was not about looking at the Ganga in isolation,” says Sudhir, adding, “The exclusivity that the paradigms of religion, spirituality and mythology lend to the river makes it the perfect segue into the plights that plague all rivers. In fact, a good case is made for all other rivers when one understands how harshly the narratives of development and urbanisation treat the ‘holiest’ of them.”  Of climate change and students   OtherIndian titles at the virtual ALT EFF 2021, where 44 films from 31 countries across 10 categories are being featured, include For the Stripes , Elephants in my Backyard and Coral Woman , among others. Festival director and co-founder, Kunal Khanna, says the festival opened for submissions in March and the final programme was decided on July 31. “During these 4.5 months, our programming team watched close to 130 submissions,” he says, sharing popular themes included climate change, biodiversity, food systems, conservation and social justice.  Addressing the newly-launched ‘Student Films’ category, he says the aim was to encourage youngsters to “seek out and bring to the fore said conversations, and in turn inspire to weave these discussions into mainstream cinema through their careers in film and storytelling”. One of ALT EFF’s aims is to highlight not just stories of hope, but how humans are tackling the problem at hand with innovations. “India especially lacks opportunities for young filmmakers covering the environmental theme and we aim to fill this gap with the new section,” he says. Next year, they aim to achieve their original vision of a physical festival in the heart of the biodiverse Western Ghats, adds co-founder Neha Shrestha.  What comes after   Arefreshing addition to India’s cinematic festival landscape that usually promotes commercial films or art-oriented projects, ALT EFF is a good platform to bring about environmental consciousness. “The goal is to do more than to make pretty pictures — to drive meaningful change,” says Micheal Snyder, international award-winning photographer and filmmaker, who is on the jury this year. Looking forward to Moti Bagh , Fat Kathy , and The Last Hop(e) , he says virtual film festivals pose an amazing opportunity to reach audiences all over the world. “I am excited for what comes after the films: what people do and say next, as it is these conversations and actions that are the critical component of environmental filmmaking,” concludes Snyder, who has directed films in the Arctic, the Amazon, and the Himalayas.  ALT EFF is on from October 9-17 at alteff.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/how-the-river-runs-through-it/article36976884.ece
13 October 2021||Mumbai,||Minister blames bad planning by Coal India for power crisis||Maharashtra may face power shortage of 3000 MW to 3500 MW in the coming days, said Energy Minister Nitin Raut. However, his department would ensure that the State does not face load shedding, he added. “State’s demand of power will reach its peak in coming days and we anticipate that the total demand will reach up to 17,500 to 18,000 MW. At present Maharashtra has a supply of 14,000 to 15,500 MW. There will be some shortfall. The supply of coal is increasing, but it will take time. The whole problem has been created due to lack of planning by Coal India,” he said. Mr. Raut wanted to know how Gujarat and Goa, which are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, enjoy surplus power while other States face problems of coal shortage. Mr. Raut pointed out that due to irregularities in monsoon in August, the demand increased. “Coal India’s per day capacity to carry coal is 40 lakh MT which had come down to 22 lakh MT. It has now reached to 27 lakh MT. It has affected the energy production and the quality. In addition, the coal supplied by Coal India is of sub-standard quality which too has impacted power generation,” he said. The State government plans to send legal notice to private companies like Coastal Gujarat Power Limited and JSW with whom it has a long-term power purchase contracts, he said. “Despite having import coal stored with them, these companies have not begun power generation to supply 1,000 MW for Maharashtra. An appeal will be filed with the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission,” he said. Asked why the State had not anticipated possible shortage of coal, Mr. Raut mentioned a letter he wrote to Union Coal Minister Prahlad Joshi and Union Energy Minister R.K. Singh. “Irrespective of coal shortage and subsequent power shortage, the government has spent over Rs. 250 crore to purchase electricity to ensure there is no load shedding. We have given Rs. 20 per unit rate, which is highest in the season,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/minister-blames-bad-planning-by-coal-india-for-power-crisis/article36976896.ece
13 October 2021||Mumbai,||BMC polls: Congress steps in to woo north Indian voters||The battle to grab north Indian votes in Mumbai is on, and after much delay the Congress has finally entered the fray with the Mumbai head of the Congress, Bhai Jagtap, on Tuesday announcing the setting up of the Uttar Bharatiya Panchayat (North Indian Panchayat). “We will cover all the 227 wards of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation through this panchayat where issues concerning north Indians living in Mumbai will be taken up and solved. The Congress will give ticket to north Indian candidates in wards where they have majority,” announced Mr. Jagtap. The Congress party’s attempt to appease north Indians is seen as an answer to the BJP’s recently launched programme of organising ‘chaupals’ across the city. Mumbai’s western suburbs have a significant north Indian population with 50 to 60 wards, of the total 227, having them in a majority. In at least 50 more they enjoy significant clout which could bear an impact on the outcome. The BJP with its aggressive campaign since 2014, and by poaching several north Indian leaders from the Congress, damaged the latter’s vote bank significantly in many areas. “We are a party whom the north Indians trust even today. We will ensure that they come back to us in the coming elections as the BJP has done nothing for them. Even they realise it now,” said Suraj Singh Thakur, Mumbai Congress leader. Mr. Jagtap added said they would hold special conferences across all six parliamentary constituencies of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bmc-polls-congress-steps-in-to-woo-north-indian-voters/article36976899.ece
13 October 2021||Talkeshwarpur (Mungapara),||Malnutrition deaths of Pando people highlight systemic failure||The death of 29 people (including children) of the primitive Pando Korwa and Pahadi Korwa tribes in Chhattisgarh’s Balrampur district between July and first week of October this year has not changed anything despite the State government claiming to have admitted 270 people in the district hospital, Ambikapur Medical College and other multi-speciality government hospitals. “In July, August and September, 29 Pando Korwa and Pahadi Korwa tribes people had died,” Dr. Basant Kumar Singh, Chief Medical Health Officer, Balrampur, told The Hindu . Behind the deaths and beneath the frenzied reaction from the government lurks a sordid tale of severely affected Pando Korwa tribe people who were never classified as either Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes. This resulted in them being left out of the reservation pie and all the welfare schemes meant for the backward communities. “Life is hell here…How will I and my six children survive on 20 kg rice, 1 litre kerosene, and 1 kg sugar from the monthly public distribution system?” asks Rooplal Pando, sitting in front of his one-room house, which he got under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna in 2016. “I and my wife are daily labourers. She starts the chullah only when we get something to cook,” said Rooplal, a resident of village Talkeshwarpur, Mungapara in Balrampur district. He, his two brothers and their families survive on the meagre harvest produced on their one acre land. For the last few years, the tribals have not been able to source rich forest produce. “We are unable to get nutritional forest produce. Perhaps it is due to changes in the weather,” Kalavati Pando, wife of Shiv Prasad Pando and a resident of village Talkeshwarpur, said. The district administration officials say poor state of health is due to lockdowns and engagement of health officials and workers to contain the coronavirus. “The health officials are busy in COVID-19 and the tribal community members have become vulnerable. During this period, monitoring and timely health check-ups were stopped. But now things are under control. We have admitted 153 seriously ill people in hospitals, shifted 117 patients to Ambikapur Medical College and other multi-speciality government hospitals,” Balrampur Collector Kundan Kumar said. COVID-19 is likely to leave a deep impact on the undernourished people, due to weakened immune systems. “We do not benefit from the government schemes.... school admissions or scholarships, jobs etc,” said Uday Pando, Prantiya Adhyaksh, Pichdi Janjaati Samaj Kalyan Samiti, Balrampur district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/malnutrition-deaths-of-pando-people-highlight-systemic-failure/article36976901.ece
13 October 2021||NUH,||Dengue, viral fever on rise in Nuh; 18 deaths reported so far||As many as 18 persons have died due of fever and 113 due to dengue reported so far in Nuh, amid a spurt in viral cases over the past one month in the district. More than 8,000 cases of fever have been recorded in a survey by the Health Department across the district. District Malaria Officer Vikram Singh said a majority of the dengue patients were children. Locals alleged that the healthcare facilities were not able to keep pace with the rush and sometimes three to four children were forced to share a bed at the district’s lone Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College in Nalhar. “Every four years there is a spurt in dengue cases in the district since 2009. So far 113 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported. However, there have been only four malaria cases so far. The Nalhar Medical College, catering to five districts, had recorded 33 dengue cases till October 3,” said Mr. Singh. The officer said the Health Department teams had carried out survey across the district and recorded 8,339 cases of fever. “Eighteen people have died due to fever since September 1, but none of the deaths have been caused due to dengue,” said Mr. Singh. Social activist Sabir Kasim claimed that the situation on the ground was grave, and the actual number of deaths and patients could be much larger. He said the cases of fever were on rise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dengue-viral-fever-on-rise-in-nuh-18-deaths-reported-so-far/article36976905.ece
13 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||Meghalaya firm on shifting Sikhs||The Meghalaya government said on Tuesday the order of any commission would not come in the way of shifting the colony of Dalit Sikhs from a prime location in State capital Shillong. The assertion was in reaction to an order of the National Commission for Minorities vetoing the State government’s decision to relocate the residents of Harijan Colony or Punjabi Lane in the Iewduh or Barabazar area of Shillong. “We will challenge in the court any status quo or any other order issued by the different commissions on this matter. We are ready to challenge them in the High Court or even the Supreme Court,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said. The minorities’ panel had on October 8 directed the State government to maintain the status quo in the matter as ordered by the High Court of Meghalaya on April 9. Legally sound On the announcement made by Punjab Deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa that he will take up the “eviction” move with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr. Sangma said the relocation decision had been taken after three-and-a-half years of detailed homework. “Whatever steps we are going to take from now on will be legally sound and action will be based on proper documentation. We will also take up the matter with leaders in the Punjab government,” he said. The Chief Minister said the ownership of the land — 2.5 acres bisected by a 300-metre lane — is with the government in terms of the lease signed with the Syiem of Mylliem. Syiem is a king-like traditional custodian of the land. “The residents are being asked to go to residential places allotted to them by the government,” Mr. Sangma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/meghalaya-firm-on-shifting-sikhs/article36976894.ece
13 October 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan to review Bill on marriage registration||The Congress government in Rajasthan will reconsider a recently passed Bill to amend the Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2009, in view of the concern expressed in certain quarters that it could encourage and legitimise child marriages. The Bill is pending with the Governor for his assent after its passage in the State Assembly on September 17. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said at a function marking the International Girl Child Day here on Monday that the government would urge the Governor to return the Bill for its legal scrutiny. “We will go ahead only after a thorough examination of the Bill,” he said. Governor Kalraj Mishra was stated to be studying the Bill following objections raised by the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party as well as the civil society groups. The BJP, which had staged a walkout in the Assembly when the Bill was passed with voice vote, had petitioned the Governor with the plea not to give his assent to it. Mr. Gehlot said while it was the State government’s resolve to stop child marriages at any cost, the Amendment Bill had been brought in accordance with a 2006 judgment of the Supreme Court making it compulsory to register all marriages of Indian citizens. Since a controversy had erupted that it would promote child marriages, the Bill would be re-examined, he said. Information on marriage The Bill has sought to amend Sections 5 and 8 of the Act of 2009, dealing with the appointment of Marriage Registration Officers and the duty of parties to a marriage to submit the memorandum for registration. The amendment authorises women above 18 years to provide information of their marriage on their own. While the Act stated that the parents or guardians of the bride and bridegroom were responsible to submit the memorandum if both the boy and the girl had not completed the age of 21 years, the latest amendment has reduced the age of bride to 18 years for casting the duty on parents to report about the marriage to the Registration Officer within 30 days of the union. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal had clarified that the provision for mandatory registration of all marriages, including the child marriages, existed in the Act of 2009, and the amendment had only reduced the age of girls from 21 years to 18 years for their responsibility to report about their marriage, which was earlier the duty of their parents. The State government also clarified later that the Bill had been brought to protect legal rights of children, stop multiple marriages and take care of the matters related to maintenance and inheritance. It said the Bill would also streamline the registration process for marriages, without changing the status of the nuptial ties of minors, who had the right to get the marriage annulled upon becoming major.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-to-review-bill-on-marriage-registration/article36976649.ece

According to a CBI counsel, the dera chief pleaded leniency, citing welfare works. However, the CBI opposed it and demanded “maximum punishment” under the IPC Section 302. The special court had convicted them on Friday in the murder case of a dera manager, Ranjit Singh. The other convicted are Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh, Avtar Singh and Sabdil. “The counsel of some other convicts sought time stating that they are not ready with arguments as they have to go through the judgments,” CBI special prosecutor H.P.S Verma said. On their request, the court deferred the sentencing till October 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sacha-sauda-heads-sentencing-deferred-till-october-18/article36976904.ece
