11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi not dictatorial, hears all views: Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah has rejected the charge that Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes unilateral decisions. In an interview to Sansad TV aired on Sunday, Mr. Shah said he had never come across a “better listener” than Mr. Modi. When asked about allegations of Mr. Modi being dictatorial, Mr. Shah said these were baseless allegations. Mr. Shah, who has worked with Mr. Modi in the BJP, the Gujarat government and now in the Central Government, said the Prime Minister heard out all points of views and held extensive discussions before taking decisions. He said unlike before, the details of decisions taken do not leak out, leading to some people thinking the decisions are taken unilaterally. Mr. Shah spoke to the government channel last week, marking 20 years of Mr. Modi in public office — first as Gujarat Chief Minister and then as Prime Minister from 2014. School enrolment drive Speaking about the challenges faced by Mr. Modi as Chief Minister, the Home Minister said low enrolment at schools and high dropout rates were hurdles. He said Mr. Modi took up enrolment drives as a mahotsav or festival. Enrolment increased from 67% to 100% and the dropouts decreased from 37% to under 1%, he said. “You can understand what contribution this had on the development of the country and Gujarat. An illiterate person becomes a big burden on the country. Neither does he know his Constitutional rights, nor the duties asked of us by the Constitution. How can he be a good citizen,” he asked. He said Mr. Modi had quickly taken to the world of administration, having had no experience. “Never been a sarpanch, let alone an MLA,” he said. Mr. Shah said Mr. Modi focused on uplift of the tribal population of Gujarat that the Congress had “used as a vote-bank” earlier. Mr. Modi also worked to develop the coastal areas of Gujarat, which became the “backbone of Gujarat’s industrial development”, he said. ‘India first’ motto He said Mr. Modi became Prime Minister at a time the country was down in every sector, there were “scams of Rs. 12 lakh crore” and “policy paralysis”. He said Mr. Modi took risks in decisions as he believed that he was in government to change the country. Mr. Modi’s primary goal was “India first”, he said. “Only he could have implemented a decision like demonetisation.” Responding to a question about criticism of Mr. Modi, Mr. Shah said, “With every criticism, Modiji becomes stronger”. The public was standing with Mr. Modi through tough decisions. He said allegations, including of corruption and “communal riots”, have never stuck as Mr. Modi has worked with transparency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modi-not-dictatorial-hears-all-views-shah/article36936189.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers in east see little hope in stir||As the movement against the agricultural reform laws builds towards its one-year anniversary, it is clear that the bulk of farmers in eastern States have not been as motivated to join the agitation as their counterparts in the northwest, as they have not even experienced many of the benefits that the laws threaten to take away. In fact, farmers in these States, with densely populated rural areas, bear the double burden of low procurement as well as low prices in the open market, partly because grains procured in the northern and western States are dumped into the eastern region at subsidised rates via the public distribution system (PDS), a situation exacerbated by additional free grain distribution as COVID-19 relief. Experts and farm leaders say reforms are needed in both procurement as well as PDS, to allow for more effective decentralised procurement, which will benefit both farmers and consumers in the region. Analysis of procurement and PDS data from 2020-21 highlights the stark divide. Government procurement of wheat and paddy in Bihar and West Bengal each account for just 2% of the national total, despite the fact that the latter is the country’s largest rice producer. However, 10% of all foodgrains allocated under the National Food Security Act last year went to Bihar, while 7% went to West Bengal. Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are the other major States in a similar situation. Punjab accounts for a whopping 27% of all procurement, and Haryana for 11%, while only being allocated 2% and 1% of grains under PDS respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-in-east-see-little-hope-in-stir/article36936193.ece
11 October 2021||MANGALURU,||Norms being relaxed as TPR remains less than 1%||With COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) continuing to remain less than 1% in Dakshina Kannada for the last over seven days, the Dakshina Kannada district administration has started relaxing norms to allow, among others, the use of Mangaluru City Corporation’s Mangala Swimming Pool by the public. “On October 7, we allowed long-term pass holders to use the swimming pool,” corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar told The Hindu . It will take time to allow other people to use the swimming pool, he said and added that the corporation is not issuing any new passes for the use of the pool. Among the people who were happy with this permission was senior citizen and rationalist Narendra Nayak who had been demanding that the swimming pool be thrown open for regular swimmers. “I have been a member of Mangala Swimming Pool for over 30 years. In the absence of swimming, I was walking around the pool,” he said Since October 7, Mr. Nayak has resumed swimming twice a day. Among the few who have resumed swimming at the pool include Jeradin D’Souza, founder-director of Mangalore Alzheimer’s Association. It has been nearly a month since physical classes started for students in Classes VII to II Pre University in Dakshina Kannada, as the test positivity rate fell to less than 2%. Physical classes for students in Classes VI and VII and other courses too have resumed since September last week. During his recent visit to Udupi, Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh told reporters that the State Government is considering opening physical classes for Classes I to V after the end of the Dasara festival. Cinemas and multiplexes have been allowed to screen movies with 50% capacity in the district. On the sidelines of the commissioning of two oxygen generation units at the Government Wenlock Hospital here recently, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra told reporters that as the TPR in the district continues to be less than 1%, the district administration is gradually relaxing norms while ensuring strict compliance with social distancing and other COVID-19 safety guidelines. “But we are seeking production of COVID-19 test negative certificate, not older than 72 hours, from those entering the district from Kerala. Though the TPR in Kasaragod is around 4%, it continues to be high in other parts of Kerala,” he said. District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishore Kumar said that while the virulence of COVID-19 continues to be low, the district has made good progress in terms of vaccination. As much as 82% of people have received their first dose of the vaccine.  The district administration has planned to achieve 100% administration of first dose in the next few days. Dr. Kumar said that the health staff are carrying out an average of 9,000 RT-PCR tests every day and reports are now being made available within 24 hours.  On October 7, we allowed long-term pass holders to use Mangala Swimming Pool, says corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar It has been nearly a month since physical classes started for students in Classes VII to II Pre University in Dakshina Kannada||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/norms-being-relaxed-as-tpr-remains-less-than-1/article36936636.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,||Modern Indian women want to stay single, says Sudhakar||Minister for Health and Family Welfare K. Sudhakar has attributed the increase in stress levels and prevalence of mental health issues among Indians to moving away from joint families amid “western influence, materialism, and competition”. He claimed that many modern Indian women want to stay single and are unwilling to bear children even after marriage. They also prefer surrogacy, he said. “Today, sorry to say this, a lot of modern women want to stay single. Even if they get married they do not want to give birth; they want surrogacy. There is a paradigm shift in our thinking. It is not good,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar was speaking at World Mental Health Day 2021 programme at NIMHANS on Sunday. “In western countries, almost one in two people periodically and naturally go to psychiatrists for counselling. Because when they live in isolation, without good friends and family, they want someone to counsel them, that is natural human behaviour,” he said. “Unfortunately, we are going the western way. We don’t want our parents to stay with us, leave alone grandparents,” he said. Mental health issues need to be addressed at the root cause. Prevention is any day better than cure.We need to stress on family and living in social harmony, the Minister said. “Managing stress is an art, an art which we need not learn, we need to preach the world. Our ancestors have given us a system of joint families, pranayama, yoga which are the best antidotes for stress and mental health. We need to go back to our ancient wisdom,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modern-indian-women-want-to-stay-single-says-sudhakar/article36936255.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Power blackout fears misplaced: Centre||Terming any fear of disruption in power supply in the country due to coal shortages ‘misplaced’, the Government on Sunday said coal stocks at power plants would ‘gradually improve’ and were currently sufficient for four days. At a review meeting of the coal stocks at thermal power plants attended by Power Minister R.K. Singh and Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi, the Coal Ministry and Coal India assured that there is ample coal available to meet the demand of power plants.  The Coal Ministry also said coal supplies were set to hit a ‘record high’ in 2021-22 and blamed extended monsoons for constraints in despatches from mines. Coal India, the Ministry said, was supplying more than 2.5 lakh tonnes daily to non-power industries such as aluminium, steel and cement, reflecting the ‘comfortable coal position in the country’. The daily average coal requirement at power plants is about 18.5 lakh tonnes whereas the daily coal supply has been around 17.5 lakh tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/power-blackout-fears-misplaced-centre/article36936578.ece
11 October 2021||KURNOOL,||First ‘PM-WANI’ project launched in Kurnool||Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy on Sunday launched the first Prime Minister’s Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) project of the State at Uyyalawada in Kurnool district. As part of the project, Public Data Offices (PDOs) will work like Public Call Offices (PCOs) to facilitate users data service at cheaper rates so that every citizen can enjoy Internet facility. As part of the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, the project being executed by Tess and Tera Techno Solutions Private Lt., the first Public Data Office Aggregator (PDOA) and App provider of A.P., was launched under the brand name ‘Wi-DOT’. As per the National Digital Communication Plan, the Central government has set a target of setting up millions of Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022 and the PM-WANI scheme will facilitate this. During the inauguration function, Founder and CEO of Tess and Tera Techno Solutions Private Limited S.V.V. Sanjeeva Kumar said plans were afoot to set up Public Wi-Fi Networks to provide Internet service through Public Data Offices (PDOs) across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. “This move will accelerate the proliferation of public broadband services through Wi-Fi networks and it will enable local entrepreneurs such as chaiwalas, kirana stores and eateries to earn additional revenue,” he said. Mr. Sanjeeva Kumar asked people to download Wi-DOT App to enjoy the benefits of the PM-WANI project. After downloading the App, a user completes the profile after keying in the KYC details and can discover the nearby WANI-compliant SSIDs. Nandyal MP Pocha Brahmananda Reddy, MLC Gangula Prabhakar Reddy, and MLA Gangula Brijendranath Reddy were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/first-pm-wani-project-launched-in-kurnool/article36936195.ece
11 October 2021||CHENNAI,||DGP initiates trifurcation of Chennai Commissionerate||With the State government recently appointing special officers for the proposed Tambaram and Avadi police commissionerates, the Director-General of Police (DGP) has issued modalities for trifurcation of the Greater Chennai Police. In his instruction to Commissioner of Police Shankar Jiwal on Saturday, the DGP said the city police, which had previously jurisdiction over 137 police taluks, would now have 104 police stations. Twenty taluk stations would form part of Avadi Commissionerate and 13 taluk stations would be under the Tambaram Commissionerate. The Avadi Commissionerate would have 25 police stations, and Tambaram, 20 taluk stations. Twenty police stations, which previously belonged to Chennai police, would be shifted to Avadi Commissionerate. They include Avadi, Milk Colony, Red Hills, Manali, Manali New Town, Sathangadu, Ennore, Poonamallee, Nazarthpet, Muthapudupet, Pattabhiram, Ambattur, Ambattur Estate, Korattur, Thiruverkadu, SRMC, Tank Factory, Thirumullaivoyal and Thiruninravur.

11 October 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Hypertension higher among educated, urban residents’||With hypertension a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, a study has revealed that approximately 42% of adults aged 45 and above, and their spouses had hypertension, and prevalence was found to be higher among richer, more educated individuals residing in urban areas across India. Research conducted by experts of the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, and others, published in ‘PLOS Medicine’ on August 24, 2021, estimated that 29.9% of the people who participated in the study had uncontrolled hypertension, and the prevalence was higher among richer and better educated groups. “Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in adults aged 45 years and above, and their spouses in India: A nationally representative cross-sectional study” noted that richer individuals with higher monthly per capita consumption expenditure were more likely to have hypertension. Prevalence was estimated to increase from 37% among the least educated to 51.2% among the most educated. Prevalence was higher in urban areas (51.8%) than in rural areas (37.8%). It was also higher among those not working. The study, which is based on a sample of 64,427 participants (58% female and 70% rural dwellers) noted that prevalence increased strongly with age, and this was higher for females (43.7%) than for males (39.6%). Prevalence of hypertension varied from 31.3% in Uttar Pradesh to 66% in Lakshadweep. Awareness among those with hypertension varies from 27.5% in Nagaland to 75.9% in Jammu and Kashmir. Treatment among those with hypertension varies from 23.8% in Nagaland to 74.9% in Jammu and Kashmir. States with the highest prevalence include those most advanced in the demographic transition, such as Kerala, and high-income States, such as Goa and Delhi. While prevalence tends to be lower in the low or middle-income States, it was relatively low in all four States with the highest rates of poverty – Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. “Those living in poorer States were at lower risk of hypertension. If they were hypertensive, however, they were also more vulnerable to diseases associated with the risk factor because they were less likely to have been diagnosed, treated, and controlled,” according to the study. It is estimated that 54.4% of adults aged 45 and above, and their spouses with hypertension were aware of their condition; 50.8% were treated while 28.8% had achieved control. Major risk factor Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that accounted for 44% of the 42 million deaths related to non-communicable diseases globally in 2019. “The fact that older adults with chronic conditions, such as hypertension, are most likely to succumb to this illness and need high-cost medical care emphasises that investment in hypertension screening and management can potentially pay off in the long term through reduced demands on the health system,” the study said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hypertension-higher-among-educated-urban-residents/article36936258.ece
11 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||KSEB keeping its fingers crossed||With the shortage of coal that has hit power stations yet to be sorted out, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has scrambled to avoid power restrictions, while keeping a close watch on the developments. Although the KSEB has managed the situation without power restrictions thus far, a sharper dip in supply from Central generating stations would warrant tight measures, officials of the state utility said. The State has been recording a daily shortage of 120 MW-200 MW in Central supply during peak consumption hours due to the coal shortage. The utility has urged its 1.3 crore consumers to reduce electricity usage during the evening hours when consumption peaks, B. Ashok, Chairman and Managing Director, KSEB, said. “If the shortage goes beyond 400 MW or the crisis persists over an extended period, we will have to go in for restrictions. For now, we have asked consumers to keep the usage down,” he said. Multiple factors have so far helped Kerala elude the worst of the crisis. Only three of the power plants supplying power to Kerala have been hit by coal shortage, according to Mr. Ashok. Moreover, the State has been receiving heavy rainfall, leaving the hydel reservoirs 83% full [generation capability 3,430 million units (MU)] as on October 9. This is also the highest for the day in recent years. The Idukki reservoir, the biggest in the State, is 83% full. That said, the coal crisis has yet again revealed the extent to which Kerala is dependent on 'imported' thermal power. The total consumption on Saturday stood at 71.42 MU, and net imports at 36.9 MU. Over the years, internal generation has been increased in Kerala, but so has consumption. The Power Department data reveal that internal consumption stood at 4,599.09 MU in 2016-17 against the annual consumption at 23,815.13 MU. In 2020-21, it was respectively 7,637.8 MU and 25,145.9 MU. Consequently, the State has also been spending more on power purchases. The money spent on purchases rose from Rs. 7,393.32 crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 8,057.9 crore in 2020-21.  The State has been recording a daily shortage of 120 MW-200 MW in central supply during peak consumption hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kseb-keeping-its-fingers-crossed/article36936555.ece

At around 5.45 p.m., lightning struck the tree, killing Thippeswamy on the spot. In critical condition “His son who was standing next to him was also injured and was rushed to hospital by the Hoysala patrolling staff who reached the spot within a few minutes,” the police officer said. He is being treated in ICU and said to be critical. A case was registered in the Byadarahalli police station in this regard. Heavy rain was reported in various parts of Bengaluru on Sunday. The police have advised people against taking shelter under trees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/man-killed-in-lightning-strike-on-nice-road/article36936254.ece
11 October 2021||Pune,||PM Modi’s ‘silence’ comes under criticism of NCP||The Nationalist Congress Party on Sunday chastised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for failing to condemn the death of farmers in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh, with NCP State president Jayant Patil stating that Mr. Modi’s “continued silence” over the incident was astonishing. “He [Mr. Modi] has neither shown any remorse, nor expressed any grief, nor condemned the incident in which farmers were crushed to death,” said Mr. Patil, who is the State Water Resources Minister. Speaking in Sangli district, Mr. Patil said the Centre was quick to stifle any dissent expressed by non-BJP parties of its anti-farmer policies. “If voices are raised against the government today, the Central Government will unleash probe agencies. Even though there is not the slightest evidence against any of its leaders, the BJP has strained every sinew to defame the MVA government in Maharashtra,” he said. Mr. Patil claimed that when NCP chief Sharad Pawar likened the Lakhimpur incident to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Centre promptly began investigating firms linked to or owned by Deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s kin. “The Central probe agencies, be it the I-T or the Enforcement Directorate [ED] are being guided by the BJP and a planned smear campaign is under way in the State. It is solely with this intention that the raids against Ajit Pawar are taking place,” alleged Mr. Patil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-modis-silence-comes-under-criticism-of-ncp/article36936661.ece

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,||Unaccounted cash, gold jewellery seized in raids||The Income Tax Department seized unaccounted money and gold jewellery in two different search operations it had conducted at 34 locations in Kancheepuram, Chennai and Vellore. In the search on the premises of a chit fund and financing group, the officials seized unaccounted cash of Rs. 1.35 crore and gold jewellery of about 7.5 kg. The undisclosed income detected in this group so far is more than Rs. 150 crore. It was found that this group was running an unauthorised chit fund business, and all the investments and pay-outs of more than Rs. 400 crore, in the last few years, were done entirely in cash. Evidence revealed that the group had earned unaccounted income by way of commission and dividends. Numerous promissory notes, post-dated cheques and power of attorney documents kept as collateral for the loans given or from chit subscribers were seized. Many property documents registered in the names of group members and their associates were also seized. In the case of the second group that was in the business of silk saris and other garments, unaccounted cash of Rs. 44 lakh and gold jewellery of about 9.5 kg were seized. The undisclosed income detected so far in this group is more than Rs. 100 crore. Evidence was found relating to sales suppression during the last four years. The manipulation of sales figures through a customised software application was also detected. After such manipulations, the group members used to take out the unaccounted cash on a regular basis, and made investments in land and buildings. Further investigation is on in both the cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unaccounted-cash-gold-jewellery-seized-in-i-t-raids/article36936347.ece

The daily average coal requirement at power plants is about 18.5 lakh tonnes whereas the daily coal supply has been around 17.5 lakh tonnes per day. Citing the heavy rains in coal field areas, the Ministry said the CIL was now supplying over 14 lakh tonnes a day to power plants which would increase to over 16 lakh tonnes by the end of October as the rains recede. The Power Ministry said in a separate statement that domestic coal supply had sustained the power plant operations “despite heavy rains in August and September, steep hike in power demand due to economic recovery and increase in imported coal prices”. “All out efforts are being made to ensure full power supply to the DISCOMs as per requirements,” the Ministry added. Taking special note of concerns raised by Delhi about the prospect of power supply disruptions in the capital, Mr. Singh had directed that distribution companies of Delhi would get ‘as much as power as requisitioned by them as per their demand’. Capital demand The Minister had directed the NTPC and the DVC to give full availability of power as per the needs of distribution companies, and advised GAIL India to provide gas from all sources to gas-based power plants in Delhi. “If any DISCOM is found to resort to load-shedding despite being power available as per the PPA, action would be initiated against them,” the Power Ministry warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/power-blackout-fears-misplaced-centre/article36936194.ece

11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.S. outlines a softer focus for Quad||The Quad is a “non-defence, non-military” arrangement, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said during her visit to India and Pakistan last week, indicating at two separate interactions that the purpose of the Australia-India-Japan-U.S. grouping is meant to cooperate on what are considered “softer” issues. “The Quad is [a] vehicle which largely operates in security realms that are non-military, non-defence. Things we do together on vaccines, and infrastructure, supply chains, technology and climate — all the forward-thinking areas in which we need to gain confidence and ensure security for our people,” Ms. Sherman said at an event organised by the think-tank Ananta in Mumbai. People-to-people ties In an interview to Pakistan’s official PTV, broadcast on Saturday as well, Ms. Sherman called the Quad “a cooperative effort to work on things like energy, people-to-people exchanges and infrastructure and supply chain resilience”. The comments by a senior U.S. official are the clearest signal yet that Washington has shifted its view of the Quad’s agenda, particularly after the announcement of the new Australia-U.K.-U.S., or AUKUS, alliance for nuclear submarines in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement came just a week ahead of the first in-person Quad summit, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended in Washington in September. In a briefing by the U.S. State Department at the time, a senior official said there was no “military dimension to it or security dimension” to the Quad, which was earlier called the “Quadrilateral Security Dialogue”, calling it an “informal grouping” instead. Indian officials said the imperatives of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the need for vaccines, technology, supply chain resilience and HADR (Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief) operations, appear to have “clarified” the Biden administration’s plans for the Quad. “The Quad has not been downgraded, but we are seeing it being purposed differently from the AUKUS,” said an official aware of the discussions. Asked about the difference between the Quad and AUKUS at the Ananta interaction, Ms. Sherman replied that the two were non-competing “pieces of a puzzle”. “AUKUS is a one-of-a-kind project, which will be a game changer in a maritime sense in this arena,” Ms. Sherman said, speaking about the project for the U.S. and the U.K. to help Australia build a fleet of nuclear-propelled submarines “which are faster, harder to detect, more agile”. Former Indian Ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale, who had posed the question to Ms. Sherman, said that in his view, the U.S. position had not shifted. “Quad may not be a military alliance, but it continues to undertake military activities like the Malabar Naval exercise,” he told The Hindu , pointing out that the four-nation naval exercises will begin a second phase this week in the Bay of Bengal. However, other analysts say the shift is perceptible, and that it could lead to more productive outcomes, given India’s hesitation over joining any military forum in the Indo-Pacific. Not containment “This is not about containing China as much as it is about competing with China. The costs of containment, especially for countries like India, is too high,” Rudra Chaudhuri, Director of Carnegie India, said. Ms. Sherman’s words during her visit were in stark contrast to those of Michael Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State during the Trump administration, during the Quad’s Ministerial level meeting just a year ago. “As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the Chinese Communist Party’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion. We’ve seen it in the south, in the East China Sea, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Straits,” Mr. Pompeo said in his opening statement in Tokyo in September 2020, where he lashed out at the Chinese government’s “authoritarian nature” and criticised it for the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-outlines-a-softer-focus-for-quad/article36935945.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||There is consensus over Kalapani: ex-Nepal Minister||Nepalese political parties have a general consensus over the fact that Kalapani in Uttarakhand is part of Nepal’s sovereign territory, said former Foreign Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat. Mr. Mahat blamed the previous government of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli for not holding dialogue on this issue with India, and said the Nepali Congress (NC), which is leading the current coalition government steered by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, is interested for a national consultation on amending the constitution to reflect Nepal’s Hindu identity. “There is general consensus or common understanding across political parties over Kalapani. But we are confident that the territorial dispute can be solved through dialogue,” said Mr. Mahat who is here leading a team of NC leaders to sustain conversation between India and Nepal. Mr. Deuba replaced Mr. Oli in July after the Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Oli’s government for decisions that violated the Constitution of Nepal. India-Nepal relations were disturbed during 2020 because of Mr. Oli’s decision to include the Kalapani region in the map of Nepal but Mr. Mahat’s comments show that Kathmandu’s position on the dispute has remained unaffected by the change of government. Mr. Mahat met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and BJP Foreign Affairs Cell’s head Vijay Chauthaiwale. After meeting Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Mr. Mahat told The Hindu from Lucknow that Mr. Oli exploited the Kalapani dispute for his political gains. “We can resolve whatever issues are there like the Kalapani problem or the border issues. Faithful discussion can resolve such things. At least we can start discussing these outstanding issues.” The visit of the Mahat-led delegation is aimed at building closer working relations between the ruling parties. Leading figures from the NC and the BJP have been discussing issues related to the Constitution of Nepal adopted in 2015. Common values Mr. Mahat indicated that Nepal’s cultural identity is also under discussion with the Indian side. “Nepal led by strong nationalism is a good thing that will help India. This is what Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath told me.” “Nepal is overwhelmingly Hindu and its identity is rooted in Hinduism and Buddhism and there is no way that we can distance ourselves from these interconnected and ancient philosophies,” said Mr. Mahat informing that there is a serious discussion within NC on this issue. A section of the NC led by Shashank Koirala has been vocal about the need to declare the country a Hindu state. Mr. Mahat said Nepal’s 2015 Constitution also took note of its ancient traditions and asked the state to protect “sanatana dharma”. “But the Constitution did not mention the cultural identity clearly and therefore we have to develop a strong discussion within Nepal on how we can include that in it.” Indian officials and the visiting team also discussed the possibility of high-level visits and it is understood that such a visit is expected to take place soon. Mr. Deuba’s Government is meant to remain in power till Nepal holds the general election in 2022 that Mr. Mahat hinted could be advanced. “I personally want an early election and we are confident that the Nepali Congress will get a majority in the election. Taking decisions and formulating policies will be easier with our own majority,” Mr. Mahat said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/there-is-consensus-over-kalapani-ex-nepal-minister/article36935955.ece
11 October 2021||Mumbai,||3 metros witness faster COVID-19 spread: study||Mumbai’s R-value, which reflects how rapidly the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading, increased to over 1 at the end September, according to researchers at the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences. The Reproduction number or R refers to how many people an infected person infects on an average. An R-value smaller than 1 means the disease is spreading slowly. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round — technically, this is what is called the epidemic phase. The R-value of Mumbai was 0.70 between August 10 and 13. It rose to 0.95 between August 13 and 17, went up further to 1.09 between August 25 and September 18, and dropped to 0.95 between September 25 and 27. However, it again rose to 1.03 between September 28 and 30, the researchers said. The increase in the R-value of Mumbai comes at a time when the number of COVID-19 cases in the city have seen an upward trend. The city logged 629 new cases on October 6, the highest after July 14 when it had recorded 635 cases. From October 7, the first day of the nine-day Navaratri festival, the Maharashtra government allowed reopening of religious places in the State. However, Mumbai seems better placed than Kolkata and Bengaluru. The R-value of Kolkata has been over 1 since August and was 1.06 between September 29 and October 4. The R-value of Bengaluru remained close to 1 in the last month and was 1.05 between September 28 and October 1, as per the study. “If you look at these cities, you see that things aren’t that rosy. At least three of the metros (Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru) have R greater than 1 or very close to 1,” said Sitabhra Sinha, who is leading the research at the institute. Also, some cities exhibit large fluctuations. For example, Delhi had R-value greater than 1 between September 27 and 30, but less than 1 between September 30 and October 4, he said. “Things can switch very quickly from good to bad in smaller regions, because of the higher degree of variability when you are dealing with smaller populations, so it is difficult yet to say whether we are finally seeing the end game,” Mr. Sinha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-metros-witness-faster-covid-19-spread-study/article36935972.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Domestic travel takes off with festival season||The festival season is upon us and domestic travel is speeding up. Rail bookings in October have surpassed pre-COVID-19 levels, and demand for air travel too has recovered. Long queues, a crowded terminal building, machines breaking down, missed flights and frayed tempers — this is how passengers described the scenes at the Mumbai airport last week. On Sunday, passengers posted photos on social media of the Delhi airport with serpentine queues at the entrance to the airport building. Numbers tell the story behind these images. As per data from the Indian Railways, net passenger booking (reserved) in the first eight days of October this year stood at 225.95 lakh, up nearly 74% from 130 lakh bookings in the same period of 2019. The Indian Railways’ net revenues for the period under review also rose 43% to Rs. 1,066.85 crore as against Rs. 745.66 crore during the first eight days of October 2019. As on October 8, the Indian Railways was running 1,701 mail/express trains daily on an average, including holiday specials, which is only marginally behind pre-COVID-19 average of 1,768 trains. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the sole entity authorised to offer online ticket booking, has also seen average daily reservations cross 13 lakh in the first week of October as against the pre-COVID-19 average of 9 lakh reservations per day. An IRCTC official added that with the festive season beginning, the average daily figure is expected to increase to 14 lakh reservations. The official said that when the company announced the recommencement of the ‘Ramayana Yatra Train Tours’, the entire train was booked within five days. On Saturday, October 9, air travellers on domestic routes in India breached the 3-lakh mark. “October 9 saw 3,04,020 passengers, which is 71.5% of pre-COVID-19 [figures]. The last time the 3,00,000 mark was crossed was on February 28, 2021,” says Ameya Joshi, founder of the aviation analysis blog Network Thoughts. Both Delhi and Mumbai have announced their decision to reopen passenger terminal buildings they had closed because of the dip in traffic. Mumbai decided to reopen Terminal 2 from October 13 instead of October 20, and Delhi airport said it would resume flights from Terminal 1 from November 1. The government, too, recently decided to remove the limits on the fares an airline can offer if a traveller is booking a ticket more than 15 days in advance. As a result, airfares tumble if travellers book well in advance. For example, a Delhi-Bengaluru flight that costs Rs. 7,422 on October 11 is priced at Rs. 3,170 on November 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/domestic-travel-takes-off-with-festival-season/article36936169.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, China discuss disengagement||India and China held the 13th round of Corps Commander talks on Sunday at Moldo on the Chinese side with focus on working out the third phase of disengagement from patrolling Point 15 in Hot Springs as part of overall disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The talks began around 10.30 a.m. and concluded at about 7 p.m., a defence official said. The Indian side was led by the Army’s Leh based 14 Corps Commander Lt. Gen. P.G.K. Menon. Details on the outcome of talks were not immediately available. In addition to the overall disengagement and de-escalation, the two sides had also agreed to work out new protocols for patrolling to ensure such instances do not recur. Series of meetings Since the stand-off began in May last year, the two sides have held a series of talks at different levels, political, diplomatic and military, and as part of agreements reached have undertaken disengagement from both sides of Pangong Tso in February and the Patrolling Point 17 at Gogra area in August. The other friction areas that remain are Demchok and Depsang. Officials said while an agreement for resolving Hot Springs is within reach, Demchok and Depsang are legacy issues and are tough to resolve. While Demchok is one of the two mutually agreed disputed areas in Eastern Ladakh, Depsang is one of the eight friction points in the area. In Demchok where there are claims in the Charding La area, China has set up tents on this side of the Charding nala . Ahead of the talks, speaking at an event on Saturday, Army Chief Gen. Manoj Naravane highlighted the large-scale build-up as well as infrastructure development on the Chinese side. Close watch Gen. Naravane said if the People’s Liberation Army continued to stay there through the second winter, it “definitely means that we will be in a kind of Line of Control (LoC) situation though not an active LoC as is there on the western front.” He further added, “So, it means that they (China) are there to stay. We are keeping a close watch on all these developments, but if they are there to stay, we are there to stay too.”  In Demchok where there are claims in the Charding La area, China has set up tents on this side of the Charding nala .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-discuss-disengagement/article36936173.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Priyanka on the front foot in U.P.||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s Kisan Nyay (justice for farmers) rally on Sunday in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi has been the high point of a hectic political week. She was among the first few Opposition leaders who tried to reach Lakhimpur Kheri in the aftermath of the death of eight persons on October 3, and visuals of her fiercely arguing with Uttar Pradesh policemen, while being detained at Sitapur, prompted party colleagues to call it her “Indira Gandhi” moment. Appointment of Sidhu The comparison, perhaps, provided her some relief as she was being questioned for playing a key role in backing the elevation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as the president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. The move, many argued, was aimed at preventing Mr. Sidhu from walking over to the Aam Admi Party (AAP) that is gaining ground in Punjab's politics. Though the Congress says it’s a “sin” to link Lakhimpur Kheri with next year's Assembly polls in U.P., the party will certainly hope that the incident gives it a much- needed momentum on the ground. “People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP-led Opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting themselves up for a big disappointment,” election strategist Prashant Kishor tweeted on Friday, adding that the GOP [grand old party, a term for the Congress] faces “deep-rooted problems and structural issues”. “Prashant Kishor is new to politics and hasn’t seen phenomena like N.T. Rama Rao sweeping the polls within months of forming Telugu Desam Party. Just one moment can change an election,” counters senior Congress leader from Bihar, Kishore Kumar Jha. Many, including Mr. Kishor, while advising the Congress during the 2017 U.P. Assembly elections, put forward the argument of the Congress trying to reach out to Brahmins, who make up the third largest group after Jatavs and Yadavs. “It’s a reality of politics that votes are mobilised along caste lines. Along with Dalits and minorities, we need to regain the votes of the Brahmins,” adds Mr. Jha. However, a CSDS-Lokniti study of the post poll trends of the 2019 Lok Sabha found that 82% of Brahmins voted in favour of the BJP. Desertions by prominent Brahmin faces like Jitin Prasada and Laliteshpati Tripathi, have further dented the party's prospects. Once considered a 'trump card', Ms. Vadra now clearly faces a huge challenge to build the party organisation in a State where the Congress has not been a major player since 1989.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-on-the-front-foot-in-up/article36935959.ece
11 October 2021||RUGUDISAHI,||Death stalks villages in Odisha’s Keonjhar||Over the past few months, Sukurmani Munda, a 31-year-old tribal woman in Rugudisahi, a dusty hamlet near Keonjhar’s Gandhamardan mines, one of the biggest iron ore mines in Odisha, has been suffering from persistent cough and bouts of fever. A few houses away, Raibari Munda (25), too, showed similar symptoms and lost weight rapidly before she passed away a week ago. Tala Munda, a 46-year-old neighbour of Raibari, also died a couple of months ago after being “reduced to a pack of bones”. Ms. Sukurmani says she cannot sleep thinking of the terrible end that awaits her like it does other people in Rugudisahi and its neighbouring villages. In Uppar Kainsari village, 10 people have reportedly died with identical symptoms since 2020, while Salarapenth, another village close by, has seen two such deaths. Though the District Headquarters Hospital is just 15 km away, most villagers are unable to afford losing a day’s wage to travel for treatment. Big mining Near the villages, iron ore is scooped up every day by the large earth excavators of the Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) — lease holder of the Gandhamardan iron ore mines and the largest profit-making public sector undertaking in the State. But little has changed in the lives of tribals like Ms. Sukurmani who live in the area. By one conservative estimate, iron ore worth Rs. 5,000 crore has been excavated from the Gandhamardan mines in the last five years. “We survive only on pakhala (fermented rice in water) throughout the year. The only other dish that we can afford is a preparation of arum leaves,” said Ms. Sukurmani. While the land beneath their feet is a massive iron reserve, Rugudisahi’s villagers are unable to even meet basic needs. The village does not have an anganwadi . This year, six students in Rugudisahi started herding goats after dropping out of school. Iron ore dust mixes into the stream in which villagers bathe. The water is reddish brown. Pollution worries Keonjhar MLA Mohan Majhi, who visited Raibari before her death, thinks she might have succumbed to tuberculosis. “Lack of access to safe drinking water, and pollution caused by iron ore mining, are the major reasons behind people dying early. Untimely deaths have been occurring among tribal families who live around iron ore mines in the district. I had requested the district administration to send mobile health units for treating villagers, but there has been no response. People are left to die while the government exchequer is full with cash,” alleged Mr. Majhi. However, Ashok Kumar Das, Chief District Medical Officer, Keonjhar, said, “These villages have been the special focus of the district health administration. We have invariably found high liquor consumption by tribal people, which could be one of reasons behind early deaths. Due to social stigma and low awareness level, they don’t approach hospitals in the first place. After the situation worsens, they come to the hospital.” Dr. Das said a health survey was conducted in different villages but extensive prevalence of tuberculosis was ruled out. Kiran Shankar Sahu, president of the Keonjhar Citizen Forum, laments that not even a tiny fraction of the profit earned by mining companies in Keonjhar has percolated down to the district’s poorest people. “In 2017, the Supreme Court ordered the levy of fines on miners for the violation of environmental laws. Accordingly, the Rs. 17,000 crore fund of the Odisha Mineral Bearing Areas Development Corporation came into being. It was mandated that the funds should be spent on mining affected people. However, a sizeable amount of the fund is lying unutilised,” Mr. Sahu alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/death-stalks-villages-in-odishas-keonjhar/article36935966.ece
11 October 2021||Ghaziabad,||Akhilesh launches SP’s campaign for U.P. polls||Launching the Samajwadi Party’s (SP) poll campaign, party president Akhilesh Yadav said on Sunday that if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not voted out, it would “trample upon the Constitution as it has mowed down [the demands] of farmers in the last one year”. “The three farm laws came into being because the BJP won Uttar Pradesh,” he said, while addressing a massive rally in Saharanpur in western U.P. “It is not going to be an ordinary election. It will decide the destiny of the country, the future of the youth,” he emphasised. Yashpal Singh event Talking about the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, Mr. Yadav said “scriptures tell us that no arrogant ruler survived the wrath of the public”. The rally was organised in the Tintro area of the district to mark the birth centenary of the Samajwadi Party’s vice-president and prominent farmer leader Yashpal Singh, who belonged to the Gurjar community. The location assumes significance as, after the Samrat Mihir Bhoj statue controversy, the community had shown ire towards the ruling party. Mr. Yadav said the BJP government wanted to diminish the “Ganga-Jamuna identity” of the region. “I would like to thank the farmers’ movement for salvaging the syncretic character of the region despite being humiliated and called names. They have risen above the caste and religious identities,” he said. Providing a sense of the alliance in the upcoming polls, Mr. Yadav recalled how the SP joined forces with Rashtriya Lok Dal to defeat the BJP in the Kairana Lok Sabha bypoll in 2018.

11 October 2021||Kolkata,||Trinamool training its guns on Congress increasingly||After the resounding victory of the Trinamool Congress in the West Bengal Assembly polls in May 2021, the party has been trying to increase its presence in national politics. The past few weeks have seen a new trend where the top Trinamool leadership is taking on an unlikely adversary, the Congress. Despite the meeting between Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on July 28 and the Congress not fielding a candidate against Ms. Banerjee in the Bhabanipur bypolls, the political targeting is hard to miss. In the latest issue of Jago Bangla , the mouthpiece of the Trinamool Congress, Ms. Banerjee wrote an article “ Dellir Daak (Delhi Calling)”. The main thrust of the piece published on October 7 was reminding the Congress party that the Trinamool had defeated the BJP and the Congress had not. “The Congress has failed to fight the BJP in Delhi. The last two Lok Sabha elections are an example of that. Developments like this have demoralised people,” the West Bengal Chief Minister wrote. “In the recent West Bengal election, the whole country has witnessed how the Trinamool Congress defeated the BJP which came to West Bengal with all its force,” she noted. This is not the first time that the Trinamool leadership has taken on the Congress in the past few weeks. Several other pieces in Jago Bangla have targeted the grand old party. In the last week of September, a number of leaders from the Congress party in Goa joined the Trinamool. Trinamool party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said that the Trinamool has fought the BJP on the streets and advised the Congress to stop being “armchair warriors” and took to the streets. The Trinamool leadership has also targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for a remark that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh had allowed leaders of the Trinamool Congress to visit Lakhimpur Kheri while Congress leaders were stopped. The Trinamool leadership was quick to react, stating that its delegation of MPs was the first at the spot of strife and they had managed to get there by eluding the police. On its part, the Congress has said that there was not much of a difference between the BJP and the Trinamool. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury held a press conference on October 8 and accused the Trinamool of trying to “kill the Congress politically”. “Modi wants a Congress-free India and Mamata Banerjee wants a Congress-free West Bengal. We don’t find much difference between the two,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-increasingly-targeting-the-congress/article36935961.ece
11 October 2021||GUWAHATI,||Issue white paper on evictions, Assam Government urged||A minority-based organisation in Assam has asked the State Government to issue a white paper on the eviction of farmers over the past five years with all data pertaining to the displaced, land under encroachment and the area re-possessed. The Assam Civil Society also sought to know how and where the evicted people have been rehabilitated besides demanding the reopening of government-run schools and health centres in Darrang district’s Dhalpur-Gorukhuti where an eviction drive on September 23 led to clashes and the death of two persons, including a minor. “Farmers have invariably been the victims of eviction drives in Assam. The people have a right to know whether or not rules were followed during such drives, the reasons for eviction, district-wise data on the people evicted with their names and addresses and their places of domicile before allegedly encroaching upon government land,” Abdur Rahim Sheikh, society’s general secretary, said. “The government should also provide details on the land under encroachment, how the re-possessed areas have been utilised and where the evicted people go. We need data on the rehabilitation of and compensation to the evicted people, and how their families — especially the women and children — are being taken care of,” he said. Health and education The society appealed to the Government to reopen a 30-bed primary health centre and a primary school in the Dhalpur-Gorukhuti area. “Eviction notwithstanding, people cannot be denied access to health and education,” it said in a statement while expressing concern that the evicted people were not being allowed to move out of their ‘enclosure’”. The State Committee of the Students’ Federation of India too has drawn the attention of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (ASCPCR) to the blatant violation of child rights at Dhalpur. State SFI secretary Nirangkush Nath said a delegation of the federation took note of the problems faced by the children and students of Dhalpur area after the violent eviction on September 23. “More than 1,000 families were affected by the eviction drive and almost every family had at least one child. After the drive, they were left without any place to take refuge. This makes children vulnerable and severely affects their mental health,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/issue-white-paper-on-evictions-assam-govt-urged/article36935937.ece

11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Congress plans to meet President||The Congress party has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking time for a seven-member party delegation that wants to submit a “memorandum of facts” on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident that left eight people, including four farmers, dead. “Congress delegation led by @RahulGandhi has sought an appointment with @rashtrapatibhvn to present a memorandum of facts about the murder of farmers in Lakhimpur,” Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge tweeted on Sunday. “Minister Ajay Mishra and his son are being protected by BJP govt. We will not rest till we get justice for farmers,” he added while tagging general secretary (organisations) K.C. Venugopal’s letter to the President. The seven member delegation would comprise of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, A.K. Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury besides Mr. Kharge, Mr. Venugopal and Mr. Gandhi. “The shocking incident of broad day massacre of farmers has shaken the conscience of the entire nation. Even more tragic are the open warnings given by the Union Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni and the consequent trampling of farmers under a Thar Jeep owned by the Minister and his family,” Mr. Venugopal wrote in his October 9 letter. “Farmers, who were eyewitnesses, have openly stated that they were run over by vehicle being driven by the son of the Union Minister. Despite all-around protests and intervention of the Supreme Court, no decisive action has been taken either against the guilty or against the Minister,” he further added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-plans-to-meet-president/article36935957.ece
11 October 2021||Varanasi,||‘Govt. tried to save Minister’s son’||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday accused the government of the bid to save a Union minister’s son in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case and said except BJP leaders and their “billionaire friends” nobody is safe in the country. The Congress leader also attacked the Prime Minister, saying he travels across the country and abroad but did not have time to talk to farmers protesting over the Centre’s farm laws, just at a distance of 10 minutes from his residence. The PM recently visited Lucknow for an exhibition but could not reach Lakhimpur Kheri, a distance of just two hours, to wipe the tears of farmers, who gave freedom to the country, she said. “In this country, the son of the (Union) Minister of State for Home crushed farmers under his car but the government was trying to save him,” the Congress leader alleged. Nowhere in the world would the police invite a murder accused for interrogation, she said. Ms. Vadra said people should compel those in power to give justice. She also said families of aggrieved people in the State, be it from Sonbhadra (where 13 tribals were killed), Hathras or even Lakhimpur Kheri, said they do not want compensation but justice, of which they have no hope. About the farmers’ protest, she said, “Farmers are protesting against farm laws for the past 10 months and 600 of them have lost their lives.” Farmers, Dalits and women are feeling harassed, she claimed. People may belong to any caste and religion, they are not safe, the Congress leader alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-tried-to-save-ministers-son/article36935963.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||New MoD complexes designed to be eco-friendly: architects||The two new office complexes of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) that were inaugurated recently as part of the Central Vista redevelopment are state-of-the-art and energy-efficient, with comprehensive security management measures, according to the construction firm GPM Architects & Planners, which executed the project. “One of the defining features is the use of new and sustainable construction technology called LGSF [light gauge steel frame] which reduced construction time to 10 months in comparison to conventional reinforced cement concrete [RCC] construction,” GPM said, elaborating on the series of environment-friendly measures incorporated into the buildings. “A non-polluting, dry construction method is used to make its execution environmentally friendly,” it stated. The two complexes at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue constructed at a combined cost of Rs. 775 crore have a built-up area of 93,000 sq.m. and were inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. Over 7,000 employees of the MoD will soon move to the new complexes from existing hutments and old buildings around South Block and North Block. To reduce the construction time, pre-engineered structural members such as structural steel columns and beams were used, GPM said. The building facade was designed to be dynamic with the use of ventilated terracotta tiles to provide thermal comfort. “Being a low maintenance material, it provides acoustic insulation from outside which reduces noise levels up to 15%,” it stated. Terracotta facade GPM further said: “The terracotta facade reduces solar heat gain, reducing air conditioning load and saving energy by 30%. The main grid is connected to solar panels of 520 kWp capacity and the solar energy generated is used for solar-supported street lights.” Additionally, the use of occupancy sensor-based lighting systems and air conditioning systems saves unwanted wastage of electricity, reducing energy consumption, it said. A Central Public Works Department (CPWD) certified green building, the complex has large clear glazed windows to bring in natural light and air quality monitoring devices to keep the air quality in check, GPM said. The other sustainable practices incorporated are rainwater harvesting and treatment of wastewater. GPM said that part of the treated wastewater was utilised for flushing, using dual plumbing systems, and gardening, while the surplus was supplied to the New Delhi Municipal Council. GPM said an integrated command and control centre had been established for managing building operations, while also catering to the end-to-end safety and surveillance of the buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-mod-complexes-designed-to-be-eco-friendly-architects/article36935968.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. allows export of Sputnik Light||The government has permitted the export of Russia’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik Light, domestically produced here, as the jab has not yet been approved for emergency use in India, sources said on Sunday. Indian drug firm Hetero Biopharma Limited has been allowed to export 40 lakh doses of Sputnik Light to Russia, the sources said. Sputnik Light is the same as component-1 of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V, which is being used in India’s anti-COVID inoculation programme after getting emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator in April. The Russian Ambassador had urged the Indian government to allow the export of Sputnik Light produced by Hetero Biopharma, one of the partners of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) in the production of the jab, to his country. In a communication to the Centre, Russian Ambassador Nikolay Kudashev had stated that Hetero Biopharma Limited had manufactured one million doses of Component 1 of Sputnik V and two million doses of the Sputnik Light but the six-month shelf life of the vaccine could expire before its registration which would result in the wastage of vaccine doses, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-allows-export-of-sputnik-light/article36935973.ece

The searches were carried out in seven locations in Kulgam, Srinagar and Baramulla districts. Digital devices including mobiles, pen drives, data storage devices and other incriminating materials were also seized. “Investigation has revealed that Pakistan-based handlers of the LeT and their associates based in J&K had conspired to cause extensive terror activities for harming the general public. They had planned that responsibility for the terrorist acts so committed would be taken by the pseudo-acronym TRF,” the spokesman said. Earlier, three LeT terrorists were arrested in this case, the NIA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-arrests-2-militants-in-multiple-searches-in-valley/article36935940.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Farmers in east see little hope in stir||However, 10% of all foodgrains allocated under the National Food Security Act last year went to Bihar, while 7% went to West Bengal. Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are the other major States in a similar situation. Punjab accounts for a whopping 27% of all procurement, and Haryana for 11%, while only being allocated 2% and 1% of grains under PDS respectively. Madhya Pradesh, which has seen a major increase in buying by the government over the last few years, now accounts for 16% of national procurement, and only 6% of PDS allocations. States like Chhattisgarh and Odisha have a greater balance between their share of procurement and the grain allotted for PDS beneficiaries. This reality is one of the key reasons why the scale of the movement against the farm laws, which protesting unions say will ultimately destroy the system of government procurement at remunerative rates, is so much smaller in the eastern States. Different scales “In Punjab and Haryana, farmers are protesting because they are experiencing the benefits of the MSP procurement system and are fighting so that it is not snatched away from them. But in other States, those who have joined the movement are fighting to get the benefits in the first place. So definitely, we cannot expect the same scale,” said Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, pointing out that although the MSP for paddy is set at Rs. 1,868 per quintal last year, most Bihar farmers were forced to sell at Rs. 1,500 per quintal. “As long as the government is procuring at MSP rates in one place and then distributing the grains at subsidised PDS rates in another place, the prices will definitely be depressed in the second location,” said Himanshu, an economist at the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Centre for Economic Studies and Planning. However, he felt that the lack of avenues for sale in eastern States was a bigger obstacle. Infra challenges Former Agriculture Secretary Siraj Hussain, currently a senior fellow at ICRIER, pointed out the infrastructural challenges hampering procurement in eastern States. “There is a shortage of the necessary warehouses and godowns needed to store procured grain. When Bihar dismantled the APMC mandi system in 2006, they failed to create any formal substitute for the marketing system,” said Mr. Hussain who is also a former CMD of the Food Corporation of India. “BISCOMAUN [Bihar’s State Cooperative Marketing Unit] is in a very bad shape financially, so farmers don’t get paid on time. Apart from fiscal and physical infrastructure, the manpower needed is also not there,” he added. Dr. Himanshu pointed out that Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh provided positive models of what needs to be done. “They have reformed their PDS system and revitalised decentralised procurement,” he said, adding that there have been hurdles with getting the Centre to reimburse increased procurement due to bonuses offered by the States. “When grain is procured locally, it helps the local farming community get fair prices, it cuts costs of storage and transport for the government, and it provides PDS beneficiaries with the kind of local variety of food grains they are most used to. This is the ideal,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-in-east-see-little-hope-in-stir/article36935943.ece

The assurances came at a review meeting of the coal stocks at thermal power plants attended by Power Minister R.K. Singh and Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi, The Coal Ministry also said coal supplies were set to hit a ‘record high’ in 2021-22 and blamed extended monsoons for constraints in despatches from mines. Coal India, the Ministry said, was supplying more than 2.5 lakh tonnes daily to non-power industries such as steel and cement, reflecting the ‘comfortable coal position in the country’. The daily average coal requirement at power plants is about 18.5 lakh tonnes whereas the daily coal supply has been around 17.5 lakh tonnes per day. Citing the heavy rains in coal field areas, the Ministry said the CIL was now supplying over 14 lakh tonnes a day to power plants which would increase to over 16 lakh tonnes by the end of October as the rains recede. The Power Ministry said in a separate statement that domestic coal supply had sustained the power plant operations “despite heavy rains in August and September, steep hike in power demand due to economic recovery and increase in imported coal prices”. Taking special note of concerns raised by Delhi, Mr. Singh had directed that distribution companies would get ‘as much as power as requisitioned by them as per their demand’. He had directed the NTPC and the DVC to give full availability of power as per the needs of distribution companies, and advised GAIL India to provide gas from all sources to gas-based power plants in the capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/power-blackout-fears-misplaced-centre/article36935947.ece

Mr. Abdullah's close aide and former legislator Devender Singh Rana and ex-legislator Surjeet Singh Salathia submitted their resignations to party president Farooq Abdullah. “The resignations were accepted,” an NC spokesman said. These resignations have come at a time when the BJP is galvanising its support to have a Hindu Chief Minister from the Jammu province whenever the next Assembly elections are held. Mr. Rana has kept his cards close to his chest on whether he will join the BJP or cobble together an amalgam of political parties from Jammu. “I vow to pursue the Jammu declaration, a political road map emanating from Jammu, religiously and resolutely to retrieve the glorious ethos of inclusive J&K to its pristine glory again. Nothing will deter me in realising this objective,” Mr. Rana said. ‘Appeasement tactic’ He said fair play and justice should not only be the bedrock of the political system but even the perception of one being appeased at the cost of another due to politico-strategic expediency should also become an imperative of the past, in an indirect reference to the Kashmir-based parties. “The Jammu region has hugely suffered on all these counts over the decades,” he added. Mr. Rana recently met Dogra Swabhiman Sangthan chief and ex-MP Choudhary Lal Singh and former Peoples Democratic Party leader Surinder Choudhary, in an apparent bid to rope in their support too for a Jammu-centric political platform. Mr. Rana is also the brother of senior BJP leader Jitendra Singh, who serves as Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omar-abdullahs-close-aide-rana-quits-party/article36935956.ece
11 October 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Cong starts campaign against Haryana Govt.||The Haryana Congress on Saturday started a “Vipaksh Aapke Samaksh” campaign led by Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda in what it termed an attempt to capture the “pain and problem” of the people and draw the State Government’s attention towards issues concerning the public. Congress workers including several sitting and former MLAs participated in the programme at Karnal to interact with people and hear their ‘issues’ and raise them before the ruling BJP-JJP government. Farmers, labourers, traders, workers, temporary government, transporters and people from different walks of life took part. Accusing the State government of failing to address the problems of the people in their two-year rule, Mr. Hooda said as a responsible Opposition party, it was the party’s responsibility to go among the people and become its voice. “The BJP-JJP coalition government has failed to fulfil its election promises. In such a situation, no more time can be given to it which is formed for mere opportunism and selfishness. That is why the Congress Legislature Party has decided to go to the public in every district and every Assembly constituency and establish direct communication with the people. We will listen to their pain and problems and I assure the people that we will forcefully raise all their problems and issues not only on the streets but in the Assembly as well,” he said. Mr. Hooda said no section of society is happy with the coalition government — be it farmers, traders, employees, labourers, transporters etc. “It seems that the government has turned its back on the people of the State. The farmers are not getting MSP, traders are not getting their commission, labourers are not getting fair remuneration and employees are not getting pension. The government is cutting the facilities of every section. Before the formation of the BJP government, Haryana stood first in per capita income, per capita investment, employment generation and development,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-starts-campaign-against-haryana-govt/article36935946.ece

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Ramayana avatara||The first major festival that we celebrate with the birth of the New Year, according to the Hindu almanac, is Sri Rama Navami. That is the avatara day of Rama. There is a Veda vakya that says Citra Paurnami marks the mukha (commencement ) of the samvatsara (year), said Navalpakkam Vasudevachariar in a discourse. In the same way, we can say that Sri Rama Navami marks the beginning of a year of joyous festivals, which offer us a chance to give thanks to the Supreme One. The significance of the Rama avatara lies mainly in the fact, that as Rama, He showed us that adherence to dharma was of the utmost importance. He could have taken any kind of avatara. Did He not take the unusual man lion form in the Narasimha avatara? But He chose to come as a human being in the Rama avatara to show us that it is not impossible for humans to keep to the path of righteousness. It may not be an easy path. But one must not waver. Just as Rama never for a moment thought of moving away from the path of dharma, so too must we never think of moving from the path of dharma. Vedanta Desika prays that Rama, the embodiment of dharma, must keep him from doing anything that is adharmic. While it is true that Rama kept to dharma, His message would not have reached us but for Valmiki’s Ramayana. Therefore, the Ramayana is of as much importance as the hero whose story it presents. The Ramayana too is an avatara. Rama is an avatara of Lord Narayana. Likewise, Valmiki’s Ramayana is an avatara of the Vedas. Just as Rama drew everyone through His saulabhya, so does the Ramayana draw us. The Vedas are not understood by all, but the Ramayana is easier to follow. The Vedas command; but the Ramayana advises us gently, like a good friend or a beloved wife.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ramayana-avatara/article36935969.ece

11 October 2021||Pune,||PM’s ‘silence’ comes under NCP criticism||The Nationalist Congress Party on Sunday chastised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for failing to condemn the death of farmers in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh, with NCP State president Jayant Patil stating that Mr. Modi’s “continued silence” over the incident was astonishing. “He [Mr. Modi] has neither shown any remorse, nor expressed any grief, nor condemned the incident in which farmers were crushed to death,” said Mr. Patil, who is the State Water Resources Minister. Speaking in Sangli, Mr. Patil said the Centre was quick to stifle any dissent expressed by non-BJP parties of its anti-farmer policies. “If voices are raised against the government today, the Central government will unleash probe agencies. Even though there is not the slightest evidence against any of its leaders, the BJP has strained every sinew to defame the MVA government in Maharashtra,” he said. Mr. Patil claimed that when NCP supremo Sharad Pawar likened the Lakhimpur incident to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Centre promptly began investigating firms linked to or owned by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar’s kin by springing the Income Tax department in a bid to discredit him. “The Central probe agencies, be it the I-T or the ED are being guided by the BJP and a planned smear campaign is under way in the State,” alleged Mr. Patil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pms-silence-comes-under-ncp-criticism/article36935962.ece

The cases were reported from the Central Jail and the Special Jail, both in district headquarters Nagaon, about 125 km east of Guwahati. According to Atul Pator, district Joint Director of Health Services, most of the inmates had contracted the virus before they were put behind bars. “The disease in them was detected a few days ago,” he said. Officials said the patients, mostly intravenous drug users, were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. “Forty cases were detected at the Central Jail,” jailer Prabin Hazarika said, denying the possibility of those found positive infecting others. He also denied allegations that the infected inmates were getting access to drugs. Officials of the Special Jail said they detected 45 HIV positive cases. Nagaon Superintendent of Police Anand Mishra said, “The jail authorities should be vigilant about the inmates getting access to drugs. The police recently arrested a pharmacist.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/85-hiv-cases-in-2-assam-jails-in-a-month/article36935970.ece

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Majority of stormwater drains cleared||The Greater Chennai Corporation has completed desilting 98% of the 4,254 stretches of stormwater drains covering 697 km, which were identified ahead of the northeast monsoon. The civic body has cleared more than 99% of the 30,797 silt catch pits identified along 2,686 vulnerable stretches in various parts of the city by October 9, ahead of the northeast monsoon. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the civic body had started identifying additional stretches, including micro canals for desilting before October 25 in the second phase. Citizens have been requested to report waterlogging issues on helpline 1913 so that the affected stretch could be included in the second phase. Other government agencies such as the Public Works Department have stationed machinery at various locations to clear bottlenecks in canals. For instance, officials inspected Basin Bridge where machines had been stationed to clear the canal. “We have adopted two strategies ahead of the northeast monsoon. One is the desilting of stormwater drains and the second is the desilting of silt catch pits. And whatever we planned to do before October 10, we have achieved most of it. There are other drains that are on the second list. I have asked my officers to desilt them also using 1,000 workers from now till October 25. In addition to this, we are in the process of clearing the micro canals,” said Mr. Bedi. Former councillor S. Mangala Raj said the desilting of stormwater drains had been completed in his ward before the onset of monsoon this year. Geetha Ganesh of Velachery AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association said they had inundation issues on Sunday but it was the result of local residents who closed the chute pipes, claiming that there was mosquito breeding. The drains were desilted and the silt catch pits cleared. But some residents are letting sewage in the stormwater drains, clogging the drains after desilting,” said Ms. Ganesh. The construction of new culverts by government agencies such as Highways Department had not been completed on many stretches such as Poonamallee High Road, causing waterlogging in many areas. As many as 237 roads were identified as vulnerable within the core city during northeast monsoon 2019 and 2020 due to dilapidated brick and mortar drains constructed three decades ago and the presence of very few new links. Work had to be completed on many such stretches to reduce waterlogging. Sensors installed Officials said the civic body had installed flood sensors at 46 locations, flood camera at 68 locations, rain gauges at 30 locations, and environment sensors at 18 locations. The 46 flood sensors and cameras were installed at Buckingham Canal, lakes, and subways. Two rain guages have been installed at each of the zones. The 18 environmental sensors had been installed at major vulnerable locations in the 15 zones. All the sensors had been integrated with the command and control centre and officials had started getting alerts. Of the 46 flood sensors, 38 were active and two had been temporarily stopped for bridge construction and six more are to be installed after approval from PWD in lakes, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/majority-of-stormwater-drains-cleared/article36936329.ece

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC confirms life sentence imposed on man for raping mentally challenged woman||The Madras High Court has confirmed the conviction and life sentence imposed on an individual for having raped a woman suffering from moderate mental illness. The court ignored the inconsistent answers given by the victim during cross examination since it was natural for such persons to take time to grasp the questions and answer them properly. A Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and R.N. Manjula wrote: “The victim had clearly understood what had happened to her and narrated it lucidly in her examination-in-chief in a language understandable to everyone. When she was grilled during cross examination, it is quite natural for her to become nervous and pick up the questions slowly.” The judges pointed out that the victim belonged to the lower strata of the society. She was married to a person who deserted her within six months of their marriage. Since then, the woman was living at her parental home in Tiruppur district. On February 5, 2014, Sakthivel, a local resident, had taken her to a cotton godown forcibly and raped her. Penning the judgment, Justice Manjula said: “It is a pitiable case of a partially retarded woman who had been mercilessly subjected to violent sexual abuse... Though the victim was found to be moderately retarded, the doctor (prosecution witness number 10) has stated that she could understand the questions put to her but gave late replies.” Therefore, while answering questions put to her during cross examination, the victim had initially replied “yes” when she was asked whether the sexual intercourse took place with her consent and immediately replaced her answer with a “no.” Similarly, when asked whether she did not resist the occurrence, she initially said “yes” and then said “no.” “These answers of the victim cannot be taken as a serious contradiction for the simple reason of her partial retardation... Such kind of stammering or blonde moments in the evidence of a person like the victim cannot be considered as a serious or material contradiction,” the Division Bench observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-confirms-life-sentence-for-rapist/article36936346.ece

Police have appealed to public not to click on such messages and delete them immediately. One of the widely circulated message is that “YOUR MOBILE NUMBER WAS SELECTED FOR PAYMENT OF 5.7 CRORE RUPEES IN E.U DONATION 2021 TO Receive SEND/ NAME/AGE/MOBILE NO TO/Email: tavernphilips@europe.com”. Similarly, fraudsters also send messages saying that SBI Yono account would be locked and asking mobile user to click a link, which is malicious, and update PAN. Or they send messages offering part-time jobs through Flipkart or Amazon to cheat the gullible public, said the police. Bulk messages A senior police official said such messages had been sent in bulk to mobile users recently either as SMS or on WhatsApp. “Despite warning by us, people fall prey to fraudsters. Immediately on clicking those links, the data on mobile phone of the individual will be compromised. Hence, we appeal to public not to fall prey to these tactics,” he said. Police also said people should not listen to strangers who call them on the pretext of offering a gift parcel or asking advance payment for jobs or offering business opportunity abroad or investment on oil business and seeds. They have been advised to avoid such calls. Commissioner of Police Shankar Jiwal has asked people looking for alliances on matrimony sites not to send any money to prospective bride or bridegrooms who may ask for it to send gift parcel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-advise-people-to-ignore-sms-alerts-and-malicious-links-on-jobs-kyc/article36936325.ece
11 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC stays job racketeering case against Senthilbalaji||The Madras High Court has stayed all further proceedings pending against Electricity Minister V. Senthilbalaji in a case filed against him for having allegedly cheated many by promising them jobs as drivers and conductors in State Transport Corporations when he served as Transport Minister in Jayalalithaa’s cabinet between 2011 and 2015. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar granted the interim stay following a criminal revision petition preferred by the Minister. Representing the petitioner, senior counsel S. Prabakaran said a compromise had been reached between the parties and the issue had been settled amicably. Therefore, he urged the court to compound the offences. The senior counsel also brought to the notice of the court that as many as four different cases had been registered by the police with similar allegations and that two of them had already been quashed. He said the High Court had quashed one case on the basis of the compromise reached between the complainants and the accused. “This case is also of similar nature,” the counsel said and produced affidavits of 20 alleged victims of the job racket who had claimed that they had got back their money. He said those individuals were ready to appear before the court and depose that they do not want the prosecution to continue. However, some of the victims in the fourth case wanted to get impleaded in present revision petition filed by the Minister, as well as another accused in the case, and oppose the plea to compound the offences. Observing that it would be appropriate to stay the proceedings pending before the special court for trying cases against legislators until a final decision could be taken on compounding the offence, the judge granted the interim order and adjourned the Minister’s revision petition for further hearing to October 22.

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘SL refugees will lose privileges if they get involved in criminal cases’||Sri Lankan refugees can either choose to reside in any one of the 107 camps or stay as ‘out refugees’ elsewhere on their own and report to the local police station. However, they will lose these privileges if they get involved in an offence and thereafter, their only place of stay could possibly be the special camp in Tiruchi until the government decides to dislodge them, the Madras High Court has said. Justices P.N. Prakash and R.N. Manjula made the observations while dismissing ahabeas corpuspetition filed against the government’s decision to lodge Premkumar Ratnavadivel at the special camp in Tiruchi after he obtained bail in a criminal case. The judges also held that ahabeas corpuspetition could not be filed against legal detention orders passed by the government and at most only regular writ petitions could be moved. They directed the High Court Registry to bring the issue to the notice of the Chief Justice so that appropriate instructions could be issued to entertain such cases only as writ petitions to be heard by single judges of the court and not as habeas corpus petitions which were heard by Division Benches comprising two judges. The Bench also gave liberty to the petitioner to approach the government seeking dislodgement from the special camp. Earlier, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram brought it to the court’s notice that the State government pays Rs. 1,000 a month to the head of every family lodged in the 107 refugee camps. It also pays Rs. 750 a month to every family member above 12 years of age and Rs. 450 to those aged below 12. These privileges would not be extended to refugees who chose to stay on their own outside the camps. However, if the refugees get involved in criminal cases, they would be lodged in a special camp after they obtain bail. Even such foreigners would be paid Rs. 175 per day and permitted to cook their own food by obtaining a gas connection. Relatives could also visit them at the special camps. The government provides them free treatment, too, at the nearest government hospitals. Therefore, such detention could not be termed illegal, he argued. He said a joint review committee had been constituted to consider the plea of the inmates of the special camp to dislodge them and allow them to reside elsewhere. Such a committee had considered the case of Premkumar Ratnavadivel, but decided against his dislodgement from the special camp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sl-refugees-will-lose-privileges-if-they-get-involved-in-criminal-cases/article36936352.ece

In a statement, the Chennai-based NGO said that while the Tamil Nadu government was currently operationalising Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH) based on guidelines by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, there were several gaps. There was lack of interdepartmental coordination in the rescue and rehabilitation of homeless people. Also, a majority of the shelters functioning across the State lacked employment linkages, credit linkages and psycho-social rehabilitation, the organisation said stressing on the need for effective linking of various welfare measures of the State with the shelter. It pointed out that as per the Centre’s scheme, shelters that were more than five years old were not provided with the operation and maintenance costs by the urban local bodies, which made their functioning difficult. The organisation highlighted the need for quality and social audits of the shelters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngo-requests-govt-to-address-gaps-in-welfare-of-homeless-people-in-tn/article36936364.ece

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Quizzes for students of classes 3 to 5 proposed||The School Education Department has proposed to conduct short quizzes for students of classes 3 to 5 in government and aided schools, in a bid to address learning outcomes. Over the past year, while schools remained shut, lessons were telecast on Kalvi TV and resource material prepared and sent to students to ensure that learning continued. The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has prepared short quizzes which the Department has said can be sent to the heads of government and aided schools through the chief and district educational officers. These quizzes will be sent to students on WhatsApp, and teachers are being encouraged to have further discussions with students and clear any doubts they may have. For senior students, the Department has already been conducting basic quizzes every Saturday in government schools through the hi-tech labs on campus since mid-September. Some tweaks Some teachers, however, have asked for a few aspects of these quizzes to be tweaked so that they could be more effective and benefit the students more. “At present, students of classes 9 to 12 are taking up these quizzes. A schedule could be provided, detailing the lessons they would be tested on every week. They are now answering multiple-choice questions in all subjects,” said Patric Raymond, Secretary, Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers’ Federation. He said the quizzes could have more questions from their syllabus, as currently, they tackle several topics which do not feature in the syllabus. “Since the quiz is taken online, we have also asked for a larger font size in some papers as well as diagrams and charts in Tamil for students from the Tamil medium stream,” he said, adding that the Education Department had said the concerns would be addressed. Schools reopened for classes 9 to 12 on September 1, and government and aided schools have been conducting refresher courses for those students, largely featuring concepts from their previous class since schools remained shut for much of the previous academic year.

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to minor subjected to sodomy||The Madras High Court has enhanced from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh the compensation to be paid by the Tamil Nadu Government to a Class VII student who was picked up by an unknown person from a bus stand, lodged at a remote place and subjected to sodomy and unnatural sex for a week. Justices P.N. Prakash and R.N. Manjula felt that the compensation of Rs. 1 lakh, awarded by the Mahila Court in Erode, was too low. Hence, they directed the government to pay Rs. 5 lakh from either the Victim Compensation Fund or from any other State fund within 30 days. The judges also ordered that 25% of the amount be paid in cash to the father of the victim and the rest be deposited in a bank until the victim attained majority. The orders were passed while the court confirmed the conviction of, and the life sentence awarded to, the accused. According to the prosecution, the boy was waiting at a bus stand on November 17, 2016, when he was picked up by the convict in his motorcycle under the pretext of dropping him at home. The abductor locked the child in a building at a secluded place and subjected him to unnatural sex for a week. The victim escaped when the abductor was busy on a phone call. After reaching home, he narrated the events to his parents at whose instance the police altered a boy missing case into a case of abduction and invoked the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. Though counsel for the convict contended that the victim was suffering from psychiatric issues and therefore his deposition should not be taken into consideration, the judges rejected the argument and held that the victim’s statement inspired the confidence of the court and could not be rejected. Authoring the verdict, Justice Manjula wrote, “The doctor, who examined the victim, has noticed bite marks on the right leg of the child and mentioned them in the medical certificate marked as exhibit number 11...The presence of bite marks would show that he was assaulted by the accused whenever he did not cooperate for his sexual desires.” The judges said the court would have no hesitation in confirming the conviction and the life sentence since the victim’s oral testimony was of stellar quality and there was no motive that had been attributed by the victim for the prosecution to have booked a false case against him.

As many as 600 ophthalmologists, including vitreo retina postgraduates and those who had acquired an update on the latest techniques and technology of vitreo retina disorder management that are constantly evolving, participated in the international conference. Amar Agarwal, chairman of Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospitals, said the conference was envisaged to provide an opportunity to the postgraduates and general ophthalmologists to sneak a quick look on the progression in diagnostics and treatment options in the vitreo retinal speciality. Theme This year’s theme was “navigating the new normal in retinal surgery.” The sessions revolved around medical retina, surgical retina and vitreo-retinal surgery. Dr. Agarwal said: “There are about 15 million blind people in India. The retina is part of the eye which is important for the final vision. If it gets damaged, the vision is automatically affected, hence people above the age of 30 must get their retina checked regularly as retinal diseases are today the major cause of preventable blindness compared to other eye diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic macular edema.” Though retinal disease can be effectively managed on timely diagnosis, awareness about the disease is low. Also, in blindness prevention programmes, the focus is on cataracts and glaucoma. “With rapid medical advances related to retinal diseases, their management and treatment are becoming much more affordable and effective. However, India suffers from an acute shortfall of skilled experts in retinal ophthalmology. The Reticon conference aims to plug this gap by making the latest advancements and innovations available to all retinal surgeons to improve clinical outcomes,” Dr. Agarwal said. More information is available at https://reticon.in. Telanga governor and Lt. governor of Puducherry Tamilisai Soundararajan inaugurated the conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/call-to-raise-awareness-about-retinal-diseases/article36936335.ece

Geographical limits Claiming that mountains of the Western Ghats in the district were being quarried for the project, NTK’s chief coordinator Seeman, who led the protest, questioned why the Kerala government was not sourcing materials for the project by quarrying mountains in its own geographical limits. Pointing out that the project was awarded to the Adani group, he alleged that the Union government’s priority appeared to be to protect the interest of the group rather than the larger interests of the country. He said the quarrying would have severe environmental impacts, particularly on water resources. Highlighting the need to protect natural resources, he urged the Tamil Nadu government to take measures to stop quarrying activities in the district for the port project.

In a statement, Mr. Haasan pointed to reports in the media that power plants in north Chennai, Thoothukudi, Mettur have coal supplies that would last only next 4 days. Usually coal supplies are ensured for 14 days. “This has created concern among industrialists and other sections of the society as they fear that it may cause power cuts. During the last DMK regime from 2006 to 2011, agriculture, industries and medical services were severely affected and industrial cities such as Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Karur and Sivakasi were severely affected. Many companies shifted their base to other states. Such a situation should not arise again,” said Mr. Haasan. The economy was slowly recovering. If there was power shortage, Tamil Nadu would suffer a great deal, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prevent-power-cuts-kamal-urges-govt/article36936342.ece

11 October 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Minister tells Singanallur Housing Unit residents to come together for TNHB to build houses||Minister for Housing and Urban Development S. Muthusamy said he has told the residents in the Singanallur Housing Unit that they need to come together for the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) to demolish and rebuild their houses. Addressing reporters at the Unit after an inspection on Sunday, he said the residents were divided into four unions. They all should come together as one, so that it would be easier for the TNHB to take up the project of demolishing 960 houses to build new ones. Their unity was a prerequisite, he reiterated and said the TNHB had already walked the extra mile in accommodating the residents’ request though it was not necessary. It had given the residents, who were yet to clear their dues and vacated their allotted houses in the Unit, another opportunity to be eligible for the houses to be built by clearing dues. They should be paying the dues plus a simple interest on the dues. But this was applicable only for those allottees who had not sold those houses, Mr. Muthusamy added. The Department of Housing and Urban Development had received complaints that residents in Surya Nagar, Senthil Nagar, Sreenivasa Nagar and a few more localities did not have road access. He had asked the officials to look into the issue. Quality check Likewise, he had also instructed his officials to check the quality of construction in projects the TNHB had completed in the recent past and were underway. If they found deficiencies in construction, he had asked them to take the help of structural engineers to do a thorough investigation, the Minister said. The instruction regarding quality of construction was not only for officials in Coimbatore, but Chennai as well. In response to a question on alleged irregularities in allotment of houses and commercial establishments on rent, he replied that based on complaints, he had asked a senior officer to look if there were irregularities. The TNHB would soon take steps to allot to beneficiaries the houses in the apartments it had built in Kavundampalayam, the Minister said in response to a question.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-tells-singanallur-housing-unit-residents-to-come-together-for-tnhb-to-build-houses/article36936381.ece
11 October 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore airport to get larger turn pads||While the wait for overall expansion of the Coimbatore International Airport continues, more facilities are being added up by the Airport Authority of India (AAI). The airport will soon have bigger turn pads on both ends of the runway that will enable smooth turning of aircraft, especially the bigger ones. Airport Director S. Senthil Valavan said the runway already had turn pads on both ends, which would be expanded. Bigger aircraft with wide body needs larger turn pads to turn on the ends of the runway. The existing runway at the airport, that is 05 and 23, is 2,990 metres long with a width of 45 metres, he said. The runway could be expanded only if more land is acquired under the expansion project. An AAI official said that wide-body aircraft such as Boeing 777 had landed in the airport. The airport has got seven more new aprons or aircraft parking area. With this, the number of aprons at the airport has increased to 18. Mr. Senthil Valavan said that out of the new seven, five were meant for A 320 type aircraft and the remaining two for ATR type flights. He said the new aprons were added mainly to accommodate base flights that make night halts at the airport and leave for their destinations in the early hours. According to the Airport Director, three base flights are currently operational from Coimbatore to three cities namely Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. He added that the addition of new aprons may prompt airlines to operate more base flights and avail the State Government’s concession for the VAT for aviation turbine fuel for flights that operate between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-airport-to-get-larger-turn-pads/article36936377.ece

In an order dated September 30, 2021, the Ministry of Finance had increased the rate to 18 % from 12 %. S. Surulivel, president of the Association, said in a press release the hike was at the “most inopportune time, in respect of small industry suppliers.” Purchase orders The railway manufacturing organisations release purchase orders nine to 12 months in advance. Thus, orders for next year were issued last month. Cost of raw materials have increased 25 % to 40 % in the recent months and price variation clause is applicable only for basic raw materials. It does not apply for finished goods. The railway suppliers who took orders before September 2021 at the prices that prevailed then are incurring loss now. With hike in transport costs and the impact of the lockdown, the component supplying units are hit hard. These units are seeking cancellation of orders and review of prices without penalty. In such a situation, the government has increased the GST. The increased GST amount will not be reimbursed by Railways if the supplies are effected beyond the scheduled delivery date. Hence, the government should defer the increase to 18 % to next April and enable the units to complete the existing orders without incurring loss, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/railway-suppliers-seek-review-of-hike-in-gst-rate/article36936385.ece

Rajendran of Pudukkottai district. The court took note of the fact that the land where the biogas plant was being established was a vacant land belonging to the government and not a waterbody. The petitioner had said that the biogas plant would block a water course leading to an oorani. The State submitted that the biogas project was a Central government project. Establishing the plant in a vacant land belonging to the government would not affect the environment or disturb the people in the village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-nod-for-biogas-plant-at-village/article36936428.ece

11 October 2021||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||Restoration of murals at Thiruvattaru temple in limbo||The restoration and conservation of the paintings on the walls of the sanctum sanctorum of the Adikesavaperumal temple at Thiruvattaru in Kanniyakumari district is in limbo after the work was stopped following public objections. The temple, one of the 108 Vaishnava Divya Desams, is being readied for kumbabhishekam after a gap of over 400 years. The Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments has completed 80% of the work. But what comes in the way of scheduling kumbabhishekam is uncertainty over the restoration and conservation of the murals. Members of the public demanded that the colours of the paintings be brightened and complained to Aswathy Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, the princesses of Travancore. Adikesavaperumal was the principal deity of the royal family until it changed its capital from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram. “She took up the issue with HR&CE officials, and the work was stopped,” said a senior official of the Department. HR&CE Commissioner J. Kumaragurubaran, who visited the temple, assigned the task of studying the issue to K.U. Krishnakumar, principal and chief instructor of the Guruvayur Devaswom Institute of Mural Paintings. Mr. Krishnakumar, in his report submitted on September 27, certified that the restoration work, executed by Unnikrishnan, who has a vast experience in the field, was done with due care and dedication. He also certified that the work was executed as per the directions of Veeraraghavan, senior archaeologist and chemist with more than 25 years of experience in traditional mural paintings. G. Maheswari, Regional Director (South), Archaeological Survey of India, who had inspected the restoration work, rejected the demand for brightening the murals with modern colours. She said the use of modern colours would damage the murals, and the restoration work had been done in compliance with the archaeological norms. ‘Peculiar style’ Mr. Krishnakumar said in his report that the style, beauty and colour of traditional Kerala mural paintings could be witnessed at the temple. The temple murals had a peculiar style, and restoration should be done without altering it, he said. “More care should be given to the finishing styles, especially the final outlines. It is better to be done by Unnikrishnan, being an experienced artist. Due care should be taken in the facial expression, eyes, lips, body postures and mudras,” he said. Mr. Krishnakumar also suggested erection of steel rails around the walls to prevent devotees from applying sandal paste and oil on the walls. A similar arrangement could be made around the sanctum sanctorum of the Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna temple on the Adikesavaperumal temple premises. A.K. Perumal, who authored a book on the history of the temple, said the paintings were in perfect shape when experts of the Travancore Archaeology Department studied them in 1934. “When they visited again in 1938, they saw the colours fading. A chemical analysis indicated excess presence of lime in the paste used for plastering the walls,” he said in his book, citing the report of the experts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restoration-of-murals-at-thiruvattaru-temple-in-limbo/article36936363.ece
11 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Unchecked vehicular pollution a cause for concern||Unchecked pollution from vehicles, including those owned by government departments, old and condemned private vehicles, has resulted in deterioration of air quality in the city, posing a health hazard. In spite of Puducherry having over 15 emission testing centres, there are vehicles, which are too old to be roadworthy but are used here with impunity. Government vehicles, especially buses, compactors, old tempos and cars more than two decades old, have been a major source of pollution in the town. A large number of two-stroke engines continue to operate, contributing significantly to air pollution, planners say. “The vehicles have poor fuel-efficiency and release semi-combusted fumes. On Kamaraj Salai, one can spot the movement of compactors with high emission of black smoke while collecting garbage from the town,” an urban planner said. “Strangely, such vehicles continue to operate without any trouble. A majority of them do not even bother to get their emissions checked. Public transport plays an effective role in curbing pollution, and the time has come to encourage environment friendly transport systems,” he added. Officials admit that there were a number of old and condemned government vehicles that significantly contributed to the rising pollution. The vehicles are covered under Life Tax for a period of 15 years, and they turn up for Pollution Under Control  (PUC) certificates only during renewal of Fitness Certificates (FC). While government vehicles, transport and non-transport vehicles must ensure they renew their PUC certificates regularly, private vehicles go unchecked and continue to pollute the town. A number of tempos, autorickshaws and cars continued to emit black smoke, polluting the city and calling into question the relevance of emission standards, officials said. According to sources, some old two-wheelers and tempos, which are no longer in production, use adulterated fuel, making pollution levels intolerable in the town. According to T.P. Raghunath, Svarnim Puducherry, Sri Aurobindo Society, and member of the Alliance for Good Governance (AGG), “Complete breakdown of public transport system is one of the major issues. Bus services are not designed to be convenient, and many populated places are not serviced by them, forcing people to rely on private transport, which has increased vehicle density. Even the existing public transit systems are not regulated, and the buses do contribute to heavy emissions.” Public data sharing “Goods vehicles, government vehicles, tractors and trucks which pass through the town are heavy polluters, and they continue to get ‘fitness’ certificates and not undergo any emission testing. Another big polluter are vehicles of the education sector which are sometimes condemned. Vehicles are repainted and re-registered too. Monitoring air quality and public sharing of such data at multiple locations will generate public awareness and identify hotspots. The data should be shared on public web-portals as well,” he said. An official said that enforcement teams in association with the traffic police had been conducting emission checks at various places in town. However, shortage of staff was another reason for authorities being unable to check every vehicle for emissions. “Though we have taken up the issue with the higher authorities several times citing health hazards, no action has been taken yet. The government should seriously consider the emission standards of vehicles before it renews FCs. The older diesel and petrol vehicles should be phased out, and the implementation of scrappage policy alone would help tackle the rising problem of air pollution,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unchecked-vehicular-pollution-a-cause-for-concern/article36936726.ece
11 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Mental health issues on the rise due to pandemic: Lt. Governor||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Sunday called for increasing awareness on mental health issues, especially since the world has been confronted with the long-term sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic. Flagging off an awareness rally in connection with World Mental Health Day at the Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, the Lt. Governor said there was a rise in mental health problems across the world during the pandemic. While many had lost their kin, several others had become infected or were impacted by the pandemic indirectly. Calling for paying as much attention to mental fitness as physical fitness, the Lt. Governor suggested engaging in pursuits to becalm and refresh the mind alongside exercise to keep the body in shape. Ms. Soundararajan stressed the importance of family support in helping those with mental health issues overcome their problems. T. Arun, Health Secretary, G. Sriramulu, Health Director, and other officials participated. The Health Department held a seminar on the theme of the observance this year, ‘Keeping Mental Health in an Unbalanced World.’ A press note said people can utilise services of tele-counsellors or call 104 for any emergencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mental-health-issues-on-the-rise-due-to-pandemic-lt-governor/article36936440.ece
11 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Political parties against holding local body polls||As political parties close ranks in their opposition to the conduct of the local body elections in its present form and schedule, the Congress-led Secular Democratic Progressive Alliance (SDPA) called for a dawn-to-dusk bandh on Monday seeking restoration of reservation for Backward Classes (BC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in civic bodies. The State Election Commission (SEC) had, on the intervention of the Madras High Court in a petition, rescinded its 2019 poll notification order that earmarked constituencies for BC and ST sections by way of rectification of anomalies and notified afresh the conduct of elections in three phases on November 2, 7 and 13. After an urgent meeting of constituents at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office, the SDPA, comprising parties such as Congress, DMK, VCK, Left parties and the MDMK, issued the call for a bandh from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The meeting, chaired by PCC president A V Subramanian, passed a resolution calling for the bandh and flayed the “bungling” of the SEC in rescinding the reservation for BCs and STs in municipalities, commune panchayats and wards. The SDPA squarely blamed the NDA government headed by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy for plunging the whole exercise in confusion and demanded the replacement of the SEC. Meanwhile, the BJP in Puducherry demanded the postponement of the local body elections by at least two months to accommodate all-party consultation and avoid the exercise clashing with the northeast monsoon and the festive season. Addressing newsmen, V. Saminathan, BJP president, said the SEC should have held consultation with political parties and taken their views before finalising the polling schedule. He urged the SEC to reconsider the schedule as Puducherry was set to celebrate 20 festivals in as many days, including Liberation Day (November 1) and the All Soul’s Day (November 2) when Christians offer prayers to the departed. The BJP leader called for deferring the polls by two months as it would be cumbersome to go ahead within just 20 days of filing of nominations. Moreover, as the local body elections required electors to cast three votes, sufficient awareness had to be created prior to the polls. He sought the Lt. Governor’s intervention in the matter. AIADMK leader Vaiyyapuri Manikandan also took exception to the “anomaly” in the revised poll notification that deprived BCs and STs of due representation in political power at the grassroots. He urged the Lt. Governor to set right this social injustice and restore BC and ST representation. Delegation meets L-G On Saturday, an all-party delegation had called on Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan with the demand to postpone the local body polls. The delegation said the decision to conduct the poll without reservation for BCs and STs was unconstitutional and also expressed their objection to the schedule that coincided with the monsoon and festive season. They said if the polls were pushed through overlooking these concerns, the parties would be compelled to boycott them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/political-parties-in-puducherry-against-holding-local-body-polls/article36936369.ece

11 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||AICC yet to announce KPCC office-bearers||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) seemed to play a waiting game on Sunday regarding the much-anticipated announcement of the list of new Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) office-bearers. The ‘delay’ has triggered speculation that the impending nominations would reignite another bout of bitter falling out in the KPCC over reorganisation. Some insiders said a last-minute bid by the AICC to make the process rancour-free might have caused the hesitancy. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan told reporters in New Delhi that factional loyalty was not a criterion for nomination. The second phase of KPCC reorganisation entails the naming of vice presidents, general secretaries and secretaries. The 51-member panel will be the apex decision-making body of the Congress in Kerala. A party insider said emphasis was on youth and competency. Caste, communal and gender demographics had impacted the nomination process in some measure. By one account, the AICC believed that the BJP has ceased to be a disruptive force in Kerala, given its ‘severe loss’ of political ground in the 2021 Assembly elections. It sensed an opportunity to regain lost turf. The AICC has reportedly cautioned the KPCC that the party in Kerala risked locking itself out of power for another successive term if the intra-party feuding persisted. The focus should be to take the fight to the LDF camp. Nevertheless, several issues remained unaddressed. ‘Emergent group’ Congress leaders Oommen Chandy, Ramesh Chennithala, V.M. Sudheeran, and Mullappally Ramachandran had demanded that the KPCC leadership expand decision-making beyond the ‘emergent group’ purportedly centred around KPCC president K. Sudhakaran, AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal and Mr. Satheesan. Mr. Sudheeran had resigned from party posts lamenting the ‘lack of consultations.’ Several leaders who defected to the CPI(M) recently had alleged the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aicc-yet-to-announce-kpcc-office-bearers/article36936145.ece

Thanking the ASI for recommencing excavation, which was being done after 17 years, Ms. Kanimozhi said the artefacts, which were excavated from Adichanallur since 1876, would be brought back here. Officials said the artefacts were in Berlin, the UK and Chennai. “All of them would be brought back here and displayed in the iconic museum,” they added. The officials further said for the time being, the artefacts would be displayed at an onsite museum, where inscription stones would also be preserved. Surveys would be expedited and with the aid of new technology, preservation would be carried out. The iconic museum, they said, would give a different feel to the visitors as they could walk on a toughened glass over the excavation site and see the artefacts. The construction would have innovations and technology adapted to them, they added. Earlier, Collector K. Senthil Raj, ASI (Tiruchi) Superintendent P. Arun Raj and MLA Urvasi S.

11 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Jal Jeevan Mission: T.N. for reduction in State’s share to 25%, says Nehru||Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru on Sunday said the Tamil Nadu government had approached the Centre to reduce the share of States from 50% to 25% for implementing Jal Jeevan Mission scheme. Speaking to reporters after flagging off road-sweeping machines and battery-operated vehicles for garbage collection in Tiruchi city, he said the State had lined up a number of schemes promised to voters in the election manifesto. The financial mismanagement of the previous AIADMK government had weakened the financial position of the State. The current financial condition of the State would not allow it to contribute 50% for implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission schemes. Most of the States were also in the same financial situation. Hence, the Centre should contribute 75% of the project cost. As far as Tamil Nadu was concerned, it was one of the most urbanised States. The Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board (TWAD) had been meeting the water requirement of about 4.5 crore people in the State. He had taken up the demand to increase the share of the Centre from 50% to 75% for implementing drinking water schemes in urban areas. Mr. Nehru said the road-sweeping machines would be highly beneficial to tidy up the roads. Each vehicle had the capacity to clean 16,000 square metre per hour. On a four-metre wide road it could clean four km per hour and on an eight-metre wide road, it could clean two km per hour. It would improve the cleanliness of the city. Moreover, it would play a key role in removing sand accumulated on roads. Collector S. Sivarasu, Corporation Commissioner P.M.N. Mujibur Rahuman and senior officials participated in the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jal-jeevan-mission-tamil-nadu-seeks-reduction-of-state-share-to-25-minister/article36936376.ece

11 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Resume regular services on Tiruvarur-Karaikudi BG section’||Adirampattinam Rural Development Association has urged Southern Railway to resume regular express train services on Tiruvarur- Karaikudi broad gauge section before Deepavali for the benefit of travellers. Association secretary M.S. Shihabudeen and member Abdul Razak, along with Ramanathapuram MP Navas Kani, met Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas in Chennai recently and submitted a memorandum containing the plea. The memorandum said Tiruvarur- Pattukottai- Karaikudi railway line, an old route, was converted into broad gauge, and the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Bengaluru, accorded approval for operation of passenger and freight trains on the stretch more than two years ago. However, regular train services were yet to resume and the inordinate delay was causing a huge disappointment to the general public. Also, all level-crossing along the stretch were not manned. A single DEMU train, which was being operated on Tiruvarur-Karaikudi BG stretch with mobile gatekeepers on board, stopped at all gates to close and reopen them. The arrangement resulted in long travel time on the stretch and the people were frustrated due to the hardship and inconvenience posed to them, the memorandum said, adding the people had been patiently waiting for 13 long years for the operation of direct train services to Chennai. The association appealed to the Southern Railway General Manager to take immediate action for appointment of gatekeepers along the route and operation of direct express trains to Chennai. If the services were resumed before Deepavali, the passengers would be grateful to the railways. The association also urged Southern Railway to operate Karaikudi - Chennai Egmore/ Tambaram daily night express service via Pattukottai, Tiruvarur and Mayiladuthurai. It also sought operation of Rameswaram - Chennai Egmore/Tambaram daily day time express service via Karaikudi, Pattukottai, Tiruvarur and Mayiladuthurai; Tambaram - Sengottai tri-weekly service via Tiruvarur, Karaikudi and Manamadurai and Ernakulam - Velankanni bi-weekly service via Kollam, Virudhunagar, Manamadurai, Karaikudi, Pattukottai and Tiruvarur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/resume-regular-services-on-tiruvarur-karaikudi-bg-section/article36936445.ece
11 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Make Smart City Project conducive for mentally ill patients: social workers||The theme for the World Mental Health Day 2021: 'mental health in an unequal world' is quite relevant in the local context wherein the shortcomings are quite glaring, according to social workers involved in running homes for the mentally ill. While the number of people susceptible to mental illness has witnessed a rise during COVID-19 pandemic period, the services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders have been significantly disrupted, they point out. Against the backdrop of commitments made by governments at the World Health Assembly in May 2021 to scale up quality mental health services at all levels, the local administration must ideally find ways to incorporate care for the mentally ill in the Smart City Project, T.K.S. Senthil Kumar, Founder of Anbalayam Home for Mentally Ill, said. The support system for the mentally ill patients is far from adequate. Though there are many coming forward to meet the cost of food expenses for the mentally ill, there are no places where they could be given a bath. The problem is that 108 ambulances have limitations in admitting mentally ill patients with physical injuries to the hospital. The staff of 108 ambulance service insist on an attendant, which is impractical. Also there must be a special ward in government hospitals to provide psychatric care and attention for physical injuries simultaneously with police protection to ensure that the treatment course is completed. For, the mentally ill patients are prone to getting away, Mr. Senthil Kumar explained. According to psychiatrists, there must be exclusive parks for mentally ill patients with facilities for food, shelter and clothing. Not all mentally ill patients could be sheltered in closed confines for long. The wandering nature of mentally ill patients must not be viewed as unusual. Such parks would be of immense utility for integrated care, in keeping with the theme of the World Mental Health Day, they say. In a letter to the Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and School Education Minister Ambil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, Neurologist and former Vice-Principal of KAPV Government Medical College M.A. Aleem requested for inclusion of a chapter on Mental Health in the science books at higher secondary level. This is a way to prepare future generations to handle mentally ill patients with care, Dr. Aleem said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/make-smart-city-project-conducive-for-mentally-ill-patients-social-workers/article36936435.ece

Technology has come to play an important role in enhancing supply chain operations and navigating risks that are not in a company’s control, Arun Awasthy, President and Managing Director of APTIV India, said, in his inaugural address at a virtual ceremony on Saturday. Key to success Citing the instance of APTIV adapting to changing needs of industry and using key supply chain functions to identify opportunities for growth, Mr. Arun Awasthy said it was important for management professionals to stay flexible, adapt to the changing industry needs, and involving themselves in strategy and execution, which, he explained, were the key aspects of success. Director of Indian Institute of Management - Tiruchi i Pawan Kumar Singh explained with examples the link between supply chain management and human resource management. There were references to supply chain management in theBhagavad Gita. The five most important concepts in this field constitute demand, supply, revenue, cost and profit. One must must use both data and intuition when taking important decisions, Mr. Pawan Kumar Singh emphasised.

11 October 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Surge pricing as omni bus operators try to take advantage of holiday rush||Going to home towns for Dasara holidays may turn out to be the most expensive affair for commuters in the State. For, omni bus operators have hiked fares though they still claim inability to break even. This time of the year, many families either go on pilgrimage or visit relatives and friends. With COVID-19 cases on the decline and many taking the vaccination, the inclination to travel has increased. Travellers allege that the bus operators have taken advantage of the festival rush and charge the highest ticket fare ever over the last couple of years. M. Monitha, a medical college student here, who was travelling to her hometown near Chennai on Sunday, said: “We got to know of the leave on Monday only at the last minute. The tickets that usually cost Rs. 500-600 are now over Rs. 800,” she said. For her return trip, on Dasara day, the tickets are priced at Rs. 1,540, she added. “We live on student budget and cannot afford these prices.” Bus operators cite increase in fuel prices, lack of business and pending loan payments among various reasons for the spike. R. Balakrishnan, president, Tiruchi Omni Bus Operators Association, says bus owners are yet to derive utility of the holiday season. So far, there has been no enquiry or bookings for several bus operators. “People are yet to purchase tickets at normal prices; we would not sell even one ticket at inflated prices.” Many bus operators are yet to take their buses out of parking lots. Only one-fourth of the buses operated out of the omni bus stand on normal days are being plied now, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/surge-pricing-as-omni-bus-operators-try-to-take-advantage-of-holiday-rush/article36936444.ece

The validity period for the red category units has been fixed at five years; for the orange category at 10 years; and for the green category at 14. The order, issued by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Forests on Friday, follows the government’s announcement in the Assembly in September, which was part of the ease of doing business policy. But this will be subject to compliance with the conditions stipulated in environmental clearance issued under the Environment Impact Assessment notification and the ‘consent to establish’ order issued under the laws to prevent and control water and air pollution. Until now, the red category units had to get renewal of consent annually. The orange category units, too, had to get it annually until they operated the effluent treatment plant and implemented air pollution control measures satisfactorily; thereafter, they could get it once in two years. The green category units were required to have the renewal done once in two years. The official pointed out that though the Board’s rules and regulations had a provision for renewal of consent at one go for the entire validity period, it had not been implemented so far. Now, the government order has got the provision incorporated in it. The decision would be “extremely beneficial” to micro, small and medium enterprises, the official said. The categorisation of industries is based on their pollution potential and gross fixed assets. As per the latest figures, of the total 49,524 units, 12,153 are labelled red, 26,343 orange and 11,028 green. Non-polluting units are called white. They need not obtain the consent but they need to intimate the Board’s office. ( With inputs from    Dennis S.

The basement of the pole has worn out and has been in that conditon for long. The local residents have been asking for its replacement, but TANGEDCO officials are yet to take action on the complaints. The locals, on their part, have provided temporary support to the utility pole with ropes to stave off any untoward incident. The authorites concerned must desist from delaying any further in order to prevent danger to the residents. Saravanan Natesan Puthanampatti   Vaccinations against COVID-19 are safe and it is crucial for every citien to take part in immunisation camps. The vaccines have proven to be effective in reducing one’s probability of contractingthe infection. The body of a vaccinated person is better prepared to shield off more viruses by making the immune system stronger. Protecting oneself also means safeguarding others around. Rumours about the vaccine are unfounded. Getting vaccinated is safe also because one does not get seriously ill by contracting the COVID-19 virus in future. By getting fully vaccinated, people can get back to their vocations by following the standard operating procedures: wearing of mask, maintaining personal distancing, washing hands frequently, and following respiratory etiquette. M.A. Aleem Tiruchi   Frequent power outages Of have become frequent, much to the chagrin of consumers. There are fears that shortage of coal both in power-generating stations of TNEB as also private entities selling power to Tangedco could cause hassles. This was not the case six months ago. The public ought to be informed about the reasons for the failure of TNEB to address the problem. T.M. Ranganathan Srirangam   This refers to the news item 'ASI to renovate World War I memorial arch near Lalgudi', (The Hindu, October 5). It is gratifying to read that ASI has taken up renovation of the War memorial arch at Keela Valadi. There are other monuments of historical importance dating back to the Naicker period in Rockfort City lying in neglect including the wharfs at Odathurai and Thillai Nayakan Ghat that were constructed during the 17th Century. The lime mortar has given away exposing the broken brick structures and a few iron rings used to fasten the boats. These were in use until the early nineties for operating boats between Tiruchi and Srirangam as Mettur Dam was constructed only after then. The ASI would do well to preserve the two monuments of historical importance and pride for Tiruchi in right earnest. A.V. Narayanan Thillainagar   Stretches of the road on Sannathi Street near Perumal Koil and at the northern end of east agraharam at Thippirajapuram are in a deplorable condition with much water-logging in potholes. The damaged road causes a lot of inconvenience to people visiting Perumal and Siva temples. It is a pity that no effort was taken to re-lay the road for years despite umpteen appeals by the affected public. Moreover, these stretches full of the stagnated water become the breeding centre of mosquitoes, which pose a health hazard. The lack of proper drainage is one of the factors for the sorry state of affairs. The onus is on the local body to set right the road promptly in the interests of the general public visiting the two temples. R.

11 October 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Fact-finding committee visits Khanapur||A fact-finding team comprising members of some NGOs visited Khanapur and Belagavi this week to understand the murder of Arbaz Mulla, who was killed after he fell in love with a Hindu woman, and express solidarity with the victim’s family. The fact-finding team, along with some journalists, lawyers and activists, visited the family of Arbaz Mulla, Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi and Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath. The team expressed concern over the fact that the police had not made any arrests even 10 days after the incident. This is despite the fact that the victim’s mother had identified three of the accused in her complaint. “We were struck by the fact that the police had made no arrests despite a clear role played by the Hindu nationalist vigilante group Sri Ram Sene (Hindustan) in the murder,’’ the members said in a report. The police arrested 10 accused only on September 9, 11 days after the offence, the report noted. What is more shocking, the members said, is that in the eight days that had passed since the murder, the family received little solidarity from local politicians, even from non-BJP parties. The bereaved family did not get support from activists or citizens groups, including those not belonging to Hindu nationalist groups. The silence and inaction on the part of the police, the administration and politicians is what contributes to the impunity with which groups such as Sri Ram Sene (Hindustan) work, the report said. The victim’s mother, Najeema Sheikh, told the team that a few days before the murder, Pundalik alias Maharaj Mutagekar, a member of the sene, openly threatened her. He threatened her with an acid attack and warned that he could murder her son, while asserting that there were already 40 police cases against him and that he had nothing to fear, the team quoted her as saying. Mutagekar is among the 10 arrested. The District Police have said that the woman’s parents had paid money to Mutagekar and his associates to get the man killed. Talking to the family, the team understood that the family had anticipated trouble once the inter-faith love between Mulla and his neighbour became known in Khanapur. Yet there was little social and community support that they could fall upon and even considered agreeing to a settlement proposed by Mutagekar and Praveen Pujari of Sri Ram Sene with the hope that the situation did not escalate. The report said that this brings forth the helplessness of the local Muslims and Christians who have been repeatedly targeted with threats, occasional attacks and boycotts by the Sri Ram Sene over the last decade. Thus, this incident comes in the wake of sustained efforts by Hindu nationalist organisations, including the RSS and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to divide communities along religious lines and their growing political clout in the region, the report added. When asked, the Superintendent of Police said that he cannot divulge any information till the investigation is completed. Appeal for solidarity The team has appealed to all citizens to show solidarity with the family and friends of Arbaz Mulla and to demand a speedy and fair investigation and trial in the case to ensure justice and to make proactive efforts to build bridges between communities and rebuild communal harmony. The team demands that action be taken by the government to ensure such communal incidents are prevented. The team has urged the government to take steps to ensure communal harmony, including comprehensive compliance with the Supreme Court judgment in the Shakthi Vahini v Union of India case. The team consisted of Akash Bhattacharya (All India People’s Forum), Avani Chokshi (All India Lawyers Association for Justice), Nizamuddin (Fraternity Movement), Shaik Zakeer Hussain (journalist, The Cognate), Siddharth Joshi (independent researcher), Syed Junaid (activist, All India Students Association) and Tanveer Ahmed (Movement for Justice).  The team in a report points out the fact that there was little social and community support that the victim’s family could fall upon once the inter-faith love between Arbaz Mulla and the Hindu woman become known in the town||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fact-finding-committee-visits-khanapur/article36936482.ece

11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Milk trade takes a sour turn for farmers||The milk farmers of the State, who saw their income decline during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, have continued to receive unstable income this year. Since May, the milk unions across the State have reduced milk procurement prices, with Bengaluru Milk Union being the latest to cut them citing mounting losses. Since October 1, Bamul — one of the biggest milk unions in the State — has reduced the procurement cost by Rs. 1.5 a litre. A Bamul milk farmer, who was receiving Rs. 29 a litre about a year and a half ago, now gets Rs. 24.5 a litre. Across Karnataka, the procurement price ranges from Rs. 24 to Rs. 25 a litre, sources said. Since 2019, milk farmers have seen both an increase and rollback in procurement prices as the pandemic has affected the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) market adversely. “The union had no choice but to decrease procurement price in the interest of Bamul and [to] ensure continuity in payment to farmers. We have been incurring losses close to Rs. 10 crore every month since April this year,” said Bamul president Narasimhamurthy. In fact, he pointed out that the other unions had started reducing the procurement price since May this year. “Because of a shrunken market, Bamul is saddled with 8,000 tonnes of milk powder and 4,000 tonnes of butter. While the cost incurred to convert milk into a kilogram of powder is Rs. 270, the current market cost of powder is Rs. 180 per kg.” He estimated that the KMF had a stock of about 25,000 tonnes of powder and 8,000 tonnes of ghee. On the other hand, he said the State Government had refused to allow KMF to increase the sale price of milk, which is the lowest in the country at Rs. 38 a litre. In other States, the milk price ranges from Rs. 42 to 48 a litre. While the last milk price hike had been effected in 2018, the Karnataka Government has refused to allow the KMF to increase prices. “We have petitioned at least thrice. The overall cost of milk production has increased by about 35% in three years. Salary bills have gone up, petroleum price is pushing up raw material cost, and packaging cost has increased,” he said. Double whammy Amidst the tussle between the KMF and the State Government, it is the milk farmer who is suffering as a procurement price of Rs. 24.5 a litre does not even cover the production cost. It is a double whammy for farmers as recently, the cost of cattle feed too has gone up. Mr. Narasimhamurthy said, “The cost of production of a litre of milk is calculated at about Rs. 35 a litre. Including the Rs. 5 incentive given by the State Government, a milk farmer in Bamul currently gets Rs. 29.5 a litre, down from about Rs. 34.” Farmers maintain that the KMF should bring in efficiency in its management and reduce overhead charges. They have also accused the KMF of not being proactive in exploring new markets. In fact, the KMF is yet to completely capture the Bengaluru market, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/milk-trade-takes-a-sour-turn-for-farmers/article36936294.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Metro ridership touches 2.5 lakh in Oct., all-time high since July||An increasing number of people have resumed using Namma Metro services over the last few months. While the average daily ridership was 1.66 lakh in July, it crossed 2 lakh in October. “On some days, especially on Mondays, ridership increases considerably. On October 4, more than 2.5 lakh people travelled in a single day. Gradually, patronage will increase in the coming months,” said B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan, Chief PRO, Bangalore Metropolitan Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL). He added that in August, the average number of riders on both the Purple and Green lines was 1.86 lakh; it increased to 1.99 lakh in September. While the numbers point to a resumption of normal life, ridership levels are still around 50% less than what they were before COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, more than 4.15 lakh commuters were using Namma Metro services. At the time, BMRCL was generating over Rs. 1 crore per day. Currently, daily revenue is around Rs. 45 lakh per day. Nearly 8,000 passengers currently use the Kengeri metro line – which opened for commercial operations on August 30 – every day. On some days, ridership touched upto 10,000 per day. At present, trains towards Kengeri operate with a frequency of ten minutes. There has been demand by the passengers to increase the frequency of trains operated to the newly-opened line. “We are running trains keeping in mind the patronage. A sufficient number of trains are operating on the new line and for the time being there are no plans to increase the frequency of the lines,” said Mr. Chavan. Prior to opening the line, the BMRCL had estimated that the Kengeri line would benefit 75,000 people. The number is expected to increase when working professionals start to shift from work from home to work from the office. The opening of the line has helped students of various colleges located on the Mysuru Road. Prajwal, an engineering student said, “I travel from Majestic to Kengeri metro station. The extended metro has resulted in reduced travel time. The BMRCL should speed up the metro work beyond Kengeri. Opening of the line till Challaghatta will help hundreds of students studying in various colleges.”  Average daily ridership July: 1.66 lakh August: 1.86 lakh September: 1.99 lakh||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/metro-ridership-touches-25-lakh-in-oct-all-time-high-since-july/article36936277.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lobbying on for control of Bengaluru||After a spat between two senior Cabinet Ministers over the control of Bengaluru affairs, an uneasy calm prevails in the BJP camp even as intense lobbying continues. A turf war that was mostly fought behind the screens between July 2019 and July 2021 when B.S. Yediyurappa was the Chief Minister, is now out in the open, possibly bringing discomfort to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. On Saturday, as Mr. Bommai was away in Delhi, Housing Minister V. Somanna, citing his previous experience, claimed that he was the most suitable candidate to hold the post of Bengaluru in charge. He also alleged non-cooperation from Revenue Minister R. Ashok and accused him of not attending meetings convened by him. According to party insiders, the current wave of turf war has intensified after Mr. Ashok was given the mandate to monitor COVID-19 and flood situation in Bengaluru, a move that is being seen suspiciously by other leaders. It is also learnt that Mr. Ashok is also lobbying for Bengaluru district in-charge post. “This has caused anxiety among others, considering Mr. Ashok’s proximity to the Chief Minister. The four new entrants to the party and those opposed to Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp seem to be comfortable with Mr. Somanna,” party sources said. Besides Mr. Somanna, others lobbying for the portfolio, include Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan.In the absence of a leader who could become an unanimous choice to lead Bengaluru development, Mr. Yediyurappa kept the portfolio with himself to avoid embarrassments. The trend has been continued by Mr. Bommai too. Strategically, Bengaluru is important in electoral politics as it accounts for 28 constituencies of which the BJP currently holds 15. The elections to the BBMP council are expected soon. “The reading is that in the absence of the BBMP council, the Bengaluru district in charge becomes all powerful in decision making both for development works and party works, especially ahead of elections,” BJP sources said. “Mr. Ashok was an undisputed leader in the party for Bengaluru calculations till 2015. He does not enjoy that position any more since there are challengers now,” sources analysed. It is also no secret that Mr. Ashok and Mr. Somanna do not get along well. Mr. Somanna held the Bengaluru development portfolio in the J.H. Patel Cabinet in the late 90s when Mr. Ashok was a first-time legislator. However, exuding confidence that the issue will be resolved amicably, and that he was in touch with all the legislators from Bengaluru, Mr. Bommai on Sunday said, “I will solve the problem whether it is Bengaluru development or appointment of Bengaluru in charge. The decision on Bengaluru in charge will depend on the outcome of my discussions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lobbying-on-for-control-of-bengaluru/article36936283.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Judiciary should strive hard to ensure speedy delivery of justice to victims’||The High Court of Karnataka on Sunday bid farewell to two of its judges — acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and the senior-most judge, Justice Aravind Kumar — on their appointment as the Chief Justices of the Telangana and Gujarat, respectively. During the traditional farewell given on behalf of the High Court of Karnataka and the Karnataka State Bar Council, Justice Kumar said the judiciary should strive hard to ensure delivery of speedy justice and the Bar and the Bench should work in tandem to “wipe out the tears of those craving justice”. Pointing out that the dispute resolution process was undergoing fast changes, Justice Kumar, who was instrumental in conducting a mega e-Lok Adalat for the first time in Karnataka in view of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, said that an onerous responsibility lay on advocates to rise to the occasion to keep pace with globalisation and rapid developments in the fields of trade, technology, and commerce. Justice Kumar, who had been a judge in the High Court of Karnataka since June 26, 2009, also called upon the members of the legal fraternity to enlighten the litigant public to resolve disputes by adopting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to ensure that speedy justice is delivered and the confidence of litigants reposed in the judiciary is enhanced. Justice Kumar, who was also executive chairperson of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, had ensured that the highest number of cases were settled during last three mega Lok Adalats, creating national records. He also delivered several judgments, including upholding the constitutional validity of the Karnataka Land Grabbing Prohibition Act, 2011 Justice Sharma, who hails from the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, has delivered several important verdicts, including the recent verdict in the case of anointment of a minor as seer of Udupi Shiroor Mutt by declaring that there was no bar in law on minors being initiated into sanyasa. Justice Sharma said he felt “sad to leave the High Court situated in the green and sprawling lawns of Cubbon Park and the beautiful city of Bengaluru”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/judiciary-should-strive-hard-to-ensure-speedy-delivery-of-justice-to-victims/article36936292.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State keen to operate the coal mines allocated to it: Bommai||The State Government, which has sought additional coal supply from the Centre in view of coal shortage, is also looking at operating the allocated mines in Maharashtra and Odisha as early as possible, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Sunday. Speaking to reporters here, he said the matter of coal shortage was highlighted during his meeting with Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi and Minister for Environment and Forests Bhupendra Yadav. “We want to start the mines allocated to Karnataka in Chandrapura in Maharashtra and Mahanadi in Odisha as early as possible,” he said. Stating that some clearances were still required to operate the mines, he said, “To operate the mines in Chandrapura, clearance is required from the Maharashtra Forest Department. The Maharashtra PCCF has to write to the Centre. Mr. Yadav has assured us of clearances as soon as he receives the letter.” The Chief Minister pointed out that the cost of coal would come down if the Chandrapura mines became operational as transport cost would reduce. Regarding the mines in Mahanadi, Mr. Bommai said, “The mines were managed by someone else before it was allocated to Karnataka. Some clearances have already been received and we are convincing the Centre that these clearances are not required again. Mr. Yadav has promised to get the file to help the State secure these clearances.” He added that once Karnataka starts receiving supplies from these two mines, the dependence on other mines would reduce. “We want to start the mines as early as possible. Officials have been given directions to work on it.” Meanwhile, when he was asked if the duty on petroleum would be reduced in light of the high cost of petrol and diesel, he said, “The decision will be taken based on the financial condition of the state.” On the reopening of classes for students of classes I toV, he said the decision would be based on the recommendation by the expert committee concerned, which is scheduled to meet after Dasara.  To operate the mines in Chandrapura, clearance is required from the Maharashtra Forest Department. The Maharashtra PCCF has to write to the Centre.

11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CM pushes for better resources, more NIMHANS regional centres||Highlighting the need to make mental healthcare accessible to all, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai appealed to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) to expand their footprint in the State through regional centres. He said the state government would support the initiative in all ways. He was addressing the 25th Convocation of NIMHANS in the city on Sunday. Earlier at the event, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Mansukh L. Mandaviya, who is also president, NIMHANS, spoke about how resources at the premiere health institute are stretched thin. “During my morning walk on the premises on Sunday, I spoke to a few people at the X-ray centre. One of them told me he had to wait for five days to get an X-ray. You, the students passing out, must question why this man and his attendant who have travelled all the way from their village forgoing their wages, can’t get an X-ray on the same day,” he said. Responding to the issue flagged by the Union Health Minister, Mr. Bommai recounted how he could not secure a ventilator for a critically ill patient at NIMHANS recently and announced that the Karnataka Government would donate 100 ventilators in two phases. “People from all across south India come to NIMHANS and hence the resources here are limited. Why should a person wait for five days to get an X-ray? I request the director to requisition adequate X-ray machines to ensure everyone gets their X-ray reports on the same day. I also request NIMHANS to expand its footprint in the state and open regional centres, like Jayadeva and Kidwai hospitals,” he said. “We are coming out with a health vision for the state in which I will include regional centres of NIMHANS. The vision policy will stress on mental healthcare,” the CM said. He suggested NIMHANS design a dedicated course and programme to address stress faced by women. Dr. Mandaviya, who presented degrees to students, said all doctors need to work with the motto of serving the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-pushes-for-better-resources-more-nimhans-regional-centres/article36936269.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Heavy rain leads to collapse of compound wall of house and retaining wall of drain||A retaining wall of a stormwater drain at Nagarbhavi 2nd Stage, Papareddypalya, collapsed on Sunday following yet another day of heavy rain. As a result, the compound wall of a two-storey house adjoining the wall also collapsed. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) blamed the house owner for constructing the compound on the retaining wall. However, the house owner claimed that he had constructed the house as per the building plan approved by the civic body itself. While civic officials claim that there is no immediate damage to the two-storey structure, they want to issue a notice to the building owner. The jurisdictional official told The Hindu that the building owner had been asked, albeit orally, to find alternate housing arrangements until the building was deemed safe. “When we informed the owner that the building may not be safe and that a notice would be issued, he refuted the charges and said he would complain against the BBMP. He also demanded that we provide alternate arrangements. However, this may be possible only after ascertaining if the 10-year-old building has been constructed as per the approved building plan,” the official stated. 30 years old An engineer from the Stormwater Drain Department pointed out that the drain’s retaining wall is a free-standing gravity wall. It is a stone masonry construction which cannot not sustain any ‘earth or building pressure’. “It was constructed more than 30 years ago, when the area was still under the city municipal council. The building has been constructed in the buffer zone. To arrest further damage, we are placing around 50 sand bags in the area,” the engineer said. Rajarajeshwarinagar Joint Commissioner Nagaraj S. told The Hindu that that civic body would issue a notice to the building owner on Monday. “If the building owner does not evacuate the building and if any untoward incident occurs, he will be held responsible,” he said. ‘Not a rajakaluve’ Building owner Krishna P., a bank employee, claimed that the drain collapsed as a result of faulty work. “The house has been constructed on a BDA allotted site. The drain is just a rainwater drain and not a rajakaluve as is being claimed by the BBMP. If it was a rajakaluve, would the BDA have allotted the site?” he sought to know. He blamed the civic body for not maintaining the retaining wall, and stated that another portion of the wall adjoining a vacant site in the locality had also collapsed. “The BBMP should make other arrangements for us, if they are going to issue a notice,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heavy-rain-leads-to-collapse-of-compound-wall-of-house-and-retaining-wall-of-drain/article36936271.ece
11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||War of words continues between HDK and Siddaramaiah||Intensifying their verbal duel as the bypolls to the Assembly come closer, former Chief Ministers and political foes Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy continued trading barbs on Sunday. Mr. Siddaramaiah, who had saidthat the Janata Dal (S) would not get votes in Sindgi, a seat that the party held, told reporters that the regional party had lost popularity in Mandya. “If the party considers itself strong, why did it lose the Mandya seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls? It has become weak.” Even as he claimed that he had not started the war of words, Mr. Siddaramaiah said, “I do not want to speak about the JD(S). I have stopped speaking about H.D. Kumaraswamy and H.D. Deve Gowda. Let them criticise [me]. I have ignored their statements.” Responding sharply to this, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, “It seems Siddaramaiah will not get sleep if he does not criticise the JD(S). He is criticising the party that has given him political life.” In a series of tweets, he said, “My sympathies are with those daydreaming. He chants our name by stating he would not do so. It is a political necessity for him to criticise us for his survival. He has no alternative and no one respects him in the Congress, while the BJP does not care about him.” On the Mandya elections, he said, “It was a conspiracy hatched by the Congress and the party backstabbed us despite being a ruling coalition partner. It was a managed election by the Congress, BJP, Raitha Sangha, and some media outlets. Considering that loss as the party [JD(S)] becoming weak in Mandya is foolish. Like how Abhimanyu was stuck in the Chakravyuha in Mahabharatha, Nikhil (JD-S candidate in Mandya) was also stuck.” Referring to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s statement on Sindgi voters, the JD(S) leader asked, “Are the voters of Sindgi in his pocket? It is an arrogant statement and an insult to the voters of Sindgi. Now they [the Congress] are making a wasted attempt to gain sympathy over M.C. Manuguli’s death. It is a drama.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/war-of-words-continues-between-two-former-chief-ministers/article36936295.ece

The police are making all efforts to trace the missing children. In the first case reported in Bagalagunte, three Class X boys who studied in the same school, have been missing since early Saturday morning. Morning walk The police said the three 15-year-olds were friends. “The three reportedly used to go for a morning walk every day but did not return home this Saturday morning. One boy, in a note left to his parents, said that he wants to pursue Kabaddi as a career and would return home after earning fame and money. Another boy left a similar message saying he was not interested in studies, but wanted to make his mark in sports. He asked his parents not to search for him,” said the police.  In the other incident, two boys and a girl — all 12 years of age — who lived in different flats but in the same building at AGB Layout in Soladevanahalli, have been missing since Sunday morning. A 21-year-old woman, a third-year BCA student, who also lived in the same apartment is missing. They left their respective flats early in the morning without informing their parents. The parents, who searched for them till afternoon, lodged a complaint with the Soladevanahalli police. “The parents have found slips on which common items like slippers, brush, toothpaste, water bottle, cash, etc., were listed. The missing persons have also packed sports items and have taken them,” the police said.

11 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hit-and-run case: Retired HAL employee arrested||The K.R. Puram traffic police cracked a case of a hit-and-run that took place 19 days ago and arrested the motorist, a retired HAL employee, who allegedly mowed down a pedestrian near Kasturinagar on the night of September 21 and sped off. A police team, however, was able to track him down with the help of CCTV footage recovered from a photocopying and stationery shop that the motorist had visited after the accident. When the incident was reported, the K.R. Puram traffic police registered a case of hit-and-run, but there was very little evidence. Inspector Mohammed M.A. and his team analysed footage from 59 CCTVs but were unable to get the registration number of the car. “All we could get was the make of the car and direction it was heading,” said a police officer. It so happened that shortly after running over the pedestrian, the driver stopped at a store in the area to get some photocopies. While scanning the footage and seeing the make of car, the police realised that he was a likely suspect. They made photographs of his face from the CCTV footage of the shop and shared copies with LPG delivery boys and paper boys, shopkeepers and hawkers in the area, as well local informers’ circle. Their efforts paid off, when they were able to locate his address. “We issued a notice to him to appear before the police for questioning on Saturday. Sridhar meanwhile surrendered before the court and obtained bail,” the police officer added. When he appeared for questioning, he reportedly told the police that it had been raining heavily at the time of the accident and that was why he could not stop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hit-and-run-case-retired-hal-employee-arrested/article36936273.ece

Farmers are not responsible for the loss, but the government is,” the Congress leader added. On profits The former Chief Minister asked if the government-appointed managing director was not interested in the factory, how could it be expected to report profits. “When private sugar factories are profitable in Mandya and Mysuru, why is Mysugar incurring losses? I will speak to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to release adequate funds. If this is not done, we will restart the factory within one month after coming back to power,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-will-restart-mysugar-if-voted-to-power-says-siddaramaiah/article36936289.ece

Madhuswamy has said the Cabinet sub-committee on Sri Guru Dattatreya Bababudan Swamy Dargah issue will hear all the parties concerned and arrive at a decision. He told presspersons in Chikkamagaluru on Friday that the High Court had directed the State Government to come with a concrete decision after hearing all objections if any. “The sub-committee will issue a public notification calling for the petitions. We will hear all of them. People can appear before the committee and express their opinions,” he said. Several years The issue had been dragging for several years. “Much time has gone into the issue. We will entertain those who come before the committee with proof to support their arguments. If there are too many petitions, we will come to Chikkamagaluru and hear the petitions,” he said. The Karnataka High Court in its judgment on September 28 quashed the State Government’s previous order and directed the government to consider the issue afresh. Following the order, the government has constituted the sub-committee. Ministers Shashikala Jolle and S. Angara are its members. Opposed Pramod Mutalik, president of Srirama Sene, has opposed the constitution of the sub-committee. At a press conference in Chikkamagaluru on Saturday, he said the State Government should appoint a Hindu priest to the shrine, instead of dragging the issue by constituting a committee. “Instead of wasting time, the government should appoint a Hindu priest. Let those who oppose it move the court. The Hindus would not forgive the government if it did not take such a decision,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decision-on-shrine-after-hearing-all-opinions/article36936676.ece
11 October 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Santosh Hegde blasts govt.||Former Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde has criticised the State Government for not abolishing the Anti-Corruption Bureau as the party in power had assured before the elections. He was delivering a lecture on the necessity of social values on Saturday. The Congress, when in the Opposition, took out a march from Bengaluru to Ballari demanding the implementation of the Lokayukta’s report on illegal mining. The party said it would implement the report once it assumed power. It forgot the promise after coming to power. Instead, it scuttled the powers of the Lokayukta and strengthened the ACB. “The BJP while in the Opposition, promised the people that it would abolish the ACB within 24 hours of assuming power. But, they have not done it even 24 months after coming to office”, he said. Mr. Hegde said all three pillars of democracy – legislature, executive and judiciary – had become corrupt. “People have to be aware and fight against it”, he said. The programme was jointly organised by Hassan Senior Citizen’s Forum, District Advocates Association, and Hassan District Working Journalists Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/santosh-hegde-blasts-govt/article36936675.ece
11 October 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Ridges and furrows method helps protect red gram crop||Amid the vast tracts of red gram fields destroyed due to excess moisture stress caused by incessant rainfall in Kalaburagi and surrounding districts this year, here is a small field at Melkunda (B) village that stands in stark contrast. A healthy crop standing on a four-acre field owned by Channabasayya has become a place of attraction for inquisitive farmers who are visiting the field to know the reasons behind the difference. It was the ridges and furrows method of farming that made Mr. Channabasayya stand out from the crowd. Prompted by Mallanna, a farmer who had been in the forefront as far as the implementation of the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) Project in his village is concerned, he undertook the ridges and furrows method of cultivation — a method of ploughing in which ridges and furrows are formed in the field and then seeds are sown in those ridges. The project was taken up by the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) through Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Kalaburagi, under the guidance of KVK scientists “The ridges and furrows method of cultivation is a traditional method of ploughing which helps to drain the field by allowing the excess water to flow through the furrows thus, reducing excess moisture stress on plants. It is also good for dry conditions as it conserves limited water available in the ridges and reduces heat stress on plants,” Yusufali, an agronomist from KVK, Kalaburagi, who gave guidance to the farmer, said. As per official data, Kalaburagi district has already received 1,040 mm of rainfall this year to cross its annual average of 750 mm. Red gram was cultivated in 5.12 lakh hectares of land, nearly 70% of the total sown area, in the district and most of it turned yellow and wilted due to excess moisture stress. In many areas, farmers could not take up sowing due to non-stop rain that lashed for weeks. In other parts, farmers had to re-sow seeds after the failure of the first sowing just to see their second attempt also fail. “I found that this ridges and furrows method of cultivation not only protects plants from excess moisture but also protects the crop from weeds. In this method, crop management is easy and less expensive. After my success, many farmers are visiting my field and enquiring about the farming method,” Mr. Channabasayya told The Hindu , during a field visit recently. Farm scientists from KVK, Kalaburagi, are now planning to hold a field day in Mr. Channabasayya’s field for farmers in Melkunda (B) and surrounding villages to showcase the success and encourage them to take up traditional ridges and furrows cultivation method that is now done with a simple tractor-mounted implement. “The simple tractor-mounted implement used for ploughing to create ridges and furrows can also be used in the cultivation of many crops as the width between the plough-blades is adjustable. The poor availability of the implement may become a hurdle when more farmers begin to adopt the method. As a small institution, we can take up demonstrative cultivation in five to 10 acres of land. For a large scale operation, the government needs to step in. Offering incentives and subsidies on the implement can be useful in attracting farmers and popularising the method,” Raju Teggelli, senior scientist and head of KVK, Kalaburagi, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ridges-and-furrows-method-helps-protect-red-gram-crop/article36936479.ece
11 October 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Implement effectively law against cow slaughter or face the music’||Minister for Animal Husbandry Prabhu Chavan has told officials of his department to ensure that the law that prohibited cow slaughter is implemented effectively or face the music. He was chairing a Karnataka Development Programme progress review meeting at the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Kalaburagi recently. The Minister pulled up officials of the Animal Husbandry Department when they failed to explain to him the provisions of the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act 2020. The district and taluk officials could not even tell the existing provisions for punishment for killing cattle. The officers should thoroughly study and be well aware of the provisions of the law and new schemes launched by the department. Steps should be taken to prevent the slaughter of cows, he added. The Minister expressed displeasure over the decline in the number of livestock in the district. Officials said that as per the 20th Livestock Census conducted by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, there has been a sharp fall in cattle numbers though tough laws have been introduced against cow slaughter. Mr. Chavan directed officials that all stray cows in the district be shifted to goshalas. The Minister said that he had received complaints regarding the neglect by veterinary staff and that the doctors are demanding money for providing vaccine to animals. He warned the officials with such attitude that stringent action will be taken against them. Mr. Chavan also directed officials to attend to phone calls from farmers and address their issues. The veterinary doctors should compulsorily visit villages to attend to problems of farmers engaged in animal husbandry. And, “the officials should also visit goshalas twice a week and send updates to me directly via WhatsApp,” Mr. Chavan said. Later, addressing media persons, he said that Pashu Sanjeevini, ambulance service for livestock, is being emulated across the country. The Centre has sanctioned 275 veterinary ambulances for the State under the National Disease Control Programme and has sanctioned Rs. 44 crore for the Pashu Sanjeevini scheme. The Minister said that one ambulance will be assigned for each taluk. Each ambulance comprising a veterinary doctor, an assistant and a driver will go to the doorsteps of farmers to help them with veterinary issues. Mr. Chavan directed the Revenue Department to identify grazing land (gomala) to set up government-run goshalas in each district. “We need at least 50 acres to 100 acres to develop a goshala. At present, there are 188 goshalas in the State. Most of them are run by NGOs, private groups and religious mutts,” he said. Earlier, the Minister also visited a few private goshalas on the outskirts of the city. Member of Legislative Assembly Avinash Jadhav and Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Dileesh Sasi were present.

11 October 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Coal shortage impact may be felt after the rains||Though Karnataka is presently managing its power supply without load shedding, it is bound to feel the impact of coal shortage soon as none of its three State-owned thermal power stations has adequate coal stock to operate all the generating units at optimal level. While the rains have reduced demand for power, especially agricultural load, the hydel generation too stands at the optimal level presently, covering up for the coal shortage. But the present coal stock and the daily supplies are not adequate to operate all the three thermal stations at full capacity, say sources in these stations. This would mean that the State may find it a tight-rope walk to manage power supply soon after the rains stop and the demand for power shoots up. The Bellary Thermal Power Station, with an installed capacity of 1,700 MW from three units, had only 20,000 tonnes of coal as of Sunday as against its daily requirement of around 25,000 tonnes to run all the three units, according to sources in the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. The two units with an installed capacity of 500 MW each together consume around 15,000 tonnes of coal and the third unit with an installed capacity of 700 MW consumes around 10,000 tonnes a day when they function at full potential. However, only one unit with an installed capacity of 500 MW is presently operating. Fall in demand for power has been cited as reason for shutting down the two units. The station is receiving less than 15,000 tonnes of coal a day – in three rakes – which is not sufficient to run all three units even for a day. The condition is almost similar in RTPS which has an installed capacity of 1720 MW from its eight units. It needs around 24,000 tonnes of coal a day to operate all its units at full potential. According to sources, the station had a stock of around 10,000 tonnes of coal on Sunday which is not sufficient to operate all the eight units. Four of its eight units remained shut on Sunday and Unit-1 and Unit-2 were generating around 170 MW and 150 MW respectively as against their installed capacity of 210 MW each. Unit-4 was generating just around 40 MW as against its capacity of 210 MW. The exact coal stock status in Yermarus Thermal Power Station was not available. However, the condition is unlikely to be different, as the coal is supplied from the same suppliers who cater to other two stations and that the available coal is generally distributed among all the three. The YTPS, which has an installed capacity of 1600 MW from its two units, requires around 24,000 of coal a day to run both the units. It has presently shut one of its units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/impact-of-coal-shortage-may-be-felt-after-the-rains/article36936251.ece

11 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Commercial cultivation of bamboo begins||With the threat of Yellow Leaf Disease spreading to vast tracts of arecanut plantations looming large, farmers in the State’s coastal belt have now begun commercial cultivation of bamboo in a small way. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, which has taken the lead, has distributed 10,000 tissue cultured plants of bamboo from Bhatkal to Kasaragod (Kerala) in the last one year, according to sangh director and convener M.G. Sathyanarayana. Except a farmer who has cultivated them as an orchard, a majority of them have taken it up as border cultivation. The saplings have been sourced from a well recognised tissue culture institute, he told The Hindu . Mr. Sathanarayana said that the sangh took the initiative because bamboo cultivation will not only be the best alternative for farmers whose plantations have been hit by Yellow Leaf Disease, its cultivation helps maintain water table. Bamboo helps preserve rainwater. Now, there are no legal hurdles to farmers taking up commercial cultivation and sale of bamboo. Trials of using it as a source of energy are also under way, Mr. Sathyanarayana, who has planted about 250 saplings of bamboo, said. The sangh has distributed six commercially important varieties in the region. They are Bambusa balcooa (Bheema bamboo), Dendrocalamus brandisii (Burma bamboo), Bambusa nutans , Bambusa tulda (Bengal bamboo), Dendrocalamus asper (Giant bamboo or vegetable bamboo) and Dendrocalamus hamiltonii (Tama bamboo used for making furnitures). Mr. Sathyanarayana said that shoots of Dendrocalamus asper (locally called Kanile) can be harvested six times a year. It now cost Rs. 200 a kg in the local market. When commercially cultivated, by feeding fertilizers and water with weed management, the harvest can be started from the fifth year of planting. The life span of the cluster will be 30 years or the harvest can be done up to three decades. It should be well taken care in the first three years of planting, he said. “One can earn a net profit of Rs. 1.20 lakh from an acre of plantation per annum. The market price now stood at Rs. 4,000 per tonne,” he said. Vice-Chancellor of BEST Innovation University, Anantpur P. Chowdappa, said that some varieties can be harvested from three-and-half years of planting. Bamboo is best suited for coastal and Malnad regions as an alternative crop in Yellow Leaf Disease-hit arecanut plantations. Industries manufacturing incense sticks (agarbathi) require Bambusa tulda . The agarbathi industry also demands bamboo powder. In addition, there is demand for bamboo charcoal and bamboo briquettes, Mr. Chowdappa, who was formerly a director of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI), Kasaragod, Kerala. said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/commercial-cultivation-of-bamboo-begins/article36936650.ece

Rao, from Udupi district, received the Balavana Award at Balavana in Puttur on Sunday. The award is given every year by the district administration on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Shivaram Karanth. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Rao said that it is the good understanding of linguistics that enabled Shivaram Karanth to come up with so many literary works. It is important for a writer to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a language, he added. Giving away the award, Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor said that the nation has made a lot of progress since the days of Shivaram Karanath.

11 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Creating awareness on environmental issues||A moot Green Parliament aimed at raising awareness on environmental conservation as well as parliamentary proceedings among students was organised by Kudremukh Wildlife Division of the Forest Department in collaboration with Rostrum Speakers Club of Alvas Educational Institutions in Moodbidri recently. Students from seven colleges in Dakshina Kannada representing various Ministerial portfolios in Parliament discussed the issues relating to environment ranging from biodiversity conservation, road widening projects, felling trees, human-animal conflicts to the use of chemical fertilisers. The Biological Diversity Bill 2002 was passed with three amendments in Parliament. According to the Bill, a national biodiversity authority and a State biodiversity board will be constituted. Refuting the charge by Leaders of the Opposition that artificial cultivation of medicinal plants will lead to decline in medicinal values, the Health Minister said that mass cultivation using tissue culture will not only help regenerate potency but will also help retain the vast tracts of forest area intact. He said that only 25% of medicinal value will be lost in the process which is negligible. Another leader said that steps have been taken to preserve Nagabana and Devara Kaadu in their original forms instead of confining them only to ritualistic practices. Feeding wildlife became a hot topic during the session with many saying that feeding birds and animals will do more damage than good, like irregular pattern of food consumption, loss of nutrition and weakening their hunting abilities that may amount to animal cruelty. Inaugurating the programme earlier, Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty said that legislation enacted with the sole purpose of preserving forest areas without obstructing the rights of forest-dwellers should not be misused at any cost. Deputy Conservator of Forest, Kudremukh Wildlife Division, P. Ruthren said that responsible youth have a pivotal role to play in conserving environment. Presiding over the inaugural, Moodbidri MLA Umanath Kotian said that the Opposition and the ruling party should always involve in business with true concern for the people, rather just to protect their interests. Mangaluru Circle Chief Conservator of Forests Prakash Natelkar and Alvas Foundation Chairman M. Mohan Alva were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/creating-awareness-on-environmental-issues/article36936644.ece

Speaking at the inauguration of the B-SAFE centre for excellence promoted by Bharathiya Vikas Trust, Manipal, in Udupi, he said that the government should at least slash the rate for solar panels that are below 100 watt capacity. Mr. Hegde said that if solar panels and devices are made available at nominal rates, even poor people can afford to buy renewable energy devices. He pointed out that the increase in the cost of raw material used for making renewable energy devices may indirectly negatively affect the buying pattern. In his response, the Minister said that he will examine the demand and also take it up if the government policy guidelines permit him to do so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reduce-gst-on-solar-devices/article36936645.ece

11 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Success of Mysuru tourism circuit hinges on connectivity’||Stakeholders in the tourism sector in Mysuru aver that better connectivity and upgrade of the city airport holds the key for implementing the tourism circuit as announced by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai during the inauguration of Dasara last week. Former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna in his inaugural speech had called for developing a tourism circuit ahead of next year’s festivities so that it could emerge as a fulcrum to promote tourism in the State. In response, Mr. Bommai promised to discuss the issue with subject experts and stakeholders and roll out a plan before next Dasara to shore up the tourism sector. Experts in the field of tourism and travel in Mysuru say connectivity holds the key for further development and underlined the imperatives of expanding Mysuru airport. K.S. Nagapathi, retired professor who has authored books on tourism, said direct flights to other places of tourist interest and destinations were imperative if tourism potential was to be unlocked. Mr. Nagapati also argued for train connectivity from Mysuru to places of interest like Goa, Thiruvananthapuram etc. It is not enough if we focus entirely on high-end tourists. Airport is important but the existing potential for scooping more domestic tourists by providing direct connectivity to places of tourist interest should also receive priority, he added. S. Mahalingaiah, secretary, Karnataka Tourism Society, an organisation of stakeholders from tourism and hospitality bodies in the State and promoting tourism extensively, said no new circuit was required as far as Mysuru and surrounding regions were concerned. “If the government releases funds for land acquisition to pave way for airport expansion, the tourism sector will soar and will not necessitate any other intervention,” he said. Mr. Mahalingaiah, who is director of Skyway International Travels, said his interaction with tourists from other countries and States indicated that there was scope for ferrying chartered flights to Mysuru. “From wildlife to heritage, history and culture, Mysuru has everything in a radius of 80 km to 120 km and can be used as a base to cover Belur, Halebidu, Shravanabelagola, Somnathpur, Bandipur, Nagarahole, and Kodagu,” he said. Incidentally, Mr. Bommai has promised funds in the next Budget for Mysuru airport expansion which entails land acquisition for runway extension. Once extended, it will facilitate long-haul flights. The general perception is that the government should worry about larger issues of connectivity and initiating tourism-friendly policies rather than worry about circuits and providing infrastructure, which, it is argued, is best left to the investors and players in the private sector. The euphoria over the flurry of statements to promote tourism in Mysuru is also tempered by the realism that not every announcement translates into policy action. Hence, stakeholders are not going overboard about the new promises and point to the Karnataka Tourism Vision Group headed by luminaries from the corporate world and not many of its objectives have been met.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/success-of-mysuru-tourism-circuit-hinges-on-connectivity/article36936679.ece
11 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Banana workshop and expo planned||The Horticulture Department is planning to hold a banana workshop cum exhibition in Mysuru after the conclusion of the Dasara festival to promote Mysuru as a destination for the food processing industries to source their requirement of bananas. Banana has been assigned for Mysuru in “One District One Product” list approved by the Centre to promote micro-food processing enterprises. Mysuru grows a wide variety of bananas, including the Nanjangud Rasabale, a unique variety, which enjoys the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, Pacha Bale (Cavendish variety), Yelakki, and G9, besides the Nendran variety that commands a good market in neighbouring Kerala. Banana has a huge potential in the food processing industries for manufacturing a variety of snacks and other food items. The idea behind the workshop cum exhibition was to promote the bananas grown in Mysuru region among the food processing industries. “We wanted the food processing industries from across the country to come and see the variety of bananas grown in Mysuru for use as raw material in their industries,” said an official of the Horticulture Department here. Bananas are grown in about 15,000 hectares of land in Mysuru district and the annual production of the crop exceeds 1.5 lakh tonnes. A large quantity of the produce is consumed locally. For, bananas not only have a relatively short shelf life, but also grown in abundance in other tropical countries. Banana-based food However, through the workshop-cum-exhibition, the officials were exploring the prospects of use of bananas by the food processing industries and export of the banana-based food products. According to officials from the Agriculture Department, technologies were available with CFTRI, a premier food technology laboratory in Mysuru, for extraction of juice and powder from bananas. A few entrepreneurs had even undergone training at CFTRI. The entrepreneurs coming forward to set up micro food processing industries were eligible for subsidy and other forms of assistance under the Centre’s “One District One Product” scheme. Though the Horticulture Department officials were planning to hold a banana mela in Mysuru during Dasara to attract not only food processing industries and entrepreneurs from different parts of the country along with the general public, representatives of a few food processing industries preferred visiting Mysuru after the conclusion of Dasara festivities. “Since the event was not just to exhibit bananas, but to attract food processing industries to purchase bananas from Mysuru, the workshop-cum-exhibition will be held after Dasara concludes,” said an official from Horticulture Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/banana-workshop-and-expo-planned/article36936681.ece

The evening cultural programmes commenced after the dawn-to-dusk event. Though cultural programmes during Dasara are held at multiple venues, it has been confined to the palace premises this year due to the pandemic. During pre-pandemic times, as many as 120 to 130 cultural events spread over 12 venues would take place over the 10-day festival. The cultural programmes are also a tribute to the contribution of the Wadiyars of Mysore who were great patrons of art, culture and literature. There is a legacy of eminent artistes of national and international repute performing during Mysuru and this includes the veritable who’s who of the Carnatic and Hindustani genre of music, besides eminent classical dance artists. This time around, however, the organisers decided to encourage only local artists or those from Karnataka given the pandemic situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dawn-to-dusk-cultural-events-held-on-palace-premises/article36936677.ece
11 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah questions strength of JD(S) in Mandya||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday questioned the political strength of JD(S) in Mandya district by recalling the party’s loss in the last Lok Sabha elections. Speaking to reporters in Mandya, Mr. Siddaramaiah claimed that the JD(S) had become politically weak in Mandya, which is considered to be one of the party’s strongholds. “If they were strong in Mandya, why did they lose in the last elections to the Lok Sabha?” the Congress leader questioned. It may be mentioned here that Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who was the party’s candidate in the elections to Lok Sabha from Mandya, lost to Independent candidate Sumalatha Ambarish. Mr. Siddaramaiah made it a point to also mention that the Congress had not fielded its candidate in Mandya during the polls in 2019. The Congress had ceded to the seat to JD(S) as part of the seat-sharing arrangement. ‘Stopped speaking’ When his attention was drawn to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s claim that Mr. Siddaramaiah cannot sleep peacefully without criticising the JD(S), the Congress leader said he had stopped speaking about JD(S), Mr. Kumaraswamy, and their party supremo H.D.

11 October 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Illumination of roads till 10 p.m.||The roads and circles in Mysuru will be illuminated for Dasara between 6.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. till October 15. Earlier, Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) had announced that the illumination will be between 6.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. till October 13 and till 11 p.m. on October 14 and 15 on Ayudha Pooja and Vijayadashami day, respectively. However, a statement by CESC on Sunday sought to clarify that the illumination will end at 10 p.m. in view of COVID-19 regulations. As part of COVID-19 guidelines, night curfew starts at 10 p.m. The CESC had earlier decided to extend the illumination timing from 9.30 pm till 10.30 pm in view of the huge response from tourists and locals to experience the lighting, leading to traffic congestion. Several visitors and locals had even complained that they were unable to watch the illumination in view of the traffic congestion at several places in the city. Though the administration decided to celebrate Dasara in a simple and low key manner this year, the illumination of Mysuru palace, heritage structures, and other prominent landmarks, besides roads, circles, and junctions have become a huge draw with locals and visitors thronging the central business district around Mysuru palace in the evening. The open-roof Ambari, the double-decker bus, deployed by Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) recently, has received overwhelming response from the people. The Ambari begins its journey from KSTDC office before covering Deputy Commissioner’s office, Crawford Hall, Kukkarahalli Lake, University of Mysore, Folklore Museum, Ramaswamy Circle, Mysuru palace Karikal Thotti Gate, Mysuru palace Jayamarthanda Gate, Mysuru zoo, Karanji lake, Jockey’s Quarters’ circle, Snow City, Chamundi Vihar Stadium, St. Philomena’s Church, Bannimantap, and city railway station before culminating at Hotel Mayura near KSDTC office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/illumination-of-roads-till-10-pm/article36936683.ece

The MLA had written to Mr. Bommai narrating the woes of farmers in Dodda Kavalande due to lack of perennial source of water. Rainwater is the primary source of water in the region. If the village’s tanks are filled by Kabini river water, it will help in meeting the drinking water needs besides helping in irrigation, the MLA said in his letter. Mr. Harshavardhan has urged the Chief Minister to instruct the Finance Department to grant a sum of Rs. 70 crore to the Minor Irrigation Department so that the lift irrigation project could be implemented. “The Chief Minister has now asked the officials to prepare a file on this,” he said. When the rains fail, Dodda Kavalande would face a severe water scarcity, the MLA said in his memorandum. There is a significant shortage of drinking water throughout summer. The majority of the population works in agriculture. There are no industries in this area. Borewells dug as deep as 400 feet have failed to yield water, he explained. Groundwater levels in Badanavalu, Devanur, Koodlapura, Bagur, Hedathale, and the adjacent villages need to be improved.  Harshavardhan has urged the Chief Minister to instruct the Finance Department to grant a sum of Rs. 70 crore so that the lift irrigation project can be implemented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lift-irrigation-project-mla-writes-to-bommai/article36936673.ece

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Potholed roads, buildings collapsing or tilting, overflowing drains, and inundated homes... There doesn’t seem to be a day when the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the custodian of roads, drains and other civic infrastructure in Bengaluru, is not in the news. The BBMP faces a lot more scrutiny from citizens and media alike over the often crumbling civic infrastructure in the city. More so in the past few days when heavy rains have left tell-tale marks. When this reporter called a senior civic official to check about a road caving incident on Mysuru Road, the official, who was already obviously harried by other reporters, snapped, “The BBMP has now become ‘Bittige Biddiro Mahanagara Palike’… there is no end to the comments and rebuke that we face every day.” His expansion for the acronym BBMP roughly translates to “Whipping Boy Mahanagara Palike.” While the BBMP cannot run away from its responsibility as the keeper of the city’s infrastructure, one sympathises with whoever ends up answering the phone on such days.   At a time when the Congress leadership and its functioning has come under intense scrutiny, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai(in picture)has dismissed it as “part of political history”. Continuing the sarcastic tirade at a conclave by a private TV channel in New Delhi, he said, “Leaders of the party think only about history, and history suits them.” Only the Nehru-Gandhi family history was written during the Congress regime, Mr. Bommai claimed, while defending the New Educational Policy (NEP) of the BJP Government. The history of the Independence movement, authored during the “Nehru-Gandhi dynasty”, was totally silent on the contributions of many peasants, workers and soldiers who laid down their lives, he said, dubbing it “false history”. Claiming to correct this with the NEP, he said the State Government was preparing the ground to enable students to compete with their international counterparts in the 21st Century, leaving behind education “dictated by Macaulay 200 years ago”.   The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be slowly entering into the annual affairs of the Mangaluru Dasara organised by Kudroli Gokarnanatha temple. Veteran Congress leader B. Janardhana Poojary, who worked to restore the temple built by social reformer Narayana Guru, was the main architect of the Dasara celebrations earlier. With Mr. Poojary taking a back seat in organising the event because of his age and health issues over the past two years, the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) illuminated the 7-km-long route of the Shobha Yatra. BJP legislator D. Vedavyas Kamath was behind the move of the MCC, which bore the cost of illuminating the entire stretch this year. “The temple’s earnings have been hit by COVID-19. We prevailed upon the MCC to bear the cost of illumination. This act is politically significant for us,” said a district BJP office-bearer. The temple has a huge following among the electorally dominant Billava community. Harikrishna Bantwal, who switched to the BJP from the Congress and is a long-time associate of Mr. Poojary, is also member of the temple committee.  Chitra V.

Although the rain subsided on Sunday, water level remains high in the Pampa and Manimala rivers. The outer bund of the 303-acre Perumanikkary Vadakke Thollayiram paddy polder at Champakulam was breached on Sunday. The field was being prepared for the upcoming ‘puncha’ cultivation. It is the third time in as many years the outer bund of the polder was breached. As many as 450 families living around the polder are now facing inundation. The outer bund of the Thaiparambu Thekku paddy polder at Veliyanad was breached on Saturday. The breach has been plugged. Waterlogging Waterlogging has been reported from Thalavady, Edathua, Thakazhi, and Veeyapuram. Floodwaters entered a number of houses and submerged several rural roads in the region affecting vehicular movement. Floodwaters also inundated parts of the Alappuzha-Changanassery (AC) road. Heavy rain has destroyed paddy in several fields and affected the harvest of the second crop. Farmers in the region paused the preparation of fields for the ‘puncha’ season due to incessant rain. Farmers fear the rise in water level would result in bund breaches and crop loss. With more rain predicted in the coming days, officials said that they were keeping an eye on water levels in rivers in Kuttanad. Agriculture Minister P. Prasad on Sunday visited flood-affected paddy fields in Kuttanad and took stock of the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rain-several-areas-in-kuttanad-flooded/article36936550.ece

11 October 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Marayur sandalwood seeds find many takers||Marayur sandalwood is set to cross its borders. An initiative is on to distribute its seeds to Government agencies and individuals keen on planting them. Every year from October to December, seeds are collected by select members of the Vana Samrakshana Samiti (VSS) of the Marayur Sandalwood Division. “This time we hope that the demand could be met to an extent as few unripe seeds fell in August and September as the climate was favourable,” said Marayur range officer M.G. Vinodkumar. Seeds were collected from mature and healthy middle-aged trees to keep the quality, he said, adding that a kilogram of sandalwood seeds was sold at Rs. 2,000, Buyers The main buyers are government departments, including forest authorities in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. “However, we get orders from as far away as Jammu and Kashmir,” he said. Last year the quantity of seed collected was less as unripe seeds had fallen following winds, he said. Though there are nearly 56,000 sandalwood trees in the reserve, seeds are collected from only 5,000 healthy trees in the two divisions of Marayur and Kanthallur. Last year the price of a kg of seeds was Rs. 1,500. A kg consists of nearly 2,500 seeds and around 200 women are engaged in seed collection. Rs. 40 lakh last year “Last year we collected 2,630 kg of seeds and got an income of Rs. 40 lakh. This year we aim at collecting 5,000 kg of seeds,” he said. This is in addition to the sandalwood saplings developed from the seeds and supplied by the sandalwood division. “The buyer can grow the seeds anywhere,” he said, adding that climate similar to that of Marayur was the most suited. Income to tribes Marayur Divisional Forest officer B. Ranjith said the seed collection was done through participatory management and provided an income to the tribespeople. Last year, Rs. 8 lakh was given to them, giving them an income during the pandemic period, he said. The collectors will be given Rs. 400 a kg this year. A person can collect up to 4 kg of seeds in a day. Mr. Vinodkumar said that the focus was on spreading the Marayur sandalwood in other forest areas, including in other States. This would provide a good income to the tribespeople and a good revenue to the exchequer. “The massive seed collection was started two years ago though the VSS had directly sold it for many years,” he said. A percent of the revenue went to the VSS and for activities related to sandalwood protection in the two divisions, he said.  An initiative is on to distribute its seeds to Government agencies and individuals keen on planting them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/marayur-sandalwood-seeds-find-many-takers/article36936546.ece

Chief Conservator of Forests (Northern Circle) D.K. Vinod Kumar told The Hindu that endemic to the Western Ghats, the butterfly is commonly found over 1,200 metres above sea level. They were previously reported in some parts of Wayanad. Mostly found in areas north of the Palakkad Pass, Red-Eye Bushbrown is evolutionarily relevant. The life cycle of this butterfly, which lays eggs in grass, has not yet been scientifically described, he said. Mr. Kumar said the species was spotted by a team of observers comprising V.C. Balakrishnan, Girish Mohan P.K., and Rajendran T.M., and Paithalmala Eco Tourism watcher Menom Veettil Antony. Besides, the team found rare butterflies like Travancore Twilight Butterfly and Coorg Forest Hopper. V.

11 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||PWD, civic agencies face flak for damaged bridges||The deteriorating state of pothole-ridden bridges that link Kochi with its suburbs is giving commuters a nightmarish time negotiating through them. The trio of Goshree bridges built and maintained by the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) have almost always been replete with potholes and undulations. While the GIDA claims that it had done patchwork over potholes recently, the condition of approach roads to the bridges leaves much to be desired. Neither has the agency handed over the bridges and the road that links the city with Vypeen to the Public Works Department (PWD). The department had done patchwork atop the bridges over a month ago, after the GIDA requested the agency to step in with damage control following public outcry. However, rains caused delay in completing the work. The approach roads to the bridges are almost always in a shoddy state. The GIDA ought to decide whether to lay concrete paver blocks in such perennially vulnerable areas to ensure smooth and safe commute, PWD sources said. On its part, the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) has not taken steps to repair the potholed Mattancherry BOT Bridge, which links the city with the densely populated West Kochi. Nor has it handed over the structure to the PWD. Still, the department carried out patch work a few months ago. It now appears that the bridge has to be properly resurfaced. The condition of the Harbour Bridge, which is parallel to the BOT Bridge, too is far from satisfactory. Venduruthy bridge Further towards the city, gaping potholes dot approach roads to the Venduruthy Bridge as well. The PWD owns the roads. On its part, the PWD (NH Wing) is under fire for the shoddy condition of the Edappally ovebridge on NH-66, following which traffic has been moving at a snail’s pace. The agency has not ensured the upkeep of the 2-km-long Kundannoor bridge either, despite a spree of accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pwd-civic-agencies-face-flak-for-damaged-bridges/article36936557.ece
11 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Under-age drivers give road users a harrowing time||Close on the heels of the death of a 16-year-old motorbike rider at TVS Junction, Kalamassery, recently after he reportedly jumped the signal and rammed a car coming from the opposite direction, the enforcement wing (Ernakulam) of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) was in for a surprise soon, as they intercepted a 13-year-old boy, who was driving a motorbike, at Muvattupuzha. On being questioned, it turned out that he had ventured out to purchase ice cream. In yet another incident, an MVD patrol team nabbed a 17-year-old from Kalamassery recently for under-age driving. He was riding his uncle’s scooter, and claimed he was on his way to purchase milk. The parents of the accident victim were under the impression that he was sleeping in the upper floor of their house, when they were contacted over the phone to inform them of his death. The teenagers, who were intercepted by MVD personnel as part of Operation Juvenile recently, will, in all probability, have to wait till they attain 25 years to obtain driving licence. “This is apart from a case that will filed before the magistrate court against their parents/vehicle owner, who will have to, in addition, remit a fine of Rs. 25,000 and up to Rs. 10,000 fine if they don’t produce documents for age proof. They could even invite imprisonment of up to three years, while the vehicle’s registration could be suspended for one year,” said Bejoy Peter, Motor Vehicle Inspector of the enforcement wing. With under-age driving becoming common, people have begun providing tip-offs about teenagers in their area, who illegally venture into public spaces on two-wheelers and in cars. Some of them were drug addicts or involved in criminal cases. Still there were many constraints in bringing them to book, since they could end up in accidents if patrol vehicles chased them, and the public could turn against the MVD or police. Even worse, the police often arraign the driver of bigger vehicles as accused, even if accidents were caused by under-age drivers, official sources said. Under-age driving was more common in the suburbs of Ernakulam, said G. Ananthakrishnan, Enforcement RTO (Ernakulam). “Most of them involve children of NRIs and on whom parents have little control. MVD personnel face tremendous pressure when they are nabbed for the offence. Such instances are on the increase in locales like Perumbavoor and Muvattupuzha,” he said. The offence is punishable under Section 199A of the Motor Vehicles Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/under-age-drivers-give-road-users-a-harrowing-time/article36936569.ece
11 October 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Sea erosion gulps beach tourism||Unprecedented sea erosion and the subsequent dwindling of the extent of many beaches could dent beach tourism which brought in substantial number of guests from other States and countries to Kerala during the past many decades. Already, the historic Fort Kochi beach, which witnessed footprints of foreign traders and the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonialists, and was considered a must-visit destination in Central Kerala, is off the list of must-visit beaches of 2021 published by an online portal. This has been attributed to the sea now occupying what was once a prime beach attraction in the country, and also pollution. Even worse, much of the walkway tucked behind the sea wall has been damaged by the raging tides. A similar situation prevails at Kovalam, yet another beach that was a crowd-puller. Instead, Muzhipilangad and Marari have made it to the list of must-see beaches this year. Port activities Experts in oceanography and tourism enthusiasts cite man-made reasons and climate change for the state of affairs in many beaches across Kerala. “They include unscientific dredging, its disposal and other port/harbour-related activities and unplanned developments that have been occurring across the Kerala coastline through the past couple of decades,” said R. Sajeev, Associate Professor and Head of Department of Physical Oceanography, Cusat, who did an extensive survey of the State’s coast 25 years ago as part of his doctoral thesis. “The situation on the 560-km coast is entirely different now, including due to breakwater and other constructions which have toppled the delicate balance between land and the sea. Nature has a seasonal cyclic pattern whereby sediments that eroded from the coast during the monsoon returned after a few months. This is not the case now since man-made and unplanned constructions like unscientific groynes to build port/harbour hinder free movement of sediments. Development activities are inevitable from the economic point of view, but not at the cost of nature.” Very often, sea walls and other preventive measures are erected haphazardly without scientific design. In this context, a combination of measures that IIT-Madras suggested earlier this year to arrest sea erosion of Fort Kochi beach could be tried out, Mr. Sajeev said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sea-erosion-gulps-beach-tourism/article36936751.ece
11 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Discontent in MVD over appointment of ministerial staff in uniformed posts||Discontent is brewing in the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) over the practice of appointing ministerial (clerical) staff on promotion to posts that ought to be held by uniformed cadre, even if they are not technically qualified. The demand to appoint only technically qualified personnel who have also undergone the three-month police training as Motor Vehicle Inspectors (MVIs) and Joint Regional Transport Officers (RTO) has gained strength in the wake of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety stating in 2019 that only technically qualified people should be appointed in middle ranks. “A similar recommendation made by the 10th Pay Commission and yet another by the 11th Pay Commission two months ago that the 20-odd executive posts set apart for ministerial staff be identified in the administrative side [and not in executive cadre] must be implemented, from the point of view of road safety,” said A.S. Vinod, general secretary, Kerala MVD Gazetted Officers’ Association. Similarly, a Division Bench of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT) had dismissed pleas by ministerial cadre staff seeking continuance of their appointment on promotion in technical/executive posts that ought to be held by uniformed personnel, he added. Sources in the MVD said many from the ministerial cadre did not know technical terms, neither did they have technical know-how about vehicles and road safety issues. The situation is such that a technically qualified Joint RTO has to come from the nearest RTO/Sub-RTO office, to conduct heavy licence test and to issue fitness certificate for vehicles, when Joint RTOs who are promoted from the clerical cadre are deputed for such executive tasks. “Clerks and superintendents are hitherto tasked with maintaining files, office records, and other clerical tasks. It is the executive personnel who review and take a final call on files. On the contrary, ministerial staff who are posted as MVIs and Jt.RTOs have little or no technical know-how and job experience. Many committees appointed by the government have pointed out this anomaly. In addition, ministerial staff are being appointed in supervisory positions without undergoing the mandatory training,” they added. Executive personnel are appointed after passing the automobile engineering course, a year’s work experience and training akin to that imparted to police officers. Anything to the contrary has an implication on road safety, condition of vehicles, and accident prevention/mitigation measures that MVD personnel are tasked with. More so, since the reports given by the personnel are crucial to Motor Accident Claims Tribunals (MACT) deciding accident cases, they added.

11 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Four-lane flyover found feasible at Kathrikadavu||There is no need to acquire additional land to build a four-lane flyover at Kathrikadavu Junction on Thammanam-Pullepady Road, what with plenty of innovative solutions available, it has emerged. The Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB), Public Works Department (PWD), and other agencies which are associated with the proposed development of the road into a four-lane stretch with a width of 22 metres and its extension to M.G. Road and the NH Bypass, had expressed scepticism about realising the flyover at the junction, citing the need to acquire an additional 10 metres of land on either side of the junction to build service roads beside the flyover. Former DMRC chief engineer G. Keshava Chandran, who oversaw Kochi metro work and subsequently the reconstruction of the Palarivattom flyover, said a four-lane bridge and service roads could easily be accommodated within the 22-metre space. “A four-lane flyover built as per NH standards will need a total of 15 metres of width, 14 metres for the carriageway and a metre for the kerb on either side. This leaves seven metres of open space on either side of the flyover. Service roads measuring 3.5 metres each can be built on either side to ensure smooth flow of vehicles at the ground level,” he said. The busy service roads of the Ernakulam North bridge, which was widened to four-lane as part of the Kochi metro’s preparatory work, are an apt example of vehicles moving in one-way direction along service roads having similar width. Project report Official sources said the detailed project report (DPR) for widening and extension of Thammanam-Pullepady Road, which was readied by the PWD’s design wing, is ready. It does not mention the flyover, over fears that land will have to be acquired at additional width on either side of the 500-metre flyover that will have to be built at Kathrikadavu. A decision on whether to include a four-lane flyover in the DPR is awaited, they added. Stakeholders, including residents associations, had expressed fear that there would be traffic chaos at the already congested junction in the absence of a flyover to bypass the junction, when the four-lane road project is realised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/four-lane-flyover-found-feasible-at-kathrikadavu/article36936561.ece

It also reduces the carbon footprint by curtailing long-distance transportation of produce,” said Ashwin Ramachandran, co-founder and CEO. The NFT system involves circulating nutrient-rich water through food-grade UPVC pipes for a richer yield and is best suited for leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and mint and other exotic vegetables. It recycles the water facilitating water conservation while also avoiding the formation of salt deposits near the roots. “The solutions at PlantMe Agro Solutions Private Limited were developed with the help of technology and rigorous research, to allow the average city farmer to optimise their yield,” said Nithin Kumar, co-founder and COO. PlantMe’s polyhouse facilitates improved air circulation and ventilation, which, they claim, is ideal for growing fruity vegetables, thus helping farmers to replace tin-foil roofs with a better alternative to protect their crops from excess heat, cold, and pests invasions. “For years, we have been suffering because of an unbalanced lifestyle and lack of quality resources within our reach. This search for balance took us back to our roots” says Parvathy Sasikumar, co-founder of PlantMe. The start-up is also associating with NGOs for inculcating farming enthusiasm among children as a welcome diversion from the virtual world during the pandemic by bringing out kits specifically designed for them. An initiative involving 55 children from Don Bosco Kochi during the lockdown has proved to be a success. Akhila Ramdas, an M.Tech in Computer Science, is another co-founder. The start-up offers training in operating their NFT systems besides round-the-clock customer support. The products are available atwww.plantmeagro.comand delivered across India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tapping-into-a-newfound-craze-for-urban-farming/article36936553.ece
11 October 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Earth mover to be deployed for tidying up beachfront||With public ire mounting against the Kochi Corporation, Kerala Tourism, Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) and Fort Kochi Heritage Conservation Society for heaps of garbage adorning the Fort Kochi beach, tourism stakeholders have envisaged deploying an earth mover there to frequently clean what was once the prime beach in Central Kerala. This comes in the wake of the assessment that the 22 cleaning personnel deployed by the DTPC and other agencies to tidy the beach and the walkway are inadequate. “A meeting has been planned in a week’s time to finalise the proposal to permanently deploy an earth mover on the beach. This would entail a monthly expense of around Rs. 1.50 lakh, at an average rent of Rs. 5,000 per day,” tourism sources said. “It would be tough for the cash-strapped DTPC and the heritage conservation society to raise this amount, since both are autonomous bodies which function with little government support. We could deploy an earth mover twice or thrice a week, if it becomes tough to mobilise Rs. 1.50 lakh per month,” they added. Official sources said the same set of cleaning workers could be deployed for sorting biodegradable and other garbage that accumulate on the beach, following which they can be transported to respective dumping/garbage treatment yards. In addition, the heritage conservation society ought to be revamped and held responsible for cleanliness and upkeep of the entire heritage locale, to ensure its effective functioning. This is because too many agencies are currently involved in ensuring cleanliness of the locale. On different pages In the meantime, a project report submitted early this year by IIT-Madras to build an innovative sea wall on the beachfront to prevent sea erosion, which has considerably destroyed much of the beachfront, is gathering dust. This is mainly because the IIT, which had been paid Rs. 25 lakh for the study, and the Irrigation Department, which was vested with implementing the project, are on different pages on the issue, it is learnt. Encroachment Reinforcing the beach is a pre-requisite to renovating the concrete walkway that suffered extensive damage this monsoon following sea erosion. Benches and garbage bins atop the walkway too are crying for upkeep. The fear is rife that encroachers, who have already occupied much of the space beside the walkway, will occupy more areas, including tiled kiosks which were built using tourism funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/earth-mover-to-be-deployed-for-tidying-up-beachfront/article36936564.ece

Rs. 3-crore project Municipal chairperson Ajitha Thankappan said on Sunday that the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) had been entrusted with the task of preparing a plan for the development of the stadium as well as preparing an estimate for the project. According to initial estimates, the stadium project will cost about Rs. 3 crore. The project report is expected to be ready within a fortnight. It is expected that the stadium development will also take into consideration the availability of government land lying adjacent to the present stadium complex, which is now being used by football players. The decision to develop the stadium has been welcomed by Thrikkakara residents. Anil Kumar of the residents’ apex council said though the municipal authorities had been spending money on the stadium in the past, comprehensive development of the facility had not taken place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thrikkakara-municipality-to-develop-stadium-infra/article36936562.ece

11 October 2021||Kollam,KERALA||Verdict in Uthra murder case to be pronounced today||When Uthra, a 25-year-old differently-abled woman, was found dead due to snakebite, there were murmurs about a ‘sarppa kopam’ among locals. The young homemaker had sustained a near-fatal bite on March 2, 2020 and her life was claimed by another snake on May 7, while she was recovering from the initial attack. She was first bitten by a viper and then a cobra, the two incidents separated by nearly nine weeks. Uthra was found dead at her home in Anchal and the cobra that killed her was also spotted there. But her family was not ready to dismiss the incident as a natural snakebite death and alleged foul play. A police investigation followed, and the chargesheet gave details of a conspiracy, pointing to a murder painstakingly planned and executed by her husband Sooraj. Sooraj was arrested on May 24, along with Suresh, a Kalluvathukkal resident who helped him procure both the snakes. The handler, who later turned approver, said he sold the snakes for Rs. 10,000. As per her family, Uthra had been facing harassment from her husband and his family.  1,000-page chargesheet Kollam Crime Branch (Rural Police) had filed a 1,000-page chargesheet in the case before Punalur Chief Judicial Magistrate Court on August 14. While Dy.SP A. Ashokan led the investigation, G. Mohanraj was appointed the special prosecutor. A first-of-its-kind case in Kerala, the prosecution went for strong scientific and circumstantial evidence during the trial. The Kollam Additional Sessions Court will pronounce the verdict in the case on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/verdict-in-uthra-murder-case-to-be-pronounced-today/article36936614.ece

11 October 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||End in sight to administrative deadlock in Erattupetta||After weeks of indecision and political blame game, the administrative impasse in the Erattupetta municipality appears to be clearing up. As the municipal council meets on Monday to elect its new chairperson, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has decided to abstain from the election to keep its word of not holding onto power with the support of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). The move, in turn, is expected to help the United Democratic Front to take control of the civic body once again. The UDF, on its part, has decided to field IUML councillor Suhra Abdul Khader, who was ousted through a no-confidence motion last month, as its chairperson candidate. In the 28-member council, the coalition now has 13 members, excluding a rebel; the LDF has nine members and the SDPI five members. The LDF had earlier planned to field Ansalana Pareekkutty, the Congress rebel as the chairperson candidate. In case of her winning the election with the support of the SDPI, the coalition could claim that it merely supported a Congress rebel. But with the UDF successfully raising the pitch of an unholy nexus between the CPI(M) and the SDPI, which had a State-wide resonance against the backdrop of the narcotic jihad controversy, the LDF was forced to drop the plan. Senior CPI(M) leader and Minister V.N. Vasavan and KC (M) legislator Sebastian Kulathungal came out in the open, dismissing any links with the SDPI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/end-in-sight-to-administrative-deadlock-in-erattupetta/article36936615.ece

11 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||SilverLine will be a heavy burden: Prashant Bhushan||The proposed Thiruvananthapuram-Kasaragod semi high-speed rail (SilverLine) is going to become a financial albatross around the neck of Kerala, noted lawyer Prashant Bhushan has said. Speaking at an ongoing satyagraha against the project at Kattilpeedika, near Koyilandy in Kozhikode district on Sunday, he said that it would become a white elephant, which the people would continue to pay for decades altogether. Mr. Bhushan said that Alok Varma, former Chief Engineer, Indian Railways, had told him that this project would break the backbone of Kerala. New alignment The high-speed line from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram had been conceived as a stand-alone standard gauge line, which would have a completely new alignment, different from the alignment of the normal rail lines. It would involve several tunnels and bridges that cut through the fragile mountainous terrain of Kerala. It would involve acquisition of 1,000 ha of land, which would destroy the ecosystem of the State, which is prone to landslips and floods. An illusion The so-called interest-free loan from Japan was also an illusion and nonsense, he said. “The loan would have to be repaid in Japanese currency, Yen. Because there is zero inflation in Japan and at least 7-8% inflation in India, the price of Yen appreciates by 7-8% every year against the rupee. Eventually, we will be paying an interest of at least 7-8% on this loan,” Mr. Bhushan said. “There is absolutely no reason why this project should be built on standard gauge and not on broad gauge. The cost is projected as Rs. 75,000 crore by the government, but agencies such as NITI Ayog say that it may cost well over Rs. 1 lakh crore. For a 500-km stand-alone line, it is financially non-viable,” he said. Since the railway stations would be far away from cities, only a few well-to-do people would be able to travel by it. This project is not going to serve the common people, Mr. Bhushan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/silverline-will-be-a-financial-albatross-around-keralas-neck/article36936539.ece
11 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Protest against Poraali granite quarry intensifies||The public protest in Kayanna panchayat demanding the closure of the Poraali granite quarry is gaining strength, with the relay strike organised by the anti-quarry protest committee completing 30 days on Monday. The committee had recently held a march to the panchayat office raising the issue as part of the different modes of protests planned here. The Poraali quarry that started functioning in 2018 had been shut down after a few months following the stop memo served by the panchayat upon public demand. The major problem was the tremor experienced in the region whenever there was an explosion in the quarry. As a result, cracks started developing on the walls of the houses in the area, of a nearby church and a newly constructed school building. “Children jerk awake from their sleep and start crying when there is an explosion. There are cracks on around 45 houses here,” said Iype Vadakkethadam, chairman of the protest committee. Kattullamala The Porali quarry is located in the valley of Kattullamala, a hillock which is mostly dense forest with a lot of rocks. “The granite is not visible on the surface. They had to dug up to five metres to expose the rock,” Mr. Iype said. The quarry resumed operation a few months ago after the panchayat council passed a report favouring it. “The quarry owners had greased enough hands to obtain that report in their favour,” Mr. Iype alleged. The protest committee had appealed to the District Collector demanding a study on the feasibility of the quarry. The Collector had ordered the tahsildar and the Mining and Geology Department to conduct the study. The tahsildar’s report clearly stated that the cracks on the buildings were the result of the explosions in the quarry. However, the Mining and Geology Department’s report is yet to be released. “This is a matter of our existence. There are around 50 houses on the hill that are affected by this explosion. In case there is a landslip, around 250 houses in the valley will be buried in mud,” Mr. Iype said. The protest committee also fears there could be water shortage in the region in the near future, as a wetland down the hill is slowly getting filled with residue from the quarry. They are determined to continue protest until a stop memo is served on the quarry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protest-against-poraali-granite-quarry-intensifies/article36936529.ece

Barefoot Monsoon, a consultancy based in Sydney, Australia, has reached out to the municipality, as part of extending its activities to Kerala. Miswin Mahesh, a representative of the consultancy, visited Vadakara on Saturday to assess its progress in the sector. Barefoot Monsoon manages the funds of 25 multinational companies, which they spend as part of their Extended Social Responsibility. It is in India as part of a worldwide initiative to assist third world countries in maintaining a circular economy and reducing plastic pollution in the ocean, thus protecting several species from extinction. “The consultancy is planning to implement several schemes in Vadakara, quite similar to what they have implemented in Indonesia. They have been in touch with the State government before coming to Vadakara,” said Manalil Mohanan, coordinator of the Haritha Karma Sena in Vadakara. User fee to be paid As a first step, the consultancy will pay the user fee to Haritha Karma Sena for low-income families in the municipality who cannot afford it. Other projects Providing electric vehicles to the Haritha Karma Sena to ease the door-to-door waste collection, mechanised segregation of plastic, indoor mobility vehicles at the material recovery facility and eco-friendly waste collection bags for each house and establishment to segregate waste at source are the other projects that may be implemented. Mr. Miswin will prepare a project report in three months and make the corporate funding available eventually. Municipal Chairperson K.P.

He said the coal shortage had begun to affect the power supply in Kerala too. Mr. Krishnankutty said here on Sunday that the State was not getting the 1,000 MW of power due for it from the central pool because of the coal shortage. “I do not think the coal shortage could be addressed very soon,” he added. The Minister said that the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) would have no choice but to go for power cut in the wake of the continuing coal shortage. Mr. Krishnankutty said that the KSEB was closely monitoring the situation arising out of the coal shortage. He asked the people to control the use of power in view of the shortage. According to him, power generation from hydel projects will be the only way out. He said the State had bought power the other day by paying Rs. 18 a unit. “This is causing a huge burden on the KSEB,” he said. The Minister, however, said that the State’s power consumption had come down considerably because of the monsoon season. If the shortage continues into the summer, then the State will have to face a real crisis in power supply, he warned. Mr. Krishnankutty also said that the load shedding would be implemented in such a way as not to affect the industrial sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/load-shedding-likely-to-be-imposed-says-power-minister/article36936616.ece
11 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Engineering colleges weather pandemic-induced crisis||Managing to stay afloat amid the pandemic-induced crisis, engineering colleges in the State have survived a second year on the trot without any closure. Buoyed by an encouraging campus placement trend, the college managements also anticipate a change in fortunes with an increase in student enrolment this year. With the admission process for BTech courses under way, APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) is yet to receive any closure requests from self-financing colleges. While a private institution in Kottayam had reported the possibility of property attachment owing to loan default, the management has been confident its students would remain unaffected, sources said. Even while it has been witnessing a scenario of over 17,000 seats going unfilled in self-financing colleges for many years, the State has been able to arrest a slide in the number of engineering colleges for the past two years. While there were 161 engineering colleges in the State in 2014, KTU currently has 145 affiliating colleges, including 107 private and 24 government-controlled self-financing colleges. The approved BTech intake for the next academic year has marginally decreased to 44,946, a slight fall from last years’ count of 45,197. There had been 47,268 available seats in 2019. With the State reporting surplus seats every year, the fall is unlikely to affect demand. The counts of vacancies were 27,191; 24,985; 20,459; and 17,106; in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. Private college managements felt the large number of vacant seats could be partly attributed to the delay in commencing admission process in the State. Blaming the government for the delay, Kerala Self-Financing Engineering College Management Association president Biju Ramesh said the State had been facing a drain of engineering aspirants. “Allotments must ideally be completed within a month of the declaration of Class XII results. The KEAM entrance examination must be conducted soon after the completion of the qualifying examination. Any lackadaisical approach would only serve the interests of engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu and other States,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/engineering-colleges-weather-pandemic-induced-crisis/article36936622.ece

11 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Public bike-sharing project to come back after a hiatus||Cycling enthusiasts in the city who had held a public bike-sharing project close to their hearts a few years ago have a reason to cheer. M.S. Athirup, founder of Athi’s Bicycle Club, says the initiative that has been functioning in a very limited way in the city with only members using its services is all set to revive public sharing in the next couple of months. The club operations have been focussed on Kochi where it has tied up with Kochi Metro to provide free short-distance cycle rides. Free services In the State capital, the project had always been run with the objective of free services for the public. With the COVID-19 pandemic drying up sponsorship, Mr. Athirup had been forced to bring operations to a halt. However, he is trying to line up sponsors to resume the service at the earliest. “The bike-sharing has not been wound up. We have invested a lot of money in the project, and have paid taxes to the city Corporation to maintain the cycle racks to keep it going,” says Mr. Athirup. The bike club was first launched in Technopark in 2011, and had been popular among techies for intra-campus travel. Sponsorship, mainly from Technopark, helped expand the project to the city. During the pandemic, user numbers too dropped along with the funding, but Mr. Athirup expects to get things back on track by the year-end. “Cycling was a bit slow in taking off in the city, but that is changing in recent times. People are integrating cycling into their daily lives by making small changes, such as carrying a fresh pair of clothes to change into after cycling to office, and so on. This is the best time for bike-sharing project to make a come-back,” says Mr. Athirup. He welcomes the city Corporation’s initiatives to promote cycling, especially in the wake of the pandemic that has spurred an interest in cycling. Beachside cycling Promoting beachside cycling circuits in places such as Shanghumughom would also help, he feels. Athirup says they are also exploring tie-ups with cycle clubs, reading clubs, youth clubs, and so on who will voluntarily provide cycles, and take care of sponsorship support and maintenance, so that cycles can be available to the public for free.  The bike club was first launched in Technopark in 2011, and was popular among techies for intra-campus travel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/public-bike-sharing-project-to-come-back-after-a-hiatus/article36936612.ece

11 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||e-payment may be mandatory for higher tax amounts||Though an online system for tax payment has been in place in local bodies for the past few years, a large percentage of payments from the public still happen manually, primarily due to database issues and lack of awareness about the system. The bypassing of the online payment system provides a leeway for corrupt officials to misappropriate funds, as it happened at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation recently. The State Government is currently ironing out issues in the online system and planning to bring about a system for mandatory online payment for taxes of large amounts. KSEB’s example It is learnt that the Government is planning to make it online payment mandatory for tax amounts above Rs. 10,000 or 15,000, and then progressively shift a majority of payments to online. Such a shift, after an initial mandatory push for bill payments of higher amounts to be made online, was successfully carried out at the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The rolling out of the Sanchaya online revenue collection system, designed by the Information Kerala Mission (IKM) began in the local bodies around 2014. By 2018 or so, many local bodies had implemented the system, with the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation being one of the earliest ones to do so. However, right from the initial days, there have been issues with the database in many local bodies, with hardly any effort being taken up for data cleaning, to remove ambiguous or duplicate entries. The problems were compounded following the tax revision exercise taken up in 2016. The building taxes till then were fixed at 18% of the annual rental value of the building, which was calculated on the basis of plinth area and land value. As per the new system, building tax was to be assessed on the basis of plinth area alone. These changes were not reflected in the database on time. Little awareness Though the online system was put in place, there was no push towards creating awareness among the public. Even now only about 20% of the tax payments happen online, according to officials at the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. People now pay their taxes at the ward-level collection drives or at the offices. Though this gets entered in the daily collection register, it should also be entered in the online database, which might not happen in some cases. Not an easy task Shifting the entire tax collection online is a complicated task as urban local bodies have five kinds of taxes, including property tax and professional tax, and 40 different kinds of fees including regularisation fees, application fees, tar cutting fees, vehicle rental payments, building rents, and land lease. But shifting the property tax, which makes up about 40% of the income of local bodies and the professional tax, which makes up 10-20% of income, could ensure that there is less leeway for large-scale fund misappropriation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/e-payment-may-be-mandatory-for-higher-tax-amounts/article36936620.ece

11 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Mental health literacy important, says Minister||Mental health literacy is important to recognise mental health problems, their symptoms, and illnesses, Minister for Health Veena George has said. She was inaugurating online a seminar organised by the Psychiatry department of Government Medical College Hospital, Kerala chapter of the Indian Psychiatric Society, and the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad in connection with World Mental Health Day observance at the medical college here on Sunday. Mental health, the Minister said, was just as important as physical health. People sought timely treatment for physical ailments but a majority were unable to recognise mental health problems and seek scientific treatment for them. This was because they did not have precise knowledge about mental health. Inaccurate beliefs and superstitions also abounded. Nearly 12.8% of the State’s population had mental health problems that required scientific treatment. However, of them only 15% sought such treatment. This was not owing to lack of treatment centres. But people did not reach these centres. Need to intensify In such a situation, it became essential to intensify mental health literacy activities, and the Health department was taking up this mission with public support, Ms. George said. People were undergoing a lot of stress owing to socio-economic changes brought about by COVID-19. There were changes on the education front too. Development of children with social interventions had been more or less lost. The Health Department was considering intensifying all activities related to mental health from the primary health level itself. The functioning of mental health centres and Psychiatry departments of medical colleges would be strengthened and research prioritised, the Minister said. The inauguration of a training programme ‘Sneha Kavacham’ designed by the Kerala chapter of the Indian Psychiatric Society to address digital addiction was held on the occasion. The programme is aimed at students, teachers, and parents. Society Kerala chapter president Radhakrishnan presided over the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mental-health-literacy-important-says-minister/article36936551.ece

11 October 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Author of bestselling crime novel at the age of 11||At the age of 11, Joshua Bejoy is the author of a best-selling crime thriller on Amazon kindle store in Children’s Crime and Thriller category.  Murder at the Leaky Barrel , the first novel of the Class VI student, is currently tops (kindle edition) in U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and India. Joshua’s novel in English, which kindles curiosity and suspense, was on the top seller list on the very first day of its release to make him the youngest Indian to have a best-selling novel to his credit. It was published by Booksthakam, a group of Malayali writers. Son of Suma Sunny, a freelance journalist from Vynthala, near Mala, and Bejoy Thomas, Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, from Kottayam, Joshua used to scribble poems and stories from a very tender age. (The family is now settled in Pune. ) “He was reluctant to show his works to anyone. He used to say that he writes for his own pleasure,” says his mother. Joshua started writing Murder at the Leaky Barrel during the lockdown. It took seven months for him to complete it. “Friday the thirteenth. Halloween night. 1532, Dublin, Ireland. After a night out in a bar, Edward Brown is returning back home, where he was murdered. Five centuries later, on Halloween, he has woken up from his sleep, a thought to get revenge in his mind.” The novel happening in an Irish background is progressing with vengeance and the investigation into it five centuries later. The plot, very unlikely by a 11-year-old writer, has the potential to hook any crime thriller fan. A sixth standard student of Ryan International School, Pune, Joshua has been a passionate reader of books of Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling and Gerald Durrell. His teachers, especially English teachers, used to appreciate his exceptional language skills, his mother recalls. “I have online classes during the day. Then there will be lots of homework too. So, I spent two or three hours writing in the night,” says Joshua. Natural knack “You need a natural knack for writing. If you have that warmth when you write, your readers will feel that passion. From there your words will take your readers to the imaginary world you created in the book,” the young writer talks about the skill of writing. Joshua says his parents, who are voracious readers, inspired him to dive into the world of letters. “My mother is my main motivator. She inspired me to publish the work,” he says. The paperback of the book is also available now. Joshua has almost completed two more books. They are in different genres. Current Books is planning to bring the book in Malayalam, says Suma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/author-of-bestselling-crime-novel-at-the-age-of-11/article36936618.ece

11 October 2021||Chennai,ANDHRA PRADESH||States scramble to avoid power restrictions||The power utilities in most southern States are staring at coal shortage and scrambling to avoid power restrictions. Majority of the thermal power plants in various States were running with stocks sufficient only for three to four days against having reserve stocks to last for at least two to three weeks in the past. Limited supply in T.N. In Tamil Nadu, the State power generating stations were maintaining an average 4 to 4.5 days of coal and the power officials were confident that they would be able to maintain this coal stock in the future. A senior official of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) said the State had been receiving coal in limited supply, with power stations maintaining a cumulative average of four days’ stock. He said the normal coal stock maintained by Tangedco would usually be nine to 10 days. He said indigenous coal was being used in different modalities by blending with it with imported coal. As of Sunday, more than five days of coal stock was available in north Chennai, three days in Mettur and five days in Thoothukudi. Tangedco has three thermal stations, with a total capacity of 4,320 mega watt. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) was keeping a close watch on the developments. The State had been recording a daily shortage of 120 MW-200 MW in supply during peak consumption hours. Three units shut in A.P. In Andhra Pradesh, while the total daily requirement of coal at AP-Genco plants was 70,000 tonnes, the present supply was only 40,000 tonnes. Three units had been shut due to a coal shortage. Sources said the existing stock would last for another two days. “If the shortage goes beyond 400 MW or the crisis persists over an extended period, we will have to go in for restrictions. For now, we have asked consumers to keep the usage down,” he said. Meanwhile, the 54 km Sathupalli-Kothagudem railway line has been completed for a length of 26 km so far and the remaining line would be completed by the year-end with participation of South Central Railway. Meanwhile, to tide over coal shortage, the Karnataka Government has sought additional coal supply from the Centre. The State is also looking at operating the allocated mines in Maharashtra and Odisha as early as possible, according to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Rain helps Karnataka Though Karnataka was presently managing its power supply without any problem, it was bound to face the heat of the coal shortage soon as none of its three State-owned thermal power stations had adequate coal stock to operate all the generating units at optimal level. While the rains had reduced the demand for power, especially agricultural load, the present hydel generation, too, stood at the optimal level, covering up for the coal shortage. But the present coal stock and the daily supplies were not sufficient enough to run all the three thermal stations at full capacity. To step up supply With the increasing demand for coal, particularly in the power sector, the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) in Telangana has decided to dispatch coal by at least 34 railway rakes a day from the present 30 rakes to its contracted buyers.

11 October 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||China’s presence in Sri Lanka raises concerns||The Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, including some former cadre of the defunct Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), are “seriously concerned” over the large-scale and long-term investments by the Chinese Government in Sri Lanka, Indian intelligence agencies have said. In a note to States, a Central agency referred to a conclave of the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora held in London recently and said the delegates felt that India had not taken it seriously to safeguard the interests of the Sri Lankan Tamils and even lost its influence over the island nation. The conclave was convinced that the fate of the Sri Lankan Tamils would be in jeopardy if the Chinese established their presence in northern Sri Lanka. Contact with Beijing Noting that “inaction” on the part of the Government of India had paved the way for China to gain prominence in Sri Lanka, the conclave decided to take all out efforts to establish contact with the Chinese Government to create a political and economic base for Sri Lankan Tamils. “They assume that the Chinese will welcome such initiatives as it would assist them in northern Sri Lanka to have a hassle-free presence, besides facilitate them in their stance against India,” the note on security preparedness said, adding that the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora was deploying its global resources to tap Chinese intellectuals to gain a groundswell of opinion favouring their efforts. However, the conclave had strong dissenters to the strategy as they believed that the Sri Lankan Tamils would lose the support of the Indian Tamils. Adding to the Central inputs, Tamil Nadu Director-General of Police  (DGP) C. Sylendra Babu wrote to the Commissioners/Superintendents of Police (SPs) on reliable information about the LTTE remnants regrouping and holding meetings near Thiruvanmiyur in Chennai “very often”. The alert was given days before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested former LTTE intelligence operative Satkunam, alias Sabesa, 47, on charges of indulging in drug trafficking with international links and also funding the revival of the defunct organisation in Sri Lanka. Materials seized from his premises in Valasaravakkam, Iyyappathangal, etc., revealed evidence of a huge transfer of money to his contacts in Sri Lanka, investigators said. At the meetings held in Chennai, the participants chalked out strategies for further course of action in the backdrop of the developments relating to the increasing presence of Chinese defence personnel in Sri Lanka. Since the Chinese presence in the neighbourhood could pose a threat to India, the DGP called for enhanced surveillance along the coastal districts. The State intelligence, relying on the Central agency inputs, said some radicalised Muslims were brought from Pakistan and Turkey by senior Sri Lankan political leaders and made to settle in Batticaloa, Mutur and Kalpatti. They had started madrasas to spread their ideology in eastern Sri Lanka and had planned to infiltrate into India, police sources told The Hindu on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chinas-presence-in-sri-lanka-raises-concerns/article36936136.ece
11 October 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Nod for industrial units to cover full validity period’||In a significant relief for industrial units, the Tamil Nadu Government has done away with the requirement for industrial units to approach the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) every year for getting consent to operate and renewal of consent. An order issued by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Forests on Friday said the TNPCB would issue the clearance for the entire validity period of an industrial unit on payment of the total consent fee in advance. “Hereafter, the clearance will be issued at one go, covering the total period,” an official explains. The validity period for the red category units has been fixed at five years; for the orange category at 10 years; and for the green category at 14. The order follows the government’s announcement in the Assembly in September, which was part of the ease of doing business policy. But this will be subject to compliance with the conditions stipulated in environmental clearance issued under the Environment Impact Assessment notification and the ‘consent to establish’ order issued under the laws to prevent and control water and air pollution. Until now, the red category units had to get renewal of consent annually. The orange category units, too, had to get it annually until they operated the effluent treatment plant and implemented air pollution control measures satisfactorily; thereafter, they could get it once in two years.

11 October 2021||Kozhikode,ANDHRA PRADESH||Study sought into rabies deaths despite vaccination||A proper study has been sought into recent deaths due to rabies among people who are vaccinated against the infection. The latest case is that of a seven-year-old boy from Kasaragod district in Kerala, who died on October 7, more than three weeks after getting the first dose of the vaccine following a stray dog bite. According to sources, similar cases have been reported from across the State, including in major government medical college hospitals. K.K. Purushothaman, Professor of Paediatrics, MES Medical College, Perinthalmanna, told The Hindu on Sunday that rabies is a fatal infection in which “the chances of death are 100%”. Patients are given four to five doses of the anti-rabies vaccine in intervals from the day of the bite, along with anti-rabies serum. If the bite happens somewhere in and around the head and neck, it may affect the brain very fast. The virus may spread and lead to problems as the vaccine-induced antibodies may take time to reach the protective level, Dr. Purushothaman said. “The vaccine gives full protection only 14 days after it is administered. The serum, in the meanwhile, ensures temporary protection,” he said. Taking the patient to the hospital at the right time is also important. The boy in Kasaragod was given three doses of the anti-rabies vaccine and the anti-rabies serum. He died before getting the fourth dose. “If deaths are happening even after the patient is administered the vaccine and the serum on time, there is something wrong somewhere. It may be due to bad quality of the serum, or the manner in which it is transported to the hospital and stored. People who are administering the serum may not be doing it in the right way as well,” he said. Dr. Purushothaman said government authorities should take these issues seriously. “There is a need to verify the quality of the serum. The healthcare workers need better training too,” he added. The Health Department is collecting data on similar incidents from various districts.  There is a need to verify the quality of the serum. The healthcare workers need better training tooK.K.

Interacting with the party workers from the Santhanulapadu Assembly constituency at Pernamitta in Prakasam district, Mr. Manohar exhorted them not to be cowed down by the ‘threats unleashed by the YSRCP leaders’. He alleged that the ruling party was misusing the police to foist cases against the leaders of the opposition parties. “The future belongs to the JSP. Let us fight back the YSRCP’s sinister designs without fear,” he told the party cadres and hoped that his party would win a majority of the 12 Assembly seats in Prakasam district in the next elections.

Mr. Justice Goswami has been transferred as the Chief Justice of the Chhattisgarh High Court. He had assumed charge as the Chief Justice of the A.P. High Court on January 6, 2021. Speaking at a farewell organised at the High Court on Sunday, Mr. Justice Goswami said large segments of the population had still no access to justice, which was a matter of concern. He called upon the members of the legal fraternity to come to the rescue of such hapless people, while pointing out that there was no profession more exacting than law. “The profession demands a lot of patience and perseverance. It is not like a T20 or one-day cricket match. To make your mark, you should have all the attributes of a test cricketer and the temperament to play long innings,” he observed. Mr. Justice Goswami said he had a short but memorable stint in the A.P. High Court, for which he thanked his colleagues on the Bench, the Advocate General (A-G), and the judicial officers and staff.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Naidu pointed out that investors and the public were facing problems after the flight services between Kadapa and important destinations were cancelled. “The flights were introduced during the TDP rule in 2018 to ensure air connectivity to Kadapa. The people of Kadapa and Nellore districts had been availing of these services to Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Vijayawada and other places. The services have stopped for reasons best known to the government. Air connectivity plays a key role in the development of industrial and services sectors. The previous TDP regime made good use of the the Udan programme. Flights were introduced between tier-2 and tier-3 cities,” he said. In the absence of flight services, one would have to reach Vijayawada from Kadapa via Tirupati, Chennai or Bengaluru, which consumes time and money, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/revive-flight-services-to-kadapa-naidu-tells-cm/article36936713.ece

Participating in the programme, BJP national organisational joint general secretary Shiv Prakash said the opposition parties had unleashed a ‘vicious propaganda’ against the Centre’s policies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-tdp-governments-failed-on-many-counts/article36936710.ece
11 October 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Industries told to go for energy audit||In an attempt to unlock the huge energy saving potential of the MSMEs, the Industries Department has directed its State and district-level officials to motivate industries and the MSMEs to go for energy audit and implement the Energy Efficiency (EE) measures on a larger scale. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has agreed to provide the technical assistance and send accredited energy auditors to help MSMEs conduct energy audits, Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission CEO A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy said on Sunday. He said Special Chief Secretary (industries and commerce) Karikal Valaven suggested to Director of Industries J.V.N. Subrahmanyam and general managers of the District Industries Centres to utilise the services of the A.P. State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation for carrying out investment Grade Energy Audit (IGEA) in MSMEs and large industries. The energy efficiency measures are expected to help the MSMEs and large industries save around 2,000 million units (MU) of energy worth approximately Rs. 1,200 crore. It was mentioned that the cost of the IGEA has been fixed at an optimum level considering the type of the industry, processes involved, contracted maximum demand on cost-effective basis and etc. Energy consumption in the industries sector is around 17,000 MU per annum, of which MSMEs account for about 5,000 MU. The MSMEs have scope for saving 500 MU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/industries-told-to-go-for-energy-audit/article36936712.ece

Mr. Satyanarayana Raju said that the opposition leaders had been seeking stringent steps to check the drug mafia. “Instead of taking corrective steps, the YSRCP leaders and the police are filing cases and serving notices on the TDP leaders,” he said. He said the people were raising doubts on the link of the State with the Mundra port case. “Former MLA Dhulipalla Narendra and other TDP leaders expressed similar doubts. But, the police have served a notice on Mr. Narendra without checking the facts. Why didn’t the police serve notices on Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy for linking N. Chandrababu Naidu with the drug mafia?, he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-nia-team-visited-vijayawada-asks-mlc/article36936714.ece

11 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cong. seeks White Paper on industrial development||APCC president S. Sailajanath on Sunday demanded that the government release a White Paper on the development of industries in the State. In a statement, Mr. Sailajanath said people wanted to know where were the promised new industries set up and how many people gained employment from them. He said the government had allocated huge funds to develop industrial infrastructure to attract investments. “But the promised industries are nowhere to be seen, and the youth continue to suffer in the absence of job opportunities,” Mr. Sailajanath said. The Rs. 2,705 crore allocated for the development of industries and the needed infrastructure in the 2020-21 fiscal year was enhanced by Rs. 968.34 crore, and Rs. 3,673.34 crore was allocated in the current fiscal, which was an additional Rs. 35.79 crore compared with last year, he said. Mr. Sailajanath pointed out that the government had allocated Rs. 200 crore to the APIIC for development of the Visakha-Chennai, Chennai-Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Bengaluru industrial corridors, an additional Rs. 200 crore for the the YSR Electronic Manufacturing Cluster (EMC) in Kadapa, Rs. 60.93 crore for development of basic amenities for the MSMEs, and Rs. 250 crore for the YSR Steel Plant in Kadapa district, which the State is building on its own.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-seeks-white-paper-on-industrial-development/article36936716.ece

11 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Doubts arise over linking of second Vistadome coach||The second Vistadome coach has arrived in Visakhapatnam. But, the question is will it be attached to the Visakhapatnam – Kirandul passenger train for the benefit of thousands of tourists, who come to the city from different parts of the country to visit Araku between October and January? The lone Vistadome coach, which was introduced in 2017 following persistent demands from tourists for several years, is being fully booked during the tourist season, all these years. Tourists had to book more than three months in advance to get a seat in the coach. The existing Vistadome coach has a ‘self-generating battery’ and its coupling is ‘screw type’. The new Vistadome coach has CBC (Centre Buffer Coupler) and does not have a battery. This is an LHB coach, which requires an EOG (End On Generator). LHB coaches are longer than conventional coaches and no LHB coaches are running on the Araku route and hence clearance from the Commission of Railway Safety would be required for operation of the new coach. The clearance will not be given until testing is done in that route, say railway sources. “The railway authorities are neglecting the introduction of the second Vistadome coach. The zonal and divisional authorities should have planned much ahead on the testing and other aspects, as the tourist season is barely a few weeks away,” says N. Gajapathi Rao, a former Zonal Railway Users Committee (ZRUCC) member. “We have plans to run the entire train with LHB coaches. The coupling of the present Vistadome coach may need slight modification and it can be done,” Divisional Railway Manager Anup Kumar Satpathy told The Hindu , when the issue was brought to his notice. He was optimistic that the Vistadome coach could be utilised, before the commencement of the tourist season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/doubts-arise-over-linking-of-second-vistadome-coach/article36936782.ece

Addressing the media on Sunday, Mr. Ramakrishna wondered as to how Mr. Pawan Kalyan, knowing that the NDA government at the Centre was ‘nonchalant’ towards the farmers agitation against the three controversial laws and the agitation against the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) , was supporting the BJP. The JSP, which initially announced that it would not field a candidate in the Badvel bypoll as the deceased MLA’s wife was contesting the poll, later said that it would support the BJP candidate. Mr. Ramakrishna sought to know whether the JSP should withdraw its support to the BJP in the bypoll and standby the farmers and workers.

The construction of a new bridge of 1.20 km length and 12 metre width, parallel to the existing old bridge above the Godavari, at the temple town has been pending for more than five years. Work on the new bridge started in 2015 at an estimated cost of Rs. 65 crore to decongest traffic on the old bridge, the crucial road link on the National Highway 30 (Old NH 221) at Telangana’s famous temple town, bordering Andhra Pradesh. The Maharashtra-based executing agency missed three construction deadlines in the past five years. However, nearly 77 % of the work on the new bridge has been completed and efforts are on to expedite the remaining work relating to the main components such as laying of slabs across the girders by the contracting firm so as to complete the construction of the bridge within one year, a senior official of the NHAI told The Hindu . Difficult terrain Multiple factors ranging from initial delay in carrying out civil works due to rocky terrain in the river zone to recurrent floods led to inordinate delay in execution of works on the most sought-after new bridge, sources said. The COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns during the first and second waves of the pandemic added to the delay. Motorists bound for Bhadrachalam and the vast tribal region spanning across Telangana’s border with Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh continue to grapple with frequent traffic snarls on the narrow old bridge at the temple town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/traffic-jam-at-bhadradri-bridge-not-to-end-soon/article36936521.ece
11 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Hyderabad and Madanapalle figure in ‘tough’ Civils prelims||Hyderabad, Nizam State and Madanapalle found place in the Civil Services preliminary exam conducted on Sunday and it was also the first time that several questions from sports tested students apart from regular topics. The question on Madanapalle was related to headquarters of the Theosophical Society, Pattabhi Sitaramaiah starting Quit India Movement from there and Pingali Venkaiah designing the Indian flag from there. Question on Hyderabad was linked to UNCDF recognising it as Tree City of the world or its commitment to grow and maintain urban forests. Out of the 46,953 aspirants who had applied from Hyderabad district, 22,193 appeared. A few thousands also took the test in Warangal, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Anantapur and Tirupati in the two Telugu states. The examination was conducted in two sessions - from 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. According to aspirants, the paper this year was a bit ‘tougher’ than previous years’ with expected questions on the pandemic and India-China relations in view of the Galwan valley issue. Reasoning questions were confusing is what they said. However, V. Gopalakrishna of Brain Tree Academy said that it was a balanced paper which comprised questions from all the areas listed in the syllabus. Questions tested conceptual clarity of the aspirant rather than only factual information indicating that a long term preparation and broad based preparation is expected out of a prospective civil servant, he said. There were 15 questions from Economic and Social Development, 20 from History and Culture, 12 from General Science, 18 from Indian Polity and Governance, 20 from Environment and Ecology, 8 from Geography and about 7 questions from GK and Current Affairs. V. Srikanth of Analog IAS Institute described the paper as more random than last two years and less logical and more factual than last four years. He said sports, awards, geography, microeconomics made a re-entry in the prelims almost after half a decade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hyderabad-and-madanapalle-figure-in-tough-civils-prelims/article36936508.ece
11 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Huzurabad, a test for all three party chiefs||As Huzurabad bypoll campaign heats up with the nominations filed, the poll outcome will not be a test to the calibre of the candidates or the political parties alone but also the image of the chiefs of all the three political parties – K. Chandrashekhar Rao of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), Bandi Sanjay of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and A. Revanth Reddy of the Congress. The last two face their first election in different aspects after assuming charge as chiefs of their State units. Huzurabad falls under the Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency represented by the aggressive Mr Sanjay and it will be a test to prove his strength in his constituency for the first time after he was elected. The BJP saw a huge takeoff soon after he got into the new role, winning the Dubbaka bypoll, and also stunning the ruling party in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections winning the highest divisions in its history. The Hindutva campaign narrative in the GHMC elections was set by him and the TRS was in a predicament either to reject it or follow it or continue its initial slogan of development politics. Much before the ruling party could create a counter-strategy religious emotions took over. The AIMIM, a friendly party of the TRS, also contributed in upping the emotions, ultimately favouring the BJP. But Huzurabad is a different turf and realising that religious emotions cannot be raked up in this rural constituency that easily, he has been targetting corruption in the government. Mr. Sanjay has just ended his walkathon with a massive public meeting in his Karimnagar constituency and is seen as a prelude to the bypoll. He can relax a bit as the election is being seen as a fight between Mr. Rajender and KCR and not the BJP and TRS. For the equally aggressive Revanth Reddy this is the first election after taking over as Telangana Congress chief overcoming the challenges from seniors in the party. He has been successful in energising the party workers who were demoralised after a series of defections of MLAs to the ruling party. The ‘Dalita Girijana Dandora’ meetings created the much-needed buzz for the party and by conducting the last meeting in Gajwel, represented by the Chief Minister, he has sent a strong signal to the party workers that he is willing to fight. Neither the party high command nor the Congress workers are expecting a win here as the Huzurabad seat in the last two decades was never its kitty, but getting decent votes will help the party in the long run. By fielding a youngster and its student wing president Venkat Balamoori, the party has played it safe. Mr. Reddy’s leadership may not be judged with the outcome here though his detractors in the party will rake up the issue. But in Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s case, the fight is not limited to his party winning but decimating his long-time party colleague and trusted lieutenant, and now BJP candidate Eatala Rajender, who has questioned his leadership and ‘iron-hand politics’. A win with a massive majority only will satisfy KCR and nothing less than that. A master political strategist, he has already deployed an army of his party leaders and Ministers to hit Mr. Rajender psychologically, weaning away his closest followers from him. Launching the ‘Dalita Bandhu’ scheme from Huzurabad as a pilot project will be seen as a master political stroke as well distracting the earlier focus of the bypoll campaign. Winning with a huge margin here will suppress any thought of dissidence in the TRS and that KCR’s leadership cannot be questioned in Telangana. The other two, even if they lose, can fall on some excuses that can be bought by people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/huzurabad-a-test-for-all-three-party-chiefs/article36936517.ece
11 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State of rural healthcare in pictures||The robustness of government healthcare services and gaps can be assessed by evaluating medical services offered in remote villages. Working with this idea, a group of professionals from Bharat Dekho, a voluntary social organisation, visited villages in five districts of Telangana and compiled a report on why people do not opt for government hospitals. Reasons of healthcare workers for not being able to deliver quality services were also included. Photographs of their field visits from July to September this year, including some of the dilapidated government healthcare facilities, were displayed at Lamakaan here over the weekend. The team comprised Romila Gillela and Abhijit Biswas, co-founders of Bharat Dekho, Viplab, Murali Krishna, and other members of the organisation. They visited Shadnagar mandal in Rangareddy, Mahbubnagar, Utnoor in Adilabad, Nekonda mandal in Warangal, and Bhadradri Kothagudem district. As per their report, unhygienic conditions, unhygienic rooms and washrooms, lack of drinking water, attitude of healthcare professionals and other officers towards common people, absenteeism of healthcare workers were some of the reasons why people did not opt for government hospitals. On the other hand, reasons mentioned by healthcare workers in this regard included lack of functioning equipment for quality diagnosis, lack of proper roads to travel regularly, and an overstressed workforce. The observations were submitted to the district collectors and authorities concerned. The issues of delay in issuing salaries to Accredited Social Healthcare Activists was also mentioned.  Salaries on time Mr Abhijit said that paying salaries on time will empower the ASHAs, and added that a channel has to be established through which frontline workers can lodge their grievances to the authorities concerned with hope of a solution. Since several COVID patients from villages had to get admitted to hospitals in Hyderabad, they wanted to know the state of health services in the remote places, Ms Romila chimed in. The team plans to go back to the surveyed villages and continue the dialogue of improving health services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-of-rural-healthcare-in-pictures/article36936512.ece

11 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ministers to study two areas for fruit market||A team of Ministers and MLAs accompanied by officials would visit the Bata Singaram logistics park and Victoria Memorial Playground (V.M. Home) to examine the possibility of shifting the Gaddi Annaram wholesale fruit market to Koheda till its completion in all respects. A meeting was held here on Sunday by Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy to discuss the issue following a plea made by All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in the Assembly recently. The meeting, attended by Minister Md. Mahamood Ali, MLAs Jaffar Hussain, Ahmed Bin Abdullah Balala, D. Sudhir Reddy and M. Kishan Reddy, decided to examine the two sites for relocating Gaddi Annaram market. The State Government decided last year to construct a super speciality hospital on the site of Gaddi Annaram market by shifting it to Koheda integrated agriculture market till the development of infrastructure and all facilities there. Accordingly, the Agricultural Marketing Department had identified Bata Singaram logistics park for relocating the Gaddi Annaram market on temporary basis. Officials of the Agricultural Marketing Department informed the MLAs at the meeting that all basic facilities were already provided at the place identified for shifting the fruit market on temporary basis in Bata Singaram.

11 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Singareni to scale up coal dispatches||With the increasing demand for coal, particularly in the power sector, Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) has decided to dispatch coal by at least 34 railway rakes a day from the present 30 rakes to its contracted buyers. The decision comes in the backdrop of the Coal Ministry’s direction to the coal companies to scale up production and dispatches to meet the increasing demand of coal and improve coal stocks at thermal power plants, most of which were stated to be running with stocks sufficient only for three-four days against having reserve stocks to last for at least for two-three weeks in the past. Although the company’s coal production target for the current fiscal is 70 million tonnes (mt), its management is planning to scale up the capacity of coal handling plants (CHP), the points from where the coal is loaded on to railway rakes (wagons), to 115 mt over the next three years from less than 80 mt now. The plan includes enhancing the capacity of existing 9 CHPs and construction of four new CHPs this year. Further, the management has decided to completed the Sattupalli-Kothagudem railway lines by Dec.-end. Chairman and Managing Director of SCCL N. Sridhar reviewed the coal dispatches being done at all the CHPs across the company’s mining areas. According to officials, dispatches of coal from CHPs during first half of the last financial year was only 17.9 mt and this year it was 31.3 mt during the same period with a growth rate of 75%. The CMD wanted the officials to complete the new CHPs and enhance the capacity of existing CHPs to meet the target of dispatching 70 mt coal this financial year – dispatching at least 38.7 mt coal during the October-March period. The officials have been told to speed up work on the Kishtaram CHP, phase-two CHP in Ramagundam-3 OC-3 (opencast mine), GDK-5 OC CHP, IK OC CHP, all under construction, so that they could be completed by Nov.-end. Capacity of Srirampur area CHP is being enhanced by 4 mt and that of Manuguru-K CHP by 2 mt by Dec.-end. In all, the company targets CHP capacity of 102 mt by March-end. As the company plans to reach production capacity of 100 mt by the next five years, three new CHPs with handling 15 mt capacity would be set up at GDK-5 OC, VK-7 OC (Kothagudem) and Manuguru during the next three years. The CHP being constructed at Sathupalli with a cost of Rs. 400 crore would be a model with sound and dust pollution-free. The 54 km Sathupalli-Kothagudem railway line has been completed for 26 km and the remaining line would be completed by the year-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/singareni-to-scale-up-coal-dispatches/article36936513.ece

11 October 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Life-size admiration for ‘real-life’ hero||Noted film actor and philanthropist Sonu Sood’s multifarious acts of kindness during the COVID-19-induced lockdown last year and thereafter continue to inspire his staunch admirers to show their admiration for his humanitarian gestures through the medium of art. Gurram Venkateshwarlu, a 38-year-old farm labourer of Garlapadu village in Bonakal mandal, adores the multilingual actor as a “real-life hero” for helping thousands of migrant workers reach their homes during the mass exodus of labourers from various cities to their villages triggered by sudden imposition of lockdown to stave off coronavirus infection last year. Inspired by Mr Sood’s consistent acts of charity, Venkateshwarlu, who ekes out a living by toiling in agricultural fields to support his family, brought an impressive statue of Mr Sonu Sood made by a famous sculptor of Gollapudi village in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district recently. He had spent a portion of his hard-earned money on the statue for installing it in his village to foster the spirit of compassion. “I have seen several of Mr Sood's Telugu films including Ashok,” says Venkateshwarlu, praising the acting talents of Mr Sood. "He played negative roles in most of his films but proved a true hero in real-life during the challenging times,” he notes. Mr Sood extended a helping hand to thousands of migrant workers and provided medical oxygen to many critically-ill COVID-19 patients during the critical times, he extols. The village sarpanch and several other local body representatives have extended their support to ‘my endeavour to install the statue of the real-heroin our village to inspire youth to emulate his humanitarian gestures and help those in distress around their neighbourhood’, Mr Venkateshwarlu asserts, unveiling his plan to install the statue soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/life-size-admiration-for-a-real-life-hero/article36936523.ece

11 October 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Homes of nine oustees damaged by rain||The festival of Dasara has nothing to give them. They are blaming it on their fate and the government. In a shocking incident, the rooftops of as many as nine houses were damaged at Mamidyala village section ofi n the Rehabilitation and Resettlement colony of Kondapochamma oustees. The incident took place on the intervening night of Saturday/Sunday. Heavy rains coupled with huge gales resulted in flying of rooftops of these houses constructed with thick plastic sheets. The government constructed houses for the oustees of Kondapochammasagar reservoir at Mutrajpally. While permanent double bedroom houses were constructed to those who surrendered early and handed over lands and houses to the government, single bedroom houses were constructed to those who challenged the government and approached the High Court. Their houses were constructed in low-laying areas and it was such a painful situation that they had to spend sleepless nights whenever there were black clouds/rain. This was not for the first time that rainwater had entered their houses. However, this time the rooftops of their houses were flown in the air and fell on poles. “The houses of D. Mallesham, D. Balamani, O. Devi Reddy, Tammala Srinivas, D. Balaiah, D. Balanarsu, D. Raghupathi, E. Pochaiah and D. Ramulu were damaged. We are appealing to officials since last night but there was no response so far. We do not know whom to approach and what to do," Mr. Mallesh, one of the victims, told The Hindu adding that electric poles fell on houses and people ran away to safety. “We have lost everything by surrendering our lands and houses to the government for Kondapochammasagar project. Now our lives are at risk as the housse may get damaged due to heavy rains and gales,” they appealed the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/houses-of-nine-oustees-damaged-by-rain/article36936520.ece

The flexboards appeared in the fields on Saturday, the day some revenue officials planned for a survey of lands in the village. “Officials of Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC), Irrigation and Revenue officials, please do not enter our lands. We do not allow any coercion of farmers by officials. Please return about 400 acres of lands that was acquired from farmers. Please give back the land to farmers under GO RT No. 79. Political leaders are preventing the Collector from handing over land to the farmers. The Collector of Siddipet had already started the process of returning the lands to farmers. The farmers had already approached the court,” read the flexi board erected by farmers in the fields of Ogulapur on Saturday. “Efforts are on to allot these 400 acres not returned to farmers to food processing industry. It was not right on the part of government. We have every right on these lands that were acquired for the construction of Thotapally reservoir which was discarded later. We have also approached the High Court in this regard. The HC has directed the authorities on October 3, 2020, to dispose of the case within six weeks. Siddipet Collector through Husnabad RDO has issued notices to us stating that lands will be handed over to us provided we pay Rs. 9.25 lakh per acre. Meanwhile, we got information that the administration of Karimnagar has been proposing to hand over these lands to food processing industry. We are fighting against this,” K. Srinivas Reddy, a farmer from Ogupalur said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/do-not-enter-our-lands-farmers-to-officials/article36936736.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||The unfathomable love-hate equation!||The Opposition Congress often says that the love-hate equation between the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unfathomable at times. This seems to be true as BJP leaders in the State continue their diatribe against TRS and its Government in the State while their counterparts at the national level including the Union Ministers are seen indulging in both hailing and flaying the TRS rule. During the recent Assembly session, Minister for IT and Industries K.T. Rama Rao, as part of a short discussion on IT sector growth, said even the State leaders of BJP have become brand ambassadors to the good work being done by the TRS Government, at least indirectly. Citing an example, he said while the BJP leaders were engaged in criticising the TRS rule, the visuals captured by their cameramen spoke a different truth by presenting happiness all around with lush green farm fields. In addition, the examples of Union Ministers and reports of various agencies complimenting State’s growth were umpteen, he said explaining the brand ambassadors!     The decision of the government restraining seed dealers from selling seed of paddy varieties as the Centre had declined to procure boiled rice from the State through the FCI in the rabi had serious consequences for the dealers and manufacturers. What about the seed already in their possession, ask the dealers and manufacturers. On the other hand, the Opposition parties questioned the propriety of the government regulating paddy cultivation. The farmers were free to cultivate the crops they preferred because the new farm laws gave them liberty to dispose of their produce pan-India if the Telangana government was not interested.     The Huzurabad assembly by-election has entered a crucial phase with the political parties focusing on surveys to assess their chances of victory. Survey teams both private agencies as well as officials from the intelligence wing are said to be doing rounds of the constituency to understanding the mood of the public. The ruling party is said to be taking extra care in studying the inputs, given the experience it had from the Dubbaka bypoll. The TRS lost the constituency to BJP despite surveys projecting a win for it with a thumping majority.  (B. Chandrashekhar, N. Rahul, M.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Reader’s Mail - Hyderabad||Vasavi Siva Nagar Colony is the second oldest place after Nagarjuna Nagar in Kushaiguda. Before COVID-19 pandemic, two services in the morning, two in the evening and one in the afternoon through Bus Nos. 15V, 17V and 3V were operated and catered to the residents of these two colonies. In the last five years, many new colonies have sprung up in addition to the ever-crowded D-Mart about 1 km from the colony. There are hundreds of apartments in these new colonies, not to speak of lot of commercial activities and schools. Autos are scant in these areas and the residents, particularly the older ones, have to walk over 1 km to reach the main road to take a bus. I request RTC to restore the bus services as more people are eagerly awaiting the resumption of the same, more so with life slowly returning to normalcy now. D. Nagarjuna, Kushaiguda   Negotiating the stretch between Shenoy Nursing Home, East Marredpally, and Paradise is a nightmare for commuters especially during peak hours with traffic jams near St John’s Church being a daily nuisance. The main reason is the blockade at the church corner where the width is hardly 15 feet. The only solution is to widen the road by moving the compound wall by a few metres to allow free flow of traffic. Even the left turn is blocked for vehicles proceeding towards Paradise, Begumpet and beyond. I request the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and Traffic Police to look into this issue. N. Ramanathan, Marredpally   Allowing vehicles coming from Jubilee Bus Station side and St Ann’s School road to get access to the main parking lot for JBS-Parade Ground metro station and vehicles from Paradise side taking the left turn arbitrarily is causing a lot of confusion. GHMC and Traffic Police should pre-empt any scope of accident at this point as it is often the confluence of vehicles coming from three opposite sides. A barricade or a traffic signal for vehicles from Paradise to JBS road needs to be put up to allow commuters access to the metro station.

11 October 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Naveen seeks PM’s intervention for surplus rice procurement from Odisha||The Odisha government has raised objections to non-lifting of surplus parboiled rice from the State due to restrictions imposed by the Department of Food and Public Distribution, saying it would affect paddy procurement from 10 lakh farmers. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Sunday shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi bringing to his notice that Odisha’s paddy procurement could be adversely affected due to such restrictions. “Odisha became a Decentralized Procurement (DCP) State in the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2003-04. Since then the State has been undertaking minimum support price operations for procurement of paddy in decentralized mode. Such Decentralized Procurement has improved the outreach of MSP support to paddy growers,” Mr. Patnaik mentioned in his letter. ‘Delivered to FCI’ “The rice milled from the paddy so procured is being used under the National Food Security Act and other welfare schemes of Central government and the surplus rice is being delivered to the Food Corporation of India (FCI),” he said. Odisha Chief Minister informed that: “during the KMS 2020-21, around 14 lakh farmers have sold 77.33 lakh MT of paddy (equivalent to 52.35 MT of rice) to the State Government and MSP dues of about Rs. 14,444 crores have been transferred to the bank accounts of the farmers within 24 to 48 hours of purchase of paddy.” “In connection with paddy procurement, it is pertinent to mention here that on August 31, the Centre intimated that for the next KMS no surplus parboiled rice shall be accepted from Odisha by the FCI,” he said. According to State government, in upcoming KMS 2021-22, Odisha is estimated to procure 52 lakh MT of rice. “The State’s own requirement of rice under all the schemes is about 24 lakh MT. This goes to indicate that the State will have a surplus of 28 lakh MT of rice out of which only 4 lakh MT will be raw rice. That leaves the State with a balance of 24 lakh MT of parboiled rice for evacuation by FCI. But the latest decision of DFPD has put a question mark on lifting of the said surplus rice from the State,” Mr. Patnaik said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/naveen-seeks-pms-intervention-for-surplus-rice-procurement-from-odisha/article36936417.ece

Days after the Meghalaya Cabinet approved a proposal to relocate “illegal settlers” from the Them Iew Mawlong area in Shillong, the Harijan Panchayat Committee (HPC), which represents members of the Sikh community there, has said it will “fight tooth and nail” to stop the government from carrying out the drive. The Meghalaya State Cabinet took the decision earlier this week, based on a recommendation made by a high-level committee (HLC) headed by Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong. Two years ago, a Punjab government delegation led by Mr. Randhawa had visited Shillong and met members of the Sikh community living there and had assured them at that time too that he would vociferously oppose any move against their displacement. The Deputy Chief Minister said the Sikhs have been living in Shillong for decades and the Punjab government strongly opposes this decision to displace them. He said the civil rights of these Sikhs who have been living in Shillong for more than 200 years would not be allowed to be trampled upon at any cost. Mr. Randhawa alleged that the BJP-led NDA government has failed to create a sense of security and confidence among minorities across the country “who are feeling insecure, the latest examples of which can be seen in Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/will-fight-to-stop-meghalayas-eviction-move/article36936583.ece

An order issued by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Forests on Friday said the TNPCB would issue the clearance for the entire validity period of an industrial unit on payment of the total consent fee in advance. “Hereafter, the clearance will be issued at one go, covering the total period,” an official explains. The validity period for the red category units has been fixed at five years; for the orange category at 10 years; and for the green category at 14. The order follows the government’s announcement in the Assembly in September, which was part of the ease of doing business policy. But this will be subject to compliance with the conditions stipulated in environmental clearance issued under the Environment Impact Assessment notification and the ‘consent to establish’ order issued under the laws to prevent and control water and air pollution. Until now, the red category units had to get renewal of consent annually. The orange category units, too, had to get it annually until they operated the effluent treatment plant and implemented air pollution control measures satisfactorily; thereafter, they could get it once in two years. The green category units were required to have the renewal done once in two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nod-for-industrial-units-to-cover-full-validity-period/article36936414.ece

The Lukha — “reservoir of fish” in the local Pnar language — was considered toxic beyond redemption a decade ago. The Meghalaya Pollution Control Board had in its 2012 investigative report blamed the contamination on acid mine drainage and run-off from the coal mines. Rat-hole coal mines The Lukha river is in the East Jaintia Hills district where most of Meghalaya’s rat-hole coal mines are located. Forest and Environment Minister James Sangma said the pilot project to rejuvenate the Lukha by using algae to remove toxic contents from the water has become a success. The detoxification process is called phycoremediation. “Phycoremediation has improved the pH level of a critical stretch of the river. Enthused by the success of the rejuvenation process, we are going to upscale this pilot project to the rest of Lukha and other rivers as well,” he said. Environmentalists in Meghalaya and elsewhere have been raising an alarm over the contamination of the Lukha, marked by dead fish found afloat frequently and the colour of the water turning either blue or yellow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meghalaya-river-back-from-dead-claims-govt/article36936416.ece

In a series of tweets in Hindi, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said, “A Dalit was beaten to death in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh. This is very sad and condemnable, but why is the Congress high command silent over it.” A Dalit man was beaten to death on October 7 by a group of men in Hanumangarh over his love affair. The accused also shot a video of the entire incident in which they are seen giving water to the victim to drink and then thrashing him repeatedly with sticks. Four people have been arrested and one minor detained for the assault, police said on Sunday. The arrested have been identified as Mukesh Kumar Ode, Dilip Kumar, Sikandar and Hansraj. A sum of Rs. 4.12 lakh has been approved by the District Collector as compensation, DGP M.L. Lather said in a statement. Ms. Mayawati said, “Will the Chief Ministers of Chhattisgarh and Punjab go there and give Rs. 50 lakh to the victim's family? The BSP demands an answer, otherwise it should stop shedding crocodile tears in the name of the Dalits.” ‘Sack Union Minister’ On the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, she tweeted, “The cropping up of the name of the son of the Union Minister in the Lakhimpur violence raises questions on the working style of the BJP government.” The BJP should sack the Minister as only then will there be any hope of justice for the aggrieved farmers, she added. Ms Mayawati also said terrorists are killing innocent people almost everyday in Jammu and Kashmir, which is very sad and shameful.

11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Central govt. turning a blind eye to coal crisis, says Sisodia||The Delhi government on Sunday attacked the Centre over its failure to admit that there was a coal crisis in the country and said that it could lead to energy disruptions if not tackled urgently. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the Central government had turned a blind eye to the submissions by various States and Delhi claiming that there was a coal crisis. “Chief Ministers of many States have warned the Centre of the coal crisis, but it is calling it a rumour and trying to prove the States wrong. The Central government is running away from its responsibility and it has no plan to overcome this crisis,” Mr. Sisodia said. He alleged that the Centre had acted in a similar manner a few months ago when there was a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders during the second wave of COVID-19 and added that the government’s policy to avoid its responsibility at the time of a crisis could once again prove fatal for the country. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Saturday written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that there was a coal shortage that had been continuing for the third month in a row, which had affected power generation in major Central generating plants supplying electricity to Delhi. However, on Sunday, Union Energy Minister R.K. Singh said there is no coal crisis in the country. “When the Chief Ministers are appealing to the Centre to save the country from an incoming crisis, the Union Energy Minister is denying its existence and instead is suggesting that Mr. Kejriwal should not have written a letter to the Prime Minister in this regard,” Mr. Sisodia said. Mr. Sisodia urged the Centre to cooperate with States to tackle the situation and warned that there would be a bigger crisis if coal was not supplied to power plants. “If action is not taken on time, the whole country might have to face a terrible calamity as the whole system will come to a standstill. All industries will face shutdowns. The policy of the Center to run away from its responsibility has proved fatal for the country in the past and if the Centre does not accept its responsibility this time, the country will be pushed into a crisis once again,” Mr. Sisodia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/central-govt-turning-a-blind-eye-to-coal-crisis-says-sisodia/article36936411.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Family of riots accused fights for justice||Two years ago, in a photograph with his wife, standing near the fridge in his house, Mohammed Salim Khan wore a blazer and had black hair. In a photograph from the jail a few days ago, he has grown bald and his beard has turned grey. Salim — an exporter of shawls and scarves — was arrested on March 11 last year in FIR number 59 registered by the Delhi Police Special Cell under Sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code in connection with the communal riots that broke out in February 2020. This is the same FIR based on which former JNU student Umar Khalid among others have been lodged in Mandoli jail. Back at the house in north-east Delhi’s Yamuna Vihar, 48-year-old Salim’s wife Shavina (43) tries hard to control her tears as she says, “He sounds disoriented on the phone. He is starting to become forgetful. We have one son and two daughters. Sometimes, he thinks we have three daughters.” “I don’t see anything apart from dying now. I have gone so deep into depression... I don’t even feel like eating. I am alive because my children are outside,” Salim reportedly said in front of a judge a few days ago after seeking permission to speak. In the court — hearing him speak — was his daughter Saima (24) who along with her brother Sahil (23) have been taking care of the family and trying to encourage their father to not lose strength. But Saima has had to fight. “I ensure that my siblings and I are not photographed at court or anywhere because it’ll directly impact our future… our career. People in the neighbourhood do not know that my father is in jail. We have told him he has gone abroad for work,” she said. Saima has just completed her Bachelor of Dental Surgery and wants to pursue her Masters. Sahil completed his Bachelor of Business Administration in 2020 and had plans to go abroad for Masters to further expand his father’s export business in the U.K.. Another younger daughter is now in Class XII. All the higher education plans of the siblings have fallen apart at the moment as they manage their survival and pick up the pieces of their father’s export business, which had taken a severe hit. 12-page letter Salim wrote a 12-page summary of his life before jail, the events that led up to his arrest and his time in jail, and sent it to his family a few days ago through another riots accused who has been granted bail. “I was 47 when I came to jail; now, I look like I am 60,” he wrote. Worried about his children’s future due to a visible financial crisis, he wrote, “ Agar yahi halat rahi to dono betiyon ki padhai bhi ruk jaaegi (If this continues, further education of both my daughters will stop).” Salim had been an exporter of shawls and scarves for over 25 years and the business reached new heights in early 2000s. A man who has travelled the world for work and had plans to shift his business to London, now languishes in jail, waiting for court dates. “ 2015 main mujhe U.K. main shift hone ka pura chance mila tha par yeh kahkar chhor dia ki hamara desh India bohot accha hai. Aaj jab jail main sochta hun to hasi bhi aati hai aur rona bhi. (In 2015, I had had a chance to move to the U.K. but I thought our country was very good and quit the idea. Now, when I look back, I feel like crying and laughing at the same time),” he wrote in his letter. The reason he is worried about his children’s future is because after completion of his daughter’s higher education, he had planned to open a hospital — after taking a loan — where the poor could be treated for free. He also used to run an NGO, The Care, which would help the needy, his family said. “For the first three months after my father got arrested, we had no idea what to do with his established business, which was crumbling down. My brother then decided to understand the business and started to getting involved a little bit. That’s how we have been managing so far,” said Saima. The daughter claimed that he never actively participated in the protests but “unfortunately”, the protest site was barely a few hundred metres from his office in Chand Bagh and his route to and from home was via the protest site. In his letter to the family, he also said that a langar by advocate D.S. Bindra was set up barely 300 metres from his office-cum- manufacturing unit. He wrote that about four-six times a day, he would cross the protest site while going home for lunch, coming back, or bank work etc. On the day of protest as well, February 24, he was at his factory when violence broke out. “Construction work was going on in the shop next to my office. When violence broke out, the workers fled. I then took the articles that were lying outside — drum, bucket, wiper — and kept them (aside),” he wrote. Disclosure statement The Delhi Police Special Cell, in the chargesheet, claimed that Salim — in his disclosure statement — said that he along with advocate Bindra and others had erected the protest stage and he was assigned the task of maintaining the tent. He is also attributed to be saying that secret meetings were held in his office where the direction for the future course of action was decided and eventually followed by everyone. The police also told the court that during investigation, it was revealed that “accused/applicant Saleem Khan was using a mobile and the call detail record (CDR) of the said mobile number was collected from the service provider and was scrutinised”. The police claimed that his CDR showed that he was at Chand Bagh, Yamuna Vihar and Bhajanpura at the time of riots on February 24, which meant he was involved in the riots. The police have also submitted in the court a video in which Salim can be seen carrying a wooden stick. ‘No credible evidence’ Advocate Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, who is representing Salim, said, “Prosecution is simply relying on two CCTV footage captured near his office in Chand Bagh. In one video, he is empty-handed and walking on an inner lane, and in the other, he is carrying a wiper from his office. The police have no credible evidence against him. Apart from this, the police have illegally implicated him in three different cases on the basis of the same video footage in which he is carrying a wiper with different and contradictory narratives.” My father is struggling… he has heart ailments and needs medicines which he isn’t getting, a worried Saima said. “We talk to him for five minutes every day. That’s allowed. He asks about us and we ask about his day. We hide our pain and he hides his,” she said. Salim’s family — who feels he is depressed — urged him to utilise his time writing a book. He began with the 12-page letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/family-of-riots-accused-fights-for-justice/article36936407.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘As Delhi becomes a global city, people cling to caste, religious identities more’||The editors of the new book Colossus: The Anatomy of Delhi, which was released in India in September, professor of geography and urban studies at Temple University Sanjoy Chakravorty and assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University Neelanjan Sircar, discuss their findings. The book analyses results of an NCR-wide survey funded by the Center for the Advanced Study of India (CASI) at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, from late 2015 to early 2016, which the editors term a one-of-a-kind look at the metropolitan region. Q: In terms of the findings of the book, what were some of the highlights for you both? NS: Throughout the book, you realise that you have to cross-reference space, a social attribute or demography and the outcome you are interested in. For example, we find that even if you control for the wealth of a person, natives of Delhi have the first-mover advantage. They live in places that have better infrastructure than migrants. SC: For me, what it underlined was the information bubbles we all live in. We all ‘knew’ Delhi and it turned out that we didn’t really know Delhi. And that’s because our social networks are limited. There were two important things. First, how traditional Delhi is. There is this idea that people in cities are more advanced and liberal. But it turns out that it is not true in Delhi. It may not be as stuck in time as say, villages in Rajasthan and U.P. But it certainly isn’t a modern, cosmopolitan city as far as say getting along with other communities and marriage practices and eating practices are concerned. The village transferred to the city and the village habits really have not gone away. So marriage is conducted roughly the same way as it was 30 years ago. People don’t eat with outsiders, they don’t share meals with other communities. The very first time we presented this at an event at the Centre for Policy Research a couple of years ago, a lot of people were upset with us and said you are wrong. I would have not expected this myself because we don’t meet people from different social classes. Yes, there are casual interactions with auto drivers or service providers, but you don’t get to know what happens at home. At the same time, Delhi is very modern. There are RWAs, the politics, the engagement with politicians at all levels, dharnas and road blocks. Delhi is at the forefront among Indian cities in terms of overt politics, visible politics. The second thing that stood out was the multiple levels at which privilege, inequality and dominance work. For example, in access to drinking water and police services. Q: As you know, Delhi is in the process of master-planning, with the DDA having released its draft master plan 2041 recently, and the National Capital Region Planning Board is also drafting the Regional Plan-2041. How do you see this process, in the light of your findings? SC: Urban planning in India is not a democratic process, it never has been. Urban planning in the world in general is the upper middle class and the elite planning the cities that they want to live in. The master planning process is being dropped pretty much everywhere in the West in favour of citizen advocacy. Talking to citizens is the core of planning, but we are not there. There is a top-down nature of policy-making, probably more so today even more than 10 years ago. Very big decisions are being taken without any consultation. NS: It’s not that there aren’t skilled and talented people trying to put together master plans. What this perspective misses is that how do you go from planned to unplanned. If we go to any Indian city, there is a lot that is unplanned. Q: You’ve written that most residents of the NCR are not aware of the existence of the NCR. How does this inform the way they interact with it?  SC: I’m actually quite certain that 90% of Delhiites have never heard of the NCR. They could have heard the word somewhere but have no idea what it is. As long as its not a taxing authority or a voting authority, it has no organic meaning. It will remain that way. It will be an organisation that creates documents. Delhi has had many of these organisations. Q: One of the findings of the survey is that Muslims are more likely to live within 1km of each other than Scheduled Castes and Muslim households interacting with a neighbouring household are 80.6% of the time interacting with another Muslim household, while the number is 44.2% for SC households. What in your opinion does this say about the state of integration in the NCR? Is the situation improving or getting worse? NS: To be frank, India as a whole and that includes Delhi is getting worse if you’re Muslim. The Delhi riots are a manifestation of some of the troubles we have highlighted. The kind of social and spatial segregation that is there for the Muslim community at present, it’s hard to imagine it will unravel soon. The story with caste seems to be at the outset a bit more positive, though not on the most intimate of practices like marriage. SC: Religious polarisation is the goal of the current regime. Polarisation ultimately is most effective when there is segregation. We are slowly but inevitably moving in that direction. If we look for good news, there may be some in caste relations. I see hope in education, gender and gender relations. It is possible that this coming generation will all be educated at a level in which they become civic participants, active political agents, not partisans. We suggest that the more Delhi becomes this global modern city, the more people hunker down in their religious and caste identities. Q: Looking at the economic indicators, the survey shows the situation improving. Households that own a refrigerator and washing machine have increased, which may have an impact on health. Is that something that is clear from the data?  SC: Yes. Consumption is up and poverty is down. That is the India story. This is not taking into account the COVID-impact. We have hit a rough patch over the past couple of years. But the general trends are that people are eating better, they are more mobile, their houses are bigger and better finished. Inequality is, however, getting worse. The gap between the top and bottom is widening.  There are talented people trying to put together master plans. If we go to any Indian city, there is a lot that is unplanned Neelanjan Sircar   The master planning process is being dropped pretty much everywhere in the West in favour of citizen advocacy Sanjoy Chakravorty||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/as-delhi-becomes-a-global-city-people-cling-to-caste-religious-identities-more/article36936424.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC grants bail to man charged under POCSO Act||The Delhi High Court has termed “unfortunate” the practice of the police filing cases under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at the behest of the girl’s family, who object to her friendship and romantic involvement with a young man. ‘In a relationship’ Justice Subramonium Prasad made the remarks while granting bail to a 21-year-old man — who is facing charges of rape and sections under the POCSO Act on the complaint filed by a 17-year-old girl. The court noted that the victim and the man are more or less of the same age and photographs clearly show that they were in a relationship and “love between both of them cannot be ruled out as an option”. “This court cannot overlook the fact that the petitioner [man] is now only 21 having a complete life ahead of him. This court also cannot overrule their friendship as both of them were students of the same school,” Justice Prasad said. The court also took into consideration the statement of the girl that she would not like to pursue this case and wants to move on with her life and study ahead and would also not want her friend to suffer in jail. The girl told police that the incident happened in June last when she had gone to her friend's house to borrow books and on her way back, he stopped her and forcibly took her to the ground floor of his house. He then forcibly made her consume drinks following which she became unconscious. When she regained consciousness, she found that she was lying down and her body was paining. When she confronted him, he said since she was not adhering to his request for friendship, he committed rape. The FIR was lodged in August 2020 after the discovery that the girl was pregnant. After this, the man was arrested. The public prosecutor objected to the bail plea arguing that even if the young man and victim were friends and in a relationship, it would still attract the sixth clause under Section 375 of the IPC, which states that having sexual intercourse with the consent of a girl below the age of 18 would still constitute rape and would be punishable. The public prosecutor said the girl had been impregnated by the assault made by the man and she had to medically terminate her pregnancy, which has caused her much mental trauma. ‘Law misapplied’ “Consensual sex has been in legal grey area because the consent given by minors cannot be said to be a valid one in the eyes of law,” Justice Prasad said. Fearing a social backlash and to get the pregnancy medically terminated, this FIR has been filed giving it the colour of sexual exploitation and bringing it in the ambit of the POCSO Act, the court said. Justice Prasad remarked that the rigour of the law is being misapplied in this case. “The petitioner has been in jail for over 12 months...,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-grants-bail-to-man-charged-under-pocso/article36936404.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Tejaswini initiative helps build confidence: police||The presence of women constables and their identifying the needy and distressed people works as a catalyst for building confidence and courage among women and making them more aware of their own safety in the present times, the Delhi Police said on Sunday, while elaborating on Tejaswini, a women-centric safety initiative of north-west district. DCP (north-west) Usha Rangnani said three months after the implementation of the project, the tasks and assignments carried out by these women beat staff resulted in significant growth in terms of its reach and scope of work. “These women beat constables work in tandem with various NGOs, schools, colleges and other agencies to get insights and spread legal and social awareness of various issues concerning women and children,” the DCP said. The Tejaswini initiative was implemented on July 10 when 46 women beat constables were deployed in crime-infested and sensitive areas of various police stations, including JJ clusters of Jahangirpuri, Shakarpur and Pitampura residential areas. “The initiative aimed to reach out to women belonging to all strata of society and female senior citizens, and also to safeguard the rights and dignity of women and children in north-west district, thus creating such a conducive atmosphere where they feel at home...,” The police said not only do these women beat constables perform their regular duties along with their male counterparts, they also regularly do intensive and visible patrolling on ERVs, QRTs, motorcycle and scooters, and ensure safety and security of women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tejaswini-initiative-helps-build-confidence-police/article36936403.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||No seats after DU’s 2nd cut-off, candidates turn to other options||With the second cut-off list for Delhi University’s (DU) undergraduate courses giving little hope to candidates for securing a seat, the students who have not secured near-perfect scores are looking at options in other universities. The Capital has several options in Central universities like Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia and State universities like Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD), Indraprastha University and the recently opened Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University. They offer undergraduate courses through entrance tests and reservation for candidates from the Capital so that the sole criterion is not marks obtained in the Board examinations. However, some aspirants have realised that they needed to have planned for their admission process in advance, by taking the entrance examinations that were conducted before DU’s admission season began. ‘Delay due to COVID’ Neha Solanki, who was hoping to pursue a BSc (Hons) at DU, says that her score is a little short of 80%. She adds that she needs to start looking at options outside the Capital. “Securing an UG seat in the Capital is like playing a game. You have to start early and be guided by someone who has played it before. Due to COIVD and delay in the Board examination results, this time the rules of the game have changed as it has been difficult to keep track of the admission process of various universities,” says Ms. Solanki. While DU in its open house sessions for applicants said all its constituent colleges are of the same calibre, the National Institutional Ranking Framework, released by the Ministry of Education clearly puts one college above the other. Punya Saluja, a parent, feels that the hype surrounding DU blinds students and does not let them explore avenues like professional courses, which could help them secure good jobs. “My daughter does not have a score above 90% and I have encouraged her to take up courses that will allow her to take up internships and build her CV to be job-ready. It better to give students options rather than make them believe that they have failed by not securing admission in DU,” Mr. Saluja says. The Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU) — which was started by the Delhi government in August 2020 — is gearing up for its first intake of students. It promises to produce students who will be job-ready to be absorbed into the industry with the skill they develop. DSEU Vice-Chancellor Neharika Vohra says that the university has come up with an aptitude test that is not a part of the selection process to help applicants chose a degree that is related to their interests and make an informed choice. “The DNA of DSEU is to encourage students to choose a degree that is related to their interests. Students have been asked to take an interest test to help them make a choice as to what they offer like job-linked degrees. Our effort is to help students find more about the industry and the probable jobs by getting many interviews from people who have done well in the field. Students have been asked to watch the videos on the same before making a choice. The key point is that we want the student to exercise agency in choosing their field of study,” says Prof Vohra. At Ambedkar University Delhi, 85% of the seats are reserved for students from the Capital, giving them an edge over students competing to secure admission from other States. AUD, which is now over a decade old, is in expansion mode and providing an alternative to those students wanting to pursue the Arts. Jamia Millia Islamia is celebrating its centenary year has an admission process that includes an admission test so that candidates are judged not only on their Board examination results. A similar admission process is carried out by IP University that makes candidates sit for Common Admission Test. At present, the National Testing Agency conducts the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CU-CET) with 12 Central universities participating in it. Ahead of the admission process for DU, university officials had hinted that the CU-CET may be introduced this year but the university stuck to its regular cut-off method. With Yogesh Singh taking over as the new Vice-Chancellor, candidates applying next year will have to wait and watch if Board examination results will be the only key to securing admission. Mr. Singh on his first day after taking charge as Vice-Chancellor said that he would communicate with all stakeholders of the university and would come to a decision if any reforms are needed in the admission process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-seats-after-dus-2nd-cut-off-candidates-turn-to-other-options/article36936409.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Stubble burning: bio-decomposer solution to be sprayed on city farmlands from today||The Delhi government, in a move to provide an alternative to stubble burning and combat air pollution, will on Monday start its campaign to use bio-decomposer solution on farmlands under its winter action plan. Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the solution has been given free of cost to farmers who will spray it in over 4,000 acres. Last year, the solution was tried out in about 2,000 acres and the government claimed that it had yielded good results. Mr. Rai said there has been excitement among farmers after a third-party audit report of the solution showed positive results. “The Kejriwal government has appealed to all the States to help their farmers in decomposing the stubble by bearing the entire cost of spraying the bio-decomposer like the Delhi government is doing. From making the solution to its spraying in the field, the entire process costs less than Rs. 1,000 per acre,” Mr. Rai said. He further said that the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) too has ordered all States to use the bio-decomposer solution after the Delhi government submitted the third-party audit report. “WAPCOS, a Central government agency, had conducted the third-party audit of the impact of spraying the bio-decomposer on the stubble. The agency in its report has described the bio-decomposer a better solution for stubble decomposition,” the Minister said. The solution has been prepared in collaboration with Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, and the government is spending about Rs. 50 lakh from making the solution to spraying it, Mr. Rai added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/stubble-burning-bio-decomposer-solution-to-be-sprayed-on-city-farmlands-from-today/article36936413.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||Man arrested for killing wife, mother-in-law||A 35-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing his wife and mother-in-law in Dwarka, the police said on Sunday. DCP (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary said Mahesh killed his wife Nidhi (21) and mother-in-law Veero (55) over a personal dispute. After committing the crime, Mahesh surrendered at the Baba Haridas Nagar police station. Mahesh, who was unemployed, fired multiple bullets at the victims, an officer said. The police are now questioning him regarding the source of the illegal weapon. The police said he wanted to get a divorce but Nidhi denied him their child’s custody. The trio used to often argue over this issue. “A case under Section 302 (murder) will be registered,” Mr. Choudhary said, adding that the murder weapon has been recovered. He used to live at his wife’s house in Baba Haridas Nagar, the police said, adding that CCTV footage is being scanned to probe the sequence of events.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-arrested-for-killing-wife-mother-in-law/article36936402.ece
11 October 2021||New Delhi,||‘Divorced man has to support his children financially’||The Delhi High Court remarked that a divorced man has to financially support his children even after they attain the age of 18, noting that the entire burden of bearing the expenses of education cannot fall entirely on the mother. ‘Equal duty’ “A father has an equal duty to provide for his children and there cannot be a situation wherein it is only the mother who has to bear the burden of expenses for raising and educating the children,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said. The court made the remarks while rejecting a plea by a man against an earlier order of the High Court directing him to support his son, who is residing with his mother, with a sum of Rs. 15,000 per month till he completes his graduation or starts earning, whichever is earlier. Justice Prasad noted that the court cannot shut its eyes to the reality that simply attaining majority does not translate into the understanding that the major son is earning sufficiently. “A father is bound to compensate the wife who, after spending on children, may hardly be left with anything to maintain herself,” the High Court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/divorced-man-has-to-support-his-children-financially/article36936405.ece

11 October 2021||Pune,||Sanjay Raut likens Priyanka’s actions to that of Indira Gandhi||Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Sunday lavished praise yet again on the Gandhi family, likening Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her spirited action in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident while accusing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Trinamool Congress of indirectly aiding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by splitting votes. In his weekly column Rokhthok in the Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana , Mr. Raut said one could see shades of Indira in Ms. Vadra’s actions in Lakhimpur Kheri where the Congress leader had ‘exposed’ an “attempted cover-up” of the violence. Country galvanised “The whole country has been galvanised by Priyanka Gandhi’s illegal detention at Lakhimpur Kheri and her doughty resistance to the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh…On the morning of October 4, one could see the spirit of Indira Gandhi in her granddaughter, and as long as that spirit is alive, one can be sure that the flame of democracy is alive as well,” said the Sena MP, remarking that it was unfortunate that Rajiv Gandhi’s daughter had to battle police in this manner in the wee hours of the day. Mr. Raut also said Ms. Vadra and her brother, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, were the “only leaders” who could provide an alternative to the BJP at the Centre today. The Sena shares power with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra. “Even [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah sense this…hence, they want the Congress to remain weak. However, there is a difference between the BJP wishing the Congress to stay weak and other Opposition parties [read the TMC and the AAP] wanting the same. The overwhelming support that Ms. Vadra received after her detention in Lakhimpur Kheri is proof that it is not so easy to finish off the Gandhi family,” said the Sena leader. Mr. Raut drew parallels to Ms. Vadra’s detention with Indira Gandhi’s arrest 44 years ago on October 3, 1977. “At the time [in 1977], a united Opposition which did not want the Congress came together and defeated it. But today, there is neither any Jayaprakash Narayan nor any George Fernandes. So, it is surprising that a divided Opposition should wish to weaken the Congress,” he said, dismissing the TMC and the AAP as spoilsports bent upon weakening the Congress. Mr. Raut, who earlier this week had met Mr. Gandhi in Delhi to strategise on taking on the BJP, said the Congress leader was committed to fighting the Narendra Modi-led Central government. The Sena leader’s new fangled admiration for the Gandhi family is in stark contrast with his disparaging remarks in the recent past against the Congress party. In June, an editorial in the Saamana (where Mr. Raut is executive editor) had slammed Mr. Gandhi for “failing to provide effective leadership to his party and the United Progressive Alliance” (UPA), while speaking of Mr. Modi and the BJP in grudgingly admiring tones. BJP pounces on Raut The BJP pounced on Mr. Raut’s affinity with the Congress, with MLC Gopichand Padalkar wryly commenting that the Sena spokesperson seemed intent on ‘merging’ the Shiv Sena — founded by the late Bal Thackeray on the basis of ‘Hindutva’ — with the ideologically opposed Congress party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/raut-likens-priyankas-actions-to-that-of-indira/article36936585.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Taiwan won’t bow to China’s pressure: Tsai||Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Sunday Taiwan will not “bow to pressure” and would “resist annexation”, speaking amid rising tensions with China and a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to realise “complete reunification”. Ms. Tsai, during her National Day address in Taipei, said Taiwan’s “position on cross-strait relations remains the same: neither our goodwill nor our commitments will change.” “We call for maintaining the status quo, and we will do our utmost to prevent the status quo from being unilaterally altered,” she said, adding that “resolving cross-strait differences requires the two sides of the strait to engage in dialogue on the basis of parity.” Aerial intrusion “We hope for an easing of cross-strait relations and will not act rashly, but there should be absolutely no illusions that the Taiwanese people will bow to pressure,” Ms. Tsai said. The status quo has been coming under stress, withChina’s air force in recent days carrying out a series of aerial intrusionsintoTaiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone, with a record 38 aircraft on October 1, when China marked its National Day, followed by 39 on October 2 and 56 on October 4. Taiwan’s Defence Minister described the current tensions as the worst in 40 years. Mr.Xi on Saturday vowed that “reunification will be realised”and warned against any “external interference” on the Taiwan question, which is among the issues straining China-U.S. ties. He was speaking in Beijing a day ahead of October 10, which is marked in Taiwan as its National Day and celebrated in China as the anniversary of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, which led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC). Following the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang fled to Taiwan and declared Taipei as the ROC’s capital in 1949, while Mao Zedong’s Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China. The Communist Party still views Taiwan as its “province” and has pledged “reunification” as its goal. Charting its own course Ms. Tsai said Taiwan “will continue to bolster our national defence and demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves in order to ensure that nobody can force Taiwan to take the path China has laid out for us.” “This is because the path that China has laid out offers neither a free and democratic way of life for Taiwan, nor sovereignty for our 23 million people,” she said. On the aerial intrusions, Ms. Tsai said “the routinisation of Chinese military activity in Taiwan’s southwestern air defense identification zone has seriously affected both our national security and aviation safety.” “The situation in the Indo-Pacific region is becoming more tense and complex by the day. After taking complete control of Hong Kong and suppressing democracy activists, the Beijing authorities also shifted away from the path of political and economic development that they had followed since ‘reform and opening up’ began decades ago. At the same time, regional order is being challenged in the South and East China Seas,” she said. She called on the people of Taiwan to ‘renew with one another our enduring commitment to a free and democratic constitutional system” as well as a “commitment to resist annexation or encroachment upon our sovereignty.” The Taiwan President also highlighted Taiwan’s importance in supply chains underscored by the global shortage of semiconductor chips, as well as its geopolitical importance because of “a changing situation in the Indo-Pacific.” She referred specifically to the Quad - the India, Australia, U.S., Japan grouping — among those paying attention to the security situation the strait, saying that “the G7, NATO, EU, and Quad have all highlighted the importance of peace and security in the Taiwan Strait, while expressing concern over whether China may unilaterally undermine the status quo of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taiwan-wont-bow-to-chinas-pressure-tsai/article36935926.ece

Khan, passes away||Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced atomic scientist known as the ‘father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb’ under the clandestine enrichment programme and infamous for his controversial role in nuclear proliferation, died here on Sunday after a brief illness. He was 85. Khan, who was born in 1936 in Bhopal and migrated to Pakistan along with his family after the Partition in 1947, breathed his last at about 7 a.m. (local time) at the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) Hospital — the medical facility named after him. He was earlier discharged from a military hospital in Rawalpindi after undergoing treatment for COVID-19. Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed said that all efforts were made to save his life. “The Prime Minister has directed to bury Dr. Qadeer with full (state) honours,” Mr. Rashid said, adding that the Pakistan flag shall fly at half-mast on Sunday. Prime Minister Imran Khan said that he was “deeply saddened by the passing of Dr AQ Khan”. “He was loved by our nation bec of his critical contribution in making us a nuclear weapon state. This has provided us security against an aggressive much larger nuclear neighbour. For the people of Pakistan he was a national icon (sic),” he said in a tweet. Khan, considered as the father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb, is revered at home as a hero. He was also called a man who built the Muslim world’s first atomic bomb. The nuclear physicist was disgraced in 2004 when he was forced to acknowledge responsibility for nuclear technology proliferation and was forced to live a life of official house arrest. Khan was accused by the U.S. of sharing nuclear technology with North Korea and Iran. The U.S. State Department said in 2009 that Khan had run an “extensive international network for the proliferation of nuclear equipment and know-how that provided ‘one stop shopping’ for countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons.” This network’s actions had “irrevocably changed the proliferation landscape and have had lasting implications for international security,” it said.  According to an article dated January 31, 2018 published in the Foreign Policy magazine, “Khan built a clandestine global network that increased the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. Worse, he was never forced to identify the participants in his black market.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/scientist-behind-pak-nuclear-bomb-aq-khan-passes-away/article36935928.ece
11 October 2021||Tehran,||Iran makes 20% more enriched uranium||Iran has produced more than 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium, the country’s nuclear chief said, far more than what the UN nuclear watchdog reported last month. Mohammad Eslami said in an interview with state TV late on Saturday that under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the other signatories were to provide Iran with 20% enriched uranium needed for its research reactor. “But it was not delivered,” he said. “If we did not produce it by ourselves this would have turned into one of our problems.” Under the terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was prohibited from enriching uranium above 3.67% with the exception of its research reactor activities. Enriched uranium above 90% can be used in a nuclear weapon. In September, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to up to 20% fissile purity was estimated at 84.3 kg up from 62.8 kg three months earlier. Scientists estimate that at least 170 kg of enriched uranium is needed to make a bomb. The nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme, and is meant to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb. Tehran insists its programme is peaceful. The U.S. unilaterally pulled out of the deal in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump, but Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia have tried to preserve the accord.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-makes-20-more-enriched-uranium/article36935932.ece
11 October 2021||Tripoli,||Libyan rivals agree on pullout of mercenaries||Libya’s rival sides reached an initial agreement on the withdrawal of foreign fighters and mercenaries from the North African nation, the United Nations said. It is a key step toward unifying the violence-wracked country. The dispute over mercenaries and foreign fighters has long been an obstacle, particularly ahead of Libya’s landmark general elections due in December. Libya has been engulfed in chaos since a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The oil-rich country was for years split between rival governments, one based in the capital of Tripoli and the other in the eastern part of the country. Each side is backed by different foreign powers and militia groups. The UN mission mediating between the rivals said a 10-member joint military commission, with five representatives from each side, signed a “gradual and balanced” withdrawal deal on Friday, at the end of three days of talks facilitated by the UN in Geneva. The plan would be “the cornerstone for the gradual, balanced, and sequenced process of withdrawal” of the mercenaries and foreign forces, the mission said. Jan Kubis, the UN special envoy for Libya, welcomed the move as “another breakthrough achievement.” Libya’s split came into the forefront in 2019, when self-styled military commander Khalifa Hifter, allied with the east-based administration, launched an offensive to take Tripoli from armed militias loosely allied with the UN-supported but weak government in the country’s capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/libyan-rivals-agree-on-pullout-of-mercenaries/article36935933.ece

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A ‘Taiwan flashpoint’ in the Indo-Pacific||If the rising confrontation between the United States and China erupts into a clash of arms, the likely arena may well be the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is the unfinished business of China’s liberation under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949. The Guomindang (KMT) forces under Chiang Kai-shek lost the 1945-49 civil war to the CCP forces under Mao Zedong. Chiang retreated to the island of Taiwan and set up a regime that claimed authority over the whole of China and pledged to recover the mainland eventually. ‘Strategic ambiguity’ The CCP in turn pledged to reclaim what it regarded as a “renegade” province and achieve the final reunification of China. Taiwan could not be occupied militarily by the newly established People’s Republic of China (PRC) as it became a military ally of the United States during the Korean War of 1950-53. It was described as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” underscoring its strategic significance. This phase came to an end with the U.S. recognising the PRC as the legitimate government of China in 1979, ending its official relationship with Taiwan and abrogating its mutual defence treaty with the island. Nevertheless, the U.S. has declared that it will “maintain the ability to come to Taiwan’s defence” while not committing itself to do so. This is the policy of “strategic ambiguity”. China, on the other hand, is committed to pursuing peaceful unification but retains the right to use force to achieve the objective. This is its own version of strategic ambiguity. The PRC has pursued a typical carrot and stick policy to achieve the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland. It has held out the prospect, indeed preference for peaceful reunification, through promising a high degree of autonomy to the island under the “one country two systems” formula first applied to Hong Kong after its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. According to this formula, Hong Kong would retain its free market system and its political and judicial institutions and processes for a period of 50 years, thus enabling an extended and gradual transition. The same was promised to Taiwan, but with the added assurance that it could also retain its armed forces during the transition period. Economic links With China itself adopting market-oriented reforms since 1978 and becoming, over a period of time, a significant economic and commercial opportunity globally, Taiwan business entities have invested heavily in mainland China and the two economies have become increasingly integrated. Between 1991 and 2020, the stock of Taiwanese capital invested in China reached U.S. $188.5 billion and bilateral trade in 2019 was U.S. $150 billion, about 15% of Taiwan’s GDP. By contrast the stock of Chinese capital invested in Taiwan is barely U.S. $2.4 billion although investments through Hong Kong may be considerable. Taiwanese attempts to reduce the island’s economic exposure to China have not been successful so far. China hopes that the considerable economic benefits that Taiwan business and industry enjoy through a burgeoning relationship with China would weaken opposition to unification. By the same token, China is capable of inflicting acute economic pain on Taiwan through coercive policies if the island is seen to drift towards an independent status. Taiwan’s politics Taiwan has two major political parties. The KMT, dominated by the descendants of the mainlanders who came to the island along with Chiang Kai-skek in 1949, remains committed to a one-China policy and does not support the independence of Taiwan. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), on the other hand, is more representative of the indigenous population of the island, and favours independence. However, faced with aggressive threats from China and lack of international support, the demand for independence has been muted. China feels more comfortable with the KMT and is hostile to the DPP. Ever since the DPP under Tsai Ing-wen won the presidential elections in 2016, China has resorted to a series of hostile actions against the island, which include economic pressures and military threats. These actions have escalated since the re-election of Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 elections. Public opinion swung in her favour as China adopted a series of hardline policies in Hong Kong, abandoning the ‘One Country Two Systems’ formula promoted by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. China could no longer pretend that the model was relevant in any sense to Taiwan’s future under Chinese sovereignty. One important implication of this development is that prospects for peaceful unification have diminished. Sentiment in Taiwan in favour of independent status has increased. The escalating military threats against Taiwan, through daily violations of its air defence identification zone (ADIZ) and aggressive naval manoeuvres in the Taiwan Strait are currently deterrent in nature, aimed at heading off any move towards independence and its closer military relationship with the U.S. The U.S. stance While the U.S. does not support a declaration of independence by Taiwan, it has gradually reversed the policy of avoiding official-level engagements with the Taiwan government. The first breach occurred during the Donald Trump presidency when several senior officials, including a cabinet-level official, visited the island. The Joe Biden officials have continued this policy. The Taiwanese representative in Washington was invited to attend the presidential inauguration ceremony (Biden), again a first since 1979. Reports have now emerged that U.S. defence personnel have been, unannounced, training with their Taiwanese counterparts for sometime. In a new incident last week, a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine reportedly ran into an “unidentified object” while in the South China Sea. China has objected to these U.S. actions vociferously. The latest statement by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Taiwan on October 9, on the eve of Taiwan’s national day, responds to these developments. Mr. Xi said that unification should be achieved peacefully but added that the Chinese people have a “glorious tradition” of opposing separatism. Mr. Xi added, “The historic task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled and will definitely be fulfilled.” These statements are somewhat less aggressive and impatient than his earlier ones on Taiwan. This may be related to the recent telephone conversation between President Joe Biden and Mr. Xi when Mr. Biden reportedly assured Mr. Xi that the U.S. would abide by the “Taiwan agreement”, that is, the U.S. would not overturn its one China policy. Is China prepared to carry out military operations to invade and occupy Taiwan? In March this year, the U.S. Pacific Commander, Philip Davidson, warned that China could invade Taiwan within the next six years as part of its strategy of displacing U.S. power in Asia. He appeared to suggest that Chinese military capabilities had been developed in order to achieve this objective. Other analysts argue that cross-strait operations would be extremely complex and pacifying a hostile population may prove to be long drawn out and costly. China may, therefore, be content to head off Taiwan independence while continuing to build its capabilities and await a further relative decline of U.S. power and its will to intervene in the defence of Taiwan. Impact of alliances These calculations may be upset by accident or miscalculation, and the recent submarine incident is a warning in this respect. The recent crystallisation of the Quad, of which India is a part, and the announcement of the Australia-U.K.-U.S. alliance, AUKUS, with Australia being graduated to a power with nuclear-powered submarines, may act as a deterrent against Chinese moves on Taiwan. But they may equally propel China to advance the unification agenda before the balance changes against it in the Indo-Pacific. For these reasons, Taiwan is emerging as a potential trigger point for a clash of arms between the U.S. and China. In pursuing its Indo-Pacific strategy, India would do well to keep these possible scenarios in mind.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The many questions arising from QES data||The Labour Bureau released the results of the All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey (QES) for the first quarter (FQ) of 2021 (April to June). The survey covers establishments employing 10 or more workers in the organised segment in nine sectors (manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, education, health, accommodation and restaurants, IT/BPO, and financial service activities). These sectors account for 85% of the total employment in establishments employing 10 or more workers as per the Sixth Economic Census (EC), which serves as the basis of the QES survey. The data for QES were collected either telephonically or through visits. The report cautions that “verification of records has not been resorted to for collection of data”. This could have significant implications for the statistics generated from the survey. While the QES provides a demand side picture, the National Sample Survey or Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) gives the supply side picture of the labour market. The stated objective of the QES is to enable the government to frame a “sound national policy on employment”. India ratified the International Labour Organization’s Employment Policy Convention, 1964, which requires the ratifying countries to implement “an active policy designed to promote full, productive and freely chosen employment.” India does not have one till now. The PLFSs have not presented an encouraging picture of the labour market. The CMIE has been projecting a distressed labour market scenario, especially during the pandemic. Notwithstanding criticisms, the CMIE database has dominated the analyses and understanding of the labour market. This could be quite irksome to any ruling party. Thus, the government needed an ‘official’ database that projects a rosy picture of the economy and the labour market (remember the controversy over the release of the PLFS results in 2019, which showed the highest-ever unemployment rate of 6.1%). The government has also been using the payroll data periodically to show formal employment generation and/or recovery in employment during the pandemic. It is not surprising that the QES has reported a simple growth rate of 29% in employment in FQ2021 over 2013-14 (Sixth EC). Data that raise eyebrows However, strangely, the QES provides very broad employment figures — “3 crores and 8 lakhs approximately” in FQ-2021 against a total of 2 crores and 37 lakhs in these sectors taken collectively [in 2013-14]”. By any reckoning, these are impressive statistics. But let us put these figures in perspective. Between the Fifth EC (2005) and the Sixth EC (2013), employment grew by a simple growth rate of 38.13%. And between the Fourth EC (1998) and Fifth EC (2005), it grew by 21.13%.  The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) — a far more reliable indicator of growth rates spanning several years — between the two is 4.12%. The approximate CAGR between the 6th EC and FQ2021 is 3.33%. The remarkable simple growth rate reported above compares a normal period to a pandemic-ravaged period. The overall growth rate is incongruent with macro-economic factors and other labour market portrayals. The CMIE data revealed a rather discouraging picture in April as the salaried class shed an estimated 3.4. million jobs from the level in March 2021 and the urban unemployment rate was as high as 9.78%. Further, normal economic indicators like income growth rates, capacity utilisation, business confidence, aggregate demand measured by the Purchasing Managers’ Index and the Reserve Bank of India’s growth rates of high-frequency indicators during the pandemic did not show encouraging trends even though they were fluctuating. The provisional estimates of annual national income for 2020-21 showed contraction in manufacturing (-7.2.%), construction (-8.6%) and trade (-18.2.%), which are some of the sectors covered in QES. The real national income growth rates, though controversial for upward revisions, declined 2017-18 onwards — the annual average growth rate in 2013-14 to 2020-21 was 4.95%. Are we talking of employment growth despite economic slowdown – from jobless growth to job-loss growth to growthless job growth? Various surveys and reports, including those by the Central government, showed that the smaller establishments suffered much more than the bigger industries. This was surely more so during the more extensive lockdown period, April-June 2020, when they faced challenges concerning debt repayment, wage/salaries and statutory dues. They are also least likely to have permanent workers on their payroll. Given that nearly 75% of the estimated establishments employed less than 40 workers, as reported in the QES, one wonders about the credibility of two statistics reported in the report. One, that 87.5% of the estimated workers were regular workers and just about 2.1% (12.5% in construction) were casual workers. Two, even though excluding health and financial services, around 24-35% of the establishments were operational from March 25 to June 30, 2020, 66-86% of estimated employees received full wages including in the construction, trade and hospitality industries. We should treat these statistics as claims by employers rather than reliable data. The report throws up another perplexing statistic. It says contract workers accounted for 0.7% (IT/BPOs), 10.4% (manufacturing) and 17.6% (construction) and overall a measly 7.8%. According to the Annual Survey of Industries for 2017-18, 36.37% of the total workers are employed in the organised factory sector. However, the reported contra-statistics in QES are plausible because given the low employment demand, cost-minimising manufacturers would be more likely to engage permanent and possibly unionised and high-skilled workers while the flexible category workers will have to queue up for employment till better times come. On the flip side, the report concedes a decline in the share of female workers from 31% in the Sixth EC to 29% in FQ2021. Like the Sixth EC, it could have collected data on social aspects like caste and religion as the pandemic would have had differential impacts on social statuses of workers. The data on the formalisation of establishments as revealed by registration under the laws must take care of two aspects. One, there could be overlaps between the registrations (say, factories or shops registering under more than one law). Two, since this is an employment survey, it is relevant to consider labour laws under which the establishment can be registered like the Factories Act, Shops Act or the Building and Other Construction Workers Act and employ workers rather than including tax laws as QES does. A starting point We need to wait for unit level data to generate data at the disaggregated levels and create cross-tabulations to understand the labour market dynamics much better than the ratios released in this report. At any rate, the F12021 QES must be considered as a starting point of the new data set rather than as a continuum of the Sixth EC as the Seventh EC would enable sensible comparisons. Finally, it is baffling why the Labour Bureau has initiated five segmented employment surveys when it could have put in place a high-frequency labour market information base like most advanced economies.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A lengthening shadow of Tamil nativism||A recent public conference on the theme, “Tamil or Dravidian?”, was organised by the Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), featuring NTK leaders, a couple of veteran Tamil nationalist ideologues, and a hotchpotch of largely non-descript speakers. The points raised were that Dravidian politics had duped the native Tamil castes, led to an influx of immigrants, and was responsible for the troubles that the Eelam Tamils faced. The common point for all was that Dravidian politics had to go and be replaced by a nativist form of Tamil nationalism. The main speaker was the coordinator-in-chief of the NTK, Seeman, who, among other things, invoked Adolf Hitler to bolster his anti-Dravidian rhetoric. This is not the first time he has referenced Hitler positively. Public image Mr. Seeman’s route to fame was through public speeches at meetings organised by Dravidian collectives in the 2000s. He initially claimed to be inspired by both Periyar, and the chief of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Velupillai Prabhakaran. However, after Sri Lanka’s military defeat of the LTTE in 2009, Mr. Seeman abandoned the former for the latter. To Mr. Seeman, Prabhakaran is a leader not just for the Eelam Tamils but Indian Tamils as well. The NTK was floated in 2010 and claims to have popularised the image of Prabhakaran in Tamil Nadu, often making up apocryphal stories of friendship between Mr. Seeman and the LTTE leadership. However, the image that NTK is trying to cultivate is that of Mr. Seeman as the sole spokesperson of Tamils the world over. Leader identification matters The NTK pursues a programme of nativism in identifying its leaders. Apart from Prabhakaran, it identifies Tamil kings of yore, and a pool of modern Tamil leaders such as Iyothee Thass, Bharathiyar, Immanuel Sekaran, U. Muthuramalingam, M.P. Sivagnanam among others, as its inspirations and icons. To the NTK, the Tamil identity of these figures plays a greater role than the ideology they professed. The NTK’s targets for attacks are leaders of the Dravidian parties, especially C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, often on the specious claim that they belong to non-Tamil immigrant castes. Some in the NTK play lip service to E.V.R. Periyar, but they consistently try to downplay his central role in modern Tamil politics, owing to his irreverence for any form of identitarian parochialism. The NTK seeks to foreground only those who can claim to belong to a Tamil native caste, determined by birth in a Tamil clan ( kudi ) — their very definition of Tamil identity is based on this. Nationalism and politics Chauvinistic Tamil nationalism has historically had a marginal place in modern Tamil politics. For the good part, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) contained extremist Tamil elements and promoted a composite and pluralist approach to politics and identity. Even during the anti-Hindi agitations, neither caste-elites nor Hindi speakers were harmed. The conflict was on ideas rather than identities, as laid out by several Dravidian ideologues. The camaraderie between Periyar and Rajaji is also a testament to the same. Likewise, once they captured power, the Dravidian parties have maintained Tamil Nadu as a State free from major communal or ethnic conflagrations. Post the 1960s, Dravidian rule has also prevented the rise of violent movements threatening the sovereignty of India. While Tamil Nadu’s legislature is the most diverse in terms of caste representation across the country, localised caste conflicts of course are quite common in Tamil Nadu, with sections of Dalits usually being at the receiving end of atrocities. Likewise, of the more than 250 backward castes (https://bit.ly/3mymfgQ), quite a few have minimal or intermittent political representation. Both the NTK and Bharatiya Janata Party have tried to mobilise such caste groups that have been articulating their grievances by promoting leaders from the said communities in their party ranks. The target for both is Dravidian politics, specifically the DMK. While the BJP tries to unite such castes on the religious plank, the NTK tries to do the same on an ethnic nativist plank. The NTK’s Tamil nativism addresses the grievances of these castes with theories of a Dravidian conspiracy to secure the dominance of non-Tamil castes and a global conspiracy against the Tamil identity. Normally, such conspiracy theories are humourous, but when they are backed by a political party that secured an estimated 6.6% vote share in the recent elections, they are potentially dangerous. The inability of progressive governments to contain the class disparities generated by the current economic order engenders the proclivity for such parties. Mr. Seeman’s sympathisers are very active on social media, especially YouTube, characterised by conspiracy theories, abusive language and aggressive machismo, and rooted in an aggravated sense of Tamil victimhood. It is not unusual to spot them making threats of violence that they would unleash should they come to power. Their key targets of attack, apart from linguistic minorities in the State are Dravidianists, leftists and feminists. For long, several political parties and activist groups in Tamil Nadu have expressed solidarity with the Tamils of Sri Lanka and have supported calls for a just political solution for their crisis. The NTK has capitalised on a grave issue to promote its own chauvinistic variant of nativist nationalism. A danger The NTK continues to operate in the residual vote share space. Though the elections have become more competitive with the NTK’s participation, the two Dravidian alliances continue to garner 85% of votes. However, the NTK’s leader’s rhetoric has become shriller and the followers he inspires are restive. The NTK’s political offering could hurt Tamil Nadu’s composite social fabric especially when the current regime is attempting to cover more ground inter alia in empowering marginal backward castes, Dalits and women, reducing caste-class disparities, and upholding the federal ethos of the country.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Throttling the press in J&K||A major casualty of the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, has been press freedom in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). This has led to the problem of disinformation and is causing great anxiety in the region. The feeling of alienation in the Kashmir Valley is inimical to the national interest besides the interests of Kashmiris. Historically, the press in J&K used to highlight democratic, anti-feudal and secular struggles. It supported the efforts to accede with India as the Maharaja wavered and the political leadership under Sheikh Abdullah threw its weight behind democratic and secular India. The Urdu daily, Ranbir, was banned by the monarchy in June 1947 for demanding accession to India and the release of Sheikh Abdullah. The ban was eventually lifted. The editor of an Urdu weekly, Pukar, was also threatened in 1942 by the monarchy as the paper supported the Quit India movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. Government-regulated press Nowadays, it is painful to see the newspapers of Kashmir in the morning. There is nothing about the current political situation in J&K; there are only government press releases. There is hardly any room for political parties and their statements. Newspapers mostly carry advertisements or advertisement-cum-statements of government officials and senior government functionaries. Government advertisements are used as an instrument to force editors to control the media narrative. And if a newspaper does not conform, it has to face action: advertisements are abruptly cancelled or investigating agencies carry out raids. Our journalist friends tell us that it is routine for the police to call them and seek information about them and their relatives. These actions only send a message to the larger journalistic community that freedom of the press, which is implied in the freedom of speech in the Constitution, is under threat. More and more journalists are being harassed since the administration introduced the revised Media Policy in 2020, which effectively gags the media. The Press Council of India has constituted a three-member fact-finding committee to inquire into the allegations of intimidation and harassment of journalists. The Council is scheduled to visit J&K. The aim of the Media Policy, which has been formulated without any consultation with the media groups, seems to be to marginalise the local media and build the government narrative. The press in J&K is now virtually a government-regulated one. Strategy to prevent disinformation The denial of press freedom in J&K should be seen from a larger perspective. First, in this age of social media, where information and narratives are shared through encrypted platforms, it is important to protect the general public from disinformation and fake news. While state media outlets have a role to play in this, the public at large relies on sources of information which are seen as being more credible and independent. In this connection, allowing professional reporters to perform their task without being under duress or facing threats is at the heart of any strategy to prevent disinformation. After all, journalists are accountable to their newspaper editors who, in turn, have to abide by the laws of the land. Otherwise, in an environment where government press releases fill the newspaper space, the public will invariably reach out to easily available social media platforms which are notorious for feeding people with sensational, false information. In Kashmir, the information vacuum is a breeding ground for fake news. This has security implications as well. Second, J&K is a battleground of narratives at present. A credible narrative rooted in truth and honesty will win this battle. This can be met by allowing professional reporters to gather information, and editors to share their editorials in a freer environment. The lack of a democratic government has closed all avenues of redress. The government is not amenable to public sentiment as it has nothing to lose by alienating the people and the press. When journalists say it has become impossible for them to do normal reportage, it must be seriously taken by the courts. The judiciary must intervene to restore the dignity of the fourth estate and take serious cognisance of the cases filed against journalists and newspapers. If courts look the other way today, it will not augur well for democracy. More broadly, the refusal to integrate J&K with the Indian democratic tradition that provides for press freedom continues to be the main impediment for J&K’s emotional relationship with the country.

Like every year, names like Haruki Murakami, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o and others did the rounds. Mr. Gurnah’s award has disappointed all the speculators. The jury is out, and the readers are divided. Some also wonder if he is really that good, but we hear that every year, don’t we? A safe choice Often criticised for its Eurocentrism or affinity for obscure white writers, the Nobel Committee has made a safe decision by picking Mr. Gurnah. He hails from Tanzania and later escaped to Britain. Mr. Gurnah is the fifth writer from Africa to win the award. He is a writer of migration, displacement, post-colonial identity – all themes and issues that have come to dominate literary conversations the world over. These are also conversant with the realities of the world we live in today, where large-scale migration and refugee crisis make headlines every other day. Mr. Gurnah’s novels and stories therefore interest disciplines beyond literary studies, such as sociology and anthropology. This could also be seen as the Nobel Committee’s politically appropriate gesture after having made several controversial choices in the recent past. Writer and publishing expert Jane Friedman tweeted saying that Mr. Gurnah had only sold about 3,000 print copies in the U.S. market and his latest novel does not even have a U.S. publisher. Several writers retweeted her post drawing comfort from the fact that poor sales may not be the end of the road for them. Numbers are just a publishing game, after all. Since the announcement of the award, Mr. Gurnah’s books are hard to find online or their price has considerably increased. Bookstores will also run out of copies they had stocked. There will be new commissions, translations into other languages will follow, upcoming book tours will be organised for the new Nobel Laureate. His publishers will benefit from the awards as all publishers do when one of their writers wins the big prize. It is nothing short of a publishing blitzkrieg. An industry game But does the Nobel Prize really change our lives as readers or the health of our literary cultures? The euphoria over the winner will eventually die down. The media will find another favourite in a few months. Another big award will be announced soon, and the same circus will follow. This is nothing more than an industry game. Numbers lead to more numbers. Mr. Gurnah has been an active writer and theorist of post-colonial studies for a long time. Why should we rely upon an award to discover him as a writer? Doesn’t that indicate a systemic problem? We also ought to probe the relevance of these awards to a generation that doesn’t seem to believe in the reputation that being published in certain forums, such as The New Yorker , brought once upon a time. The problem with awards is their complete failure in creating curiosity among readers. The curiosity is always for the award or the individual winner and not for purposes of reading or literature in general. If philosopher and critic Roland Barthes were alive, he would have probably written an essay titled ‘Death of Curiosity’ bemoaning the literary culture we have become that lives in the shadow of awards. This is also the biggest fallout of neoliberal capitalism which creates momentary interest in an individual before finding another icon to replace the existing one. This obsession with the individual feeds into a culture of adulation and not critical questioning or self-reflection. In India too, many awards celebrate the best in Indian writing. There’s no denying the fact that awards help writers find new readers and brings them some financial rewards which might help to start their next project or give them more time to work on their next book. But we cannot become a culture held hostage by awards which then determine what we read and how.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A probe after prodding||The arrest of Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home, Ajay Mishra, appears to be a course of action impelled mainly by the intervention of the Supreme Court, which voiced its dissatisfaction with the way the Uttar Pradesh police were handling the killing of four farmers and four others during a protest. By taking cognisance of the incidents that took place during a farmers’ protest at Tikonia in Lakhimpur-Kheri district, the Court may have helped infuse some much-needed impetus to the investigation. The Bench gave enough time until its next hearing on October 20 to the police to pursue the probe diligently, but not without thinking aloud on whether any other agency ought to take it over and asking the State police chief to preserve the evidence. The arrest of the Minister’s son, coming after he had skipped an earlier summons and was questioned for long hours once he appeared, is largely in response to the Court’s criticism. The Bench, headed by the Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana, wondered how investigators in a murder case could merely issue summons to the prime suspect instead of taking steps to apprehend him. Scepticism about the intentions of the State police is not misplaced. It is not the first time that the initial response is one of hesitancy and obfuscation, but once an incident blows up enough to occasion judicial intervention, there is some action. What is known so far is that vehicles in the Minister’s convoy ploughed through a group of farmers, causing four deaths. Three others may have died in retaliatory violence by the infuriated mob, while Raman Kashyap, a television reporter, may also have been run over. Initial reports that the driver lost control after being hit by a hail of stones have been superseded by footage that seems to show the vehicle being driven into a group of unsuspecting people. The FIR says Ashish Mishra was in one of the cars, even though he claims to have been elsewhere. The role of the Union Minister should also be subjected to scrutiny, as some reports suggest he may have made a provocative speech earlier to the effect that the protesting farmers should either mend their ways or he would set them straight. The mention of a ‘conspiracy’ in the FIR gives scope to the police to examine this angle. It is regrettable that the Union government is noticeably silent, and there appears to be no effort to advise Mr. Ajay Mishra to step down until his and his son’s names are cleared. It is difficult to see how an impartial probe can go on as long as he is in office, and his party’s government in the State is seen to be soft on the accused. The onus is on the Uttar Pradesh police now to conduct a credible investigation, if the Court does not replace the present set of investigators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-probe-after-prodding/article36935893.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A homecoming||Air India, the airline started by J.R.D. Tata in the 1930s, is all set to return to the Tata fold after a 68-year-long journey as India’s state-owned flag carrier. The Centre’s announcement on Friday that Tata Sons’ subsidiary Talace Pvt. Ltd. was the winning bidder for the 100% stake in the debt-laden airline rings the curtain on the government’s multi-year effort to privatise the loss-making carrier. Talace emerged winner in the two-horse race by bidding to take over Rs. 15,300 crore of Air India’s more than Rs. 60,000 crore of accumulated debt and offering an additional Rs. 2,700 crore in cash for the Government’s equity stake. For the Tatas, who have retained an abiding interest in the country’s airline industry and currently majority own both a budget carrier, AirAsia India, and a full-service airline, Vistara, the Air India acquisition brings opportunities to gain scale and synergies at a significant level. With Air India and its low-cost unit, Air India Express, together serving 55 overseas destinations, holding over 3,000 landing and parking slots, operating a 141-aircraft fleet of wide-body long-haul jets and narrow body planes for shorter flights, and the parent holding membership of the 26-airline Star Alliance, the Tatas in one stroke add unparalleled global reach among Indian carriers. Air India’s 13.2% consolidated market share of domestic traffic as of August also gives the group a more competitive combined share of almost 27%, albeit still a substantial 30 percentage points adrift of market leader IndiGo. The Centre, for its part, can finally heave a sigh of relief at having successfully exited the commercial aviation space, a high-cost industry that most governments around the world have left in the hands of private carriers so as to ensure taxpayers’ money is deployed more meaningfully in social and strategic sectors. After having ploughed in more than Rs. 1-lakh crore of capital in the past decade alone and seeing Air India suffer a daily loss of over Rs. 20 crore, the Government’s desperation to cut its losses and close out a fire sale is understandable. The pandemic’s impact on public finances and the carrier’s operations, especially given the devastating impact on air travel both domestic and international, is sure to have helped spur the Government’s decision to agree to not only absorb 75% of the carrier’s debt, but to also pick up the tab on medical benefits for former employees. And in a bid to protect the interests of the more than 13,000 permanent and contractual staff at the airline and its unit, the government has bound Talace to ensuring there should be no job cuts for at least one year. Still, integrating the state-run carrier’s sizeable workforce is going to be one among the many serious challenges, awaiting the Tatas. To turn around Air India at a time of soaring fuel costs and COVID-hit air travel, is sure to test the conglomerate’s managerial mettle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-homecoming/article36935894.ece

He said he was “shocked and disturbed” to find that the research, at the University of Cincinanati’s College of Medicine, was going on without the patients being informed of its prime purpose. “I believe this project represents an incredible infringement of individual liberty, and establishes a dangerous precedent for the reduction of human rights in our society”, he wrote yesterday to the Defence Secretary, Mr. Melvin Laird. Mr. Kennedy asked Mr. Laird for the full report of the 11-year-old project. According to the report, first revealed in the Washington Post , the Pentagon’s defence nuclear agency has paid the university $850,000 for treating 111 patients. The patients, all with tumours on several parts of their bodies, are recruited for “whole body” doses of radiation after they have been told they can no longer be helped by surgery, drugs or selective radiation, the paper had reported. The patients were not told that the Pentagon was giving funds for their treatment, or that the main purpose of the research was to test the probable effects of radiation such as would be received on the battlefields during a nuclear explosion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pentagon-tests-with-cancer-patients/article36935911.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Q.Please advise whether as per IRDAI norms it is mandatory for a health insurance company to provide voice conversation in case policy is purchased online and proposal form is not physically signed? I also request you to provide the relevant IRDAI circular. J. K. SINHA A.When an insurance policy is sold by a tele-caller, the call has to be recorded and you, as the customer, are entitled to a voice copy at any time during the term of the policy or until a satisfactory settlement of claim, whichever is later. Anytime a policy is issued without obtaining a proposal in physical form, your insurer has to send you, along with the policy bond, a verbal transcript of the voice/ electronic record of the queries and the answers to those queries, on the basis of which the policy has been underwritten. The insurer is supposed to also preserve such records securely. You can download a copy of the Guidelines for Distance Marketing from IRDAI’s consumer education website, www.policyholder.gov.in. On the home page click on Protecting You ‘Already in Place’ ‘Distance Marketing’ and download a copy of the guidelines. Insurance-related query Q.My husband and I are working in a private firm. We are planning to take a health insurance cover and a term insurance plan although we are covered by our employer. Can you suggest some of the best health as well as term insurance plans? Also, can we avail a single term insurance that covers both of us? SRUTHI M. NAIR A.Taking control of your own health insurance is a good move. It can be a supplement to your employer’s health scheme and also serve as your safety net independently. Depending on your age, health status and location, please choose the maximum sum insured you can afford the premium for. This way you work off your waiting period for making claims under various clauses and also accumulate incentives for no-claim years. Keep the policy valid and upgrade your sum assured periodically. At some point supplement your coverage with a top-up policy. The health insurance company you choose should have the covers and options you require and a reputation for efficiency and customer friendliness. The former you can find out through old-fashioned research on the internet and talking to representatives of the companies for specific information. The latter will be apparent if you quiz your friends and relatives who are their customers. It is also reflected in a high claims settlement ratio, a number you can find from the company’s websites and also from the regulator’s website. You will need your preferred hospital to be part of the insurer’s hospital network in order to get cashless claims. This will be a blessing at a time of stress when a family member is hospitalised as it can work seamlessly with the company and its third-party administrator (health services), the TPA, taking care of the paperwork and the payments directly with the hospital while you focus on getting well. Of course, if you wind up having to go to a non-network hospital, you have to pay the hospital and make a claim with the insurer through the TPA to get a reimbursement. If you have a satisfactory relationship with a general insurance or health insurance company or its agent/ broker already, consider that company as a first option. The other decision to make is whether to take a family floater cover or individual covers. Individual covers are recommended as they give you better coverage, which will be reflected in the premium cost. Also, each of you is likely to claim tax benefits under Section 80D of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the premium. Term policies are an excellent option for life insurance. Starting out at an early enough age, the premium is almost negligible and it will serve as a very price efficient cover. Joint cover versus individual cover is something you can decide on depending on costs and attendant benefits and choosing the company to insure with follows the same broad approach as for the health policy. You can enhance cover by taking additional policies over time. Buying term policies online give you some cost advantages.

In the non-Olympic, 25-metre standard pistol and 50-metre free pistol events, India asserted its quality in both the junior men and junior women’s events. Vijayveer Sidhu beat his twin brother Udhayveer Sidhu for the gold in the standard pistol event, winning on better score of inner-10s 17x to 14x after the two tied on 570. In the free pistol event, Arjun Singh Cheema, Shaurya Sarin and Ajinkya Chavan were all tied on 549 and won the gold to bronze in that order, on the basis of the inner-10s. The trio denied a medal for Abdul-Aziz Kurozi of Belarus who shot 548. Rhythm Sangwan collected another gold in style, as she won the junior women’s standard pistol event with a score of 573, an eight-point margin over Niveditha Nair. India wound up the championship with 16 gold, 15 silver and nine bronze medals. It was a distant second spot for the USA with seven gold, eight silver and six bronze. India won 40 of the 114 medals.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Dhoni turns back the clock, steers Super Kings into a ninth final||In IPL 2020, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) was the first team to be eliminated from the playoffs race. Nearly 12 months later, M.S. Dhoni’s men have completed a remarkable turnaround to become the first side to reach the IPL 2021 final, their ninth overall. The Super Kings showed how to win big matches with a four-wicket victory against Delhi Capitals (DC) in Sunday’s IPL Qualifier 1 in Dubai. With 24 needed from 12, Avesh Khan bowled the 19th over and got Ruturaj Gaikwad for 70 off his first ball. Dhoni came ahead of Ravindra Jadeja and with Moeen Ali took 11 off the 19th over to make it 13 off six. Finisher at work Rishabh Pant turned to Tom Curran — Rabada had an over left — for the final over. Curran got Moeen out off his first ball, but couldn’t deny the timeless finisher, Dhoni, who sealed the chase with three fours and two balls to spare. CSK’s run-chase got off to a rocky start when Faf du Plessis was bowled by Anrich Nortje. But his departure didn’t affect the tempo as Ruturaj and Robin Uthappa — promoted ahead of Moeen — put on some breathtaking strokeplay. Uthappa struck two fours and as many sixes off Avesh Khan as CSK cruised to 59 for one at the end of the PowerPlay. Uthappa reached his fifty in the 10th over, off 35 balls and then brought up the century stand in the 13th over before being expertly caught by Shreyas Iyer on the boundary for 63. Shardul Thakur, promoted to No. 4, fell in the same over. And when Ambati Rayudu was run out — Shreyas again — in the next over, CSK had lost three wickets for just six runs. DC, which conceded just one boundary each in the 16th and 17th overs to mount the pressure, then ran into Dhoni. Earlier, Chennai won the toss and inserted Delhi. Prithvi Shaw began in streaky fashion, top-edging Josh Hazlewood for two boundaries in the second over. He then took 16 off Deepak Chahar’s second over with four fours. A square punch through point stood out. DC had raced to 36 when Hazlewood had Dhawan caught behind. That did not deter Shaw, who collected 13 off Shardul’s first over. Shaw got a reprieve on 42 when Dhoni dropped him. Hazlewood, meanwhile, picked up his second when he removed Shreyas. With Capitals 51 for two after six overs, Axar was promoted to No. 4. But the move backfired as he fell for an 11-ball 10 to off-spinner Moeen. Against DC, a side with a clutch of left-handed batters, Moeen bowled his full quota for 27 runs. Meanwhile, Shaw brought up his fifty in 27 balls before Jadeja got him for 60 off 34. Pant and Hetmyer bided time before upping the ante. Hetmyer and Pant collected 13 and 12 off the 17th and 18th overs, respectively. Bravo removed Hetmyer for 37 to end an 83-run fifth-wicket stand. Pant finished unbeaten on 51.  And the king is back... the greatest finisher ever in the game.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Shaw, Pant propel Capitals to 172||Prithvi Shaw’s blistering fifty at the top coupled with death-over fireworks from Shimron Hetmyer and Rishabh Pant took Delhi Capitals to 172 for five in Qualifier 1 against Chennai Super Kings in Dubai on Sunday. An unchanged Chennai side won the toss and inserted Delhi. Before Sunday, of the 10 night games in Dubai this year, seven had been won by sides chasing. So, M.S. Dhoni's decision to field first did not come as a surprise. With Marcus Stoinis still not fit, DC picked Tom Curran over Ripal Patel. Shaw began in streaky fashion, top-edging Josh Hazlewood for a four and a six in the second over. Deepak Chahar has dismissed Shaw six times in the IPL. But tonight, he was at the receiving end of Shaw's ire. He took 16 off Chahar's second over with four hits to the fence. Regal shot A regal square punch through point stood out. DC raced to 36 for no loss after Shikhar Dhawan stepped out and hit Hazlewood back over his head for four. Just when Dhoni's men would have started feeling the pressure, Hazlewood had Dhawan caught behind with a back of a length ball that seamed and bounced to find the outside edge. That did not deter Shaw, who turned his attention to Shardul Thakur and collected 13 off his first over, including two maximums. He got a reprieve on 42 when Thakur flummoxed Shaw with a slower ball, inducing a mistimed cut, but Dhoni couldn't hold on behind the stumps. Hazlewood, meanwhile, picked up his second when a leading edge off Shreyas Iyer's bat settled in Ruturaj Gaikwad's hands. With Capitals 51 for two after six overs, Axar Patel was sent in at No. 4, possibly to lengthen the batting by pushing Rishabh Pant and Shimron Hetmyer down the order. But the move backfired as Axar fell for an 11-ball 10 off off-spinner Moeen Ali. At the other end, Shaw brought up his fifty in 27 balls before Ravindra Jadeja's golden arm struck. Shaw was out for 60 off 34; he tried to go aerial but found Faf du Plessis at long-off. Capitals were 80 for 4 in 10.2 overs when Pant and Hetmyer joined forces. Against DC, a side with a clutch of left-handed batters, Moeen bowled his full quota for 27 runs and conceded a solitary six in his spell. Pant and Hetmyer nudged the ball around for ones and twos through the middle overs with the occasional boundary. After the 16th over, the Capitals were 128 for 4 when the two batters decided to up the ante. Hetmyer brought up the fifty stand with a boundary before he and Pant collected 13 and 12 off the 17th and 18th overs, respectively. Bravo removed Hetmyer for 37 to end a 50-ball 83-run stand. Thakur bowled the final over which went for eight runs as Pant finished unbeaten on 51.   CSK pips DC, enters final  CSK made 173 for six in 19.4 overs to beat DC by four wickets.

11 October 2021||BENGALURU,||The decline of Indian tennis from a pre-eminent place to its lowest ebb||In the last two years, Sumit Nagal has been central to all three stories in Indian men’s tennis that has got the fans most excited. On his Grand Slam debut at the 2019 US Open, he took a set off Roger Federer and became the toast of the nation. A year later in New York, he became the first Indian in seven years (since Somdev Devvarman at the 2013 US Open) to win a singles match at a Major. At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, he became the first Indian in 25 years (since Leander Paes at Atlanta 1996) to win a singles match at the quadrennial extravaganza. What Nagal managed was indeed praiseworthy. But how did a sport so integral to the Indian psyche a few decades ago, which produced Grand Slam singles semifinalists, had players in the top-20s and 30s and reached the Davis Cup finals thrice reduce itself to exulting after routine, run-of-the-mill successes? Not a pretty picture India currently has no men’s singles player in the top-150 and Nagal’s first round appearance at the Australian Open – courtesy a wild card – was the lone Major main draw singles match featuring an Indian. It recently lost a Davis Cup Group I (tier II) match to an unheralded Finland. Another loss next year will relegate it to tier III, a sorry state of affairs. Among women, Ankita Raina has done well to enter the doubles top-100, win a WTA Tour-level trophy and feature in multiple Grand Slam main draws. But to this day, Sania Mirza’s No.27 remains the best singles ranking achieved by someone representing India and that came more than 14 years ago. No one else has even cracked the top-100. There has been success in doubles with the likes of Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Sania herself winning Majors. But on a global scale, a nation’s prowess is measured solely on singles performances and as one noted coach put it, “there won’t be a player who picks up a racquet saying he is going to be World No.1 in doubles.” “You feel like you are very alone when you are trying to make it from India,” says Somdev Devvarman, whose career-high ranking of No.62 (2011) is still the best among men after Ramesh Krishnan’s No.23 (1985). “In terms of support systems, it’s a really lonely place. It is getting tougher and tougher [to break through] internationally, and at the same time other Asian countries, small European countries are doing things right and we are not. The effort is incredibly individual here and if it’s that way, it’s going to be a tough road.” Deficiencies exposed Worldwide, tennis players excel when there is a robust home circuit comprising both ATP Challenger and ITF Futures tournaments, adequate financial support, sponsorships, good coaching and fitness programmes. In India, each of these is a struggle. To be sure, these are problems that predate COVID-19 and the pandemic has just ruthlessly exposed the deficiencies. From a high of five Challenger tournaments in 2014, India hosted four in 2015, three in 2018 and two in 2019. Last year, it had one and the current year will pass without a single Challenger. Even the ATP 250 tour event, a near certainty for two decades across Chennai and Pune, wasn’t held this year because of COVID-19 and it looks set to miss its 2022 date too. “We need a system from the grassroots, coaching, support…none of which we really have. But even if all those things didn’t exist, if we had 20 odd tournaments a year, people will find a way to succeed,” says Prajnesh Gunneswaran, India’s top-ranked singles player at 164. “More than one Tour event (ATP 250), I think Challengers and Futures will make a bigger impact. Who have been the guys getting to play the ATP 250? Myself, Sumit, Ramkumar [Ramanathan]. We could possibly play Tour events at many places. But are [Sidharth] Rawat (No. 566) and Sasikumar Mukund (No. 392) playing them? How do they get that exposure?” The Italy example What Italy has done can be instructive. In the last full season before the pandemic, Italy hosted 18 Challengers, of which Italians won eight, including two by a young Jannik Sinner. Between 2018 and 2019, Italy was able to double the number of players in the top-100, from four to eight. In the same period, Sinner – who also won two ITF World Tour Level tournaments (Futures) at home in early 2019 – jumped from World No. 763 to World No. 78. He went on to win the ATP Next Gen tournament – also held in Italy – and is now World No.14. Italy currently has nine players in the top-100. “The advantage of having so many Challengers is that the federation has the wild cards and four or five young Italians will play the main draw at every tournament,” says Paolo Lorenzi, a former top-50 player. “They watch other players, practise with them and it helps. One of those, [Matteo] Berrettini, is now in the top-10. In India, there was the ATP 250, one Challenger in Bengaluru and one in Pune. But in Italy we have like 20 which means 20 chances!” Even in Spain and France, the stories are similar. In 2019, Spain conducted seven Challengers and had five home winners. France organised 15 and saw seven winners. By the end of 2019, France, Spain and Italy had the most players in the year-end top-100 with 12, 10 and eight respectively. At the KPIT MSLTA Challenger that ran for six straight years from 2014 to 2019 in Pune, Yuki Bhambri won the title twice and Prajnesh finished runner-up twice and Ramkumar Ramanathan once. The first two editions of the $162,000 Bengaluru Open in 2017 and 2018 saw Indian winners, Nagal and Prajnesh. The latter, unsurprisingly, reached a career high No.75 in April 2019. “If you do well at home, you will have the confidence to think about playing similar tournaments abroad,” says Ankita Bhambri, India’s Billie Jean King Cup (erstwhile Fed Cup) coach. “I remember playing an ITF 25k and a 50k event in Delhi and another city. It gave me the confidence to add a 75k in Spain and hope to do well. I was much more confident and I actually qualified for it. I may have never been able to do it if I didn't have those tournaments in India.” Crippling burden The financial burden of having to travel abroad for every tournament can be crippling. It brings with it the pressure of having to do well in nearly every tournament just to cover the costs. “If you want to play at a good level, you might need around 30 lakh rupees per year,” says 26-year-old Niki Poonacha, ranked No. 784. “It also depends on the region you play in, Europe or Asia, with or without a coach.” “But you need to reach at least the semifinals to break even and have some 10k or 20k in hand. That is big pressure. You have to always play with the future in mind. Everybody is human. Even if you are very tough mentally, there will be the odd occasion when you will ask if it’s even worth it.” That kind of support may be hard to come by in India. Governments, private funding bodies and sports foundations seem singularly focussed on increasing the medal count at multi-sport events like the Olympics and Asian Games. Tennis does not provide as many medals as shooting or athletics and is still predominantly an individual sport. Sunil Yajaman, joint-secretary of the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association that conducts the Bengaluru Open, feels that governing bodies, and prestigious clubs that have long patronised tennis, should take the lead in the sport’s development. “For the $162,000 Challenger we conduct, our budget will be around 3 crore rupees. Reaching out to corporates will be tough because all businesses are stressed now. It would help if the National federation and State associations create a corpus, and start packaging and marketing the tournament well. If that is done, holding Futures tournaments shouldn't be tough at all.” “It will be great if the Central government can earmark a budget for conducting international events, not just for tennis, but for all sports. We are not here to make money from the tournaments. It will help the sport. The government needn’t fund the whole of it. Even 30% to 40% will be of immense help.” Keeping up with the times Apart from the lack of tournaments and finances, playing styles, coaching and surfaces are factors too. In early July, journalist Matthew Willis pointed out that the average height of the ATP top-10 in 2021 was nearly 5cm more than it was in 2011, and correspondingly, the first-serve percentage, service games won and aces per match have all gone up. The rise of the ‘big game’ players like Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Berrettini in recent times is thus part of the norm. Ramkumar has a style that mirrors this, albeit without the security of a solid backhand. But consistency and tactics have been his bane. In 2017, he stunned Dominic Thiem on grass, and in 2018 reached the ATP 250 Hall of Fame Open final in Newport. But he has had no follow up successes and at 26, hasn’t as much as qualified for a Major. Nagal, 24, lacks the height and that perhaps explains why he mostly prefers playing on clay. Prajnesh’s is a hybrid style, but has struggled to hit through the court and finish points off. Yuki, 29, is gifted and has career-high ranking of 83, but has rarely got through an entire season without injury. “When I was playing, we focused a lot on being competitive, studying opponents. But the focus today seems more on your own ball striking,” opines Devvarman. “But a lot of the guys I played with are still doing very well. Herbert, Gasquet, Querrey, Pospisil, Steve Johnson, Vesely etc. “The older players study the game better and make less mistakes on big points. So, there are many basics that can still make you successful.” According to India’s Davis Cup coach Zeeshan Ali, the lack of good quality clay courts has affected player development. “It teaches a player to be patient. It teaches you how to work hard for a point. You need to learn how to hit 10 to 15 shots at a stretch to win a point, especially at the junior level because you still do not have the power to hit winners from the backcourt. But Indian clay courts are more like hardcourts with sand!” “Having said that, you do not need to be a great player on clay to be in the top-100,” Zeeshan adds. “Tournaments happen all the time simultaneously on different surfaces. You can choose what’s best for you and make it.” Another aspect that’s holding players back is a tennis-specific fitness regime and diet plan from a young age. But trainer Abhimanyu Singh, who has worked with Yuki and Devvarman, feels it’s no rocket science. “When I work with 16 and 18-year-olds, I see that they are reluctant to do track training in the off-season,” Singh says. “Today, tennis is about endurance and long rallies. To build that lasting power, track running is important.” “See how Medvedev has improved in the last two to three years. Somdev went through the everyday grind and he was one of the fittest guys around. It also has an effect mentally. If you feel you can last longer, you will also be more confident about your game.” Junior-level worries The rut at the top has coincided with a total lack of success at the junior level, a double whammy. Leander Paes and Yuki, following in the footsteps of Ramanathan Krishnan and Ramesh Krishnan, both won junior Grand Slam championships. But now, mere participation feels like an achievement. The 2021 US Open was the third Major on the bounce without an Indian junior. There isn’t an Indian boy ranked in the top-100 and an Indian girl in the top-200. “We don’t have enough coaches, who can frame the kids’ games once they get out of under-12s and under-14s,” says Zeeshan. “I have been coaching for close to 24 years in the United States and Europe. It took me five to six years to learn how to coach. There aren’t enough coaches out on the court. There are a lot of people promoting the game…former players, administrators. But too few on the court.” Ankita Raina feels there needs to be a shift in the mindset too. “Results don’t come overnight, but Indian parents act like it’s a life-or-death situation when their children are in 10th or 12th grade,” the 28-year-old says. “So more than half the players either quit the sport or just play as a recreational activity.” “It’s high time we get over it. I’m sure we have a lot of stories where students have failed in those grades but excelled in life. People don’t understand that this [tennis] is also a profession and you give 6-8 hours every day.” Storm in the Cup The Davis Cup setback against Finland is perhaps the first sign of the negative net effect of all the inadequacies afflicting Indian tennis. Davis Cup now follows a global format – true to its spirit of being the ‘World Cup of Tennis’ – where nations worldwide are clubbed together into one consolidated group, a shift from the earlier era where countries were divided into regional silos until the World Group playoffs. From 2014 to 2020, India beat its Asia-Oceania opponents and qualified for seven straight World Group Playoffs. Once there, it lost to European and North American opposition every single time. This September, it played Finland as early as Group 1 and succumbed. In 2022, it may well meet another European country, with its very survival in Group I at stake. “We need to start building a younger team, even if that means losing for the next three or four years,” feels Zeeshan. “We can’t keep relying on two or three players. Prajnesh is 31 and isn’t getting younger. We need at least one or two juniors in the team and for that we should start investing now.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-decline-of-indian-tennis-from-pre-eminence-to-its-lowest-ebb/article36936226.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||RCB and KKR in a clash of equals||Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders will meet in a clash of equals in the IPL Eliminator at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday. RCB, after three wretched seasons, has made the playoffs in back-to-back years. In 2020, it lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Eliminator, and this time around, Virat Kohli would want to go much further and end his captaincy tenure at the franchise on a high. Remarkable run For KKR, 2021 marks its first playoffs appearance in three years. It has come after a remarkable run in the UAE, where the Eoin Morgan-led outfit has won five out of seven games after having recorded just two victories in the India leg. Both Royal Challengers and Knight Riders come into the contest with winning momentum. On Friday against Delhi Capitals, RCB found a new hero in K.S. Bharat, who smashed a last-ball six to carry his team home. The confidence such a victory over a top-two side brings cannot be overstated. Consistency in selection RCB has also been helped by a certain consistency in selection, going four straight games without a change. But for the odd rejig of the batting order — like Dan Christian at No.3 — players seem to have well-defined roles. Harshal Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal have continued to impress while Glenn Maxwell has been outstanding. KKR has recorded back-to-back victories, with the second a thumping 86-run win over a hapless Rajasthan Royals on Thursday. Sharing the load Shubman Gill has returned to form with back-to-back fifties, ensuring that Venkatesh Iyer, KKR’s find of the season, doesn’t have to do all the heavy-lifting. Rahul Tripathi and Nitish Rana have been aggressive in the middle overs and how they handle Chahal at the sluggish but small Sharjah ground will be an interesting sub-plot. RCB’s batters will have a similar challenge against the spin combo of Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine. Speedster Shivam Mavi will be a threat, having picked up seven wickets in the last three matches, including a match-winning 4/21 against RR. The sole area of concern for RCB and KKR will be the batting form of AB de Villiers and Morgan. Their lack of runs hasn’t hurt their respective sides yet, but a return to form now will be timely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rcb-and-kkr-in-clash-of-equals/article36936159.ece
11 October 2021||CHENNAI,||Rahul — blending classicism with power hitting||His words are measured in a low baritone voice. Yet, what he says lingers in your ears for long. His equanimity, even in a turbulent game, reflects his understated presence; his visage gives away little. Yet, the sweet sound of the bat striking the ball keeps reminding you of his quality. There are times when it appears he is a throwback to another era. Classy, simple, stylish and elegant in a natural way; not loud and garish. He could have played with the likes of M.L. Jaisimha in different times. So far, Rahul is the highest scorer of the ongoing IPL with 626 runs at a whopping 62.00 at a strike rate of 138.50. The other day, Rahul’s 42-ball unbeaten 98 against Chennai Super Kings was a demolition job of considerable skill, flow and freedom performed artistically. Why doesn’t he bat with such enterprise more often? Perhaps, it is the pressure of captaining Punjab Kings. Responsibility can influence how you express yourself. Dignified and poised Even during nights of extreme disappointment for Punjab Kings, skipper Rahul’s dignity and poise never left him. During moments of joy for his team — PK won six games — his celebration was shy and rather low key. No fist pumping for him. Rahul’s gifted in the manner he can alter his game. His heroics in the IPL came after a demanding England tour where he made 315 runs in four Tests at 42.85. He played out long spells, was circumspect around the off stump, playing and leaving, and when the opportunity arrived, pierced the field with a surgeon’s precision. Rahul has 2321 runs in 40 Tests at 35.16 [home 885 runs in 14 Tests at 44.25, away 1436 in 26 at 31.21). His away record needs improvement but is not one to scoff at considering he has often batted in tough conditions against quality pace attacks. Ironing out chinks Rahul has overcome chinks in his technique, the most major of them being a vulnerability to the incoming ball. Now, he has worked on his guard, covers for the movement and is beginning to look a lot more solid. And when this rare bird takes flight in the field of dreams, the bat-swing from a high back-lift conjuring strokes that are both delicate and powerful, Rahul blends classicism with modern power hitting in a seamless, magical fashion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-blending-classicism-with-power-hitting/article36936304.ece
11 October 2021||Gold Coast,||India ends Oz tour heartbroken||India lost its way despite a fine half-century from opener Smriti Mandhana and went down by 14 runs in the third and final T20I as Australia clinched the multi-format series 11-5. Chasing a target of 150, Smriti smashed 52 off 49 balls and was involved in a 57-run stand with Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 26) for the second wicket before the visitors lost four wickets for the addition of just 10. India’s chase suffered an early setback as it lost opener Shafali Verma (1). But Smriti was in ominous touch as she pulled, clipped off the pads and hit through covers to pick up three boundaries in the fifth over. Smriti reached her fifty with a boundary off Carey but was soon dismissed as India reached 93 for three at the end of the 15th over. Needing 57 off 30 balls, India’s chase was derailed as it lost two more quick wickets, including that of Harmanpreet Kaur. The Indians collapsed after that and only some big hits from Richa Ghosh in the final over reduced the margin of defeat. Earlier, opener Beth Mooney’s half-century and Tahlia McGrath’s unbeaten 44 helped the hosts post 149 for five.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-ends-oz-tour-heartbroken/article36936164.ece
11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Dabas and Dahiya add lustre||The presence of the top two seeds Nishant Dabas and Aman Dahiya, who came through the qualifying event, adds tremendous thrust to the quality of competition in the National junior tennis championship beginning at the DLTA Complex from Monday. Both players were scheduled to compete abroad but decided to capitalise on the delay in their travel by getting some valuable matches in the domestic event. The girls’ event is spearheaded by the dynamic Maruri sisters, Reshma and Suhitha. There are a bunch of other strong players like Sanjana Sirimalla, Shruti Ahlawat, and Anjali Rathi, who promise to make it an exciting week of action. In the girls’ final qualifying round, Nandini Dixit beat the under-16 national finalist, the fierce hitting Sonal Patil.  The results (qualifying singles third and final round): Under-18: Boys: Nishant Dabas bt Shine Tokas 6-0, 6-2; Aman Dahiya bt Azmeer Shaikh 6-1, 6-2; Bushan Haobam bt Prajwal Tewari 6-1, 6-2; Rakshak Tarun bt Lakshay Kumar 7-6(4), 6-2; Jason David bt Samar Bir Sidhu 6-1, 6-3; Suresh Keerthivassan bt Ayush Hindlekar 6-1, 6-3; Monil Lotlikar bt Jaishnav Shinde 6-3, 4-6, 7-5; Tarun Korwar bt Lakshya Chugh 6-1, 6-3.   Girls: Ikaraju Kanumuri bt Anoushka Sharma 6-3, 6-4; Ananya S.R. bt Kanupriya Rajawat 6-3, 6-1; Somya Arya bt Rhea Arora 7-6(1), 6-1; Nandini Dixit bt Sonal Patil 5-7, 6-2, 6-4; Srichandrakala Tentu bt Sailly Thakkar 6-0, 6-1; Mahika Khanna bt Tamanna Panwar 6-3, 6-4; Samiksha Dabas bt Saumrita Verma 6-1, 6-0; Amodini Naik bt Meher Mishra 6-4, 7-5.

11 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Field lacks quality in National Open 400m championship||Upbeat after the nationwide enthusiasm generated by Neeraj Chopra’s gold-winning feat at Tokyo, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) lined up a short series of competitions but the lukewarm response from the athletes continues to be a worry. After the lack of quality fields in the recent National under-23 meet, the Nehru Stadium is set to witness a similar story when the two-day 3rd National Open 400m championship begins on Monday. Competitions will be held for boys and girls in the under-16, under-18 and under-20 sections, besides men and women. Heats are scheduled on Monday. Semifinals and finals will be on Tuesday. Athletes without a negative RT-PCR report will not be allowed to participate. Significantly, leading men and women 400m runners have given this meet a miss. Even those who competed in the recent World Under-20 championships in Nairobi are absent. When Lucknow hosted the last edition of this meet in 2019, the women’s final saw only three athletes, after two others did not start. This year, too, things are not very different. Only six women have entered the event. With only the National Open javelin championship scheduled later this month here, the athletes have nothing much to look forward to this season. Next year, the athletes eye a packed calendar, including the World championship, world under-20 championship, Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games. On the brighter side, an added incentive for those participating here in the older age-groups is, their eye-catching performances could get them into the National camps next year. With a bit of luck, some of them could get into the Target Olympic Podium Scheme’s core group or the developmental group. Rejected Meanwhile, the Athletics Federation of India rejected 50 athletes who have either not achieved the qualification standards for the event or for producing invalid or fake certificates. Uttar Pradesh heads the list of rejected athletes with 13 while Maharashtra and Rajasthan have seven each.  Competitions will be held for boys and girls in the under-16, under-18 and under-20 sections, besides men and women Athletes without a negative RT-PCR report will not be allowed to participate Heats are scheduled on Monday.

11 October 2021||Chennai,||Rajini prevails in thrilling battle in Premier Prostock||Ace rider Rajini Krishnan (RACR Castrol Power Racing) scripted a fine win while TVS Racing’s K.Y. Ahamed completed a double in the third round of the MRF MMSC FMSCI Indian National Motorcycle Racing Championship at the MMRT here on Sunday.

11 October 2021||Geneva,||Denmark keeps its perfect campaign intact; England slams five past Andorra||Denmark added to the most perfect campaign in World Cup qualifying and England also eased toward winning its group. Wins for Scotland, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine moved each closer to at least a place in the playoffs next year with the finals tournament in Qatar in sight. In Group F Denmark has put together perhaps the world’s best series of qualifying results as the runaway group leader while Scotland and Israel served up the most dramatic game on Saturday. The Danes’ 4-0 win at Moldova was a seventh straight win with no goals conceded and a European-best 26 goals scored. One day after he made the Ballon d’Or nomination list, defender and captain Simon Kjær’s goal from the penalty spot was one of four in 21 first-half minutes in Chisinau. Denmark can seal its place in Qatar by beating Austria on Tuesday in Copenhagen. Scotland beat visiting Israel 3-2 in a tense game with control of second place in the group — and a playoffs berth in March — at stake. In Group I, England cruised to yet another rout, 5-0 at Andorra, though is still only four points clear of surprise second-place Albania. Five different players scored against the 156th-ranked Andorrans: Ben Chilwell and Bukayo Saka in the first half and Tammy Abraham, James Ward-Prowse and Jack Grealish in the second. The match was handled by an all-woman team of match officials, led by Ukrainian referee Kateryna Monzul, one day after a fire damaged one of the stands at the tiny Estadi Nacional.In Group C, while Italy is hosting the Nations League Finals this week, Switzerland closed the gap to three points beating Northern Ireland 2-0. In Group B, Sweden forward Alexander Isak scored a contender for best goal on Saturday in a 3-0 home win over Kosovo.

11 October 2021||SAO PAULO,||Qatar WC may be Neymar’s last||Brazil star Neymar says next year's World Cup in Qatar could be the last of his career. The comments by the 29-year-old striker were made in the documentary “Neymar & The Line Of Kings,” produced by DAZN. An excerpt was published on the channel's Twitter feed on Sunday. “Man, I think it will be my last World Cup,” Neymar said. “I am facing it like the last World Cup because I don't know whether I will be able to, mentally, endure more soccer. “I will do everything possible to get there very well,” he added. “I will do all I can to win it with my country and realize my dream, the biggest since my boyhood. I hope I can achieve it.” The striker did not play in Thursday’s 3-1 Brazil win at Venezuela due to suspension. Local media accused the striker of being out of shape in the 1-0 win at Chile earlier in September, which prompted the striker to walk around shirtless during training to show how fit he is. Against Peru, Neymar overtook Romario as Brazil’s top goal-scorer in World Cup qualifiers, with 12 goals. He is also approaching Pele’s record of 77 official goals for Brazil. The Paris Saint-Germain striker has scored 69 times for Brazil. Neymar has so far played at two World Cups. In 2014, he picked up a back injury in the quarterfinals against Colombia, which stopped him from playing in the 7-1 humiliation against Germany in the semifinals. In the most recent edition of the tournament, Neymar had just returned from a serious foot injury and turned in an unimpressive performance in Brazil’s 1-2 quarterfinal defeat to Belgium.  I am facing it like the last World Cup because I don't know whether I will be able to, mentally, endure more soccer Neymar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/qatar-wc-may-be-neymars-last/article36936373.ece
11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Coach Powar foresees a skipper Smriti||The Indian women may have lost to Australia in the multi-format series, which concluded at Carrara with the third T20I on Sunday, but coach Ramesh Powar said the goals set ahead of the tour had been achieved. “We were looking at our seam attack as we needed bowlers to support Jhulan Goswami after we struggled in England,” Powar said at a virtual press conference. “Pooja Vastrakar, Meghna Singh and Renuka Singh proved that we have a pace battery that we could invest in and carry into the World Cup,” he said. The team had shown character. Tours of England and Australia were particularly important for young players, he said. “We are at a juncture where Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami will fade away at some point. These two tours were the best opportunity to test our players,” he said. The way Smriti Mandhana batted in the Test was amazing, he said, adding she would one day lead the team. “We are looking at her as a leader,” he said. “She has been the vice-captain and at some point she will lead this side. I don’t know about the format right now. The BCCI, the selectors and I will decide the next course of action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/powar-foresees-a-skipper-smriti/article36936156.ece
11 October 2021||Dubai,||Panel to decide on COVID-affected matches||A committee will decide the fate of any game affected by COVID-19 cases in team camps at the men’s T20 World Cup to be played in the United Arab Emirates and Oman from October 17 to November 14, International Cricket Council (ICC) interim CEO Geoff Allardice has said. No member nation can decide, unlike in bilateral contests. The ICC already has in place a committee of medical experts, which includes BCCI’s Dr. Abhijit Salvi. Referrals Allardice further said there would be two DRS referrals per team during the event. “We have continued with the playing conditions that have been in place for T20 Internationals for the past 12 months, which is two reviews per team,” Allardice said during a virtual conference call. DRS made its first appearance in an ICC T20I tournament in 2018 at the women’s T20 World Cup in the Caribbean. The system was again used at the 2020 women’s T20 World Cup in Australia. Neutral umpires He also said neutral umpires would be used whenever possible. Post COVID-19, ICC has used home umpires due to travel and logistical issues. Prize money The ICC also announced that the winner would take home $1.6 million while the runner-up would get $800,000. All 16 competing teams would receive a part of the $5.6 million prize money. The losing semifinalists are in line for $400,000 each.

11 October 2021||London,||England names a strong squad||England on Sunday named its strongest available squad for the Ashes tour as stars committed to the trip after coronavirus quarantine fears. The Ashes tour had been the subject of tense negotiations after England’s players and their families expressed concerns over tough COVID restrictions in Australia. England Test captain Joe Root and vice-captain Jos Buttler hinted they might not travel if their fears were not eased. But following a breakthrough in talks with Cricket Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Friday said it had given “conditional approval” for the tour. There are no opt-outs in the 17-man squad, with Essex batsman Dan Lawrence being the most eye-catching selection. Veterans James Anderson and Stuart Broad head the seam bowling for what may well be their Ashes swansongs, with support from fellow pacemen Chris Woakes, Mark Wood and Ollie Robinson. Buttler, Woakes, Wood, Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan will all head to Australia straight from a month with England at the Twenty20 World Cup in the UAE. Fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Olly Stone are out due to injuries, while Ben Stokes continues his break for mental illness. Along with the main Test squad, England will also name a separate Lions party. That group will be on stand-by in the event of injury and will serve as warm-up opposition before the five-match Test series starts in Brisbane on December 8. The ECB said the tour is still subject to “several critical conditions” being met by Cricket Australia before the team travels in November.  The squad: Joe Root (Capt.), James Anderson, Jonathan Bairstow, Dom Bess, Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Zak Crawley, Haseeb Hameed, Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Dawid Malan, Craig Overton, Ollie Pope, Ollie Robinson, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-names-a-strong-squad/article36936150.ece

Dhoni’s finishing act was ‘emotionally great’ for the side, and revealed that the skipper was determined to get the job done. “It was emotionally great for us. We wish him every time he goes out. We know the pressure that he has, an expectation that there is on him and again he came up chops for us. So it was emotional in the changing room,” said Fleming. Commenting on the discussion he had with Dhoni on sending Ravindra Jadeja ahead of him, Fleming said, “I think we probably spoke more in these 20 overs than we have for a long time. There were a lot of technical discussions, just trying to work out how this was going to unfold and who was going to make the maximum impact. “But when the captain has the look in his eyes and says ‘I'll go’, it’s been well documented the number of times he has done that and today was one of those. So I didn’t hold him back and we saw the result of that,” Fleming added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/emotionally-great-to-see-ms-do-it/article36936187.ece

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Strategy for success||My UPSC preparation strategy relied on several independent decisions — some of them risky but each informed by an honest assessment of my abilities. I knew I wasn’t comfortable sitting for hours at a stretch. I had scarce appetite for making crisp and clear notes. And I had only seven months to prepare, which I was delusional enough to believe was plenty of time. I began studying in earnest around July 2020 for my first attempt, and plodded along until the Mains. I didn’t join any coaching institute because I felt I could learn better and quicker on my own. I also didn’t stick to any specific timetable, as being flexible can help by making learning less monotonous. However, lack of routine works only when it is accompanied by dollops of motivation to study long hours when you are in the zone. Doing things differently Initially, I was most worried about the Prelims — I didn’t even think of the subsequent rounds until I was confident of clearing the first stage. I followed the booklist suggested by Anudeep Durishetty and read each item multiple times. For current affairs, I picked up free monthly compilations and went through them daily. I was scoring in the mid-70s in most of my mock tests (of which I took over 50). Ultimately, a combination of commonsense elimination, intelligent guessing, and luck took me past the first hurdle. While preparing for the Mains, I would look up each word of the syllabus and speed-read whatever showed up on Google News. Several newspapers have easily navigable online archives, and I used them extensively. I consumed news voraciously and spent most of my time reading articles and op-eds. Here is a shout-out to some excellent free resources I consulted regularly — Live History India, Down to Earth, IndiaSpend, The Diplomat, PRS Legislative Research, and ORF publications. The idea wasn’t to collect material for preparing notes but to build cognitive maps. After skimming an article, I would pause to reflect on its main ideas, and revisit all the related things I knew. For instance, if I read a piece on how India is being pressed hard in climate change negotiations, I would quickly recap everything I understood about global warming, be it climate change’s impact on the Hindu Kush, or the role of movements like Extinction Rebellion in a democracy. The idea here is to be catholic in one’s reading. Since I didn’t feel the need to remember everything I saw, more time opened to absorb influences on a variety of topics from a variety of sources. For e.g. if there was a news item about a Guyanese election, I would check the winner’s ideology and mull over its implications for India’s relations with that country. I followed this strategy because it was convenient and fun. I later realised that it also makes sense. The Civil Services Exams are no longer about things memorised years ago. Instead, examiners are testing the candidate’s knowledge of basic principles related to India’s policy paradigm, so following a rigid syllabus or just one source is unlikely to be useful if time is limited. Preparing mind maps helps in making connections between distant concepts but not for remembering things verbatim. I downloaded a flashcards app on my phone and made note of various things I saw in the news. I also enrolled in a General Studies and essay test series 40 days before the Mains and ended up writing over 25 full-length exams. I received good feedback, some of which I incorporated.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Don’t mind the GAP||The tradition of a gap year can be traced back to affluent British men of the 17th century who travelled for a year to gain experiences before starting college. Over time, this trend spread to other countries. Eventually,the gap year evolved into an immersive learning experience, usually in an alien environment, away from family. Consistent growth in overseas education over the past few decades has further fuelled the appeal of gap year, leading to several U.S. universities allowing participants to gain real-world experiences before commencing formal college education. Distinct and unique For a young adult looking to undertake a gap year, the defining feature is the quality of learning and self-discovery through immersion and reflection. It enables development of personal identity and character, allowing for exploration of interests and appreciation of cultural, social and environmental diversity. Each individual’s gap year experiences are unique, giving them a distinct personal identity and voice that differentiates them from that of their peers. These formative experiences also better equip young adults to be deal with complex and real-life situations. In addition, a better appreciation of the practical world and its challenges enables these students to assimilate the knowledge of their chosen disciplines and apply them with fresh perspectives. However, not everyone is very positive about the gap year. Critics point to out the challenges of finding meaningful and productive gap year activities that are aligned with student interests and the trend of students dropping out of college education after their gap years. The current pandemic has accelerated the need for gap year among young adults. Owing to travel restrictions, most universities are compelled to shift to online and hybrid learning, resulting in the loss of campus experience. Outside the classrooms, the shift to virtual internships and suspension of exchange programmes have led students to opt for a gap semester or a gap year, with the hope that students will get to experience ‘pre-pandemic campus life’ once the crisis is resolved. Need for dialogue The negative perception of the gap year is quite deep rooted within Indian higher education and this is reflected in the attitude of parents, teachers and even schools. Here, a ‘gap’ in the educational journey is still viewed as a disgrace and the reasons for such thinking can be traced back to different social, economic and employment practices prevalent in our country. Hence there is a need for a dialogue on the benefits and limitations of the gap year in the current Indian education system. Historically, the education systems in India have encouraged students to attain their qualifications without any gaps, and to view education as a linear progression. This may have been suitable in the past when the emphasis was on acquisition of knowledge in the chosen discipline. However, the emerging technologies that are now driving the workplace and society at large call for completely different workforce attributes, such as sense-making, emotional intelligence and risk-taking. These are life-skills that can be shaped through a well-crafted exposure during a gap year. Such young adults will be able to bring these insights into their classroom discussions and enrich peer learning. In order for the gap year to become mainstream, educational institutions need to reconsider their entry requirements so that high-school grades are complemented or supplemented with the quality of real-life learning experiences and the candidate’s assessment goes beyond academic achievements. This will extend the benefits of gap year beyond individuals, creating next generation of young leaders ready to address the mega challenges and issues such as climate change, sustainability and diversity and inclusion.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||How an Indian student weaves a successful design story||I am an IT professional turned design enthusiast. My story as a designer began when I joined Pearl Academy to pursue Fashion Design. I was into sketching since childhood, but realised my talent only when a colleague pointed it out. So I decided to pursue my creative potential. The more I studied the various aspects of Fashion Design such as fabric pattern making, garment construction, Computer Aided Design (CAD), and the design process, the more I started appreciating art, craft, textiles, colours, weaves, and so on, around me. During the pandemic, when I was in my home town Sambalpur (Odisha), which is known for the Ikat textiles, I observed the weavers from the lens of my design education. With no formal education in design, they were producing mesmerising work and their process was extraordinary. I decided to pay a tribute to their craft by making it a part of my final graduation project at Pearl Academy. Responsible Fashion During my final year, my mentor introduced me to a competition conducted by ArtsThread, a UK-based platform that helps young designers from all over the world to showcase their talent by uploading their portfolios. The theme was “Responsible Fashion Design Initiative” and it required designers to make a positive impact on future fashion systems by investigating products, practices, technology, techniques, and material that are ethical, have unique characteristics, and respect the planet and its inhabitants. My project concept aligned well with this competition. While creating the Ikat textile, the weavers use new cotton yarn and dye them in different colours. After weaving, many of these yarns are left in small quantities and never get utilised. Reduce waste My concept was to use the leftover yarns to create new fabric. The variety of yarns in terms of quantity and colours would mean that the final product would have unusual designs and patterns and help address two issues — use the leftover or waste yarn, and create an interesting variation of Ikat fabric without having to dye more yarns, thereby reducing the cost of cotton production, dyeing, and water usage. I collected a huge amount of cotton yarns from just one weaver: Chandra Meher of Remunda village in Bargarh District of Odisha. With the waste yarn, he wove more than 13 metres of fabric, which I used to design garments. This further strengthened my conviction that this could help make fashion more sustainable. I used the Home Studio Kit that we had all been given so that we did not miss out on our practical work. This allowed me to create garment designs and conduct test fits the way I would have done in a lab. My entry turned out to be the winning one at the competition and I was the only one from India to have won this competition.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||How best to prepare for the AIBE scheduled for October 31?||The All India Bar Exam (AIBE) is conducted by the Bar Council of India (BCI) to enable law graduates practice in Indian courts. By qualifying for this exam, a candidate gets a “Certificate of Practice” from the BCI, which helps him/her appear before any of the country’s courts, tribunals and administrative bodies. Until January 2021, when AIBE XV was held, law graduates could carry any number of books and notes into the exam. However, this year, the BCI has allowed only Bare Acts in the exam hall. Some pointers:  Bare Acts are your best friend: One cannot study or identify all the Bare Acts at the last moment. Instead, have a manageable set and practice with them to be able to find answers fast. Speed up this process by study the Short Title, the Commencement Date, the Amendments (usually footnoted in the Bare Acts), the definitions, and reference of basic concepts beforehand.  Strategic preparation: Analyse the past years’ question papers. It can be time consuming, but goes a long way. First, Do a detailed analysis of past years’ question papers, identify the different types of questions and also the method to attempt each type. Second, focus on subjects that carry the most marks. This helps you cover maximum syllabus fast.  Identify and interpret: Since it is a Bare Acts-based exam, one must learn the basic terminologies used. For example: Had you not known the difference between a Section and an Order, would you be able to identify them correctly?  Use your time wisely: The AIBE is a three-hour exam that requires you to solve100 MCQs with the help of Bare Acts. You have around 1.5 minutes to answer each question, leaving you with 30 minutes to revise. While this is sufficient to solve the paper, often candidates waste time in flipping through the pages of the Bare Acts. Therefore, it is important to not lose sight of the time during the examination.  Build confidence by constantly testing your ability: In the actual exam, a candidate is expected to answer jumbled up questions from 20-plus subjects. This can get a little tricky because, each time you face a new question, it is probably from a different subject, causing confusion. A successful way to prepare is to focus on practising questions from the beginning. Start with subjects with the most marks such as Constitution, Family Law, Code of Civil Procedure, and so on. If one covers one subject at a time and is constantly investing time in practising different types of questions, it has a major impact on the result.  Last-minute revision plan: The last few days can be intimidating and confusing; many panic and lose direction.However, if you are familiar with the Bare Acts and are constantly testing your ability to solve MCQ-based questions, the AIBE will be a cakewalk.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Take a productive break||With learning moving online, a student’s everyday routine has taken a dramatic turn. Research has shown that students are spending over five additional hours on gadgets every day, while learning from home. This is not only an unprecedented health hazard but also puts mental health, focus, motivation and intrinsic curiosity at risk. One way to overcome this stagnancy is to find pursuits that teach you something even when you are not actively learning from a coursebook — or a screen. Here’s what students can do to boost their motivation and increase their productivity levels even during ttheir spare time.  Learning hour: Based on your learning style, set aside a dedicated learning hour every day. If you are a visual learner, read or speed read, so you can consume more. Auditory learners can tune in to podcasts and audiobooks. Thanks to the massive growth in technology, there is a wide range of online courses to learn whatever resonates with your life’s goals.  Conscious screen time: Young adults also spend a lot of time on social media platforms. If you must do this, be mindful of whom you follow. Ask yourself if they add value to your life and teach you something new. Do they benefit your mindset, productivity and inspire you? Don’t forget to take a break once in a while, to keep general productivity in good shape.  Virtual tours and documentaries: Technology has brought closer what was geographically far away. Tour some famous museums, art galleries and destinations and watch informative documentaries on history, geography, ecology, science and culture.  Move your body: Science shows that exercising boosts immunity and improves memory. Physical activities such as indoor sports, dance, yoga, skipping rope, and running, can provide a break from monotony, keep your mind active and even give you a skill. Many fitness trainers on social media can help you stay fit without equipment.  Journal it all: A Harvard study indicates that people who journal everyday have a 25% increase in their overall performance. The pandemic has unique struggles and learning experiences, which you can write about. Not only will this benefit you emotionally but also enhance your writing and presentation skills.  Declutter: Declutter your surroundings to help you concentrate and feel in control.  Bond over board games: Enjoy your time with family and friends while bonding over stimulating games like Cash Flow that will also help learn critical money management skills.  Volunteer: Give back to the community by volunteering for a cause you feel strongly about.  Learn as an intern: Grab any opportunity to intern at an organisation or field that excites you. Real life experience is priceless and the learnings are infinite.  Get closer to Nature: Try gardening herbs, native plants and shrubs, flowers, or even indoor plants. Get curious about the birds and animals you see, and also the ones you don’t any more.

Managed to complete a couple of assignments, and also managed to watch a couple of really good movies.” “Looks like you had a better weekend than I did! Spent most of Saturday cleaning the cupboards. Found a lot of junk to get rid of. On Sunday, I visited Hari and tried to get him to take me to lunch. But you know how close-fisted he is.” “Close-fisted? Does it mean someone who doesn’t like to spend money?” “It means stingy. A close-fisted person is someone who hates spending money. He’s a miser. Other words that have more or less the same meaning are ‘tight-fisted’ and ‘hard-fisted’.” “In other words, a ‘tight-fisted’ person holds on to his money very tightly.” “That’s right! He doesn’t like to let go of it. My mother always told me that my uncle was tight-fisted. But when I got married, he gave me a cheque for one lakh.” “Wow! How about this example? My brother is fairly well to do, but there’s no point in going to him for money. He’s close-fisted.” “Sounds good. Unlike ‘tight-fisted’ and ‘close-fisted’, the word ‘hard-fisted’ is considered rather old fashioned. My former boss had the reputation of being hard-fisted. Is there something wrong with the coffee? Does it…” “The coffee is fine. Why do you ask?” “You’ve been nursing it for a pretty long time. You haven’t really….” “Nursing my coffee? Doesn’t nurse mean to take care of someone who is ill or is not feeling very well? For example, the old man was nursed back to health by his neighbour.” “That’s a good example! The children nursed the sick puppy for several weeks.” “I understand that example. But tell me, how I can make a cup of coffee feel better? I mean, how can I nurse a cup of coffee?” “You see, the word ‘nurse’, when used as a verb, has several different meanings. One of them, as you have rightly pointed out, is to take care of someone who is ill. It can also be used to mean to drink something very slowly or…” “In other words, when you nurse a cup of coffee or tea, you take a long time to drink it.” “Exactly! Sometimes, you may not even finish drinking it. You may just hold the cup for a long time without really taking a sip from it. At the party, Ajay sat in a corner nursing a glass of beer.” “Meaning that Ajay sat with the glass of beer for a long time. He didn’t drink anything else while he was nursing it.” “I guess you could say that.” “My friend Dilip is nothing like Ajay. Whenever he goes to a party, he gulps down an entire glass at one go. There’s no question of nursing a glass of beer.” “I have a few friends who are like that. But most of mine nurse their drink — especially when they go to a bar.” “Maybe it’s because your friends are tight-fisted! They don’t want to spend too much money on their drinks!” “Drink your coffee, will you?” ******** Coffee should be black as hell, strong as death and sweet as love.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Adopt Design Thinking||Design Thinking is construed as a process to deconstruct problem-solving approaches. In the legal field, this can be applied to achieve a solution through empathising with the client, defining the problem based on information collected, ideating through brainstorming sessions, phototyping, creating a working solution, and finally, testing to figure out a solution that may not have been apparent initially. Design Thinking can be inculcated in legal practices to tailor it into a client-centric approach. A legal professional’s job is diverse, and thus, clients expect customised solutions to problems through need analysis and use of tools like empathy maps. Thus, by synthesising and defining the problem, legal professionals can provide a module that can be solution-centric. Next, ideate for alternative strategies and solutions that effective, speedy, low risk, transparent and cost-friendly by promoting creative thinking and diverse perspectives. Efficacy in the legal sector It is not possible to bring about a client-based, solution-centric approach to legal professionals without adapting to innovation through incorporating new technology and a collaborative approach over a confrontational approach. Design Thinking can play a pivotal role in boosting the parameters defining a better working environment. Empathising with the client, understanding his/her needs, discussing various alternate dispute resolution mechanisms available within the legal parameters, providing customised services based on knowledge and skills will not only lead to client’s satisfaction but will also inculcate confidence in them. This will improve the efficiency of work and restore client’s trust in the justice delivery system. The rigid pre-existing way of working of legal service providers restricts flexibility that goes against the mandate of design thinking’s multifaceted approach. Thus, Design Thinking may overhaul the legal practice by systematically, innovatively and strategically addressing changes through inculcating innovative processes, designs and techniques in their functioning to achieve equilibrium in law and society.

11 October 2021||Pune,||Government job an illusion for rural students||While the pandemic has disrupted the education process for many, the contagion has proved particularly baneful for students from Maharashtra’s hinterland. For these students, hailing from the State’s mofussil and studying in Pune where living costs are generally prohibitive, securing a government job is considered a panacea for financial stress at home. However, a number of pandemic-induced decisions by the Maharashtra government like the repeated postponements of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) — no less than five times in the last 18 months before finally being held — and the abrupt postponement of exams to fill long-pending vacant posts in the State Medical Department, have driven students to the edge. “More than 60% of the students in Maharashtra’s hinterland are pursuing their higher studies and preparing for competitive exams in educational institutions in Pune district. Typically, they are sons and daughters of small farmers who have mortgaged their landholdings and staked all on their children’s education and the hope of a job, particularly a government one,” observes student leader Kuldeep Ambekar, president of Student Helping Hand, a volunteer outfit that helps students from these parts. Host of concerns Mr. Ambekar, who has been at the forefront of a number of student-related problems, says that a host of concerns – from unfulfilled promises of exam fee waiver to bungled government decisions – have aggravated conditions for students hailing from Maharashtra’s rural areas. “These students have staked everything on clearing the MPSC exam. Yet, the government has postponed it several times citing pandemic concerns. The point is, if the UPSC exams, held on a much larger scale, were conducted smoothly, why could not the Maharashtra government conduct the MPSC till now,” he questions. At least 15,000 posts are lying vacant in various State government departments till date. In March this year, irate students finally lost patience when the State government announced a further postponement and took to the streets as agitators staged roadblocks in Pune and tore books in despair. Several accused the government of playing with their careers. In June this year, the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi government was served a rude wake-up call after a 24-year-old MPSC aspirant, who had cleared the prelims back in 2019, ended his life in Pune. “The deceased had successfully cleared the MPSC prelims in 2019, but the pandemic and subsequent delays on the part of the government in scheduling the interview process frustrated him and made him anxious about the mounting financial burden on his family. Few MLAs or MPs have bothered to address the psychological problems being faced by MPSC aspirants…the endless delays in holding exams and the pending recruitments has had a severe effect on the mental health of students,” says Nilesh Nambalkar from Shrigonda, an MPSC aspirant. The commission, in a recent notification, has set the exam date for January 2, 2022. But given the track record of postponements, there is a trust deficit between the government and these students. Technical glitches Last month, the government announced that examinations for the posts of Group C and Group D of the State Health Department were to be held on September 25 and September 26. Around 8 lakh students from across the State were set to appear for an exam which had barely 6,200 vacancies. Then, a day before, came the bad news, with the government abruptly postponing the exams as the outsourced company was allegedly not able to make the necessary arrangements for its conduct. “Even before the due date, students were frustrated due to technical difficulties. Hall tickets of many candidates were not issued. And the ones that were issued had no centres given in them. Furthermore, several students, who did manage to download their hall tickets, were startled to find that the first half of their exam had a centre in one district and the exam centre for the 3 p.m. paper was allotted at a different district. What kind of callous attitude is this on the part of the administration?” asks Dnyaneshwar Vilekar. Mr. Ambekar says that one candidate was shocked to find that his exam centre had been allotted to a school in Noida in Uttar Pradesh. Ashwini Pawar, an MSc Botany student from Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, was flummoxed when she received the medical recruitment exam hall ticket, only to find that the first paper was in Aurangabad while the exam centre for the 2 p.m. paper was Parbhani district, which is 240 km away. “I was flabbergasted when I saw my hall ticket. After frantically trying the five helpline numbers to no avail, I finally contacted some friends in Pune in desperation who, too, were equally helpless. This is not the first time such chaos has taken place. Even after such exams, a huge opacity remains in all the processes,” says Ms. Pawar. Given that the students are already under considerable stress, such glitches only serve to aggravate the tension, complain students. Struggles to survive “Sometimes, we think that the government, irrespective of whichever party is heading it, is just playing with our careers. We have no financial backing and are struggling to cope with the relentless, mounting costs,” says Vishal Dabhade, a B.Sc. Chemistry student from Fergusson College hailing from rural Jalna. He lost his father during the pandemic. Trapped in Pune during the lockdown, Mr. Vishal, unable to return to his ancestral village, found himself caught between a rock and a hard place. “I worked as a library coordinator, and the meagre proceeds from that job helped defray my living expenses. Typically, four students from rural areas live on a cot basis in a single room located in Old Pune city, where they shell out anywhere between Rs. 2,500-Rs. 3,000 a month as rent. With varsities only agreeing to waive off miscellaneous fees like laboratory or the gymkhana – which were anyway shut – and not tuition fees, we had a hard time living here,” he says. Mr. Ambekar opines that whenever it comes to resolving student issues, especially of those from the margins, policy makers – be they from any political party – are ‘paralysed’. “The current scenario offers bleak prospects for students from rural areas. Securing a government job by clearing exams like the MPSC appears to be an illusion now. Only, a radical change in the government’s attitude coupled with basic administrative efficiency can help salvage the situation,” he says.  If the UPSC exams, held on a much larger scale, were conducted smoothly, why could not the Maharashtra government conduct the MPSC till now Kuldeep Ambekar President of Student Helping Hand||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/government-job-an-illusion-for-rural-students/article36936587.ece
11 October 2021||Indore,||Muslim family alleges mob attack in Indore||At least seven people, including five members of a family, were injured in a clash between two groups at a village in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore district, police said on Sunday. While members of a Muslim family alleged that they were attacked by a mob on Saturday night after they did not adhere to some people’s ‘diktat’ of leaving the Hindu-dominated Piwday village by October 9, local police denied the claim. Superintendent of Police Maheshchandra Jain said that seven people received minor injuries in the dispute that took place on Saturday night in the village, located about 20 km from the district headquarters. Those injured included five members of a Muslim family and two Hindus, he said. Mr. Jain denied the allegation that the Muslim family was attacked by a mob for not following an order to vacate the Hindu-dominated village. Amid the incident gaining a communal colour on social media, the police official termed it as a normal dispute between two groups. “Based on counter complaints filed by the two sides, cases were registered against people from both the sides,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/muslim-family-alleges-mob-attack-in-indore/article36936582.ece

(In the book, she recalls how she bought an ill-fitting dark blue polyester outfit to “fit in”, but it backfired. A friend then advised her to wear a sari the next time because if people “won’t hire you for who you are, it’s their loss”.) Today, Nooyi serves as an independent director on the board of the International Cricket Council, the first woman to do so. She also sits on Amazon’s board, teaches at the prestigious US Military Academy at West Point, and continues to advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Edited excerpts:  What prompted you to write this memoir? When I retired after 12 years as CEO of PepsiCo, I wanted to work on issues supporting women advancing in the workplace. When I stepped down, people kept asking me, ‘Why isn’t a woman replacing you?’. They never ask a man that question! There’s a tremendous burden on women in terms of how to handle work and family pressure. My lawyer and publisher came to me and said, ‘I think people want to hear your life story... how you stayed married for 41 years, have two kids, and advanced to becoming CEO. That story gives authenticity to whatever you are going to propose’. That’s how this book came about. Other books by male business leaders hardly touch on work life balance. When is that going to change?  How about right now? We have to start the conversation by saying we are not talking about females, we are talking about family. Talking about families is an economic issue. The economy grows when everybody can be deployed to help grow the economy. I think we have to bring men to the table to talk about how, collectively, we are going to address this issue. You write that ‘women’s choice to work outside the home is integral to their well-being’. Yet the reality of many women’s lives makes it hard to manage.  There’s no question that I had a good family support structure. And when they weren’t there, I created a support structure. Many people cannot afford that. I think about the nurses, front-line workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. They had no predictability, no flexibility in their work hours. And we never talked about how they were going to handle childcare, eldercare? The one good thing that came out of the pandemic is that we have to think about work flexibility in a much more expansive way. How would you envision changing this lack of a support structure?  This is where I think governments, corporates, NGOs, and communities have to come together. I was looking at the anganwadi structure in India. Now, we should think not about anganwadi 2.0 but 4.0. Redesign that structure, train the people, pay them so they can work there and take kids till age five. This could be absolutely frame-breaking for India at a point when women are doing really well in schools and colleges. Somebody once told me the biggest emerging market opportunity within the United States and within India is women. So I am approaching this an economist, not a feminist. How did you navigate the internal politics in a major organisation like PepsiCo?  The time that I came into the workforce, there were hardly any women. What I experienced, however, was a lot of support. People said, ‘Hey, if she’s made it this far there must be something good about her’. But I also sensed ‘A woman of colour, sitting in the boardroom. Who is she?’. And, along with that, came certain behaviours you could say are just not acceptable. So, I had to perform better than anybody else. The most important piece of advice I would give: understand the politics in the organisation, and stay the hell out of it. Do you think with the pandemic, the idea of care and gender roles is evolving?  I think work flexibility has to become the norm. Some mix of work at home, remote work and in the office will become common. We have to be careful not to create two classes of citizens — the men who come to work and the women who work from home and, therefore, are treated differently. You introduced mentoring [women] at PepsiCo. How do companies foster such programmes?  If we frame this as a strictly women’s issue, people go, ‘There they go again the women!’ This is not a female issue, it’s an economic issue, a family issue, a future of work issue. The future of work is about caregivers. It’s about women coming into the workforce in large numbers. The whole care structure is not going to work without women in our systems. How are we going to support all these women? We are all social beings and we have to figure out how to create social networks outside of digital social networks. From your days at BCG, wearing saris to work, till now — where your trademark scarf and stylish short hair are admired — you describe your sartorial transformation as giving you confidence.  The workplace is a competitive place. What you want to do is take away any negative attention on the way you dress. In each country or economy, dress appropriately for that place. In my case, I was in long skirts and misshapen clothes. So, [I would] overpower the dressing issue with my competence. I was always over prepared. When you come to a workplace, it’s not a social place.... let the work speak for itself. Your drive comes across throughout the book. Even as a young girl, you formed a band and started a women’s cricket team. Is that an innate personality trait?  I am wired differently. It feels like I have to do something all the time to break boundaries. The world has so much to teach you. Go out and seek that knowledge.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Nothing to hide||The elephant is out of the womb, the room, and gambols through our chat. Kalki Koechlin brought her book, her trademark vivacity and honesty to our call. Oh, and her uke too. She played us a lullaby in French. Koechlin is an actor, celebrity, award-winner, activist, writer, and a mum. Yet another celeb-turned -author?A-listers have been jumping on the book-writing bandwagon of late — Soha Ali Khan with Kunal Khemu, Karan Johar and Jugal Hansraj… Lots about tots. Why do we need another one? Burps, lack of libido and incontinence, to start with. This is a book with all the warts and bumps. Koechlin, 37, kept a diary when she was pregnant. Her musings, rants, poetry, cravings, all made it into this memoir (as personal essays and think-pieces), with Valeriya Polyanychko’s wacky illustrations focussing on the many versions of Koechlin’s baby bump, protesting vaginas and raging breasts.  The Elephant in the Womb is not medical guidance or prescription, says the actor, on a video call for The Hindu Weekend . She calls it the ‘giant experience’ of motherhood. “I wanted everyone to know about the hard parts… and that we’re not alone.” So read this if, like me, you’re frustrated with balancing the ‘mother-instinct-myth’ on that wobbly high pedestal to which we guiltily cling. Read it because there’s a star who lets us in behind the makeup. She gets real and raw: the beached-whale body, the post-partum slump, the perineal tear, the ‘awe of this new soul’ as well as “the other side... you want your life back”.  Hard truths   Atthe risk of irking the fandom, here’s a disclaimer. This book is written from a place of privilege: Koechlin’s words. Don’t expect to have the same experience, don’t even expect to agree with it all. It brings these elephants marching out of the room: the taboos, the forbidden topics, the hush-hush not-polite-conversation. “Most young women in their 20s I know have had an abortion and not talked about it. I understand privacy, but I think you need the support around. When you have a surgery on your knee, you call your family to come and pick you up. When you have an abortion, you come home alone. And that’s tragic,” says Koechlin. Both our chat and the book are about what she advocates widely: choice. Personal freedom. That the woman decides what birth she has — “Shouldn’t she be the one making the decision when she’s risking her life to do it?” — and about how she raises her child. The actor says she chose to follow her mother in the natural birthing process (her maman had three home births), but not in discipline. “I’m trying to sift the good and the bad. My parents were from a generation where it was fine to slap a child. Guy [Hershberg] and I are trying to find other ways to give Sappho [her 20-month-old daughter] discipline. We believe violence leads to violence,” she says. Hershberg, her partner, an Israeli classical musician, has his own hilarious chapter in the book, involving monkeys and dragons — but it’s very much about how different a father’s perspective on parenting is. Or is it?  Why sideline parenting?   Finally,acutely aware of not disappointing her multitude of fans, we steered the conversation around to Bollywood. She’s busy shooting again; I asked her about her identity, how she saw herself, and how the film fraternity now sees her. She wishes there were more support. “As a community, if we did talk about our problems with our work people, we’d probably be more productive in the long run,” she says. “Society sees parenting as something done on the side, while actually it’s the centre of humanity, it’s the future generation, the continuation of the species — and it’s sidelined.” As cinema turns to more feminist themes on screen, what about reality? Is someone out there listening? “One day, Sappho can look at this book and know what I went through.” And Koechlin, how your “little flea, wiggly worm, yellow thing” little elephant will trumpet that day.     Published by Penguin Random House India, the book is priced at Rs. 399 and is available on leading e-commerce sites and book stores.

11 October 2021||October 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Indra Nooyi: ‘An economist, not a feminist’||In 2009, Indra Nooyi found herself caught in a funny game of tug of war. As the global business icon stood between US President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting, they both claimed her as one of their own!A daughter of Chennai who moved to the US to pursue an education and career, Nooyi, now 65, became the longest-serving — and most visible — CEO of PepsiCo, which she ran from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, she championed healthier product offerings, pushed for sustainability, including waste and water reduction, and sought greater workplace diversity. Reflections on her personal and professional journey now inform her new book, My Life in Full , a memoir-meets-manifesto for work-life inclusion. Nooyi describes it as a personal story, a business story, and a story about her hopes for the future of work. “I want to advance the care discussion, figure out how to convene the right people....to give back as much as I can,” she tells The Hindu Weekend . She also opens up about herself, her dreams for cricket, and why dressing right is a powerful tool.
