07 October 2021||New Delhi,||SC decides to hear case on U.P. violence today||In a significant move, the Supreme Court on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and deaths, and listed the case for hearing in the next 24 hours. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, will hear the suo motu case on Thursday. The CJI will be flanked by Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli on the Bench. Eight people have died, four of whom were reportedly farmers who were mowed down by a vehicle which was part of the convoy of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Ajay Kumar Mishra, in Lakhimpur Kheri in north-central Uttar Pradesh. A journalist was among the eight who died. The top court rarely takes up issues or incidents on its own motion unless they are of such consequence or seriousness that ignoring them would affect public interest, basic rights and the conscience of the country. The court’s decision to take up the case, now titled ‘In re: Violence in Lakhimpur Kheri (U.P.) leading to loss of life’ comes just 48 hours after a Bench of the court lashed out at farmers’ bodies, connecting their protests against farm laws to the violence that occurred in Lakhimpur Kheri. That Bench, led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, had said that “nobody takes responsibility” when incidents like Lakhimpur Kheri occur. “When such incidents happen, causing deaths, loss to property and damage, nobody takes responsibility,” Justice Khanwilkar had observed on October 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-decides-to-hear-case-on-up-violence-today/article36870075.ece
07 October 2021||New Delhi,||Civilian killings cause concern in J&K||More civilians than security forces have been killed this year in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in various terrorism-related incidents. The targeted killing of civilians, including prominent citizens and non-locals in the Valley, reverses the trend of the past six years, data show. Till October 5 this year, as many as 22 civilians were killed in the Valley as against 20 security personnel in the same period. In 2020, the number of civilians who were killed stood at 33, while the number of security forces who were killed was 46 and in the year 2019, it was 36 civilians and 78 security personnel, respectively. J&K Director General of Police Dilbag Singh told The Hindu that the killings were done “to create a communal situation” and instil a sense of fear among the minorities here. He said the killing of civilians was a worrying trend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/civilian-killings-cause-concern-in-jk/article36870079.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.S. expresses unease over S-400 deal||India and the U.S. are on the same page on Afghanistan and the threat to the region from terrorism, said visiting American Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, calling the partnership “indispensable” for both countries and the world. Striking a discordant note on the impending delivery of the Russian S-400 missile systems to India, however, Ms. Sherman, who described the deal as “dangerous”, expressed the hope that the two sides could “solve” the issue arising from possible U.S. sanctions over the defence purchase. “We’ve been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that it is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest,” Ms. Sherman said in response to a question from The Hindu at a roundtable with journalists on Wednesday. “That said, we have a strong partnership with India; we want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead and discussions between our countries try to solve problems,” she added, hoping that the talks in the weeks ahead would resolve this issue as well. According to sources, Ms. Sherman, who met NSA Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday, also “raised” the S-400 purchase during her talks with Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla. Her comments come a day after Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhari confirmed that the $5.43 billion S-400 system deal, signed in 2018, is “on track” and the “first regiment” is expected to be inducted “within this year”, or by end-December 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/us-underlines-unease-over-s-400-deal/article36870081.ece
07 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||UDF: Govt. disowns endosulfan victims||The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) on Wednesday slammed the State Government for leaving thousands of endosulfan victims in Kasaragod districts in the lurch. Seeking leave of the Assembly for an adjournment motion on the issue, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator N.A. Nellikunnu said the “remediation cell” tasked with the welfare of the endosulfan-hit had been inert for over a year. The Government has repeatedly ignored the demand to reconstitute the cell. He demanded that a medical board re-examine at least 2,700 people diagnosed with signs of pesticide poisoning. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the Government had not included at least 1,000 people diagnosed with pesticide poisoning on the list of endosulfan beneficiaries. At least 3,000 have not received the compensation ordered by the Supreme Court. Endosulfan victims had no access to proper medical care. Expensive private hospitals in Mangaluru in neighbouring Karnataka were their only recourse. He called a former District Collector who compiled a report against the interests of the affected children as the "agent of the endosulfan company". Govt. reply Social Welfare Minister R. Bindu said the LDF had fought for the rehabilitation of endosulfan victims. The Democratic Youth Federation of India had moved the Supreme Court for compensating them and won the award.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/udf-govt-disowns-endosulfan-victims/article36870239.ece
07 October 2021||MANGALURU,||Boy hit by bullet from his father’s pistol declared brain dead||Sudheendra (16), who was hit by a bullet said to have been fired by his father Rajesh Prabhu at two transport firm workers here on Tuesday evening, was declared brain dead on Wednesday. Though his parents initially expressed their willingness to donate his heart, liver and kidney, they decided against it as the organ retrieval team from Bengaluru said that it can reach Mangaluru only on Thursday morning, according to an official. Sudheendra was seriously injured after Prabhu, owner of Vaishnavi X’press Cargo Private Limited, opened fire from his .32 bore pistol at two of his employees and the bullets missed the target but hit him. This came after a heated argument over payment of wages. While two rounds were fired, one bullet hit Sudheendra in his head and entered deep inside through the top of his left eye. He was immediately rushed to the private hospital where he was on ventilator support in the intensive care unit. Mangaluru South Police registered a case and took Prabhu into custody for questioning. “As Prabhu, who had got stents placed in his heart recently, complained of chest pain, he was admitted to the same private hospital where his son was being treated,” Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said. According to sources, the private hospital declared Sudheendra brain dead at around 11 a.m. following examination of the boy’s vital parameters by a panel of doctors. A team of two zonal coordinators of Jeevarthakathe, a State Government body that deals with organ donation, of Wenlock Hospital rushed to the hospital and had discussion with the boys parents and other family members. While the family members were willing to donate the boy’s organs, they were reportedly particular that the retrieval should be completed and the body handed over by Wednesday evening to conduct the last rites on Mahalaya Amavasya itself. “As the retrieval team said it can reach here only by Thursday morning, the family decided against organ donation,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/boy-hit-by-bullet-from-his-fathers-pistol-declared-brain-dead/article36870638.ece

07 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Abuse of judiciary: status report on probe sought||A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court consisting of Justices Joymalya Bagchi and K. Vijaya Lakshmi asked Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) N. Harinath as to what steps were taken to investigate the cases booked against persons, including some holding Constitutional posts, who are abroad, for allegedly making unwarranted allegations against the judiciary and Judges last year. During a hearing of the suo motu PIL filed against such individuals for posting life threatening and intimidating messages on the social media against Judges and making objectionable comments in interviews given to electronic media, on Wednesday, Justice Bagchi and Justice Vijaya Lakshmi asked the ASG to assist them by submitting details of the nodal officers of various social media platforms. The court received an interim report from the CBI, to which the FIRs were entrusted for investigation. The CBI requested three months’ additional time for making further submissions. The court also wanted help from counsels in finding a way to curb the abusing of Judges and holding out threats to them. The matter has been posted to October 28 for next hearing. In their order dated October 12, 2020, a Division Bench comprising Justices Rakesh Kumar and J. Uma Devi had made a serious observation that persons occupying high posts were waging a war against the judicial system in the State and it would create unnecessary doubts in the minds of the public on the judiciary leading to crippling of the entire system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/abuse-of-judiciary-status-report-on-probe-sought/article36870068.ece

07 October 2021||HUBBALLI,||KCCI U-turn on flyover draws flak||The Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Hubballi, which had raised objection to the proposed elevated corridor project at Kittur Chennamma Circle in Hubballi, has suddenly taken a U-turn leading to severe backlash from engineers, architects and other stakeholders who had opposed the project. After KCCI, along with members of Architects Association of India and other stakeholders, raised objection to the proposed elevated corridor, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi had intervened and directed the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad to hold a consultation with the stakeholders in a bid to find a solution to their objections. During the meeting, it was resolved to form an experts committee and the Deputy Commissioner subsequently held a meeting to decide the composition of the experts committee. However, a press release, signed by KCCI president Mahendra Ladhad and sent via email to media persons from the official KCCI e-mail, said that the chamber of commerce wants the flyover project to be commenced immediately after incorporating changes to address the lacunae relating to road widening, traffic junctions and pedestrian crossing and other issues. The release also states that the KCCI will welcome such development projects and wants the early completion of the project. The KCCI U-turn has come as a shock to many who are part of a group of various stakeholders formed to take the issue to its logical end. Mr. Ladhad has reportedly told them that he will clarify the KCCI stand. Meanwhile, chairman of the KCCI Sub Committee on Flyover and industrialist Vikram Sirur has taken strong exception to the KCCI letter and has urged the KCCI president to immediately convene an urgent meeting. In his communication sent to Mr. Ladhad, Mr. Sirur expressed shock over the development and has said that such change in decision taken reportedly at the behest of a past president of KCCI is not only unethical but improper. He has said that the KCCI president should have taken a firm stand, especially when a sub-committee has been formed to look into the issue in the interest of the members of the chamber. Meanwhile, a few organisations, including Hubballi Hotels Association and Eureka Towers Association, have written to KCCI and Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad seeking a halt in the flyover work. Efforts to contact Mr. Ladhad over telephone did not yield any result.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kcci-u-turn-on-flyover-draws-flak/article36870221.ece

07 October 2021||Mysuru,||CM promises funds for Mysuru airport expansion||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has made a slew of promises for the development of Mysuru, including allocation for airport expansion and land acquisition in the next Budget. He was speaking at a programme to mark the valedictory of Modi Yug Utsav organised by S.A. Ramdas, Krishnaraja MLA, here on Wednesday. Mr. Bommai said the government would also take steps to revitalise Lansdowne Building and Devaraja Market. The fate of thetwo heritage structures is hanging in balance with heritage experts calling for their conservation and councillors and other elected representatives seeking their demolition and reconstruction. The Chief Minister said the district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekhar and Mysuru MP Pratap Simha had apprised him of the imperatives of the Mysuru airport expansion and the need for additional funds for land acquisition. ‘’I will make suitable allocations for the works in the coming budget’’, said Mr. Bommai. The expansion entails extending its runway from 1,740 metres to nearly 2,650 metres to enable operation of long-haul flights . Mr. Bommai also hinted that the film city will also be established in Mysuru and listed a few initiatives taken by the government which will shore up the infrastructure of Mysuru in the days ahead. Work on the Haleunduwadi drinking water project has already been sanctioned at a cost of nearly Rs. 350 crore. Similarly, the State government had cleared Rs. 379 crore for a one-time development of a few MUDA layouts that lacked infrastructure. The pandemic has affected resources and economic activity but the government has reset its priorities and was mobilising funds and the State was on the path of economic recovery, Mr. Bommai added. He said the government had also improved infrastructure in 75 urban local bodies in the State under the Amrith Nirmala Nagara programme. The Chief Minister appreciated Mr. Ramdas for his initiatives to implement both the Central and State schemes which, he said, had benefited about 71,000 people in the constituency. ‘’I will write to the deputy commissioners of all the district to emulate the same model and implement the projects so as to benefit the public’’, he added. Apart from Mr. Somashekar and Mr. Ramdas, L.Nagendra, MLA, Sunanda Palanethra, Mayor, and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-promises-funds-for-mysuru-airport-expansion/article36870329.ece

07 October 2021||Srinagar,||Outrage over civilian’s killing in Srinagar||Family members of Makhan Lal Bindroo, who was shot dead inside his famous pharmacy, Bindroo Medicate, here by militants on Tuesday, put up a brave face on Wednesday, saying “the gunmen may have killed a body but not the spirit” of the family. “My father will always be alive in the spirit with which we have been brought up. Mr. [gunman], who shot my father while he was working, if you have the guts, then come have a debate with me. You won’t. You merely know how to hurl stones and open fire,” Shraddha Bindroo, the victim’s daughter, said. Bindroo’s son said his father “was a principled man who earned a name by selling genuine medicine. He was respected by all in Kashmir for being helpful and friendly. He motivated me to return [to Kashmir] and serve people here. He had no threat as such. Even if he had, he was brave enough to keep his shop open, as he did since the 1990s.” The Bindroos, residents of Indira Nagar, were among a few Kashmiri Pandit families that decided to stay back in the Valley in the 1990s, when militancy broke out. They earned a name by running a leading pharmacy in the Valley. On Tuesday evening, unknown militants barged into the busy pharmacy near the Iqbal Park area and pumped around four bullets into his body, leaving the 68-year-old Bindroo dead. Public outrage The killing evoked a public outrage in Kashmir. Scores of neighbours and loyal customers visited the Bindroos in Srinagar to express their condolences to the family. Many recalled the generosity displayed by the family during tough times faced by neighbours and the customers. “Many years ago, my mother had gone to Bindroo Medicate and reached out to her purse only to realise it was stolen. Mr. Bindroo, sensing the predicament of my mother, insisted that she not only take the medicine but also gave her Rs. 50 so as to ensure her travel back home. We have lost a personality who epitomised our shared values and culture,” Imran Gazi, a local man, said. Srinagar Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu said a road in the city “will be named after Bindroo as a tribute to his contributions to society”. Farooq’s condolences National Conference president and former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, who visited the family, said, “Bindroo was an upright man and served the people of the Valley all his life and helped poor people. But beasts killed him too.” Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti condemned the killing. She said, “With the recent spate of civilian killings in Kashmir, the Union Government’s fake narrative of normalcy lies in tatters. An utterly desensitised Government that has devalued human lives and pushed J&K into further peril and chaos by its ruthless policies of collective punishment all in the garb of security.” Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said: “The Hurriyat strongly condemns all killings, which are acts of pure violence against fellow humans and humanity. We appeal to the world community to intervene in putting an end to the daily violence and tragic loss of life in Kashmir by pushing for a resolution of the lingering Kashmir conflict.” Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar also visited the family. The police have started investigation into the killing of three persons by militants on Tuesday in multiple attacks carried out within two hours, including two in Srinagar and one in Bandipora. At least 25 civilians had been killed by gunmen this year. Two were from outside J&K.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/outrage-over-civilians-killing-in-srinagar/article36869986.ece
07 October 2021||Lucknow,||Second autopsy silent on bullet injury||With the cremation of Gurvinder Singh on Wednesday, the final rites of the four farmers, who were among the eight people dead in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, were concluded after a second autopsy of his body was conducted by a new panel of doctors appointed by the government. His family, however, rejected the second autopsy report too. The police said they would make arrests in the case, in which a Union Minister’s son is booked for murder, after collecting evidence and corroborating it.  Similar conclusion Gurvinder’s second autopsy report also did not mention any bullet injury, his family said on Wednesday a day after rejecting the first report. The second report had also given a similar conclusion that he died of internal injuries and bleeding after being hit by car, the family alleged. He was cremated in his village in Bahraich district. Gurvinder was killed in the violent incident involving the convoy of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra in Tikonia. His family had demanded a fresh autopsy after they refused to accept the findings of the postmortem report. They alleged, on the basis of eyewitness accusations, that he was shot dead by Ashish Mishra, the Minister’s son, after the latter tried to escape into the fields after ‘running over farmers’. Mr. Ashish Mishra has denied the allegation, saying he was in his ancestral village Banveerpur at the time. Gurvinder’s brother-in-law, Raman Singh, told The Hindu, “It [second autopsy] has nothing about the bullet. He has been cremated.” However, a copy of the postmortem report was not yet seen. Two FIRs While the first FIR in the case names Mr. Ashish Mishra and 15-20 on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy and death by negligence for allegedly mowing down farmers, in the second FIR, lodged against unidentified persons for murder and other charges, the complainant, a BJP worker, alleges that farmers threw stones at the vehicle and attacked it with sticks. When asked if any summons would be issued to Mr. Ashish Mishra for questioning or if he would be arrested, ADG Law and Order Prashant Kumar said the investigation would “pace up” now as the police and administration had taken “swift action” to maintain peace in the “sensitive matter”. “No guilty will be spared,” he told a news agency, adding that both the FIRs would be investigated. The officer stated that the police were examining all videos of the incident on October 3, including one showing a vehicle running over farmers, and would include them in the investigation. Apart from the four farmers, local scribe Raman Kashyap, Bharatiya Janata Party workers Shubham Mishra and Shyam and driver of the vehicle Hari Om Mishra were killed in the incident. But there is no clarity on how each one was killed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/second-autopsy-silent-on-bullet-injury/article36869995.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC asks firecracker makers why they stock barium despite ban||The Supreme Court on Wednesday wondered why firecracker manufacturers continued to stock huge quantities of toxic barium chemicals even after the court had banned its use in fireworks. “Have you seen the reply by manufacturers? What they say is very surprising. They say that the huge quantity of barium purchased was to be kept in the godown. It was not for manufacture [of crackers]. Why have they kept them in the godown?” a Bench led by Justice M.R. Shah asked. The court remarked that it might even order the seizure of the chemicals from the manufacturers. The court was hearing a plea by petitioners, including Delhi-based student Arjun Gopal, about the continued violation of the 2018 Supreme Court ban on the use of barium and other chemicals in firecrackers. The court said “noisy” celebrations are replete with “joint crackers” even though it was banned. CBI probe On September 29, the court had referred to a preliminary inquiry report submitted by the CBI into the firecracker industry, including in Tamil Nadu, which revealed rampant violation of the top court’s ban on the use of toxic ingredients in the products. The court had ordered the Joint Director of the CBI, in Chennai, to conduct a “detailed” probe in an order in March 2020. The agency had filed a report in a sealed cover in the court. The court said the agency report had shown that chemical analysis on samples of finished and semi-finished firecrackers and raw materials revealed barium content. The court had said that loose quantities of barium were purchased from the market. “We cannot celebrate at the cost of the lives of others,” the court said. It scheduled the next hearing on October 26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-firecracker-makers-why-they-stock-barium-despite-ban/article36870020.ece
07 October 2021||Lucknow,||Priyanka released, leaves for Lakhimpur with Rahul||Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra left for Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday evening from a PAC guest house in Sitapur where she was kept in detention since Monday morning. Sitapur Sub-Divisional Magistrate (Sadar) Pyarelal Maurya said Ms. Vadra had been released from detention. On their way to the violence-hit Lakhimpur Kheri, both leaders are travelling in one vehicle, while Congress leaders Randeep Surjewala and Deepinder Hooda are in another. Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel are in another vehicle. Sources said they may first stop at Nighashan in Lakhimpur district, native place of journalist Raman Kashyap who also died in Sunday’s violence. Nighashan is around 100 km from Sitapur. Mr. Gandhi reached the Sitapur guest house on his way to Lakhimpur Kheri from the Lucknow airport in his own vehicle. He staged a brief dharna at the airport after initially being asked to travel in a police vehicle. He reached the Chaudhari Charan Singh airport here on Wednesday from Delhi along with Mr. Channi, Mr. Baghel and party general secretaries K.C. Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. Earlier in the day, the State Government denied permission to Mr. Gandhi for the visit, and an official spokesperson had said no one would be allowed to visit the violence-hit district to vitiate its atmosphere. Later, the State Government allowed Mr. Gandhi, Ms. Vadra and three other Congress leaders to visit the district. “Permission has been given to five leaders of Congress, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, to visit Lakhimpur,” Additional Chief Secretary, Information, Navneet Sehgal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priyanka-released-leaves-for-lakhimpur-with-rahul/article36870001.ece
07 October 2021||LUCKNOW,||Rahul, Priyanka meet family of Kheri victim||After staging a brief and dramatic sit-in at Lucknow airport, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi along with the Chief Ministers of Punjab and Chhattisgarh — Charanjit Singh Channi and Bhupesh Baghel — and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reached Palia village in Lakhimpur late on Wednesday where they met the family of Lovepreet Singh, one of the farmers killed on October 3. Earlier in the afternoon, after landing at the Lucknow airport, Mr. Gandhi and the other senior Congress leaders staged a brief dharna after police told them to use the police vehicle instead of their own to travel to Lakhimpur. Mr. Gandhi, however, insisted that he would travel in his own car. Mr. Gandhi again hit out at the Yogi Adityanath Government and questioned the reliability of the permission granted to Opposition leaders to visit the affected district after denying them entry since Sunday. In a video that emerged from the airport, Mr. Gandhi was seen complaining that he was not being allowed to leave as a group of CRPF personnel were seen preventing his movement, despite permission been granted by the government. The Congress leaders were allowed to travel to Kheri only after all four farmers out of the eight total dead were cremated and police allowed people to travel there in groups of five. Mr. Gandhi then drove to Sitapur where Ms. Vadra has been lodged in detention at the PAC guesthouse since Monday after police prevented her from reaching Lakhimpur Kheri. After Ms. Vadra was released from detention, the two leaders travelled in the same vehicle after meeting Congress workers. Earlier in the day, before heading for Lucknow, Mr. Gandhi told reporters in Delhi that a “dictatorship” prevails in the country where the farmers are being systematically attacked.

07 October 2021||New Delhi,||No word on parliamentary panels||Nearly a month after the tenure of the parliamentary standing committees ended on September 12, there is no word on reconstitution of these panels, with sources pointing it to bureaucratic delays. Opposition leaders stated that the delay was yet another way to subvert an important parliamentary instrument. The government has a tardy record in the constitution of the panels. In 2019, the committees were constituted in October, nearly five month late. In 2014, the panels were notified on September 1, less than three months after the process was started. In 2009, during the UPA term, it was notified on August 31. And in 2004, it was constituted by August 5. Even though the composition of the committees largely remain the same, yet every year, more than a month is spent in renominating the panels. Submission of lists The sources said political parties took a long while in submitting their list of nominees and the BJP was the last to submit the list. Derek O’Brien, floor leader of the Trinamool Congress in the Rajya Sabha, pointed out that the number of Bills scrutinised by the parliamentary panels had declined under the present regime. In the 14th and the 15th Lok Sabha, during the UPA years, 60% and 71% of the Bills, respectively, were vetted by the standing committees. In comparison to this, the figures for the 16th Lok Sabha was 25% and the current one a dismal 11%. “With these figures do you think Modi-Shah’s BJP cares two hoots about the standing committees,” he asked. RJD MP Manoj K. Jha observed that the delay was a textbook example of the government’s approach towards Parliament and the instruments attached to it. Congress Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari alleged that the government had broken several conventions, including the one on leaving the committees on External Affairs and Finance for the Opposition to lead. “This convention has been in place keeping in view the parliamentary practice of providing checks and balances to the everyday functioning of the government through legislative oversight.” The practice of circulating verbatim minutes of the meeting had also been dispensed with, he noted. Accepting that the delay imposed unnecessary pause on the functioning of the parliamentary panels, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab questioned the limited and indifferent participation in the panel meetings. “How many members actually take part in these deliberations,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-word-on-parliamentary-panels/article36870002.ece
07 October 2021||New Delhi,||LPG price hiked by Rs. 15 a cylinder||The price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was on Wednesday hiked by Rs. 15 a cylinder, while petrol and diesel rates saw their steepest increase in recent weeks, pushing prices to record levels across the country. Rates of both subsidised and non-subsidised LPG were hiked, taking the increase in rates since July to Rs. 90 for a 14.2 kg cylinder. Cooking gas now costs Rs. 899.50 a cylinder in Delhi and Mumbai and Rs. 926 in Kolkata, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. A 5-kg LPG cylinder now costs Rs. 502. This is the fourth increase in LPG prices since July. Rates were increased by Rs. 25.5 a cylinder in July, followed by a Rs. 25 hike each on August 17 and September 1. Alongside, petrol price was increased by 30 paise a litre and diesel by 35 paise. Seven-year high This is the steepest daily increase in recent weeks and follows international oil prices touching a seven-year high. The petrol price in Delhi rose to its highest-ever level of Rs. 102.94 a litre and to Rs. 108.96 in Mumbai, the notification showed. Diesel rates, too, touched a record high of Rs. 91.42 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 99.17 in Mumbai. Prices differ from State to State depending on the incidence of local taxes. The relentless increase in fuel prices has been criticised by the Opposition parties which have demanded that the government cut record excise duty on the two fuels to give relief to consumers. The government has so far not agreed to the demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lpg-price-hiked-by-rs-15-per-cylinder/article36870026.ece
07 October 2021||Ghaziabad,||BKU leader steered Lakhimpur Kheri narrative||In the Lakhimpur Kheri stand-off between farmers and the Uttar Pradesh Government, the role of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait has come under the scanner. While a section is praising his practical approach in preventing a tricky situation from spiralling out of control and keeping the farmers’ movement on track, others feel he agreed for too little, too soon and appeared like a BJP agent after the incident that resulted in eight deaths, including that of four Sikh farmers. However, there is no doubt that post-Sunday, Mr. Tikait has strengthened his image as the sole leader of farmers in the region and that the ruling dispensation is fuelling his ambition. Observers say the BJP government has added a few more metres to the long rope that it has given to the BKU since January when he broke down in public at the Ghazipur border protest site. Easy entry While political leaders like Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Akhilesh Yadav, and Satish Chandra Mishra were either detained or stopped from proceeding to Lakhimpur, the BKU leader was given free access. Sources in the BKU confirmed that though the Ghaziabad administration was hesitant, verbal orders from Lucknow cleared the path for Mr. Tikait. Notably, ADG (Law & Order) Prashant Kumar, who addressed the farmers with Mr. Tikait in Tikunia, was serving in Meerut Zone before being promoted. Observers said the argument that Mr. Tikait leads a non-political farmer outfit does not hold much weight because another BKU leader, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, head of the Haryana faction and a prominent face of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, was detained in Meerut for violating Section 144. Other prominent leaders of the SKM like Yogendra Yadav and Shiv Kumar Kakkaji chose to continue with their pre-decided programmes. Observers recall that something similar happened after the Republic Day incident in January this year when the administration and one-upmanship of Mr. Tikait pushed V.M. Singh, a farmer leader from the Terai belt, out of the Ghazipur protest site, leaving his supporters under the BKU umbrella. “On January 28, when Tikait decided to stay put at the Ghazipur border despite all odds, the Sikh farmers from the Terai belt in U.P. and Uttarakhand found a new leader in him, somebody who saved their dignity in the hour of crisis,” said a senior farmer leader from the Terai belt. “Had he left, a 1984 kind of situation could have unfolded at the Ghazipur border,” he said. By listening to the officers on the ground, the BJP has virtually accepted that the party didn’t have a leader in the region whom farmers would listen to during a crisis. Those who know Mr. Tikait say that like his father he wants to be the sole leader of farmers in the region. Questioning Mr. Tikait’s focus on compensation rather than the arrest of the son of Union Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra, some like Ravindra Singh of Khalsa Aid have described the announced amount of Rs. 45 lakh as “blood money without seeking full justice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bku-leader-steered-lakhimpur-kheri-narrative/article36869997.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. asks top court to set quota norms for promotions||Seventy-five years of Independence have not been able to bring members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on a par with the forward classes of society, the Government said in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao, Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal said it was tough for a member of the SC/ST to reach the ‘Group A’ category jobs. Mr. Venugopal said the time had come for the top court to firm up and draw the basis for reservation in promotions for SC/ST candidates to fill up vacancies in top jobs. The Bench referred to records filed before it to note that there was low representation of SC/ST category in Group A jobs. Instead of improving the situation in the Group A ranks, the court said, efforts are on to ensure adequate representation in Groups B and C. This was not fair, it remarked. “We are finding that in Group A, the representation is low. Therefore, by accommodating, instead of improving the representation in Group A, you are ensuring that there is adequate representation in Group B and C. This is not fair. This is the argument of the government,” the Bench, including Justices Sanjiv Khanna and B.R. Gavai, observed. Mr. Venugopal agreed that it was a “fact of life”. “We are not being able, after 75 years, to bring the SCs and STs to the same level of merit as the forward classes... It is more difficult for the SCs and STs to get the higher post, which is in A and B,” he submitted. “Time has come for your lordships to give concrete basis for the SC, ST and OBC to fill up vacancies,” the law officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-asks-top-court-to-set-quota-norms-for-promotions/article36870524.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Many items in e-auction find no takers||From Olympic medallist P.V. Sindhu’s badminton racket priced at Rs. 80 lakh to a painting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with former United States President Donald Trump priced at Rs. 3.50 lakh, at least 162 items among the gifts given to Mr. Modi that are on auction had received no bids on the second last day for bidding. As on Wednesday evening, the auction of 1,348 items at pmmementos.gov.in found no takers for some of the featured items, including some Olympics gear gifted to the Prime Minister. A Culture Ministry official said 1,083 items had already been bid upon as of Monday morning. A search for items with zero bids on the website showed 162 items as of 6 p.m. on Wednesday. A white stole signed by the Indian Tokyo 2020 contingent (Rs. 90 lakh), bronze medallist Lovlina Boroghain’s boxing gloves (Rs. 80 lakh) and hockey sticks autographed by the men’s and women’s hockey teams (Rs. 80 lakh each) were among the items yet to receive any bids. Many stoles and portraits, including one of Mr. Modi with his mother, have also found no takers yet. However, many of these items had received bids of multiple crores each during the first week of the e-auction that started on September 17 — Mr. Modi’s birthday, but those were found to be disingenuous and removed, another official said. High bids for javelin Meanwhile, the javelin used by gold medallist Neeraj Chopra had received two bids, taking its going price from the base of Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 1,00,50,000 as on Wednesday evening. This was the third such auction of gifts given to Mr. Modi and bidding was set to go on till Thursday evening. Proceeds of the auction would go to the Namami Gange Mission, according to the Culture Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/many-items-in-e-auction-find-no-takers/article36870011.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.P. tops list of States emitting fine particulate matter: study||Uttar Pradesh is the largest emitter of PM2.5, the class of particulate matter considered most harmful to health, according to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). The council, a research body, looked at five of the most reliable data sources — international and national — that have tracked and measured the quantum and sources of air pollution in India. The high emissions from U.P. were largely due to a significant share of PM2.5 emissions from solid-fuel use in households and, by virtue of being India’s most populous State, it had a higher proportion of households relying on this form of fuel. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan too feature in the list of top polluters but are differently ranked by the five sources. Only Uttar Pradesh is at the top of the lists from all sources. Data sources The five data sources used are: Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), maintained by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre; Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Shortlived Pollutants (ECLIPSE), maintained by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS), maintained by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan (NIES); Speciated Multipolluter Generator (SMoG), maintained by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Bombay); and spatially resolved pollution emission inventory for India, maintained by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Common pollutants There are differences in the periods over which these sources track the emissions as well as the pollutants, but most track the important ones: PM2.5, PM10, NOx (nitrous oxides), SO2 (sulphur dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), NH3 (ammonia), and NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds). The CEEW analysis found “significant variation” in the estimates by various sources going up to as much as 37% for particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The overall variation in residential PM2.5 emissions was less than 25%. However, SMoG’s residential PM2.5 emission estimates are approximately 50% higher than those estimated by TERI. Because of the extent of variation, the Council said India ought to “develop and maintain a comprehensive inventory of baseline emissions”. India has a National Clean Air Campaign (NCAP) that aims to reduce pollution in 122 of the most polluted cities by 2024. “To meet the NCAP target of 20-30% reduction in particulate concentration by 2024, we need to estimate emission reductions needed across sectors. Estimating these reductions will only be possible when we have an official, representative emission inventory for India,” said Tanushree Ganguly, Programme Lead, CEEW, and lead author of the study.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-tops-list-of-states-emitting-fine-particulate-matter-study/article36870017.ece

07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, U.S. to work closely on Afghanistan, says Shringla||Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla on Wednesday held talks with visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who later said India, U.S. partnership was “indispensable” for both countries and the world. Describing the partnership during a public address to the U.S. India Business Council (USIBC)’s India Ideas Summit shortly after the meeting, Mr. Shringla indicated that the future of the Indo-Pacific region, and the situation in Afghanistan were at the top of their discussions. “Given the fast-paced developments in South Asia, especially in Afghanistan, India and the U.S. will remain closely engaged both on the future of Afghanistan, and on how we can maintain peace and stability in South Asia, and beyond,” Mr. Shringla said. However, Ms. Sherman reiterated U.S. concerns over India’s 2018 agreement with Russia for the purchase of S-400 missile systems, which she described as dangerous. The delivery of the systems to India later this year is expected to trigger sanctions under the U.S.’s CAATSA law, which Washington has already imposed on Turkey and China for buying the S-400. India and the U.S. are expected to meet for a number of bilateral functions over the next few weeks, including the Defence Policy Dialogue headed by Defence Secretaries in Washington this weekend, the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Counter Terrorism on October 26th, leading up to the “2+2” meeting of Defence and Foreign Ministers. A delegation from the office of the U.S. Trade Representative is in Delhi for trade talks this week, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to travel to Washington “soon”, said government sources. When asked if the U.S. is discussing the possibility of cooperating on sourcing military bases with India, or with countries like Uzbekistan and Pakistan, which are part of her current tour, Ms. Sherman, speaking at a roundtable with journalists, said the U.S. is discussing its options for airstrikes on Afghanistan through “over the horizon” (OTH) efforts, but did not elaborate further on India’s response. Vaccine partnership Ms. Sherman and Mr. Shringla also spoke “at length” about the Quad vaccine partnership which will entail manufacturing one billion J&J American vaccines in India by end 2022, said sources, but denied that the issue of indemnity clauses, which India insists on, will be a roadblock to the Quad proposals. Ms. Sherman said she had “applauded” India’s decision to resume its vaccine exports that were cancelled during the pandemic’s second wave. M. Sherman will travel to Mumbai on Thursday for meetings with business persons, and will head to Pakistan after that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-us-to-work-closely-on-afghanistan-says-shringla/article36869993.ece

As AAP members started their march from the MLA hostel towards the Raj Bhavan, they were stopped at barricades. The police said water cannons were used to disperse the crowd after the protestors attempted to forcefully break the barricades. Many of them were detained by the police and released later. AAP members were demanding the immediate arrest of Ashish Mishra, the son of Union Minister of State (Home) Ajay Mishra, for his alleged involvement in mowing down farmers protesting against the Centre’s three agricultural laws in Lakhimpur Kheri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aap-protesters-detained-released/article36870004.ece

07 October 2021||Srinagar,||NC Jammu leader Rana meets Abdullahs||Amid the speculation of him quitting the party, Devender Singh Rana, top National Conference (NC) leader from the Jammu region, on Wednesday met party president Dr. Farooq Abdullah and vice-president Omar Abdullah at their residence in Srinagar. Sources said Mr. Rana, during the meeting, dropped broad hints at leaving the party “to safeguard and assert Dogra interests” in Jammu. The NC has remained silent about the meeting. However, Mr. Rana, in a brief interaction with the media after the meeting, said, “As I talk to you, I am still a part of the NC. I will share details with the media when there is anything.” Mr. Rana, who is the party’s provincial president and in-charge of Jammu, is a prominent face of the party. However, his recent meetings with Dogra Swabhiman Sangathan chief and ex-MP Choudhary Lal Singh and former Peoples Democratic Party leader Surinder Choudhary have fuelled speculation that he was cobbling together a new grouping on the lines of the Gupkar alliance in Jammu. If Mr. Rana decides to exit the NC, it will be a major jolt for the party’s poll prospects in Jammu. He will also be the first senior leader to leave the party, which was able to keep leaders in its fold even after the Centre ended J&K’s special constitutional position on August 5, 2019, unlike the Peoples Democratic Party that witnessed an exodus of leaders to Sajad Lone's PC and Altaf Bukhari’s Apni Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nc-jammu-leader-rana-meets-abdullahs/article36869999.ece

Malaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the WHO. “For centuries, malaria has stalked sub-Saharan Africa, causing immense personal suffering,” said WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr. Matshidiso Moeti. “We have long hoped for an effective malaria vaccine and now for the first time ever, we have such a vaccine recommended for widespread use. Today’s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults.” The vaccine does significantly reduce life-threatening severed malaria, Dr. Tedros said, but added that, “It’s not the only tool. Vaccination against #malaria does not replace or reduce the need for other measures, including bed nets [against mosquitoes].” RTS,S was first authorised in 2015 by the European Medicines Agency for use in Africa in infants and children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/who-recommends-first-anti-malarial-vaccine/article36869980.ece
07 October 2021||Pune,||Maha Vikas Aghadi leads BJP in local body bypolls||The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), overwhelmed the BJP in the byelections to 85 zilla parishad and 144 panchayat samiti seats announced on Wednesday. The bypolls were held in six districts — Nagpur, Akola, Washim, Latur, Dhule and Palghar — with 367 candidates in the fray in the ZP polls and 555 for the panchayat samiti seats. While the three parties together won 46 of the 85 seats in the ZP bypolls, the BJP nevertheless emerged as the single largest party here, winning 23 seats. However, most significant of all was the Congress’s spirited performance, coming off best within the coalition by winning 17 ZP seats and bagging the highest number of seats (35) among all parties (including the BJP) in the panchayat samiti by-polls. The MVA won a total 73 of the 144 panchayat samiti seats, with the BJP winning 33, second to the Congress tally. The Shiv Sena and the NCP managed to win 12 and 17 ZP seats respectively. They bagged 22 and 16 panchayat samiti seats respectively. A jubilant Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) chief Nana Patole, who has been vocal about the party contesting independently in the coming civic body polls, said the results proved that it was on its way to becoming the top party in the State. “Given the high-handed manner in which the BJP government at the Centre is behaving, be it suppressing farmers in Uttar Pradesh or abusing Central probe agencies, I think people have realised that only the Congress has the wherewithal to rein it in… I thank the public in all these six districts for recognising the Congress as a viable force to counter the BJP,” said Mr. Patole, while promising to repair all organisational glitches within the party. At the same time, he remained non-committal on whether the Congress would fight in alliance with the Sena or the NCP in the crucial civic polls next year, merely remarking that his aim was to build the party’s strength. According to observers, the Congress’s win would certainly give a major boost to the party rank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maha-vikas-aghadi-leads-bjp-in-local-body-bypolls/article36869989.ece

The Resistance Front (TRF), which the police believe is a front for the Pakistan based Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) has claimed responsibility for the killing. The group said Bindroo was killed as he worked for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Another senior government official said there are inputs to suggest serious attempts to target prominent businessmen in the Valley and Jammu region. At least two such previous attempts have been foiled. “Innocent people who had nothing to do with any group were killed. This is a terrorist incident, it was done to send a message to minorities who have been staying here peacefully for decades. Mr. Bindroo never left the Valley. The street vendor was killed because they do not want anyone from outside to come and work here... The signal has come from across the border,” Mr. Singh said. He added that the taxi owner was killed on suspicion of being a police informer. A street vendor from Bihar, Virendra Paswan and Mohammad Shafi Lone, the president of the Taxi Association in North Kashmir’s Bandipora were also killed on Tuesday. The TRF accused Lone of being a police informer. Mr. Singh said a pistol was used in all the three killings. “TRF is run from Karachi. We recently killed Abbas Sheikh, TRF’s leader in an operation. Some people associated with TRF who were working as over ground workers became active and resorted to the civilian killings,” Mr. Singh said. He added that as of now no leadership of terrorist groups remained active in the Valley. ‘Intolerance’ flagged “All sections of Kashmiri society have condemned the killings. The street vendor’s killing reflects the sign of intolerance for non-locals by the terror groups,” he said. Former MP and senior People’s Conference leader Nazir Ahmad Laway said the act was an attempt to create communal disharmony in the region. The killings come at a time when a battery of Union ministers have been visiting the newly created Union Territory as part of government’s mega outreach programme. Home Minister Amit Shah is expected to visit later this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/civilian-killings-cause-concern-in-jk/article36869990.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||NEET-SS new pattern plan dropped, says govt.||A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud expressed its satisfaction with the government’s change of mind, and disposed of the case. Ms. Bhati noted that the decision to revert to the old mode was done in consultation with expert bodies such as the National Board of Examinations and the National Medical Commission, taking into consideration students’ interests. The change of tune comes a day after the court criticised the revision of the exam pattern at the eleventh hour, saying it might have been done to favour private medical colleges. The new pattern showed questions entirely from the field of general medicine and not from the specialities for which the students wanted admission. General medicine, the court said, was the largest pool from which students could be found to fill the vacant seats in private institutions for super speciality courses. ‘A business’ On Tuesday, the court said the tragedy of medical education was that it had become a business in this country. “The impression we get is medical education has become a business, and medical regulation has also become a business. That is the tragedy of medical education in this country,” Justice Chandrachud remarked. The court had observed that questions under the revised pattern were wholly from general medicine, which was a feeder category. The earlier pattern had 60% of the questions coming from the student’s chosen field of speciality and the rest from the feeder category. “For 12 super specialties, 100% questions are from general medicine. The entire examination is going to be only be on general medicine. The logic seems to be, general medicine is the largest pool, and tap them to fill the seats. That seems to be idea,” the Bench had noted. In an earlier hearing, the court had lashed out at the government, saying “young doctors cannot be left at the mercy of insensitive bureaucrats and cannot be treated like football”. It had stated, “The interests of students is far higher than those of the institutions”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neet-ss-new-pattern-plan-dropped-says-govt/article36869991.ece

07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||CPI(M) opposes changes proposed to Forest Act||The Centre’s proposal to amend portions of the Forest Conservation Act (FCA) has drawn criticism from the CPI(M). The Environment Ministry has invited comments and suggestions on the proposed amendments which are publicly available as a “consultation paper” on its website. Brinda Karat, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member, on Wednesday wrote to Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav that the proposed amendments appeared less about conserving forests and addressing environmental concerns and more to “facilitate takeover of forest land and make it cheaper and easier for corporates, intending to take the benefits of privatisation”. The proposals appeared to dilute the rights of the States to notify forests thereby further centralising authority in the Centre, she said. Currently, States have the authority to evolve their own criteria and declare tracts of lands as “deemed forest”. Several States, however, are yet to furnish such criteria. Tribal rights The consultation paper, Ms. Karat said, made no mention on protecting the rights of tribal communities and other traditional forest dwellers in any of the amendments proposed though the “direction of amendments proposed” would directly impact the rights granted under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-opposes-changes-proposed-to-forest-act/article36870015.ece

Gosavi claims to be a private detective, while Manish Bhanushali is a BJP leader, who has been seen in photographs with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda, were part of the NCB raid. Visuals of bringing Merchant and Khan to the NCB office show that these two individuals brought them to the office. Who are they? Are private individuals allowed to be a part of drug bust raid? The NCB must explain this,” Mr. Malik said. He alleged that the entire case of seizure of drugs and panchanama was manipulated. “Ever since the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the NCB started planting stories about Bollywood and drug connection. The only motive is to defame Bollywood and subsequently Mumbai and Maharashtra to which the BJP is also a party,” he said. The NCB, in its press release, accepted that both Mr. Gosavi and Mr. Bhanushali acted as independent witnesses but termed the allegations baseless. “Some allegations levelled against the organisation are baseless and seem to be with malice and probable prejudice that may have been harboured in retaliation against earlier legal actions carried out by the NCB,” said the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-minister-sees-bjp-link-in-drug-case/article36869981.ece

Speaking at the ‘Business Summit for North Eastern States’ on the NMEO-OP in Guwahati on Tuesday, Mr. Khandu said Arunachal Pradesh is geographically the largest State in the region and has about 1.33 lakh hectares of land feasible for oil palm cultivation as assessed by a Central team in 2019. “We have identified the lands, farmers and developers based on the assessment. We will implement the mission soon,” he said. Mr. Khandu said Arunachal Pradesh had ventured into oil palm cultivation a few years ago. But the scheme on about 4,250 hectares did not succeed due to lack of handholding for farmers. “The farmers did not expand their cultivation as there were no processing factories while private companies said setting up factories was not feasible,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/arunachal-finalises-oil-palm-mission/article36869982.ece

07 October 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata writes to Modi on floods||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the recent floods in West Bengal, emphasising that the annual problem of floods in south Bengal requires short-term and long-term measures. In a four-page letter released by Government of West Bengal on Wednesday, Ms. Banerjee has sought Mr. Modi’s “immediate intervention so that the concerned Ministry of the Government of India is requested to engage with Governments of West Bengal and Jharkhand and the authorities of DVC (Damodar Valley Corporation) to help in arriving at a permanent solution to this problem of our State occurring year after year”. Eight districts of West Bengal were affected by the floods last week and about 5 lakh people had to be evacuated. The improvement in the weather had resulted in an improvement of the situation. “This is the second time in this monsoon period, within a short span of 3/4 months, that due to excessive discharge lakhs and lakhs of people in West Bengal have been marooned, displaced from their homes and forced to stay in relief shelters accompanied by loss of life and property,” Ms. Banerjee said in the letter dated October 5. She added that Government of West Bengal had to bear the brunt of the unplanned discharge by the DVC and to pay for the “inadequacy and structural deficiency of DVC management”. The Chief Minister impressed that her government had to “compensate for the damages caused to a vast multitude of people in the districts of south Bengal from its own meagre resources, while adequate funds are not made available by Government of India/ NDRF (National Disaster Response Force)”. The West Bengal Chief Minister, who visited the flood affected areas of the State last week, said that the annual problem “requires short-term and long-term measures so that the sufferings of the people are mitigated and the national loss in terms of loss of life and property is avoided”. Blaming the “uncontrolled and unplanned discharge of water from DVC dams at Panchet and Maithon”, she said pointed out that she had written a letter to the Prime Minister on the same issue on August 4, to which there had been no response from the Government of India. “Unless the Government of India addresses the basic underlying structural and managerial issues both on a short term and on a long-term basis, the disasters will continue unmitigated in our lower riparian State,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-seeks-modis-intervention/article36869988.ece

A senior police officer said Rajkanya Baruah was booked under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code for an attempt to commit culpable homicide. The punishment under this section is jail up to seven years or fine or both. The 29-year-old model was arrested within minutes of a medical board of the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital finding her in fine health.

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Three arrested for abducting retired sub-inspector on ECR||The city police on Wednesday arrested three persons on charges of abducting a retired policeman and demanding a huge ransom for his release.  The hostage was identified as Moosa, 75, a retired sub-inspector and resident of Harrington Road in Chetpet. Mr. Moosa was reportedly into the business of sandalwood and red sanders. While he was returning from his son’s house on East Coast Road, a few known persons stopped him on the way on the pretext of having a chat. The assailants pushed him into a waiting car and took him to Porur, where they confined him to a de-addiction centre, and handcuffed, and threatened him with a gun. The kidnappers called his son Basheer and demanded Rs. 5 crore as ransom. Mr. Basheer lodged a complaint in the Kanathur police station. Immediately, special teams were formed under Mahendran and R. Karthikeyan, Deputy Commissioners of Police, Adyar and Kilpauk, respectively. The gang reduced the ransom to Rs. 50 lakh and demanded that Mr. Basheer come with the money to Tambaram. The police team and Mr. Basheer waited at the designated place but no one turned up. Again, Mr. Basheer got a call from the gang demanding Rs. 25 lakh to be handed over near a shopping mall in Egmore on Tuesday. He, along with plainclothesmen, waited for the gang. One of the suspects got down from a car and received the money. He hurriedly left in a car. A policeman then jumped on the bonnet of the car and tried to stop the vehicle. The other policemen chased the car in an auto. A CCTV captured the rescue operation. The police rescued Mr. Moosa and arrested Kumar alias Aruppu Kumar, 45, Prakash, 40, and Shanthi, 30, and launched a manhunt to nab three others, namely Gandhi, Vinodh and Mani, who fled the spot. The police seized a large amount of cash from them. Sources said Aruppu Kumar had been working with Mr. Moosa for long and had criminal cases, including murder and other offences against his name. But the two fell out because of a dispute over payments. So, his gang decided to abduct the retired policeman and get a hefty ransom. As per their plan, they kidnapped Mr. Moosa and kept him in the de-addiction centre with the help of Gandhi and his wife Shanthi in Porur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-held-for-abducting-a-retired-si/article36870174.ece
07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Come up with guidelines to end flex board culture, HC tells State||The Madras High Court has directed the State government to come up with a comprehensive set of guidelines indicating the measures necessary to discourage and completely stop the practice of impeding pedestrian and vehicular movement by erecting flex boards, festoons, buntings, cut-outs and the like on roads and pavements. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu said it would be best if the government suggested disincentives or penalty against those who put up such temporary structures or gates or welcome arches on public places to invite political leaders and thereby pose grave danger to the pedestrians as well as motorists. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by E.R. Mohanraj, an advocate from Villupuram. The petitioner had complained about the electrocution of a 13-year-old boy when he was erecting iron flag poles to welcome Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi to a marriage function in Villupuram on August 20. On the other hand, Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram told the court that a contractor had engaged the minor boy for the work. He said the contractor was arrested and subsequently released on bail. The Collector had also paid an initial compensation of Rs. 1 lakh to the family of the deceased and the criminal investigation was on. The A-G also brought it to the notice of the court that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had issued a diktat in 2019 instructing his party cadre not to erect flex boards for party events. The judges directed the government officials to file a written response to the PIL petition by November 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/come-up-with-norms-to-end-flex-board-culture-hc-to-state/article36870173.ece

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Beach-Egmore 4th line to be ready by 2024||The Southern Railway plans to complete the fourth line project between Chennai Beach and Egmore railway stations by 2024, for which steps are being taken to acquire land through the Commissioner of Land Administration (CLA). Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas said the Railway Board had given administrative sanction for executing the fourth line project between Chennai Beach and Egmore and the project would be executed under the Vision 2024 of the Indian Railways. Land acquisition remained a main hurdle in the project. A major portion of the land needed to be acquired from the Defence department and the RBI. The CLA held a meeting with various stakeholders last week in this regard, he said. The completion of the fourth line project would help in segregating express and suburban trains and increase services. The Vision 2024 project was part of an initiative under which several important infrastructure schemes would be taken up. Mr. Thomas was addressing the media after participating in the virtual meeting with the Railway Board Chairman and CEO Suneet Sharma on Wednesday, in which productivity linked bonus (PLB) was declared for railway employees (not for gazetted staff) equivalent to 78 days salary with a maximum amount fixed at Rs. 17,951. Mr. Thomas said the PLB would be paid to 72,241 employees of Southern Railway with a budget outlay of Rs. 130 crore. The Southern Railway had performed well in freight traffic during the time of the pandemic this financial year with the freight traffic increasing by 12% compared to last year and the earnings increasing by 25%. He said the punctuality of the train services had improved to 93%. Regarding the platform ticket charge of Rs. 50 at stations, Mr. Thomas said the rate was increased to control crowds as part of the COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures. As and when the COVID-19 pandemic ends, the Railway Board would restore the old rate of Rs. 10, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beach-egmore-4th-line-to-be-ready-by-2024/article36870571.ece
07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Drinking water supply in Chennai touches nearly 1,000 mld||The city’s drinking water supply touched nearly 1,000 million litres a day (mld) on Tuesday, a milestone in the city’s water history. This year, the Metrowater has been steadily increasing the quantum of drinking water supply. With abundant resources available, particularly in the city reservoirs, the water agency plans to sustain daily water supply for a minimum of 15 months. On Tuesday, the supply through pipelines in core parts of the city was increased to 780.52 mld compared to 745 mld of supply provided on Sunday. Similarly, supply to added areas has also been stepped up to nearly 137 mld. Officials of the Metrowater noted that the five city reservoirs had a combined storage of nearly 9,372 million cubic feet, which was 80% of their full capacity. Veeranam tank, which augments the city’s supply, also has nearly 60% of its storage capacity. While the reservoirs contribute to a major share of water drawal among the various sources, groundwater in well fields and local sources in added areas too pitch in for the supply. Drawal from the two desalination plants has been reduced, particularly from Minjur, as there is sufficient water available in reservoirs. Mobile water supply has been cut by 25% and trips are being operated proportionate to the demand. As of now, about 4,000 trips are being operated daily, including on payment. A senior official said as normal rainfall was predicted during the northeast monsoon, the reservoirs were expected to touch their full level. If they reached full capacity, the water available would help sustain city supply up to 17 months. However, further increase in supply above 1,000 mld is more of a technical decision, taking into account the capacity and design of the pipeline network both in the city and merged areas. Supply to core areas is likely to be stepped up. Difficulties in suburbs Pointing out difficulties in boosting water supply in added areas on a par with core parts, the official said many of the merged areas did not network or function with old infrastructure. Detailed project reports for water supply networks were being prepared for areas such as Semmencheri and Neelankarai. Once the merged areas had proper infrastructure, the water agency would ensure equitable supply, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drinking-water-supply-in-chennai-touches-nearly-1000-mld/article36870501.ece
07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro selects one more consultant for phase II||From managing quality to tracking deadlines, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) has appointed a general consultant for monitoring a section of the phase II project. According to sources in CMRL, the bid was opened and the joint venture of AECOM India, Oriental Consultants Global and Nippon Koei has been chosen as the general consultant for the 26.09 km Poonamallee-Light House stretch, which constitutes one of the three stretches in the phase II project whose cost is pegged at Rs. 61,843 crore and total length is 118.9 km. For two other sections — Madhavaram to CMBT and Madhavaram to Shollinganallur, the joint venture of Nippon Koei, Aarvee Associates and Balaji Railroad Systems Pvt Ltd. has been chosen as the general consultant. “The general consultant will review the detailed design of the viaduct and the station to check for any issues before construction begins, monitor the quality assurance promised by the contractors and check if they meet every deadline given for the respective contract. Also, the consultant will act as an interface between different contractors like civil, track and systems to see if there is any lack of coordination and other issues,” an official said. This contract had to be finalised a few months ago. Earlier, when the CMRL had called for this tender, there were some complaints from the bidders and eventually, the process was called off, and a new tender was floated again. “The job of a general consultant is crucial as they provide their expertise to ensure that there is no compromise on the quality of construction from the beginning of the project till the end. But it is important that Chennai Metro Rail reviews the work of the general consultant so that there are no safety lapses,” a source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-selects-one-more-consultant-for-phase-ii/article36870556.ece

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation officials seal 9 shops in Korattur||The Greater Chennai Corporation officials on Wednesday sealed nine shops in Korattur, which were functioning out of buildings owned by the civic body, as they failed to pay rent for several months. Officials said of the 40 shops in a group of Corporation-owned buildings in Korattur, occupants of only 10 shops paid rent regularly while 15 shops were vacant. “Those running the remaining 15 shops have kept the rent pending for several months, some even for up to four years,” an official from Ambattur zone said. Kamala Kannan, a licence inspector with GCC’s Ambattur zone, said the shopkeepers together owed about Rs. 20 lakh to the civic body. “Nine of these 15 shops that failed to clear the dues despite several warnings were sealed today,” he said. Pointing out that those running these shops had taken it on rent when Ambattur was a municipality before its merger with the GCC, he said the monthly rent of these shops was around Rs. 5,000. Highlighting that the action on Wednesday was taken as per instructions of senior officials, he said all the 106 such shops in Ambattur zone were checked to trace defaulters. “We will soon be initiating action against some shops in Padi and Ram Nagar,” he said.

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City of 1,000 Tanks, a strategy to make Chennai water resilient, launched||As a concerted effort towards making Chennai water resilient, City of 1,000 Tanks, a strategy for developing holistic solutions to improve water availability and minimise wastage, was launched in the city on Wednesday. A consortium of experts from various fields will develop a water balance model to collect rainwater and treat wastewater with nature-based solutions to improve groundwater recharge. Pilot project A pilot project has been initiated at the Little Flower Convent Higher Secondary School, and this would be upscaled to various flagship projects across the Chennai city. The City of 1,000 Tanks will bring together a team of various organisations — Netherlands-based OOZE Architects and Urbanists as lead and Goethe Institute, Madras Terrace Architectural Works, Care Earth Trust, IIT-Madras, Rain Centre, Biomatrix Water, Paperman Foundation and Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities and Uravugal Social Welfare Trust. Greener Chennai On the vision, Sudheendra N.K. of Madras Terrace Architectural Works, said that the concept was to improve the groundwater table and transform Chennai into a greener city. Noting that the city faced issues of drought, floods and sanitation, despite sufficient annual rainfall, he said unplanned urbanisation was one of the reasons. The ongoing pilot project in Little Flower Convent would demonstrate balanced use of water. Besides rainwater harvesting measures, wastewater collected in the open space would be treated using constructed wetlands with reeds. Reclaimed water The reclaimed water would be collected for non-potable reuse and also groundwater recharge. The school would benefit with nearly 25,000 litres of water a day, Mr. Sudheendra said. The consortium is also in talks with the government to scale up to flagship projects in the city. Eva Pfannes, co-founder of OOZE Architects and Urbanists, highlighted on the Mylapore flagship project that would have constructed wetlands, bioswales and detention parks as its key elements. Historic temple tanks would be restored for better groundwater recharge and creation of better urban space. 53 historic tanks There are 53 such historic tanks in the city with a recharge potential of 50 million litres a day, and the projects can be replicated in them. She also spoke in detail about the adaptive public housing programme in Chitra Nagar. Henk Ovink, special envoy for international water affairs, Netherlands government noted that the City of 1,000 Tanks was established through water as leverage for resilient cities. Asia and Chennai was chosen as it had a coalition of challenges and opportunities to bring in change.

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. itself is doing business of alcohol, says Madras HC||The Madras High Court has ordered the release of a scooter seized by the police for being used to carry 96 bottles of liquor. The court passed the order after taking into consideration that “the government itself is doing business of alcohol through Tasmac (Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation) shops” and hence people have very easy access to all kinds of alcoholic substances. Justice P. Velmurugan made the observation while allowing a petition filed by A. Ayyappan, whose scooter was used by one Kirubakaran to transport liquor bottles. The vehicle was intercepted at Karumagoundampalayam by the Tiruchengode Rural police in Namakkal district on August 15. A case was booked under the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act of 1937 and the vehicle was seized. When the owner sought return of the vehicle, the Judicial Magistrate in Tiruchengode rejected the plea and hence the petitioner had approached the High Court by way of a revision. Justice Velmurugan ordered the release of the vehicle on consideration of two facts, one was that the vehicle would get spoilt on being exposed to heat and rain when it gets dumped in an open space in judicial custody. The second consideration was: “Since the government itself is doing business of selling alcohol through Tasmac shops, it is very easy for the public to access the subject matter liquor.” Therefore, the judge directed the Magistrate to return the scooter on condition that the petitioner must make a non-refundable deposit Rs. 25,000 to Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund through online payment. The petitioner was also directed to produce the original registration certificate before the Magistrate before taking possession of the vehicle and undertake not to make any alterations to the vehicle. He was further ordered to produce the vehicle as and when necessary and given an undertaking that he would not use the scooter for any illegal activities in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-itself-is-doing-business-of-alcohol-says-madras-hc/article36870214.ece

Dr. Anbumani pointed out that price of a cylinder had been increased eight times in the last eight months and said the price hike was unfair. “In February, the price of a gas cylinder was Rs. 710. This has been increased [over a period of time] by Rs. 205. It is not right to increase the price of a cylinder by 29% in eight months. This will affect the poor and middle class families,” he said.

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Amid rising interest rates, State to borrow less in Q3||Tamil Nadu has indicated that it will borrow Rs. 13,000 crore through issue of bonds known as State Development Loans (SDLs) in the third quarter (October-December) of FY 2021-2022. It borrowed Rs. 15,000 crore in the same period last year. For the first half (April-September) of 2021-22, the State’s borrowing through issue of SDLs was Rs. 39,000 crore, down nearly 19% from Rs. 48,000 crore in the first half of 2020-21. “This [the decline in borrowings] could probably be due to the State’s improved revenue position relative to the expenditure being undertaken. Also, the State may be reluctant to add to its liabilities after having borrowed heavily in FY21,” said Kavita Chacko, senior economist at CARE Ratings. A senior government official said the borrowing plan was based on cash availability and also based on interest costs. “Last year (2020-21), first quarter interest rates were low. This year that is not the case. We are spacing out borrowings this year for that reason too,” he said. According to data from ratings firm ICRA, the weighted average interest rate on shorter tenure SDLs was 5.97% in Q1, FY 2021 and 5.44% in Q2, FY 2021. This has increased to 6.43% in Q1, FY 2022 and 6.54% in Q2, FY 2022, it said. On October 5, the government raised Rs. 1,000 crore through issue of SDL with tenure of 10 years with an interest rate of 6.9%. The weighted average borrowing cost has increased to 6.91% from 6.85% in the previous auction of SDLs. Faced with a difficult financial position with higher fiscal and revenue deficits, Finance Minister Palanivel Thiyaga Rajan has hinted at focusing on revenue augmentation measures once economy returns back to normalcy from the impact of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-to-borrow-less-in-q3-amid-rising-interest-rates/article36870175.ece

07 October 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Dalits are people, have lives, wives, children’||When some write about oppressed people, the human being gets lost in a lot of adjectival description, former journalist and author Mark Tully said, adding that he doesn’t want to underestimate anyone else’s suffering. He was speaking at a discussion organised by the Madras Book Club on his new book, Upcountry Tales, with N. Ram, Director, THG Publishing Group Pvt Ltd. “I don’t want to underestimate anyone’s suffering. I do want people to remember that Dalits are people, individuals, have lives, wives, children... We must have some description, but just as I see, sometimes Dalit lives get lost [in the writing],” he said, speaking about one of the stories in the book about a Dalit defying tradition to build a temple. Mr. Ram said the people Mr. Tully speaks about in the book are not ordinary people but they are also not prominent. “There are serious stories and some light-hearted ones as well. Tully has been engaging in key questions of modern Indian history...the [British] Raj, whether it had any impact, the impact of railways, Gandhi vs Nehru and so on...,” he said and asked whether Mr. Tully was raising these questions through his characters. ‘Hangover of Raj’ “The hangover of the Raj went on for too long. It is going away now but whether it is going away in the right way has to be seen. I don’t think India has still yet fully come face to face with the question of ‘Asli Hindustan’. If you talk of ‘Asli Hindustan’, you are immediately deemed a support of Hindutva. India doesn’t equal Hindutva,” Mr. Tully explained. Mr. Tully said one of the things he had learnt from India was that one must never go overboard over anything and about not seeing everything in just black and white.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dalits-are-people-have-lives-wives-children/article36870157.ece

07 October 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. completes 24x7 water supply scheme in Jayaram Nagar||Telugupalayam Jayaram Nagar resident J. Manoharan used to leave the drinking water pipe open so that his sump gets filled as and when the Coimbatore Corporation supplies water. His neighbour K. Srinivasan used to fill his sump first and then use a motor to pump water to the overhead tank. All that has changed in the area in the last month or so after the Corporation completed the 24x7 drinking water supply scheme in the locality, which has 6,296 persons living in over 600 houses and apartments. Mr. Manoharan says he longer leaves the pipe open as the Corporation supplies water round-the-clock. He opens the pipeline to fill his sump, uses the water and after a few days reopens the pipeline to refill the sump. Mr. Srinivasan says he has stopped using motor to pump water to the tank on the second floor as the pressure at which the civic body supplies water is good enough to reach the height. And as use of motor is no longer required, he is no more worried about power cut or shutdown. This change has been possible with the Corporation replacing over 20 km pipeline in the area under the 24x7 drinking water supply scheme, which Suez India Pvt. Ltd. executes. The civic body is implementing the scheme in 60 wards covering the old city areas. The Corporation chose Jayaram Nagar for implementing the project first because its survey showed the need for replacing all water supply pipeline, right from the local distribution tank in the area. The Corporation replaced pipeline for over 20 km, all the 623 house service connection lines and fixed new water meters with improved accuracy to record consumption. As a result of the change, the residents in Jayaram Nagar began getting water round-the-clock, the sources say. The Corporation earlier supplied once in 10 to 12 days in summer and once in a week during monsoon season for about six hours. Now, as the residents get water as and when they want they do not have to keep open pipe. Or they do not have to open pipe when the Corporation supplies water. All residents opening pipe at once was the reason for lack of adequate pressure in the water supply system. As the Corporation has eliminated this and began providing water on demand, it is able to supply water with adequate pressure, the sources add. The Corporation’s next step in Jayaram Nagar is to complete work for another 600 residents in a neighbouring locality so that all residents who get water from the Jayaram Nagar tank come under the 24x7 scheme, the source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-completes-24x7-water-supply-scheme-in-jayaram-nagar/article36870583.ece
07 October 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Compensation for airport land acquisition inadequate’||While allocation of Rs. 1,132 crore for Coimbatore airport expansion project brought cheer to many, hundreds of land owners, especially those who have houses and industrial units, feel that the compensation is simply inadequate for a fresh start. According to them, they will only be able to purchase new land, that too in places far away from city, with the money they get as compensation from the government. To build a new house or industrial unit, they will have to source several lakhs. On Wednesday, land owners from Uppilipalayam village petitioned the District Collector re-representing their demand for an alternative land. “I constructed a house spread over 1,250 sqft in my four-cent land 20 years ago. I was awarded Rs. 35 lakh as compensation. I had to shell out Rs. 15 lakh to purchase just more than 2.5 cents of land at Masagoundenchettipalayam. The remaining Rs. 20 lakh is inadequate for me to build a house with facilities I had before,” said S. Chandran, president of an association of residents from Uppiliplayam who were affected by the land acquisition project. There are 110 houses in the areas identified for the land acquisition at Uppilipalayam village. “Those who have four to five cents will get Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 lakh as compensation. Those who have two to three cents will get around Rs. 15 lakh. How can they purchase land and build new houses with the money? We are not against the developmental project. All we demand is a fair compensation, an alternative land to build new houses,” he said. The 624.81 acres of land identified for the airport expansion are located in 24 blocks in four villages. Places in Uppilipalayam come under blocks 4, 5 and 6. The petitioners said that the government did not follow procedures listed in the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. A land owner said the government or the district administration was yet to give a clear information on how the Public Works Department assessed the value of buildings in the lands to be acquired. The price fixed for compensation is Rs. 1,500 per sqft for residential plots and Rs. 900 per sqft for agricultural plots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensation-for-airport-land-acquisition-inadequate/article36870587.ece

Officials of the Revenue and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments departments and the police could not control the crowd which gathered at the ghat from morning. In view of the restrictions that are in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities had requested devotees to avoid gathering at the ghat. As the flow of devotees increased and physical distancing norms floated at the ghat and the temple premises, officials used public address system to send them back. As COVID-19 restrictions are in place, the temple authorities had not erected barricades at the ghat for people to perform rituals on the banks of the river. The water in the river had turned muddy due to recent rain. However, more than 100 people visited the ghat on Wednesday. Last year, the police had sent back devotees who attempted to perform rituals at the ghat due to the pandemic-induced restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devotees-throng-perur-ghat-despite-restrictions/article36870590.ece
07 October 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||NGO wants blocks in channels removed||Kovai Kulangal Pathugappu Amaipu, an NGO engaged in water conservation, has urged the State government to remove blocks in channels feeding water to tanks, at least during this monsoon season. Deficit rainfall In a communication, the NGO said the water flow in River Noyyal that fed the tanks was poor because of deficit rainfall during the South-West Monsoon season. There was water flow in the river for eight to 10 days a few days ago but the water did not reach the Vellalore tank. The earth dug for implementing the River Noyyal rejuvenation scheme was dumped into the channel feeding the tank. This, and the contractor executing the scheme work failing to remove earth from both sides of the sluices at the channel’s mouth twice stopped the water from flowing into the tank. In the recent past when there was water flow in River Noyyal, the Vellalore tank did not get as much water as it should have because the Highways Department, constructing the Ukkadam flyover, had blocked water flow. Though the State Government had carved out a separate department for managing water resources, the people were yet to gain anything from it because of officials on the ground, the NGO alleged and pointed out that in earliest instance, earth was removed only after it took up an issue to the collector’s notice. Therefore, the State Government would do well to protect water bodies by removing blocks, it reiterated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngo-wants-blocks-in-channels-removed/article36870579.ece

07 October 2021||KARAIKAL,TAMIL NADU||Intense afforestation drive launched in Karaikal district||The Karaikal administration has initiated a greening drive with the tagline: ‘Plant or adopt a tree - give the gift of life.’ The greening drive implies that the government departments and offices and the general public will support the campaign by presenting tree saplings measuring three to five feet in place of shawls and bouquets as a gesture of greeting dignitaries at times of official visits. The district administration expects the dignitaries to plant the saplings in public places or hand them over to authorities so that they could be planted in suitable locations. In an appeal to the public, Collector Arjun Sharma sought their commitment to save greenery by planting and adopting trees, thereby contributing to afforestation efforts, promotion of biodiversity, setting right damaged ecosystems, mitigating climate changes and improving the environment. He advised them to gift tree saplings with tree guards to their guests on special occasions such as marriage, birthday, house warming and anniversary. The public organisations are expected to adopt the planted trees until they grow up. “The appeal has been received well by the people. Non-Government Organisations, self-help groups and the public in general have evinced interest in playing active roles. Some of the NGOs have shown interest in raising palmyra trees along the coastline,” Mr. Arjun Sharma said. There was at least 30% of green cover in Karaikal, but there are several areas including river banks, channel bunds, road stretches and coastal areas where the green cover could be expanded. The initiative would be carried out by the Agriculture Department and coordinated by the Forest Department. The Department of Information and Publicity, and all other government departments would also render support to the intense afforestation drive in Karaikal, the Collector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intense-afforestation-drive-launched-in-karaikal-district/article36870134.ece

In a statement, Madurai Corporation commissioner, K. P. Karthikeyan, said that out of the total demand of Rs. 84.24 crore for the first half of 2021-22, the Corporation has dues to the tune of Rs. 22.49 crore. The city residents should have paid the first half yearly dues by September 30. However, the Corporation was yet to receive Rs. 4.83 crore towards property tax, Rs. 2.88 crore towards vacant land tax, Rs. 95 lakh towards solid waste management charges, Rs. 3.02 crore towards professional tax and Rs. 7.53 crore towards underground drainage charges. Appealing to the people to cooperate with the urban local body and not to delay the payment of dues, he urged the residents to pay the dues in the next 15 days. Action would be initiated against individuals and organisations that fail to comply with the instruction, he said. Meanwhile, the corporation impounded 29 cows and buffaloes that were found roaming on the streets posing danger to the public.

07 October 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court orders restoration of community certificate||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Ramanathapuram district authorities to restore at once the community certificate originally issued to a Hindu Pallan woman who was married to a Christian. The court said the cancellation of the community certificate showed “...a degree of narrow-mindedness that the Constitution does not encourage”. Nothing might be presumed upon a member of a particular community respecting another community or another religion; indeed, that is the constitutional mandate and not otherwise, observed a Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M. Duraiswamy. The certificate was cancelled merely because the woman, a doctor, married a Christian, and their children were recognised as members of the community of her husband. The judges observed that there was no doubt that the petitioner belonged to the Hindu Pallan community, and there was no dispute that she was born to Hindu Pallan parents. In the counter-affidavit, the authorities said they had visited the clinic of the petitioner and found a ‘Cross’ hanging on the wall. The officials assumed that she had converted to Christianity, and this resulted in the cancellation of the certificate. The judges observed that the specious excuses offered by the officials could not be accepted. There was no suggestion in the affidavit that the petitioner had abandoned her faith or she had embraced Christianity. It is equally possible that the petitioner, as part of a family, might accompany her husband and children to Sunday matins. But the mere fact that a person goes to church does not mean such a person has abandoned the original faith. Taking into account the fact that the action appeared to be arbitrary and based on surmises and conjectures without any material fact, the court set aside the order passed by the Ramanathapuram Collector in 2013. The scrutiny committee would do well to approach the matter with a broader mind than what was evident in the present case, the judges observed. The court allowed the petition filed by the woman in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-orders-restoration-of-community-certificate/article36870156.ece

07 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||SEC to issue fresh poll notification by Oct. 12||The State Election Commission will issue a fresh notification announcing the new schedule for the local body polls before October 12, in compliance with the orders of the Madras High Court. According to sources in the SEC, the new schedule would be announced after the government withdraws its 2019 notification providing reservation for the Scheduled Tribes and the Backward Classes in the local body polls in the Union Territory. The Madras High Court had, on Tuesday, allowed the SEC to withdraw a notification issued on September 22, announcing the schedule for the local body polls, and issue a fresh notification within five days after correcting anomalies in reserving wards. “It means that as per the court order, we have to announce the new schedule by October 12,” an official said. No reservation of seats The government had, through the Additional Solicitor General, informed the court that it had decided not to reserve any of the seats for the Backward Classes and the Scheduled Tribes, and to reserve certain wards only for the Scheduled Castes. The government’s decision to withdraw its 2019 notification providing reservation for the Backward Classes and the Scheduled Tribes “seemed not to be the right step in having a smooth conduct of the polls”, observed Tamil Nadu State Committee member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) V. Perumal. Mr. Perumal, who fought a long battle in the court to conduct the local body polls in 2006 after a gap of 38 years, said, “Everything seems to be a delaying tactic. The government should be more interested in conducting the polls than being party to the attempts by a section of people to derail the democratic process. The conduct of the local body polls is vital to strengthening grassroots democracy in the Union Territory,” he said. The government should take immediate steps so that the local body polls are held at the earliest, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sec-to-issue-fresh-poll-notification-by-oct-12/article36870408.ece
07 October 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||L-G reviews dengue preparedness||The administration is closely monitoring the incidence of dengue, which has historically seen a spike in the September-October period coinciding with the onset of the north-east monsoon, Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said on Wednesday. The Lt. Governor, who reviewed the dengue preparedness at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Women and Child Hospital (RGGWCH), told media that though there were six beds exclusively dedicated for dengue cases, the institution had the capacity to add more beds if required. As far as children were concerned, dengue posed a far greater threat than COVID-19, and one of the measures of preparedness in managing the mosquito-borne disease was to be ready for transfusion of blood and components as some patients could face a rapid plunge in platelet count. However, there was no need for the public to panic as all efforts were being made on the treatment, monitoring and prevention fronts, the Lt. Governor said. “It is remarkable that there has been no dengue child deaths at the RGGWCH for the past ten years,” she said. On the prevention front, efforts were being intensified jointly by the Health, PWD and Local Administration Departments for the upkeep of hygiene and to raise awareness on public participation in eliminating breeding sites for Aedes aegypti species of mosquitoes. “It is important to empty out water receptacles in households,” Ms. Soundararajan added. The Lt. Governor said the Education Department was taking all necessary steps for the reopening of schools and a decision would be taken soon. Pointing out that only under 3 lakh people were yet to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she urged them to take the shot without delay to ensure that the entire eligible population in the Union Territory was covered by at least one dose as early as possible. The National Vector Borne Disease Control programme has been in operation in Puducherry since 2003. In its current form, the NVBDCP is an umbrella programme, targeting malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, Lymphatic filariasis and Visceral leishmaniasis, a serious parasital infection also known as kala-azar (black fever). Of these, five are mosquito-spread while the sandfly-borne black fever has not been reported in Puducherry. Conventionally, the Union Territory has been seeing a sharp spike in dengue cases during September-October period coinciding with the onset of the north-east monsoon. This year, there have been a total of 475 cases till now, health officials said while briefing the Lt. Governor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/l-g-reviews-dengue-preparedness/article36870405.ece

07 October 2021||T IRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Decision to pause Ph.D. requirement comes as a breather||Self-financing colleges, principals believe, will have a breather this year, now that the Central government has announced its decision to put on hold the plan to make Ph.D. the minimum qualification for recruitment of assistant professors, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The managements of the institutions do anticipate a formal communication from the University Grants Commission in this regard, though there is a general sense of relief that vacancies could be filled with the ideal candidates from a much larger pool of applicants. While setting the criteria for recruitments for entry-level posts at universities and colleges in 2018, the University Grants Commission had given a three-year window to candidates to complete their doctorate degrees and asked all universities and colleges to start applying the criteria for recruitment from the 2021-22 academic session. “The statement of Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan that the mandatory requirement of Ph.D. for the post of assistant professors will be lifted as a one-time measure to fill unfilled vacancies, is indeed a timely intervention in the interests of not only the new applicants with PG qualification but also the section of existing teachers who are pursuing their doctorate degrees on a part-time basis,” V. Sujatha, Principal, Cauvery College for Women, Tiruchi, said. But for a few subjects including Tamil and Commerce, it has become extremely difficult for self financing colleges to recruit teachers with Ph.D. qualification, according to the college heads. “Yet, having more number of faculty without Ph.d. qualification must, in fact, be viewed also as a bane for self-financing affiliated colleges in the long run since the institutions struggle to make a mark in the NIRF ranking," Ms. Sujatha pointed out. The institutions lose out in the ‘Teaching-Learning and Evaluation' criterion of NAAC accreditation that contributes a weightage of 350 (out of 1,000 marks),” she explained. The managements of self-financing colleges are looking forward to derive the utility of the window period accruing from the Central government’s decision to facilitate teachers of BBA/MBA programmes to complete their doctorate degrees. “It is extremely difficult to get candidates with Ph.d. qualification for the Department of Management. Two years of teaching experience for newly recruited teachers will qualify them to enrol for part-time Ph.D.” I. Sarumathi, Principal, Annai Women's Arts and Science College, Karur, said. “Nevertheless, it is important to note that the reprieve from the relaxation is only for this year, and that the University Grants Commission’s basic requirement of Ph.D. for teaching jobs is what would be permanent," Ms. Sarumathi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decision-to-pause-phd-requirement-comes-as-a-breather/article36870132.ece
07 October 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Violence mars first phase of polling in Tenkasi||The district witnessed peaceful first phase polling on Wednesday as voters cast their votes to elect 1,259 representatives from 3,327 candidates in the battle of ballots to various positions in the rural local bodies. In Tenkasi, the first phase of polling was conducted in 754 polling booths for electing 8 district panchayat councillors, 84 panchayat union councillors, 118 village panchayat presidents and 1,056 village panchayat ward members from 3,327 candidates in the fray. Like Tirunelveli, polling started at snail’s pace as the poll percentage stood at 10.78 at 9 a.m., which rose to 24.73 at 11 a.m. and 39.85 at 1 p.m. However, the next two hours saw brisk polling to take the poll percentage to 55.29 at 3 p.m. Led by Superintendent of Police R. Krishnaraj, over 2,000 policemen had been deployed across the district. Though minor altercations broke out in a few places between the supporters of different candidates, the immediate police intervention brought back normalcy in these places. However, the violence broke out in two places triggered tension in the night. When the polling came to an end at 6 p.m. in the polling station at Kazhuneerkulam near Alangulam where Aandaperumal and K. Murugan, both belonging to different caste are contesting for the Kazhuneerkulam panchayat president post, the officials issued tokens to the voters waiting to cast their votes and closed the gate. As rumours were spread that bogus votes were being cast by the supporters of Murugan, a group of people from Kazhuneerkulam went to Therkku Kazhuneerketulam where they thrashed one Esakkimuthu, 45, who was rushed to the Tenkasi Government Hospital. Demanding the arrest of those who assaulted Mr. Esakkimuthu, Therkku Kazhuneerkulam villagers blocked vehicular traffic on Alangulam – Surandai Road. The agitation was withdrawn after police assured the protesters of stern and impartial action. When similar rumours were spread even as voting was going on in Naranapuram polling station after 6 p.m., Naranapuram panchayat president candidate Selvi’s husband Manimaran was targetted even as he came to Naranapuram in his car in the night. As a mob rained stones on his car, the vehicle suffered damage while he escaped with minor bruises. When a clash between the villagers of Naranapuram and neighbouring Marudhappapuram erupted in the night, the Naranapuram villagers abducted 3 Marudhappapuram villagers. In retaliation, Marudhappapuram villagers took 6 Naranapuram residents as hostages. After Mr. Krishnaraj held talks with the villagers, the hostages were released. When Radhakrishnan, 52, of Neduvayal, an independent candidate contesting the election from 7th ward Kadayanallur panchayat union, was canvassing votes for himself on last Friday, he swooned and was admitted to a hospital in Tenkasi. After being shifted to a private hospital in Tirunelveli, Radhakrishnan breathed his last on Tuesday night. “Election would usually be countermanded only if the candidates of recognised political parties passed away before the polls. Since he is an independent candidate, the voters were asked not to vote for him by pasting a sticker in the list of candidates kept in the polling booths. If he is elected, the by-election for ward 7 of Kadayanallur union will be held as per the decision taken by the State Election Commission,” the officials said. Though the State Election Commission had announced that the COVID-19 patients would be allowed to cast their votes between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., general voters also came to the polling booths in large number during this period, forcing the polling officials to issue tokens to the waiting voters so as to enable them to exercise their franchise even after 8 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/violence-mars-polling-in-tenkasi-district/article36870178.ece

Seeking leave of the Assembly for an adjournment motion on the issue, Indian Union Muslim League MLA N.A. Nellikunnu said the “remediation cell”, which had been set up for the welfare of those affected by the pesticide, had been inert for over a year. A medical board should re-examine at least 2,700 people diagnosed with signs of pesticide poisoning, he said. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the government had not included at least 1,000 people diagnosed with pesticide poisoning on the list of endosulfan beneficiaries. At least 3,000 have not received the compensation ordered by the Supreme Court. Endosulfan victims had no access to proper medical care. Social Welfare Minister R.

The Inspector General of Police said Superintendents of Police had been asked to deploy teams to patrol along the river banks to educate the vulnerable groups in the mornings and evenings. A 10-member team of police personnel, who had received training on disaster management, would be stationed at the district headquarters to be pressed into service, if needed, to rescue those caught in the water. According to police, 235 persons had drowned in 225 incidents in central zone so far in 2021. Thanjavur district topped the list with 51 deaths followed by 43 in Tiruchi.

Voters in isolation for COVID-19 were allowed to cast their votes between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. “The polling personnel have been asked to ensure COVID-19-appropriate behaviour at the polling stations,” Mr. Vishnu said after visiting the polling booths in Oasis Matriculation School at KTC Nagar in Palayamkottai around 8.30 a.m. Election Observer J. Jayakanthan also visited a few polling stations during the day. As the 500-odd voters of Maadhudaiyaarkulam villagers under Malaiyankulam village panchayat in Cheranmahadevi union boycotted the polls and refused to come to the polling station to cast their votes in protest against the delay in opening the new ration shop in their village, the officials tried to pacify them. Though the polling started at 7 a.m., the villagers were firm in their decision till 10.25 a.m. even after Tahsildar, Cheranmahadevi, Balu, assured them that the ration shop would be opened once the election mode code is lifted. “After Minister for Cooperation I. Periyasamy gave his consent, the new ration shop was established in Maadhudaiyaarkulam. However, it could not be opened as the election model code of conduct came into force.

When it was found that all the six were only from Tirunelveli district, they were let off in the afternoon. On information about distribution of cash for votes at Ariyakulam, a police team, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Thaazhaiyoothu, Jebaraj nabbed a few persons and took them for interrogation. Since Gopalasamudram under Munneerpallam police station limits had witnessed two gruesome beheading within a gap of just 36 hours in mid-September, the police force deployed in this hamlet were retained even though this town panchayat did not go in for polls on Wednesday. Apart from the two check-posts erected along the road leading to Gopalasamudram from the Tirunelveli – Papanasam Highway, three police vehicles had been stationed near the police outpost in the village to ensure ‘visible policing’ in the hamlet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/first-phase-of-polling-peaceful/article36870496.ece

They wanted the panchayat to be renotified as unreserved or general category claiming that majority in the village were not Dalits and Scheduled Tribes. As per records, of the total population of 1,701 persons in the Ammundi village, 284 persons are Dalits and 11 persons belong to ST community. The Vellore District Election Officer, P. Kumaravel Pandian, who is also the Collector, tried to pacify residents and urged them to cast their votes but in vain. In Tiruvannamalai, the elections will be held for as many as 35 posts including village panchayats and panchayat unions in 77 booths across the district on October 9.  Many of the 2,617 polling booths in these districts witnessed a steady flow of voters since 8 a.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-70-polling-registered-in-vellore-ranipet-districts-tirupattur-records-62/article36870403.ece

Elections were held to 25 district panchayat wards, 247 panchayat union wards, 575 village pancahyats and 4,151 village panchayat wards in the first phase. Voting began at 7 a.m. at over 2,500 polling booths in the two districts amid high security. In Villupuram, polling began on a brisk note amidst a steady drizzle in the morning. Several voters started venturing out to queue up at the polling stations in panchayat unions in Kandamangalam, Mugaiyur, Gingee, Thiruvennainallur, Olakkur, Vanur and Vikravandi.

Despite warning by the district administration, the post of panchayat president had been auctioned, claimed a section of the residents. “We are boycotting the election as our demand for a separate panchayat has not been accepted. Being part of Thuthipet, which comes under Ponnankuppam panchayat, has not benefited us. As many as 24 contestants from the village who had filed nominations for three posts of ward members have withdrawn their nominations,” said M. Selvam, a resident. Kallakurichi Incident-free voting was also witnessed in Kallakurichi district. Polling was brisk at several booths in four panchayat unions with people turning up in large numbers.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||74.37% polling in first phase of elections||Violence broke out at Kazhuneerkulam, near Alangulam, following a rumour that bogus votes were being cast in favour of a candidate belonging to a particular caste. Supporters of another candidate from Kazhuneerkulam went to Therkku Kazhuneerketulam and assaulted Esakkimuthu, 45. He was rushed to the Tenkasi Government Hospital. The other group blocked traffic on the Alangulam-Surandai Road, demanding the arrest of the assailants. The agitation was withdrawn after the police assured the protesters of stern and impartial action. In a similar incident at Naranapuram in the same district, the husband of a candidate for the post of the Naranapuram panchayat president was attacked. He escaped with bruises, though his car was stoned. When a clash between the villagers of Naranapuram and neighbouring Marudhappapuram erupted at night, the Naranapuram villagers abducted three Marudhappapuram residents. In retaliation, Marudhappapuram villagers held six Naranapuram residents hostage. After a senior official held talks with the villagers, the hostages were released. Residents of the Katpadi panchayat union in Vellore boycotted the elections opposing the reservation of the Ammundi village panchayat for the Scheduled Caste candidates. During the second phase of the ordinary elections in nine districts and the casual elections in 28 districts scheduled for October 9, over 16,000 police personnel and more than 2,800 Home Guards would be deployed for duty.

This work is going on across the State. All those who are upset with the BJP or those who are disgruntled with its leadership could join the Congress,” he told journalists. He had no idea about whether his brother Ramesh Jarkiholi would be invited to the Congress, he said. KPCC president D.K.

He also urged the district police to conduct investigation into the murder of Arbaz Mulla, 25, of Khanapur who was allegedly killed by right-wing elements. “We are gathering information about this incident.

07 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Panel to examine correctness of deleting 983.33 acres||Observing that ‘acceptable and justifiable reasons are lacking’ in Bangalore Development Authority’s action of deleting 983.33 acres of land after the issuance of final notification for Arkavathi Layout in 2004, the High Court of Karnataka has set up a three-member committee to examine whether the BDA adhered to earlier directions of the High Court and the apex court in retaining or deleting the land notified for the layout. The committee will consist of K.N. Keshavanarayana, a retired judge of the High Court, Sandeep Dave, a retired IAS officer, and N.S. Megharik, a retired IPS officer, to examine the manner and method adopted by the BDA in deleting 983.33 acres of land. Justice Aravind Kumar delivered the verdict on September 27 while disposing of around 446 petitions filed by K.P. Anjanappa and hundreds of others questioning the modified final acquisition notification issued by the BDA on June 18, 2014. The committee shall examine whether the claim of land owners for deleting their land from being acquired is within the parameters of the directions issued by the Division Bench of the HC in 2005 and of the apex court in Bondu Ramaswamy’s case of 2010 related to Arkavathi Layout land acquisition, the court said. It said that the committee will have to examine all such representations received by BDA pursuant to 2005 and 2010 judgements, and submit a report to the BDA. The BDA, based on the report of the committee, should take steps to delete or include such land from acquisition from amongst 988 acres denotified lands, the court said. The court also said the committee would examine all the representations submitted by the land owners to the BDA to ascertain whether the land of the applicants are landlocked and/or adjacent land having been dropped from acquisition without dropping the land of the applicants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panel-to-examine-correctness-of-deleting-98333-acres/article36870541.ece
07 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘We are trying to shake the deep-rooted agenda of BJP’||In the eye of the storm over his comment that the country and the State are in the grip of the RSS, former Chief Minister and JD(S) leaderH.D. Kumaraswamyon Wednesday insisted that his articulations came from his deep study of the workings of the organisation and was not premeditated or with an eye on the bypolls, where his party has fielded two Muslim candidates. He said that it was also not aimed at deflecting the accusation that his party was working cahoots with the BJP as its “B team” to divide votes. Excerpts from the interview: Why have your comments on RSS come at this point? It was just a coincidence and nothing to do with the bypolls. I have been reading The RSS - The Deep Nation by Dinesh Narayanan the last week. It influenced my thought and I spoke out spontaneously. The RSS of the present is different from what it was 40 years ago. Is it to change the perception that your party is BJP’s ‘B team’? I am not concerned about being called the ‘B team’. My statement on RSS was not even meant to appease Muslims. RSS appeases Hindus and Congress appeases Muslims. As far as our party goes, there is no question of appeasing anyone. I spoke with concern about the democratic institutions in the country that is being systematically dismantled. Someone had to raise the issue, and I have belled the cat. Siddaramaiah equated RSS to Taliban. I have not done that. You have fielded minority candidates in bypolls. It’s being seen as a ploy to divide the votes to benefit the BJP? Congress ran false propaganda calling us BJP’s ‘B team’. We are struggling to tell the Muslim community that we are with them. In the caste-dominated poll narrative, do you think Muslim candidates can win? This is an experiment. Just by fielding minority candidates, I am not saying we will win or draw all minority votes. We want to create confidence among them. The Congress has damaged the community by keeping them as a vote bank. We want to create space for the minorities to take political decisions. There are allegations of you going soft on BJP and this government. Is the assurance given to CM Basavaraj Bommai a pointer to that? Assurance to Mr. Bommai was to prevent instability and elections in the light of COVID-19 and floods. That does not mean we will protect the BJP government. We are trying to shake the deep-rooted agenda of the BJP. The week-long workshop was to create awareness about the hidden agenda of the BJP among our workers and brainstorm on how to tackle it politically. Do you think the strategy will affect the party’s vote base? Have I said I will give party tickets to Muslims in all 224 constituencies? I am trying to utilise opportunities where it is available. There are rumours you may enter into a pre-poll alliance with anyone for 2023. I can assure you 200% that we will not have pre-poll alliance with anyone. We will contest all 224 seats. Has party decided on Kalaburgi City Corporation’s Mayor post? It’s a very crucial decision that is yet to be taken. I am assessing possible damage to our party in future. The Muslim councillors in our party are opposed to tie-up with the Congress. The perception of the public about the BJP government is not good. The Congress’s strategy is to push us towards BJP. I may ask councillors to decide locally. Does JD(S) see a threat in Vokkaliga politics with D.K. Shivakumar as KPCC chief? Mr. Shivakumar cannot become a Vokkaliga leader ever. It is an artificially-created narrative. He was made president to gain sympathy that he went to jail. Even the Congressmen are not sure of his leadership. There is no guarantee that Mr. Shivakumar will become the next Chief Minister. Why will Vokkaligas vote for Congress? H.D. Deve Gowda is the undisputed leader in the community. There is a perception of a thaw between the families. It is just a public perception. Mr. Shivakumar’s agenda is to finish me and the party off in Ramanagaram in 2023. In fact, contrary to public perception, he was responsible for the collapse of my government in 2019 along with Mr. Siddaramaiah.  We are struggling to tell the Muslim community that we are with them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-are-trying-to-shake-the-deep-rooted-agenda-of-bjp/article36870346.ece
07 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP achieves 50% second dose coverage||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) crossed a milestone by inoculating 50% of the population with both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as of October 5. Although BBMP comes second after Bengaluru Urban, which has achieved 58% coverage of the second dose in the State, it is one among the few districts in the country that have covered 50% of their population with both doses. Over 21% of the total 5,75,06,096 doses administered till October 6 are from Bengaluru. Among mega cities, Bengaluru is second after Delhi that has achieved maximum first dose coverage. In the third week of August, BBMP had crossed a milestone by administering a total of over 1 crore doses. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said Bengaluru is much safer now with half of the population being fully vaccinated. “This also shows that the remaining population would be reachable and covered in the next one month or so by which time we are hoping the 84-day gap between two doses of Covishield will be reduced. We are waiting for the Centre to take a call on that so that we can achieve more second dose coverage,” he said. He asserted that the 50% coverage will be instrumental in stemming the possible third wave and the number of cases, particularly hospitalisations. “We are finding that hospitalisations, especially ICU admissions, are significantly low among those who are fully vaccinated,” he said. D. Randeep, BBMP's Special Commissioner (Health), said the civic body is confident of achieving over 95% first dose and nearly 85% second dose coverage by December-end. He said unlike the first dose, which is supply and demand based, the second dose coverage can be handled in a much more structured manner. “The due date list that also has addresses of second dose beneficiaries is available with zonal health officials and medical officers of health from the assembly constituency level up to the Primary Health Centre (PHC) level. The officials will keep track and ensure maximum coverage of the second dose. We will also continue adopting the block and lane level vaccination approach to ensure maximum coverage,” he explained. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said that having achieved 81% coverage for the first dose, Karnataka is pushing for 100% first coverage.“With the exception of some districts in Kalyana Karnataka, we should be able to achieve 100% first dose coverage by the end of this month or early next month. The focus is clearly shifting to second dose coverage,” he said. Bengaluru will be one of the first metros to achieve 100% vaccination, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-achieves-50-second-dose-coverage/article36870230.ece
07 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC refuses to quash case against CEO in illegal Aadhaar enrolment centre case||The High Court of Karnataka has declined to quash a criminal case registered in 2017 against the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a city-based private firm on a complaint that the company was allegedly misleading the public that they are authorised to sublet the Aadhaar enrolment process to individuals at a cost and collect money from the public. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while rejecting the petition filed by Naresh Kumar R.P., CEO of Edurays India, Bengaluru. The complaint was lodged after an official of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), who went as a civilian and sought an Aadhaar card from Namma Kendra, unearthed “nefarious activities of the petitioner in connivance with the enrolment agency in selling Aadhaar kits and Aadhaar cards in April 2017. “Edurays in connivance with Utility Forms Pvt. Ltd. [enrolment agency] were involved in selling the kits and in the process subletting, which is not allowed as per UIDAI norms,” the complaint had said. Terms of scheme Countering the petitioner’s claim of innocence, Assistant Solicitor General of India (Karnataka HC) H. Shanti Bhushna had contended that the in terms of the scheme for empanelment of enrolment agency what was permitted to the enrolment agency was to enter into an agreement with the petitioner and the like, only for securing manpower and not to sublet the job of issuance of Aadhaar card. Observing that the petitioner had not placed any unimpeachable evidence of sterling quality for quashing the criminal proceedings, the court said there were a plethora of circumstances for which the petitioner would have to undergo trial. “The offence alleged against the petitioner having such ramification, as issuance of Aadhaar card by such agencies who are not empowered can also lead to distribution of such cards against the interest of national security. It is prudent for the Government of India or the State Government to have a vigil on such instances of rising cases of frauds in Aadhaar enrolment,” the court observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-refuses-to-quash-case-against-ceo-in-illegal-aadhaar-enrolment-centre-case/article36870237.ece
07 October 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Science and technology are driving the world’||Science and technology are driving the world. And business and commerce are an outcome of technology and science changes, said Uday Kotak, MD and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, who was the chief guest at the Indian Institute of Science’s (IISc.) convocation hosted virtually on Wednesday to confer degrees upon students who graduated in 2020 and 2021. As many as 110 students were awarded medals during the ceremony, while 1,832 PhD and Master’s students, and 204 UG students received their degrees. Terming it a regret for not having studied science, which reflected the mood of the time, he said: “There was a disproportionate emphasis on commerce, finance, and economics. That has completely changed. The pace of change of science is mindblowing. The base principles of science and maths are at the heart of who we are, adaptation to the reality of the external world and making it of use to human consumption is the way we need to think about this,” he said. Offering COVID-19 as an example, Mr. Kotak said the term geography has become history. You suddenly find the world becoming so much closer. The way we operate is the reflection of this fast-changing world, he said, changing to a virtual reality from a physical world in a short span of time. “The speed of change can be dramatically different,” he added. Mr. Kotak said there are three ways of looking at the situation now: new normal, next normal, never normal. “We will have to forget the concept of normalcy. The world will keep changing. How students will deal with this is the true test of fundamentals of what you’ve learnt,” he said, adding that as for AI and ML, in the battle between man and machine, both can win. “Machine learning also comes from a human brain. There will be contrarians. But it is an important lesson that there’s no ultimate to change. At best, there is a comma. The constancy of this paradigm changing is what institutions will grapple with,” he said. A.S. Kiran Kumar, Vikram Sarabhai professor and former Chair of ISRO and former secretary of DOS, and Chair of IISc. council, was the guest of honour. Since the inception of IISc. in 1909, more than 20,000 students have graduated from the institute. IISc. offers PhD and Integrated PhD programmes, several Master’s programmes, and a four-year BSc. (Research) programme. During the convocation, the institute announced starting of medical courses from next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/science-and-technology-are-driving-the-world/article36870341.ece

Mallikarjun Kharge said the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is infiltrating all sectors, and his long fight against the organisation was one of the major reasons for his defeat in the 2019 LS polls from Kalaburagi constituency. “They are infiltrating everywhere... even education. Many officers are directly recruited by amending the rules,” Mr. Kharge said to a question. Speaking to the media at the party office in Bengaluru, Mr. Kharge said he has been fighting RSS ideology from the age of 15. “We are fighting against RSS. We don’t want to hide it.

On applications of revenue site owners, the court said that the three-member committee will examine the application for allotment a site for them as per BDA’s scheme. The court also directed the committee to examine by conducting a spot inspection of layouts formed by housing co-operative societies, unions and associations where sites allotted to their members, and construction of buildings have come up. If the committee is of the view that layouts are self-contained, then the BDA should delete such land from acquisition, the court said, while making it clear if the BDA had already taken possession ofl and from such societies, formed sites and allotted them, then members of the societies having registered sale deeds in their favour would be entitled only for allotment of alternative sites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bda-directed-to-execute-lease-cum-sale-documents-in-favour-of-site-allottees/article36870542.ece

The growers of coffee, areca and small farmers who were preparing for the harvest are worried about losing the crop due to the incessant rains. As the low-lying areas are flooded, many residents are busy clearing the water that gushed into their houses. A few portions of coffee estates owned by three planters at Mallodi in Kalasa taluk were damaged following a landslide caused due to heavy rains. The flow of rainwater increased and caused the landslide. Similar incidents were reported on a large scale during heavy rains in 2019 in Mudigere taluk. The areca growers in Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru have been facing difficulty to tackle the leaf spot disease, caused due to increase in moisture. The continuous rains have stopped them from spraying medicines.

07 October 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Get innovative ideas from the ground, students told||Vice-Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, M. Jagadeesh Kumar has advised students not to confine themselves to the four walls of their classrooms or the laboratory but to go to areas of work and get first-hand information and gather innovative ideas from the ground. “Our students should go to the areas of work and meet farmers, workers and other working people to get ideas from the ground. Innovation is very important. Innovation doesn’t come only from working in a laboratory. Many innovations have come from field visits and multidisciplinary studies, discussion and debates. There are many examples of problems getting solved through innovation,” Mr. Kumar said in his valedictory address that he remotely delivered during the second day of the two-day workshop on the implementation of National Education Policy 2020 (NEP-2020) at the Central University of Karnataka here on Wednesday. The event was jointly organised by the Central University and the Centre for Educational and Social Studies (CESS), Bengaluru. Resource person Laxman G. from ABRSM, Hyderabad, who participated as guest of honour, highlighted the process in which the NEP-2020 was drafted and also gave a bird’s eye view of its salient features. “The NEP-2020 Drafting Committee took almost four years to prepare the policy. It involved all the stakeholders and incorporated their ideas in the policy to make it holistic and students-centric and nationalistic. The policy covers education from KG to UG,” he said. Mr. Laxman said that the poor quality of educational institutions in India that have been suffering from inadequate resources is pushing a large number of students from the country to get better education at relatively better-resourced institutions abroad. “The reason behind India’s students increasingly going abroad for studies is the poor quality of education offered in Indian institutions. To address the issue, NEP-2020 has proposed to allocate 6% of the GDP to the education sector and improve the quality of educational institutions in the country. Not providing quality education is a crime. Spending on higher education in India is very meagre as compared to institutions in the the U.S. But, unfortunately, those institutions that get enough money are not able to spend it. Money given under RUSA is not being spent by many institutions,” Mr. Laxman said. In his presidential remarks, Vice-Chancellor of Central University of Karnataka Battu Satyanarayan stressed the importance of freedom to teachers and doctors for the progress of the country. “If we want our nation to progress, we must create such an environment where teachers and doctors could work with freedom and without any prejudices. Making students good citizens is in the hands of teachers. Teachers have to mould students and make them good citizens. If we want quality doctors, engineers and teachers, we have to provide quality education to our students. We have to improve the quality of education in domestic institutions to attract students who go abroad for studies,” Mr. Satyanarayan said. Resource persons Gourisha and Rajendra Joshi from CESS, Central University Registrar Basavaraj Donur, organising secretary, Channaveer R.M. and deans, heads and faculty members were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/get-innovative-ideas-from-the-ground-students-told/article36870225.ece

07 October 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Bridge work on Bondel-Vamanjoor Road completed||Construction of a road overbridge on Mangaluru-Mumbai railway line at Pachchanady on the Bondel-Vamanjoor Road has almost been completed even as the Railways has commenced work on constructing approach roads. Bondel-Vamanjoor Road is a key stretch linking Airport Road and Mangaluru-Karkala National Highway 169. Mangaluru City Corporation recently widened the road and has concreted it. The construction wing of Southern Railway had in 2017 dismantled the 6 metre wide and 9.25 metre long road overbridge to facilitate line doubling between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur. The Railways had provided a temporary level-crossing, about 300 m to the south of the old road overbridge. Though the Railways undertook construction of the new 12 metre wide and 27.95 metre long road overbridge at an estimated cost of Rs. 5 crore, the abnormal delay in the completion of the work had irked road users. Vehicle users had to wait for long at the level-crossing with the Mangaluru-Mumbai line being one of the busiest lines. Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel and other people’s representatives had urged the Southern Railway to complete the project at the earliest. Approach road The construction wing has now taken up work to provide approach roads at both the ends of the road overbridge to match the existing concrete Bondel-Vamanjoor Road. While 150 metres of concrete road will be laid on the Bondel-side, 100 metres of concrete road will be provided on the Vamanjoor-side, according to Southern Railway. Road closure To facilitate the construction of the approach roads, the Railways has to close the approach roads towards the make-shift level crossing too. Consequently, it has obtained necessary permission from the Dakshina Kannada district administration to close the stretch of the Bondel-Vamanjoor Road near the road overbridge for a period of one month, from October 10 to November 10. A release from Palakkad Division of Southern Railway here said that light motor vehicles may use the alternative road, via PWD Bund Road originating from Pachchanady and go via Manjalpadey to reach Bondel and vice-versa . Heavy vehicles, however, have to operate through Kulashekara during the period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bridge-work-on-bondel-vamanjoor-road-completed/article36870647.ece

07 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Tourist footfall on the rise in Mysuru despite low-key Dasara||Dasara may be a low-key event in view of the pandemic but the stakeholders in the tourism sector are optimistic of an improvement in their financial and economic situation. For, notwithstanding the government’s decision to scale down this year’s festival, the hospitality industry is witnessing a surge in accommodation bookings. In Mysury city alone which is home to nearly 180 to 200 hotels, there is an occupancy rate of 60 per cent from October 10 to 15. In all, there are about 8,000 rooms catering to different segments of tourists and about 60 per cent of them are booked, which is an encouraging sign, according to C. Narayana Gowda of the Hotel Owners Association in Mysuru. He said this is almost equal to the bookings that used to take place during the pre-pandemic times and in case the third wave was averted, they are optimistic of better fortunes by as early as December 2021. “As the Dasara is a low-key event this year, not many tourists are coming to witness the festival. But as it also coincides with their holiday people have started making bookings and this is being fuelled mainly by tourists from Karanataka’’, he added. In the pre-pandemic times tourists from Kerala and Tamil Nadu used to account for almost 50 per cent of the traffic but this time people from other parts of Karnataka are exploring the State, giving a fillip to the tourism sector. Optimism There is a general perception among the stakeholders that the peak tourism season in Mysuru which coincides with Dasara every year, is set to take off by the second week of October. The sense of optimism has also been bolstered by the increase in the coverage of the vaccinated segment. Devaraj, a guide at the Somnathpur temple, said that things were improving with a steady increase in the number of tourists visiting monuments. “There are 6 active licensed guides at Somnathpur and we take turns and work on alternate days. The scenario is definitely better than what it was during the same stage last year and things are bound to improve by November/December,’’, he added. However, among a section of the tourists there are concerns of free interaction with guides due to the pandemic and hence some of them were avoiding hiring them at all, according to Devaraj. Meanwhile, the bookings for hired cabs too have picked up indicating a traction in the travel sector. Tourism is a major revenue and employment generator in the Mysuru region. It provides direct jobs to nearly 80,000 people as per various estimates besides triggering ancillary jobs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourist-footfall-on-the-rise-in-mysuru-despite-low-key-dasara/article36870336.ece
07 October 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Tradition continues, fanfare muted||A low-key Dasara necessitated by the imperatives of managing COVID-19 will begin from Thursday and is expected to be a pale shadow of the celebrations in the pre-pandemic times. This is for the second consecutive year that the Mysuru Dasara has been scaled down to prevent crowd gathering and the consequent surge in the COVID-19 positive cases. Former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna will inaugurate the festival atop the Chamundi Hills between 8.15 a.m. and 8.45 a.m. and the current Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and others will be present. The cultural events - which otherwise used to be held at more than a dozen venues – is being restricted to the palace with limited attendance. However, the State and the Dasara Executive Committee have decided to illuminate the streets of Mysuru and the major turnarounds or circles that dot the city scape to shore up the spirit. Popular events such as Yuva Dasara, Dasara sports, Heritage Walk, Heritage Ride, and Food Mela have been disbanded this year as well due to the pandemic. An event which was used as a fulcrum to promote tourism in recent decades, Dasara used to attract lakhs of tourists from all over India and the world. As a result the demand for promoting Dasara as a cultural event across India and harness its tourism potential gained traction with the State Government taking steps for a multi-media publicity blitz. However, the pandemic has put a break on such a drive since 2020 and the events will be restricted to a few hundred people this year. The famed Vijayadashmi procession scheduled for October 15 will be confined to the palace premises unlike the 5-km-long march of caparisoned elephants, tableaus and cultural troupes which used to be the cynosure of all eyes. Though Dasara is associated with victory of the good over the evil, in Mysuru it is a continuation of the festival as observed by the rulers of Vijayanagar empire. The glory of Navaratri has been documented by the medieval travellers such as Domingo Paes, Abdur Razak, and Fernavo Nuniz who visited Vijayanagar during the 15th and 16th centuries. Consequent to the fall of the Vijayanagar empire, Raja Wadiyar, a feudatory of the Vijayanagar rulers, ascended the throne in Srirangapatna in 1610 CE and ordained that Dasara be celebrated on a grand scale.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tradition-continues-fanfare-muted/article36870332.ece

07 October 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Seeds of invasive species dispersed||A recent study has revealed that native mammals disperse the highly invasive ‘Senna Sepctabilis’ in the Western Ghats. The plant is posing a serious threat to the wildlife habitat in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary as well as the adjacent Bandipur and Mudumalai Tiger Reserves in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The study, carried out by the Ashoka Trust for Research on Ecology and Environment (ATREE), Bengaluru and the Ferns Nature Conservation Society, Mananthavady, in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, found that mammals such as Asian elephants, chital and the Indian-crested porcupine were dispersing seeds of this tree. The study was published in a recent edition of the international journal Biotropica . The study was carried out by analysing the faecal samples of wild animals and livestock, collected from the sanctuary. The researchers found that native wide-ranging animals, especially elephants, are capable of dispersing seeds over long distances. The study warns of seed dispersal by such animals facilitating the fast spread of this species to large areas in forest landscapes. Major drivers “The nutrient content, taste and smell of the pods might have been the major drivers attracting the herbivores,” N.R. Anoop, research scholar, ATREE, who led the team, said. “As a single seed pod of the plant contains more than a hundred of seeds, a single mature tree could produce more than a lakh of seeds a year,” Mr. Anoop said. The invasive plant is spreading rapidly in the sanctuary and it suppresses the natural growth of other plants. A very large portion of the sanctuary and adjacent tiger reserves are densely covered by this species now. “Interestingly, this species suppresses the growth of other invasive species like lantana and eupatorium” P.A. Vinayan, a member of the team, said. “As large mammals like elephants are involved in the seed dispersal of this tree, we should very soon expect its invasion to the wet forests, which hold very rich plant diversity in the Western Ghats,” Mr. Vinayan, said. The rampant growth of the species is already posing a threat to the wildlife habitat from Tholpetty range of the sanctuary to the Thirunelly elephant corridor. If the authorities failed to adopt steps to contain the spread of the plant, it would pose a threat to the open patches and grasslands of the adjacent Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka too , Mr. Vinayan said. Thyagarajan Ganesh and Sandeep Sen of the ATREE are the other members of the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seeds-of-invasive-species-dispersed/article36870245.ece

The Ambedkar Memorial Rural Institute for Development (AMRID) here was the first location in his itinerary. The institute was set up in 1990 by the district administration to coordinate various training programmes for tribal youths under one roof. District Collector A. Geetha, who is also the chairperson of the institute, accorded a reception to Mr. Khan. He spent nearly an hour at the institute and interacted with tribal workers. District Police Chief Aravind Sukumar and Additional District Magistrate N.I. Shaju accompanied him. Mr. Khan also visited the elephant camp under the Wayanad wildlife sanctuary at Muthanga and the Wayanad Heritage Museum at Amabalavayal. Senior officials, including Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Northern Region, K.V. Uthaman and Warden S. Narendra Babu were present. He later visited the Weavers’ Village at Thirunelly.

07 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fishing boat operators rue sharp fall in prices of seasonal harvest||Rising diesel price and low cost of seasonal harvests like shrimp, cuttlefish, and squid have hit boat operators in a big way, with some of them describing the market situation as desperate. Adding to the slackening demand for local catch was the arrival of fish from neighbouring Goa and Tamil Nadu, said a boat owner. The price of seasonal wild catch like shrimp had dropped around 80%, said Paul Rajan, a boat owner from Kalamukku. The average market expectation is that a kilogram of shrimp will fetch Rs. 80 to Rs. 100. However, the price is so low that a few boat owners are even forced to throw away the catch even as the best quality sells at around Rs. 60 a kg. The average price had ranged between Rs. 20 and Rs. 25 a kg, he added. One of the reasons being cited for the low price is the stalling of shrimp peeling operations owing to shortage of workers. Mr. Rajan sought the intervention of government agencies to help the struggling boat owners. Joseph Xavier Kalapurackal of Kerala Boat Owners’ Association said the prices of shrimp, squid, and cuttlefish had fallen sharply in the current season, plunging boat owners and fish workers into serious financial trouble. He added that cuttlefish price had fallen to around Rs. 250 a kg from the earlier Rs. 350 a kg, while the price of squid was now less than Rs. 400 a kg as against the earlier level of Rs. 500 a kg. Even the price of locally grown shrimp variety has fallen to around Rs. 300 and Rs. 325 from the earlier level of Rs. 450 a kg. The rising price of diesel, hovering around Rs. 94 a litre, was one of the reasons why boat owners were unable to cope with the market situation, Mr. Kalapurackal said. Each fishing expedition requires at least 400 litres a day, making the input cost quite high. Besides, boat owners have to pay Rs. 26,500 for permits for boats which are more than 20 metres long.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishing-boat-operators-rue-sharp-fall-in-prices-of-seasonal-harvest/article36870621.ece

Around 47.4% of those in the category of 18 years and above had received the second dose, according to official estimates. District Collector Jafar Malik said various programmes would be organised in the coming days to realise the objective. They include special vaccination camps at government hospitals, outreach centres, colleges, and private hospitals figuring under the ‘Sponsor-a-Jab’ initiative of the district administration and the Health Department. Vaccines will be given free of cost at these centres. People can also receive the second dose after making payment prescribed for private hospitals. Those who have received Covaxin can receive the second dose after 28 days, while the corresponding period for those who have taken Covishield is 84 days. According to data available with the Health Department, the district has 105 government vaccination centres, 80 outreach centres under local bodies, and 84 private vaccination centres. Spot registration The public can register online or contact the local bodies concerned to receive the vaccine under spot registration. They can also contact accredited social health activists to be included in the free spot registration process. Around 90% of online slots have been reserved for those who are yet to receive the second dose. Vaccines will be available for free at hospitals participating in the Sponsor-a-Jab project. College managements can contact the Health Department to organise special camps for students. Non-voluntary organisations can also participate in the vaccination campaign. The second dose campaign will be strengthened among migrant workers in the district under the Guest Vaccination Programme. Mr. Malik said local bodies that completed the second dose programme at the earliest would get prizes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/second-dose-vaccine-for-target-groups-in-3-months/article36870626.ece

The deceased was identified as Dhanapal Naik, 45, from Andhra Pradesh, while the injured are Sivaji, 45, and Vengur Sami, both from Andhra Pradesh. They had been staying in the city for a while doing daily wage labour. It took firefighters and the police nearly two-and-a-half hours to complete the rescue mission and recover Naik’s body. The three were engaged in drain widening work as part of Operation Breakthrough, a project to address flooding in the city, when the precariously positioned slab collapsed on them, trapping them beneath around 12.40 p.m. “Widening the drain meant that we had to pull down a part of the wall of the work area of an adjoining house. The old concrete slab that made the roof of the work area was not attached to the rest of the structure, as it is supposed to be. Hence, it was kept precariously on a couple of jack hammers. Work on the drain would have impacted that balance, resulting in the slab collapsing on the workers,” said Aristotle, councillor of Division 65. Naik was completely trapped under the slab leading to his death. One of the rescued workers had serious injuries to his legs, while the other had relatively minor injuries. “We could not remove the slab, as it presented the danger of it further collapsing on the workers. So, we chipped an opening through the slab and cut the iron rods to reach the workers using a demolition hammer and rescued the two. However, we could not save the other,” said T.B. Ramakrishan, station officer, Fire and Rescue Services Station, Gandhi Nagar. Doctors who were already summoned to the scene gave first aid to the rescued workers and rushed them to the Ernakulam General Hospital. Mayor M. Anilkumar said the faulty construction of the slab had resulted in the accident and asked the police to take necessary action. However, the North police initially registered only a case for unnatural death. “Other aspects like possible faulty construction need to be probed,” said police sources. Regional Fire Officer K.K. Shiju and District Fire Officer A.S. Jogy led the rescue mission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/migrant-worker-killed-as-slab-collapses/article36870252.ece
07 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Widespread concern over juvenile fishing||Juvenile fishing, mostly for fishmeal factories, off the coast of Kerala continues to cause unease in the fishing community, and the newly constituted fishers’ forum, Matsya Thozhilali Samyukta Samiti, has called for a protest action on October 11. Though the State government had notified the minimum legal size (MLS) for 14 commercially important fish species in July 2015, traditional fishers and most boat owners have complained of some trawlers resorting to destructive practices, including pair or bull trawling. Pair trawling involves using two boats to pull a massive net that trawls through the entire depth of the sea, catching juveniles as well and causing immense damage to the sea floor. While Fisheries Department sources said it had been taking stringent action against destructive practices, including juvenile fishing and destructive trawling practices, they called for creating awareness among fishers. Jackson Pollayil of the Samyukta Samiti and leader of the Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation, an independent union of fishers, said the All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association had also opposed destructive practices, and that only a small number of trawlers violated rules. He added that juveniles were caught for fishmeal factories and caused immense damage to the marine fish stock. He alleged that the Fisheries Department had failed to initiate action against trawlers engaged in destructive practices and called for more vigil on its part. He also said traditional fishers had taken to preventing juvenile fishing and pair trawling off the coasts of Kollam and Alappuzha. Mr. Jackson said three trawlers were seized by fishers off Alappuzha and two off the coast of Beypore and handed over to the Fisheries Department recently. A department official said more boats had been seized for violation of MLS rules in September compared to previous months. The official added that five boats had been fined last month off the Thiruvananthapuram coast. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) had recommended MLS for 58 commercially important species on the basis of which the MLS for 14 species had been notified. The CMFRI had said that juveniles were being caught for fishmeal factories, and that exploitation of juvenile fish resulted in economic loss. Juvenile fishing threatens long-term sustainability, and MLS is used as a tool for resource preservation.  Juveniles are caught for fishmeal factories and it causes immense damage to the marine fish stock Jackson Pollayil Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/juvenile-fishing-an-issue-of-concern/article36870292.ece
07 October 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Hoteliers cry foul as poultry price goes through the roof||Hoteliers have said that they will be forced to stop serving chicken dishes if the price of the bird continued to rise, even as hospitality and catering services are picking up momentum after a long hiatus following lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Kerala Hotel and Restaurants’ Association (KHRA) said the rising chicken price apart, the steep increase in cooking gas and spiralling onion price were factors that severely affected their profitability. Azees Moosa of KHRA said on Wednesday that the price of live chicken had gone up to Rs. 140 per kg. If one calculated the price of poultry meat, it would be much higher, he added. Smaller hotels are the worst affected because those who took larger quantities of supplies of chicken enjoyed a discount in prices, he said as he called for immediate government intervention to arrest price rise. Mr. Moosa said the government had intervened on many occasions in the past to control the price of chicken, which is served in most hotels across the State. He also called for strengthening the Kerala Poultry Development Corporation to make its market presence felt. A strong favourite There are around 45,000 members under the KHRA, with Ernakulam alone accounting for nearly 5,000 members. Most of them serve non-vegetarian dishes, where chicken is a strong favourite, he said. Kerala State Poultry Development Corporation sources said chicken price had gone up sharply on account of a steep rise in feed. There is shortage of supply of soya, which forms a major ingredient in poultry feed. The price of the ingredient has gone up to around Rs. 100 a kg from the level of around Rs. 50 a kg last year. However, sources said the government had decided to import soya from countries like Brazil, and supply shortage could be addressed in two months. 22 lakh kg a day S.K. Naseer of All Kerala Poultry Federation said there was a rise in demand for chicken, as the hospitality sector was being revived and pointed to the rise in the price of poultry feed ingredients like corn as the reason for the rise in the price of meat. He added that an estimate put the total chicken consumption in the State at around 22 lakh kg per day, and that the bulk of supplies went to hotels and catering businesses.  Association worried about steep hike in onion, cooking gas prices Shortage of soya, an ingredient of poultry feed, blamed for price rise||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hoteliers-cry-foul-as-poultry-price-goes-up/article36870249.ece

New case The SIT registered another case against Monson on a petition by Santhosh of Ernakulam that he was cheated in excess of Rs. 70 lakh. It had emerged that nearly 70% of the objects which Monson paraded as rare antiquities were cheap knock-offs procured from Santhosh, who also used to rent out them for film shooting. This is the fifth case against Monson, who already stands accused of cheating six people of Rs. 10 crore between 2017 and 2020, a Thiruvananthapuram-based sculptor to the tune of Rs. 80 lakh, a Pala-based businessman of Rs. 1.70 crore and for impersonating as the chairman of the TV Samskara channel. “We have given the copper plate inscription claimed to be over three centuries old among the Monson's collection to the Archaeological Survey of India for verifying its authenticity,” said Crime Branch sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sit-probing-monson-case-expanded/article36870325.ece

Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar pointed out that there was no platform for crowdfunding for treatment of persons afflicted with rare diseases. The court made the observation when a batch of petitions for crowdfunding for treating children suffering from various rare deceases came up for hearing. The court said the State Government had made several attempts to raise funds for the treatment of rare diseases. The High Court had even issued judgments in this regard. However, they had not been fruitful. Special government pleader T.B. Hood submitted that the State Government was taking steps to regulate crowdfunding and verify the beneficiaries. P.A. Mohammed Shaw, counsel for Manjalamkuzhi Ali, MLA, who headed a committee for crowdfunding the treatment of Imran Mohammed (who later died), submitted that of the Rs. 16 crore raised, it was decided to pay Rs. 2 crore each to six children afflicted with the spinal muscular atrophy disease. A part of the balance amount would be utilised to construct a building in the Mankada government hospital for treatment of children with rare diseases. In fact, several patients had requested to spare the balance amount for their treatment. The counsel, therefore, sought permission of the court to give the amount to needy persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-seeks-regulation-of-crowdfunding/article36870310.ece

The decision of the chief judicial magistrate court, Thiruvananthapuram, will have repercussions, given the Opposition United Democratic Front’s attempts to corner the Minister on the floor of the Assembly on a host of issues. The UDF had raised a volley of protests on the floor of the Assembly and on the streets demanding the resignation of the Minister. If the plea of Left Democratic Front leaders fail to impress the judge, the discharge petition will be rejected and all the accused, including Mr. Sivankutty, may have to be present in the court at the next posting of the case for the judge to frame charges. The court will also read out the charges against the accused in the process. A favourable decision from the court will see the Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerge stronger, both in the Assembly and outside, as the accused had received a drubbing at the hands of the Supreme Court when they moved it for quashing the case. The apex court had also asked the accused to face trial. In the event of an unfavourable decision from the trial court, the accused can file a revision petition at the sessions court or the High Court.

Special allotments are made after the scheduled regular allotments under the varsity’s centralised admission procedure. Of the 3,242 seats for students of the SC category, 2,296 have been filled. Allotment figures Of the 1,066 seats for ST students, 306 have been filled after the first special allotment, according to official figures. The total allotment of seats under the SC category is 4,974, while the corresponding figure in the ST category is 626. A preliminary assessment shows that there is little demand among aspirants for UG programmes in subjects like Mathematics and certain integrated programmes in multidisciplinary areas. The special allotments have been made to ensure that maximum number of SC/ST students obtain admission for the courses of their choice. Panel directive Varsity officials pointed out that they had taken into account a recent directive from the State Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that asked Registrars of State universities to ensure that aspirants from socially and economically backward communities were not denied a chance when it came to admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Members of voluntary organisations working for SC/ST students had alleged that the applicants had got only a short window to complete the process under the special allotment. They had cited difficulties faced by students from remote areas and tribal hamlets to reach campuses before the deadline. However, the university authorities coordinating the admission process said they had taken additional care this time and issued stringent directives to affiliated colleges to facilitate admission for students from the SC/ST category. Aspirants have been given sufficient time to complete the admission process online. They are not required to turn up on campuses, as the entire process is online, according to the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/40-of-ug-seats-for-scsts-vacant-in-mgu/article36870304.ece

There are around 45 lakh women under the Kudumbashree Mission in the State. However, those below the age of 40 make up only about 10% of the total membership, mission sources said. The platform, called Kudumbashree Auxiliary Groups, will welcome women between the ages of 18 and 40. Women in this age group face a variety of issues, and auxiliary groups will help them, Kudumbashree sources said. Crimes against women There has been a rise in cases of attack on women, dowry-related deaths, and paucity of jobs. The groups will train women in handling various issues. Any woman in the said age group can take membership in auxiliary groups irrespective of their economic status. One auxiliary group will be established in each of the 20,000 wards under various local bodies in the State by early November, Kudumbashree sources said. As of now, there will be no micro-financial activities under women’s groups in the new platform. The aim is to empower women. The pandemic has shown that there are jobs that can easily be done from home. Coupled with new opportunities, schemes under various government departments can also be implemented with the help of women’s groups under auxiliary groups, sources said. Each group will have a maximum membership of 50, though there will be no limit to the number of groups being formed. Gender equity awareness, skill development, and knowledge-sharing will be among the key factors that will guide auxiliary groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-platform-for-young-kudumbashree-members/article36870294.ece

And when it comes to those with no physical contact with children and grandchildren, the burden of isolation is all the more acute. In order to address the issue and ease the elderly population into the post-pandemic world, the Health Department will form local body-level collectives across the State. The units are expected to alleviate social isolation and provide senior citizens a community space to connect and interact. The project focusses on comparatively healthy individuals and couples above the age of 60 living alone. “The pandemic has forced many senior persons to spend nearly two years in the solitude of their homes with minimal social interaction. Some of them are depressed and believe it is the end of the road. We decided to launch this programme seeing their plight with a pilot project in Kollam,” says Dev Kiran, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Lonely lifestyle Most elderly parents had been regularly visiting their children and grandchildren before COVID-19 made travelling a task. While retired professionals were left with a shrinking social circle, many others suffered serious psychological consequences due to the lonely lifestyle. “The elderly will be informed about the facility through ASHA workers and they will be encouraged to join the collective. It will be more like a group therapy programme and since it is a collective of persons facing the same issue, they will be able to help each other. In the initial phase, the sessions will be held once a month,” he says. While the local body will provide refreshments during the sessions, the department will offer other services, including counselling, if required. The Health Department will be implementing the project with the support of the Kerala State Library Council and libraries in local bodies will be the venue for the sessions. “We opted for libraries as they used to function as a community space and many elderly persons are used to reading room interactions. Such spaces nearly vanished after the pandemic and another objective is to revive them for the benefit of senior citizens.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/collectives-for-the-elderly-to-ease-the-pandemic-blues/article36870318.ece

They have also sought changes in the current guidelines prepared by Education and Health departments. At a meeting held here recently, functionaries of the Kerala Private Management Schools Association alleged that they were discriminated against while formulating the guidelines. They suggested that instead of the shift system, half of the students in a class may be asked to appear in schools on alternate days as per their roll number. The working days should be rearranged to have classes also on Saturdays till the COVID-19 protocol is in force. Each student can attend classes on three days a week, but attendance should be given on all six days. School timings should be rescheduled and classes should conclude by the afternoon. The association also objected to the proposal to allow only two students to sit on a bench. The functionaries demanded that three students be allowed to sit on a bench to help schools without better infrastructure in place. The government should offer help to schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education. Directions may be issued to the police and fire force personnel. The deadline for ensuring the fitness of school vehicles should be extended from October 20 to October 30. Insurance companies should be directed to waive off the premium till November 1 as they were remaining idle so far. Finance companies should be told not to insist on early monthly instalments for vehicle loans and fine, and other charges should be avoided. The managements also opposed the mandatory installation of speed governors in school buses saying it was expensive.

07 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Internship of foreign medical students comes to the fore again||Issues related to the internship of foreign medical graduates in Kerala have again been raised against the backdrop of the dilemma of students who study in Chinese medical schools and are unable to attend offline classes due to the pandemic. M.K. Raghavan, Kozhikode MP, in a letter to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandavya and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, said facilities for clinical training and lab should be made available for such students. He claimed that many foreign medical graduates were worried about the delay in getting registration for their internship in Kerala. Quoting the National Medical Commission (NMC) orders, the MP pointed out that those who had completed medical studies abroad and done internship there, need not repeat it here. Mr. Raghavan claimed that only some states were not ready to go by the NMC orders and sought a unified law on the issue. Those who have graduated from foreign medical universities are supposed to clear Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) to register with the Travancore-Cochin Medical Councils (TCMC) in the state. They should then do a mandatory one-year internship with district or general hospitals later. The students claimed that the TCMC took at least three to four months to allot provisional registration number that was valid for a year. If there are no vacancies in district or general hospitals, they will have to wait for another four to five months to start the internship. They pointed out that the FMGE took place only once in six months and the results took another two months to be published. This means the students may have to spend around a year in waiting before starting their internship. It delayed their preparations for getting admissions to postgraduate courses, the students added. However, TCMC sources have said that foreign medical graduates needed to mandatorily complete the internship before getting permanent registration here because they were not familiar with the Indian conditions. They need to learn and gain clinical experience and exposure about the epidemiological and clinical profile of the local community. Also, they need to learn and get exposed to the public health delivery and referral system here. “Our stand has been upheld by the Kerala High Court. The draft regulations of the NMC have also proposed two National Exit Tests for foreign medical graduates,” the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/internship-of-foreign-medical-students-comes-to-the-fore-again/article36870243.ece
07 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Kesava Menon Nagar residents see bid to encroach upon property||Residents of one of the oldest housing colonies in Kozhikode city have alleged that attempts are being made to encroach upon their private land. Functionaries of the Kesava Menon Nagar Bilathikulam Housing Colony Association on Wednesday told the media that the gate and the compound wall on the western side of their premises had been damaged by a group of people led by Alphonsa Mathew, Congress councillor representing ward number 65 in the Kozhikode Corporation, Sulaikha, a corporation staff, and one Achyuth Lal, on September 7. It led to losses to the tune of Rs. 3 lakh, they said. This housing colony was one of the first to be built by the Kerala State Housing Board in Kozhikode district. There are at least 250 flats spread across 30 apartment blocks. It is named after K.P. Kesava Menon, the founder editor of Mathrubhumi . At a time, a majority of the residents were journalists working in various media organisations in Kozhikode. Association president K. Rajeev and secretary Umesh Kumar said that the gate on the western side was closed and entry to the colony restricted after COVID-19 cases began rising. It was proposed by the authorities to protect the residents from the risk of infection, they said. The Kozhikode Corporation has some land adjacent to this gate and efforts are on to construct a new building there after demolishing existing structures of the Calicut Development Authority. The association functionaries alleged that the gate and the wall were demolished to provide access to this building. Some people with vested interests had misled the corporation Secretary saying that the road passing through the colony was public and the association was served a notice. However, the property belongs to the owners of the flats in the colony who have been given legitimate rights by the Kerala State Housing Board, the functionaries said. They said that a stay had been obtained from the Kerala High Court and a temporary injunction order had also been issued by a civil court in Kozhikode. Though complaints were lodged with the Nadakkavu police station, no action had been taken against the culprits, Mr. Rajeev and Mr. Umesh Kumar alleged. Councillor’s stand However, Ms. Mathew said that the Board had not completely handed over the property rights to the residents’ association. At least 21 of the title deeds are yet to be given. “I have been a resident of the colony for the past 30 years. The road was being used by the people around the area for long. You can’t seal it and block the access on a fine morning in the name of COVID-19,” she said. Ms. Mathew said that the road belonged to the corporation as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kesava-menon-nagar-residents-see-bid-to-encroach-upon-property/article36870256.ece
07 October 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||The Muslim woman who paints Krishna||Krishna is a deity who, for believers, emulates feelings of friendship, fondness and love alike. For Jasna Saleem, a young woman from Koyilandy in Kozhikode, Krishna is synonymous with livelihood. “I am a Class 10 drop-out. If I have earned recognition today, it is only because of my Kannan,” Ms. Jasna said, with fondness and gratitude for the Hindu deity. Known for numerous Krishna portraits that adorn the walls of several temples and houses, Ms. Jasna is a faithful Muslim. It is the name ‘Kannan’ that connects Jasna with Krishna, for it was her nickname in childhood, too. “My family decided to call me ‘Kinnan’ as I used to throw around the kinnam (plate) at home, which later changed to ‘Kannan’,” Ms. Jasna explained. Ms. Jasna took a liking to a picture of little Krishna with laddoo s in his hand that she found somewhere. “Before drawing Krishna, I had not even drawn a map properly. I had no skills whatsoever. But somehow, Krishna turned out well,” she said. Later on, she shifted to the portrait of “little Krishna eating butter”, which earned her fame across the State. “I used to contribute Krishna paintings to the Guruvayur temple every year. Though I could not go inside, I used to hand them over to the security personnel and leave. But my friends and neighbours who returned from Guruvayur would often comment on my paintings, which they saw in the temple. I was elated,” she said. Later, the temple committee at Ulanadu Sreekrishna Swamy Temple at Pandalam invited her to reveal her painting before the deity. Ms. Jasna did initially have some opposition from her family and community for painting a Hindu deity, but this stopped as she gained recognition for her work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-muslim-woman-who-paints-krishna/article36870244.ece

The union suspended S. Shanti, office superintendent, and Sunitha, cashier, at the Nemom zonal office, George Kutty, office assistant at the Attipra zonal office, and Biju, office attendant at the Sreekaryam zonal office, from its primary membership, pending investigation. In a press release on Wednesday, the KMCSU said the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was trying to portray the entire staff at the Corporation as corrupt. The party has gone ahead with a protest in an attempt to bring to a halt the functioning of the civic body, despite the Mayor taking action, including suspension of the erring officials and registration of FIRs, against them. The union said that several employees of the Corporation had worked round-the-clock after the COVID-19 outbreak. The BJP was trying to paint even perfectly legal actions as illegal, the statement said. Opposition protest Meanwhile, the BJP and the United Democratic Front (UDF) have decided to step up the protests over the revenue collection issue. On Thursday, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran will inaugurate a dharna in front of the Corporation office over the issue. A special council meeting of the Corporation council will be held in the afternoon to discuss the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/union-suspends-four-corporation-employees/article36870661.ece
07 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Plus One admissions in a muddle||The Plus One admission process in the State continues to be dogged by controversies with thousands of students unsure of securing admission even after the second allotment. As many as 655 merit seats remain after the publication of the second allotment list on Wednesday. There were 4,65,219 applicants in all for Plus One courses, and of them, 2,69,533 received allotment. There were 2,70,188 seats in all. This has left nearly 1.96 lakh students dependent on the nearly 70,000 community and management quota seats in aided schools, plus the 55,157 seats in unaided schools. Even factoring in the management and community quota seats, all applicants will still not be able to get Plus One admission. Government and aided school students seldom prefer to take admission to unaided schools owing to factors such as fee. Last year, of the 50,057 seats in the unaided sector, 22,798 remained vacant. These seats also comprised the chunk of the 32,617 left vacant across the government, aided, and unaided sectors last year. The government had sanctioned a marginal seat increase of 20% in seven districts, mostly in the Malabar region. However, districts such as Thrissur did not receive any marginal increase. The government has also refused to sanction additional batches in districts experiencing seat shortage citing financial burden. Supplementary list Now, only supplementary allotment remains for the seats remaining vacant after the second allotment and those where students will not take admission owing to various reasons. Besides the students who have not got into schools or courses of their choice, a large number of students have not received admission after the first two allotments despite obtaining A+ grade in all subjects in the SSLC examinations. This is owing to the large number of students who secured full A+ grade this year — 1,21,318, nearly three times the number last year. The bonus points awarded to students have complicated matters further. A student with full A+ may not secure admission to the school of their choice, however another student with more bonus points but fewer A+ has better chances of doing so. Even as students who have not received allotment despite full A+ are left desperate, those who apply for supplementary allotments may end up getting admission to vacant seats in schools of their choice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plus-one-admissions-in-a-muddle/article36870323.ece
07 October 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Accident-prone harbours to have rescue forces||Trained rescue forces will be deployed in accident-prone harbours in the State, with Muthalappozhi, Kasaragod, and Vizhinjam on the top of the priority list, Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian told the Assembly on Wednesday. Replying to questions regarding frequent boat accidents leading to loss of lives of fishworkers at Muthalappozhi in Thiruvananthapuram district, Mr. Cherian said that unscientific construction of the harbour had led to accidents. On the stretch of coast from Anchuthengu to Veli, 58 fishworkers have died in accidents since 2011. As per the FIRs filed in coastal police stations, 11 fishworkers have died at the Muthalappozhi harbour in the five-year period from 2016, out of which two deaths happened this year. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan and M. Vincent, MLA, said the promise of dredging, made in the Assembly previously, had been delayed. Sand deposit, a reason Mr. Cherian said accidents had increased due to the depositing of sand at the harbour mouth. An understanding has been arrived at with the Adani Group for dredging at Muthalappozhi. A grab dredger has been brought to the site. The Ernakulam-based Ultratech Agency has been tasked with conducting an Environment Impact Assessment ahead of the implementation of a permanent sand bypassing system for shifting the sand accumulated at the south side of Muthalappozhi to the north side, where there is severe coastal erosion. An expert team from the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, will visit the Muthalappozhi harbour within a week to study the unscientific construction of the harbour and to propose corrective steps. The report will be put up for public debate, before further steps are taken, said Mr. Cherian. Annual dredging The Minister said annual dredging had to be carried out at the harbour mouth before the monsoon season. Most accidents involving fishing boats had happened within five nautical miles of the coast. A rescue system in cooperation with the Union Government was required. There is a need to carry out maintenance work on the groynes too.  Unscientific harbour construction has led to frequent boat accidents at Muthalappozhi, Saji Cherian tells Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/accident-prone-harbours-to-have-rescue-forces/article36870261.ece

Everyone should get themselves vaccinated as soon as possible. The state has adequate stocks of COVID-19 vaccine and over 1,200 vaccination centres in the government sector alone. However, most vaccination centres are now deserted even though there is still a minority who are yet to get their first dose. The state delivered 5,65,432 doses of vaccine between October 1-5, of which 1,28,997 took the first dose. The public should not turn away from COVID-19 vaccination. Those yet to be vaccinated should register through Cowin or approach vaccination centres directly, Ms. George appealed. 93.04% covered The state has vaccinated 93.04% of the eligible population above 18 years with the first dose, while 42.83% have been fully vaccinated. According to the revised Census estimate of 2021, 18.5 lakh more people have to take the vaccine. Of this, there are at least 10 lakh COVID-afflicted individuals, who need receive the vaccine only three months later. 8.5 lakh still Hence, at present, those remaining unvaccinated, without even a single dose of vaccine, would come to 8.5 lakh, according to the Health Department. It reminded the public that according to the available evidence, vaccines reduced the risk of serious disease, hospitalisation and death. The state had low rates of hospitalisation (11% of active cases) and that it was due to the effect of vaccination. The state cannot remain under lockdown at all times and lives and livelihood have to be saved. Colleges and schools are reopening soon and at this point in time when life is slowly returning to normality, a few persons reluctant to take vaccination could pose a serious risk to society, Ms. George said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ministers-appeal-for-vaccination/article36870293.ece

Saseendran told the Assembly on Wednesday. However, the new crop insurance scheme can address some of these issues, he said. “Currently, the Agriculture Department provides compensation for crop damage by wild animals based on Central guidelines. Due to the limitations of the guidelines and the funds, people often do not get the compensation they wish for. However, the crop insurance scheme, along with a new Central project, can ensure as much as four times the compensation package the farmers are currently getting. Only a few have registered for the crop insurance scheme. All MLAs should ensure that farmers living near forests in their constituencies join this scheme,” said Mr. Saseendran. Measures adopted The Minister placed on the table the measures taken by the government to prevent wild animal attacks and human-animal conflicts. A master plan has been prepared. Preventive measures, including different types of fencing to stop animals from entering human settlements and agricultural land, various compensation and insurance packages, ensuring availability of water sources and food materials within the forests to prevent animals from straying into settlements, and awareness campaigns among the communities living near forests are part of the plan. ‘A failed attempt’ Malampuzha MLA A. Prabhakaran said that some measures like solar fencing had failed as the elephants often managed to break these using wooden logs. Mr. Saseendran concurred with this and said that poor maintenance of fences at times made it easier for elephants to damage them and enter human settlements. The government is planning a project to address this. Hanging solar fencing could be a more effective solution, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/minister-urges-farmers-in-forest-fringes-to-take-crop-insurance/article36870262.ece

Mr. Sailajanath, along with dozens of party workers, staged an agitation at the Tower Clock Centre here and criticised the BJP government for getting Priyanka Gandhi arrested when she wanted to meet and console the families of the deceased farmers. The police do not have minimum concern for human dignity, he added. Criticising leaders of all hues in the State for remaining silent on the recent incident, Mr. Sailajanath said: “Instead of just mudslinging against each other at public meetings, political leaders should come out to support the farmers’ cause.” “Drinking water is no more free and if the public do not raise their voice, very soon corporate companies will have the control on food. They will have the final say on what we should eat,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-questions-political-leaders-silence-on-lakhimpur-kheri-incident/article36870364.ece
07 October 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Writer urges Centre to restore paintings at Lepakshi||Mularam Narayana Swamy, the author of a book on Veerabhadra Swamy temple at Lepakshi in Anantapur district, on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Union Minister of Tourism and Culture G. Kishan Reddy, seeking action to restore the paintings that adore the ceiling of the 16th Century temple. “The temple is a testimony to the rich culture and history of the Vijayanagara kings who ruled Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The inscriptions suggest that the Veerabhadra Swamy temple was constructed by Viroopanna-Veeranna, brothers of Penukonda, under the patronage of king Achyutadeva Raya between 1529-42 AD. However, the sculptures and paintings at the temple are fading and their restoration is the need of the hour to preserve them,” said Mr. Narayana Swamy. He also sought the release of a postal stamp so that the importance of the temple is spread far and wide. The Lepakshi temple is a living example of Vijayanagara architecture. There is a painting of Veerabhadra Swamy on the roof of the maha mandapa. The 25-foot-long and 15-foot-wide painting is considered as the biggest mural painting in Asia. Lord Siva as Bhikshatana Murthy, Veerabhadra Anugraha, Vatapatra Saayi, Bhoo Kailas, Kaala Bhairava, Droupadi Swayamvaram, Kiratarjuniyam, Manu Neeti-Dharma Chola Gaatha, Markandeya Rakshana are some of the famous paintings in the Natya Mandapa and all these need to be protected, he said. The Bhikshatana Murthy is one of the finest sculptures in India, he said, adding that he had spent several months researching the place for his book. The Lepakshi Basavayya, a colossal monolith, is a remarkable piece of art from the Vijayanagara era. It is the largest Nandi monolith in India decorated with bells, garlands and ornaments, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/writer-urges-centre-to-restore-paintings-at-lepakshi/article36870087.ece
07 October 2021||Begnaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Five held in inter-State baby sale case||The police, while tracking the high-profile case of a baby stolen two hours after its birth from a civic body-run hospital in Chamarajpet in 2020, have uncovered an inter-State baby sale racket. Five people operating in Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, have been arrested for allegedly purchasing more than 12 babies and selling them to childless couples. The South Division Police team, investigating since April this year, traced 12 children, and tracked down the biological parents of 11. “There are around five to six more, and efforts are on to track them down. We have submitted a report to the Child Welfare Committee,” said an officer. The five gang members, three of whom are women, operated in slums and lower socio-economic pockets in Chennai, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “They convinced the birth parents to sell their babies for Rs. 70,000-80,000 depending on the health of the child,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP, South Division) Harish Pandey. Some of the babies were just two months old. Staff involved? Meanwhile, other members of the gang moved around IVF centres in Bengaluru. After striking a deal with childless couples, they took Rs. 6 lakh to Rs. 9 lakh, and gave them fake documents to convince them that the adoption was legal. The police suspect involvement of hospital staff. “Some of the accused worked with employees in private hospitals. We suspect that they created fake ‘thayi ID cards’ (identity cards for mothers) for the racketeers,” said Mr. Pandey. As many as 28 such ID cards were recovered during a raid on a house of the accused in Kengeri. “So, if they purchased a child in Mumbai, then they would sell it to a couple in either Karnataka or Tamil Nadu,” said a police source. In some cases, the gang convinced the parents that they would provide a surrogate mother, and nine months later handed them a baby, complete with all the paperwork. The parents, too, were duped as they thought what they were doing was legal and that the child shared their DNA.Currently, all the children are with their adoptive parents. “Though there is culpability on part of the biological and adoptive parents, we have decided not to arrest them on a humanitarian basis,” a senior officer said. But he added that their actions will be included in the chargesheet. “The court will decide what legal action has to be taken.” Probe leads to accused The racket was uncovered during the investigation into the theft of an infant from a BBMP hospital in Chamarajpet in June 2020. Sub-Inspector Srinivas K.R. received information in April 2021 of a baby that was being brought to Bengaluru from Mumbai to be sold. The team arrested one of the racketeers, Ranjana Devidas outside Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna railway station. They rescued a one-month-old girl from Mumbai whom she was planning to sell to a couple in Bengaluru. During the investigation, the police realised that Devidas was part of a larger network, and subsequently arrested other members of the gang, identified as Devishnmugamma, Mahesh Kumar, Janardhan and Dhanalakshmi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/five-held-in-inter-state-baby-sale-case/article36870040.ece
07 October 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||IISc medical courses from next year||The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, on Wednesday announced that it would start offering medical courses from next year. At the convocation ceremony held virtually, IISc director Govindan Rangarajan said, “Even though we are called Indian Institute of Science, right from the beginning, we have had both science and engineering equally represented. Twelve years ago, a lot of interdisciplinary departments were created. Now, starting next year, we are planning yet another change. After about 100 years of excellence in science and engineering, we are planning to start a postgraduate medical school on campus.” As many as 110 students were awarded medals during the online ceremony, while 1,832 PhD and Master’s students, and 204 undergraduate students received their degrees. “Science and technology are driving the world. And business and commerce are an outcome of technology and science changes,” said Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, who was the chief guest at the convocation. Terming it a regret for not having studied science, which reflected the mood of the time, he said, “There was a disproportionate emphasis to commerce, finance and economics. That has completely changed. The pace of change of science is mind-blowing. The base principles of science and maths are at the heart of who we are, adaptation to the reality of the external world and making it of use to human consumption is the way we need to think about this,” he said. Mr. Kotak said there are three ways of looking at the situation now: new normal, next normal, never normal. “We will have to forget the concept of normalcy. The world will keep changing. How will students deal with this is the true test of fundamentals of what you’ve learnt,” he said, adding that as for AI and ML, in the battle between man and machine, both can win. “Machine learning also coming from a human brain. There will be contrarians. But it is an important lesson that there’s no ultimate to change. At best, there is a comma. The constancy of this paradigm changing is what institutions will grapple with,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/iisc-medical-courses-from-next-year/article36870028.ece
07 October 2021||BENGALURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP attacks ex-CM over remarks on RSS||A day after JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy accused the RSS of controlling the country and State’s administration, BJP leaders launched a counter-attack on the former Chief Minister. While BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi launched an attack on Tuesday, the party’s State president Nalin Kumar Kateel, RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa, and State vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra joined in the chorus on Wednesday. Mr. Ravi suggested to Mr. Kumaraswamy that he should visit a RSS shakha to understand its purpose. Mr. Kateel described the former Chief Minister as “frog in a family well” and asked him to shun narrow-minded thinking. He termed Mr. Kumaraswamy’s allegations that nearly 2,000 bureaucrats in the country were trained by the RSS and that they conform to its ideology as an insult to the country’s bureaucracy. Stating that senior JD(S) leader P.G.R. Sindhia was from RSS background, Mr. Kateel suggested to Mr. Kumaraswamy to learn more about the RSS from him. Mr. Eshwarappa said that Mr. Kumaraswamy had a mental block. He said India is strong on the global scene because “an RSS-inspired volunteer” is holding the post of Prime Minister. He argued that RSS is “trying to bring poor and tribal people into the mainstream” and inculcate national spirit in all spheres. Accusing Mr. Kumaraswamy of making remarks against the RSS keeping in mind the elections, Mr. Eshwarappa said the former Chief Minister may be making such comments about RSS under the illusion of getting votes from other communities. Referring to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s statement that a large number of bureaucrats had been trained by RSS, he asked, “What is wrong if the RSS gives financial aid to poor students pursuing civil services?” Mr. Vijayendra took to Twitter to attack Mr. Kumaraswamy. “RSS is an embodiment of selfless service and nationalism. His comments expose his ignorance about the RSS and its legacy, which the former Prime Minister and his father H.D. Deve Gowda is aware of. He praised RSS and even participated in its programme in 1977,” he said in a tweet. He also uploaded newspaper cuttings of the programme in which Mr. Gowda had participated. On Wednesday, Mr. Kumaraswamy countered Mr. Ravi. “Please tell the people whether the training on conducting Operation Kamala that goes against the democratic principles was also imparted in RSS.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-attacks-ex-cm-over-remarks-on-rss/article36870029.ece
07 October 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||NIA nabs former LTTE intelligence operative||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has nabbed a senior intelligence operative of the defunct Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Chennai on Tuesday. Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect, Satkunam alias Sabesan, 47, a Sri Lankan Tamil and a former member of the LTTE’s intelligence wing, had transferred a huge amount of money to former cadres or sympathisers of the outfit to revive the movement in the island nation. Searches on his premises in Valasaravakkam, Iyyappanthangal and other places led to recovery of incriminating material, including details of the money flow from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in recent years, sources in the agency said. NIA investigators were tracking Satkunam following specific inputs on his involvement in arms and drugs trafficking operations from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The input also said that he used the proceeds of smuggling to fund former cadres of the banned LTTE in Sri Lanka. ‘Trusted aide’ The sources said that Satkunam was among the trusted lieutenants of LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran and was also part of his close proximity security. He was also closely associated with the then LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman. About 15 years ago he was sent to Madurai to take forward the organisation’s plans in Tamil Nadu. But he was arrested in a drug case and spent almost 10 years in prison, the sources said. After his release from jail, Satkunam revived his contacts with international arms and drugs smuggling network. His satellite phone, diary and other gadgets have more evidence to his connections with international drug peddlers in Pakistan, Dubai and Sri Lanka. Further investigation revealed that Satkunam was the key conspirator in the Vizhinjam arms case of Kerala. The case relates to the seizure of five AK 47 rifles, 1,000 rounds of 9 mm ammunition and 300 kg of heroin off Minicoy coast upon interception of the fishing vessel Ravihansi by the Coast Guard on March 18, 2021. Case registered A case was registered under the Arms Act against six Sri Lankan nationals. The NIA investigation revealed Satkunam had arranged conspiracy meetings of sympathisers of LTTE in India. He had played a crucial role in routing the proceeds of drug trafficking to former LTTE cadres in Sri Lanka for the revival of LTTE. The accused was produced in a special court and remanded in judicial custody.  The input said that Satkunam used the proceeds of smuggling to fund former cadres of the banned LTTE in Sri Lanka||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nia-nabs-former-ltte-intelligence-operative/article36870219.ece

07 October 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Six more arrested in Telugu Akademi scam||Hyderabad police on Wednesday claimed to have unravelled the Telugu Akademi’s Fixed Deposits (FD) fraud. With the arrest of six more persons, including kingpin Chanduri Venkata Koti Sai Kumar (49). Since December last, the accused persons swindled Rs. 64.50 crore out of the Akademi’s 43 FDs in Karwan and Santosh Nagar branches of Union Bank of India and Canara Bank’s Chanda Nagar branch. Surprisingly, police managed to recover only a few lakhs from the accused. The mastermind behind the fraud, Sai Kumar, a realtor from the city was previously involved in similar offences in Andhra Pradesh and Chennai. He withdrew the FDRs of AP Minority Welfare Society in 2012 and the case is being investigated by the Crime Investigation Department (CID). Sai Kumar was also accused in AP Housing Board scam of nearly Rs. 6 crore and Rs. 25 crore FDR fraud of Northern Coal Fields in Chennai, both cases are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The other accused include Akademi’s administrative officer and in-charge accounts officer Segoori Ramesh, Canara Bank’s Chanda Nagar branch manager M Sadhana, Nanduri Venkata Ramana from Tanuku in West Godavari district, Venkateshwar Rao, a self-proclaimed registered medical practitioner and a realtor from Sathupallu in Khammam district and Somashekar alias Raj Kumar, a realtor from Dharmavaram. “Except the bank employees, all other accused are in one way or the other involved in real estate,” Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. He said the accused persons have illegally withdrawn the Akademi’s money and cleared their debts, invested in real estate and used the money for their pleasure. Narrating the details of the case, the Commissioner said that since Sai Kumar was already involved in similar offences in the past, he was aware of the modalities of FDR withdrawals, and his friend who was a field agent for banks in deposits and loans. “Sai Kumar was already in debt and on his request, his friend introduced him to an unknown person who he said will arrange FDRs for him, got him to contact Akademi’s accounts officer Ramesh,” he said. Whenever the Akademi plans to open an FD, Sai Kumar was contacted through the agent and in turn, the former would send Dr.Venkat or Somashekar to collect the cheque from Ramesh. Later, the prime accused with the help of his associates would create fake FDRs and fake request letters and submit them in the bank with different amounts and time periods for the FD. “They used to print and send fake FDRs to the Akademi,” he said. According to Mr. Kumar, the needle of suspicion is pointed at eight and nine more people and they will be arrested soon. Further, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said that arrested managers – Shaik Mastanvali of UBI and Sadhana of Canara Bank – would inform the UTR numbers of FDRs to Venkat Raman and his associates who would use it on the fake FDRs. “They withdrew the money after transferring it to the Akademi’s fake account in AP Merchantile Co-Operative Credit Society from Agrasen Co-Operative Urban Bank Limited.,” he said. The police personnel have already arrested credit society’s Chairman and Managing Director B. V. V. N. Satyanarayana Rao, his sister and manager (operations) Vedula Padmavathi and relationship manager Sayyad Mohiuddin, apart from Mastanvali. When asked about the recovery of swindled cash, the top cop maintained that the accused have spent the majority of the cash, and only a small amount was recovered. He said that the credit society got a commission of nearly Rs. 6 crore for parking the Akademi’s money, and a majority of the share was taken by Sai Kumar, Ramesh and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/six-more-arrested-in-telugu-akademi-scam/article36870041.ece
07 October 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Registration revenue continues to rise||The Registration and Stamps department’s revenue crossed Rs. 1,000-crore mark for the second time in the current financial year with Rs. 1,088 crore revenue reported in September. Revenue from Registration and Stamps department was Rs. 1,201 crore during July which was the highest revenue earning month for the department in more than a year. The department’s revenue during the month grew 689 per cent as compared to Rs. 139 crore reported during the same month last fiscal. The revenue was achieved from registration charges through sale of 1.66 lakh documents during the month. The growth indicates steady progress of the department to achieve the target of Rs. 12,500 crore set for it during the current financial year. The department suffered a setback during the previous fiscal achieving around 65 per cent of the Rs. 10,000 crore target set for the year. Revenues however picked up in the current fiscal showing the robustness of the real estate market and the ever increasing interest among people to invest in land which would yield benefits in the long term. Interestingly, the increase in revenue comes in spite of the hike in registration charges and revision of market values of lands which came into effect from July 22. In the first revision of market values effected after seven years, the government had fixed the lowest value for agricultural land at Rs. 75,000 per acre. For agricultural lands, the existing values had been enhanced by 50 per cent in lower range, 40 per cent in the mid range and 30 per cent in the higher range. The increase in case of flats/apartments had been fixed at 20 per cent in the lower range and 30 per cent in the higher ranges. In spite of the hike in charges, the department reported revenue of around Rs. 2,000 crore in the last two months – Rs. 922 crore in August and Rs. 1,088 crore in September. Officials hope that the revenue during the next two months would be significant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/registration-revenue-continues-to-rise/article36870372.ece
07 October 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Two held for ‘duping’ over 100 depositors||The Kadapa police busted a cyber crime on Wednesday and arrested two persons for reportedly luring more than 100 persons into making deposits with the assurance of doubling their money. As many as 23 bank accounts of the suspects, involving Rs. 62.5 crore, have been frozen. Four complaints were received in Kadapa I Town, Chapadu, Mydukur and Duvvuru police stations, where the victims complained about how they had been duped by pressing the link in the bulk SMS and WhatsApp messages sent from fictitious numbers. The modus operandi of the criminals was to circulate details of ‘money making apps’ among public. After they click on the link, the scamsters used to ask them to play games or do simple tasks if they wished to double their money. “In this manner, they duped more than hundred people who had made huge deposits into the virtual payment address. By the time the victims understand they had been tricked, the offenders block them from the website and their WhatsApp accounts,” SP K.K.N. Anburajan told the media here on Wednesday. The string of events saw light only after Ghouse Basha of Yerramukkapalli in the city filed a complaint that he had deposited Rs. 1.30 lakh in the ‘money making app’ aiming to double his investment. The cyber crime police found that the money, to the tune of Rs. 3 crore, swindled from the public had been transferred to different accounts. Another victim Dandu Naga Chaitanya shared vital details to the police, based on which the police found the involvement of Gokul (28) and Muruganandam (58), both from Tamil Nadu. As the two had already been arrested by the Dehradun police for similar offences, the Kadapa police brought them through PT warrant, produced them before the local court and sent them to remand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kadapa-police-bust-cybercrime-gang/article36870036.ece

Kannababu on Wednesday dared the TDP leaders to show the land the farmers had left without undertaking any agriculture activity as part of the ‘crop holiday’ in the Konaseema region in East Godavari district. Responding to the letters written by senior TDP leaders such as Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu and Devineni Umamaheswara Rao to the Chief Minister on the farmers’ woes, Mr. Kannababu said the TDP’s “false campaign” was only to project that the Konaseema farmers declared a crop holiday during kharif. “The farmers have not declared a crop holiday in any part of the State. The TDP campaign is fake. The opposition party has a history of deploying the police to threaten the farmers to withdraw the crop holiday they had declared in the Konaseema region during their term,” Mr. Kannababu told the media here. “The government has been providing every facility, including supply of seeds and procurement of yield, at the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Farmers have never been asked to stand in queues for the seed in the past two years,” claimed Mr. Kannababu.

07 October 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Why can’t post-COVID care be free?’||The Kerala High Court has asked the State government why it could not provide free treatment to those above the poverty line for post-COVID-19 complications for 30 days after they tested negative. The Bench comprising Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edappagath raised the question on Wednesday when a revision petition filed by an association of private hospitals against the fixing of treatment charges in private hospitals came up for hearing. The court observed that the treatment during the 30 days after patients turned negative should be reckoned as COVID treatment just as the Centre considered the death of COVID patients occurring 30 days after they turned negative. S. Kannan, senior government pleader, submitted that fixation of maximum rates for diseases occurring as post-COVID complications would ensure that private hospitals did not charge exorbitant rates from patients above the poverty line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-cant-post-covid-care-be-free/article36870032.ece

He had undergone treatment for COVID-19, tested negative, and was at home after being discharged from hospital.

07 October 2021||Kochi,ANDHRA PRADESH||KSEB loses interest in Athirappilly project||It is curtains for the controversial Athirappilly hydroelectric power project proposed across the Chalakudy, it seems. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), the project proponent, has conveyed its in-principle decision not to go ahead with the project to the Forest Department two years ago, while seeking Rs. 4.11 crore it had deposited with the department as the seigniorage of trees to be axed at the project site. Litigations Though proposed in 1996, the project could not be taken ahead by the KSEB as it was faced with a series of protests and litigations. The proposed 163-MW project had invited the wrath of environmentalists, who feared that it would destroy the riparian ecosystem of Athirappilly. Jairam Ramesh, former Union Environment Minister, had castigated the project as a perfect recipe for an ecological disaster in the State. Censure by panel The Western Ghats Ecological Expert Panel led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil had also denounced the project in its report. The Ooru Sabha (tribal council) of the Kadar tribe of the Vazhachal forest had denied permission for the project by invoking the Forest Rights Act conferred on the community. KSEB officials first conveyed their decision to drop the project at a meeting convened by the Chief Secretary on October 25, 2019. Later, the decision was reiterated at a meeting convened by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Forest Management), where the proceedings for the repayment of seigniorage were prepared, said senior forest officials. Responding to the developments, B. Ashok, Chairman and Managing Director, KSEB, said that one cannot say the KSEB had withdrawn from the project, though the seigniorage was sought back. The board was of the view that the project should be implemented though a consensus process guided by the State government, said Mr. Ashok. The seigniorage was remitted during the first phase of the environment clearance (EC) of the project as the value of trees that were to be cut down and related works. Even if the Forest Department remitted the money back, the board could resubmit the application for counting the trees and estimating the cost of the trees that were to be axed, said Mr. Ashok.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kseb-loses-interest-in-athirappilly-project/article36870033.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana withdraws Krishna plea in SC||Telangana on Wednesday withdrew its plea in the Supreme Court for “equitable apportionment” of the Krishna river water on the basis of an assurance given by the Centre that it will “consider” constituting a tribunal to resolve the issue. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, Telangana, in an application, said the Union Minister, in a meeting, stated that if the State withdrew its case from the Supreme Court, the Centre would “positively” consider forming a tribunal under the Inter State River Water Disputes Act of 1956 after taking necessary legal opinion. Taking “legal opinion” before forming a new tribunal on the issue of Krishna River water sharing was necessary as the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT II) was already seized of the inter-States’ issue. Seeks fair share Telangana had come to the Supreme Court complaining that it had been “unjustly denied” an equitable allocation of the water. It had made the Centre and the riparian States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra respondents. In its plea, Telangana had complained to the Supreme Court that it had written a letter to the Centre in 2014 to constitute a tribunal under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act of 1956 to adjudicate the issue. While the matter was pending with the Supreme Court, Telangana said the Union Minister, during a meeting, put forward the proposition to consider constituting the tribunal provided the State withdrew its case. The State said its Chief Minister had decided to act on the proposal from the Centre. The court recorded the prayer made by Telangana. The Bench said it was a “very sensitive matter” and disposed of the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-withdraws-krishna-plea-in-sc/article36870043.ece

Speaking to reporters at the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), Mr. Niraj said the Department had collected a lot of data, including pug marks and movement patterns of the tiger. “We have collected a lot of data, including signs of the tiger, such as pug marks, and evidence of the tiger scavenging on some kills. We have formed different teams [to track the tiger],” he said. Mr. Niraj said the Forest Department was altering strategies every day based on the information and data they collect. Currently, teams are in the Singara area in the tiger reserve, and they are trying to tranquillise the tiger. Mr. Niraj said there was a high probability of the tiger being in the Singara region, based on all the evidence that the Department had collected. Teams have also been posted in other areas to track the tiger. Mr. Niraj said it was a “silent operation”, with teams of three people each carrying all the food and supplies with them into the forest. The teams will camp in the search area and attempt to locate the tiger. Local residents and motorists are being stopped and are not being allowed to use the Singara road for the time being. “The habitat will remain undisturbed, and we are hoping that the tiger may be around and will venture out and provide an opportunity to us to tranquillise it,” he said. Based on the daily images from the camera traps in the search area, the focus of the operations will be shifted, he said, adding that drones, sniffer dogs as well as kumki elephants were being put to use in the operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/using-scientific-techniques-local-expertise-to-track-t23/article36870164.ece

07 October 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Travel by RTC specials at 50% extra fare||To cater to the commuting needs of the people during Dasara, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) will operate 4,000 special buses from October 8 to 18. At a press conference on Wednesday, APSRTC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said 50% extra fare would be charged in the special buses. Stating that the main festival days were Durgashtami (October 13, Wednesday), Navami (October 14, Thursday) and Dasami (October 15, Friday), he said the corporation would run special services before and after the festival days to clear the rush. From October 8 to 14 (before Dasara), it would ply 1,800 special buses and from October 15 to 18, it would operate 2,200 special buses. Out of the 4,000 buses, 1,383 would be operated from Hyderabad, 277 from Bengaluru and 97 from Chennai, while the remaining 2,243 vehicles would be operated within the 13 districts of the State, he said. Why additional fare Referring to allegations of over-charging, Mr. Rao explained, “These special buses will travel with commuters only on one side. In the return journey, there will be no takers and the buses will return empty, and hence the additional 50% charge.” He said the RTC was operating buses even on routes with one-way demand only to ensure that people were not put to inconvenience in the absence of a transport facility. Citing the increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, Mr. Rao said the corporation, which was already in deep financial crisis, had no other option but to charge extra for the special services. Electric buses Responding to a query on the proposed electric buses, he said 100 such buses would be added to the RTC fleet soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/travel-by-rtc-specials-at-50-extra-fare/article36870386.ece

07 October 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP disputes CM’s claim on fulfilment of promises||By voting the YSRCP to power, people had given Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy the chance he asked for, but he went about destroying institutions one by one, BJP national secretary Y. Satya Kumar alleged on Wednesday. “The Chief Minister is more interested in commissions than in development of the State,” Mr. Satya Kumar alleged. The BJP leader was speaking after participating in a protest staged against the alleged government’s failure in solving the people’s problems, at Dharna Chowk here. Mr. Satya Kumar said the government claimed to have sanctioned Rs. 2,600 crore for road repairs, but was unable to get even patchworks done. Power tariff had been increased six times in the last over two years, he said. The government turned a blind eye to the “attacks on temples,” Mr. Satya Kumar said. Disputing the Chief Minister’s claim that he had fulfilled a majority of his election promises, the BJP leader said, “Mr. Jagan should make amends, lest he should pay a heavy price for his autocratic style of functioning.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-disputes-cms-claim-on-fulfilment-of-promises/article36870377.ece

07 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lift ban on ring nets: fisherfolk||Highlighting that the ban on use of ring nets is taking a toll on the livelihood of fishermen, Andhra Pradesh Matsya Karmika Sangham leader and CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy has demanded that the government must take immediate measures to provide a solution to the issue. The Sangham, affiliated to the AITUC, took out a rally in this regard from Saraswathi Park to the District Collectorate on Wednesday. Mr. Murthy questioned the rationale behind imposing a ban on the use of ring nets by fishermen at Uppada and Bheemunipatnam. Showing the orders of a Single Judge Bench on a case filed under the AP-MRF (A) Act, he said only fishermen who had registered their ring nets were being allowed to use them up to a distance of 8 km from the coast and this was affecting the livelihood of fishermen at large. “Even as the AP MRF Act does not specify that only a particular type of net has to be used, the fishermen of Bheemunipatnam mandal have been ensuring that the holes in the nets were more than 1 inch in size for the last 20 years,” Mr. Murthy said. “More than 25 families are dependent on each of the 83 ring nets being used in the mandal and their livelihood is under threat now,” said Mr. Murthy. ‘Ban not uniform’ He said there was no ban on use of ring nets in some mandals in Visakhapatnam and other coastal districts. Later, the Sangham submitted a memorandum to the officials. Sangham leaders Yerripalli Nandanna, Chelluri Bujji, Nookalamma, Vamana Murthy and Nallayya were among those who participated in the protest rally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lift-ban-on-ring-nets-fisherfolk/article36870682.ece
07 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Release scholarships of SC/ST students, urges Chinta Mohan||Former Union Minister and Congress Working Committee Member Chinta Mohan on Wednesday alleged that the failure of the State government in releasing the scholarships for SC/ST and OBC students during the last two years in Andhra Pradesh is depriving students of these communities to pursue higher studies. The students, right from Class VI to degree/PG and professional courses, were not given their scholarships for the past two years. They were in no position to pay tuition fees and hostel fees due to non-receipt of scholarship dues. Around 80 lakh students,under these categories in A.P. were eligible for scholarships but were being deprived of the same, Mr. Mohan alleged at a press conference on Wednesday. Demanding payment of scholarship arrears to the students before Deepavali, the senior leader of the Congress recalled how he had got a scholarship of Rs. 18.69 paise during the early 1960s as a student of Class VI and how helpful it was in pursuing his school, college and professional studies. Luminaries like B.R. Ambedkar, K.R. Narayanan and Babu Jagjivan Ram had all come up in life by making use of scholarships, which was provided as a matter of right by the Constitution to the underprivileged classes, he said. Replying to a query, Mr. Chinta Mohan alleged that the State government was diverting the scholarships to other welfare programmes. To another query, Mr. Mohan said that he had taken the issue of privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to the notice of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and that the latter was planning to visit Visakhapatnam soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/release-scholarships-of-scst-students-urges-chinta-mohan/article36870673.ece

07 October 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VPT celebrates its 88th Foundation Day today||From a single berth in 1933 to 21 inner harbour berths and seven outer harbour berths today, the Visakhapatnam Port Trust has come a long way in its 88-year journey. Inaugurated in 1933, the port celebrates its 88th Foundation Day on Thursday. The British government had towards the end of the 19th century decided to build a port on the eastern coast of India in order to export resources from provinces in Central India. After a report was tabled by Col. H. Cartwright Reid of the British Admiralty with expert advice from Sir Arthur Cotton, the architect of Dowleswaram Barrage, Visakhapatnam was chosen for its strategic location and geographical advantages. To stop the silting at the mouth of the harbour, two decommissioned ships Janus and Wellesdon were sunk to create the breakwater, and the Bengal Nagpur Railway was given the order to construct the port. The first phase was taken up from 1927. It was formally inaugurated by the then Viceroy and Governor-General of India Lord Willingdon on December 19, 1933. However, the port came into operation from October 7, 1933, and the first vessel to enter the port was a passenger vessel named SS Jaladurga. The port later came to be known as the Visakhapatnam Port Trust after the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 came into being. Beginning with an annual traffic of 1.30 lakh tonnes, of which imports stood at 1.20 lakh tonnes, VPT has handled 33.41 million tonnes of cargo so far this year alone. Initially handling manganese ore, groundnuts, rice and flour, VPT today has the capacity to handle all types of cargo including iron ore, coal, crude oil, petroleum products, LPG, fertilizers, dry cargoes, liquid cargo and containers. Speaking to The Hindu , Chairman K. Rama Mohana Rao said that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, VPT has registered an increase of 2% in cargo volume. There has been a significant growth in thermal coal by 161%, steam coal by 45% and containers by 7% when compared to the corresponding period of previous year. A number of projects are on the verge of being awarded such as construction of a covered storage facility with an investment of Rs. 36.38 crore, repair of rehabilitation of ORS jetty with an estimated cost of Rs. 21.47 crore and cruise-cum-coastal terminal at an estimated cost of Rs. 96.05 crore. All of them will be awarded in the next one month, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vpts-88th-foundation-day-today/article36870669.ece

07 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Nearly 6k more may get cancer by 2025||Around 6,000 more people in Telangana may be diagnosed with cancer in 2025 compared to figures in 2020. While 47,620 people were projected to have cancer in 2020, the incidence in 2025 is estimated to be 53,565, which means 12.48% (5,945) more might get cancer in the five-year period. This has alarmed oncologists from the State, who have appealed to people to take measures to prevent the disease, loss of lives, and financial and emotional distress associated with it. The projections are from the ‘Profile of Cancer and Related Factors-Telangana’ released by the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR) of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the fourth week of September. Leading sites Apart from the projected increase in cancer cases, it has details on the leading sites of cancer in men and women, cumulative risk of developing cancer of any site in 0-74 years of age group in both the genders, proportion of cancer sites associated with tobacco usage, and other aspects. The cumulative risk, leading sites of cancer and proportion of cancers in sites associated with tobacco use are based on data from 2014-16 and calculated for the Population Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) areas. PBCR is located at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences. Principal investigator at PBCR Dr. G. Sadashivudu said that the data is taken from all cancer institutes and labs in Hyderabad, which conduct diagnostic tests for the disease. And data for Hospital Based Cancer Registry is drawn from NIMS, Indo-American Cancer Hospital & Research Institute, MNJ Institute of Oncology and Regional Cancer Centre. An important observation from the fact sheet is that the leading site for cancer among women is breast (35.5%), followed by cervix uteri (8.7%), and ovary (6.9%). In men, the leading site of cancer is mouth (13.3%), followed by lungs (10.9%), and tongue (7.9%). One needs to be aware of the factors associated with risk of developing cancer to know what should be avoided, and aspects of life that need to be changed. The fact sheet states that behavioural and environmental risk factors are tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, infections, and air pollution. Risk Dr. Sadashivudu, who is also the Head of the oncology department at NIMS, said that since 42.2% of cancer risk in men, and 13.5% of risk in women is associated with tobacco use, avoiding tobacco might help in preventing cancer. “Diagnosing cancers in early stages helps in better outcomes and cure. So, early screening is important. People can stop cancer by exercising, opting healthy food, avoiding alcohol and tobacco,” he suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nearly-6k-more-may-get-cancer-by-2025/article36870446.ece

Facilitating the rise in enrolment is the State government policy of not demanding transfer certificate from students up to Class VIII. Earlier, schools would insist on TC and the private schools demanded full payment of fee before issuing the certificate. “We have 480 students. Last year we had 327. We are running the school in two batches in three languages,” said Mohammed Laik Ali Khan, the head master of the school. This 46% rise in enrolment in this one school is replicated in different forms in other government schools in the city. Concurrent with the rise in enrolment of students in government schools is the decline in the numbers in private schools. Hyderabad had 2,083 private schools in 19-20. The number of private schools now is 1,886 a decline of 9.4%. Outside the classroom of Hyderguda Government School, Rajeshwari has enrolled her two children Venkat Kiran and Vasavi in Class I and Class IV. “They were studying in New Brilliant School. After the lockdown was lifted, the school wanted us to pay last year as well as this year’s fee. My son was in UKG and didn’t care about the online classes. The discovery of this school has come as a blessing,” says Rajeswari as her son and daughter walk around the school watching students scream their lessons. Hyderabad has about 377 government schools spread across the city with 8,15,910 students on its rolls. The quality ranges from small four class room establishments in Upparpally to multi-storied building complexes in NM Guda and Begumpet. “We have 158 students on the rolls in our school. Most of the admissions this year are students who dropped out of private schools. Students have to produce a birth certificate and we enrol them,” informs C. Suhasini, headmaster of the Hyderguda school as she counsels a parent about Dasara vacation and the issue of new textbooks for children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/enrolment-soars-in-government-schools-as-pvt-schools-fold-up/article36870456.ece

Narayana has criticised the BJP-led Government at the Centre for its inaction in arresting the persons responsible for killing of farmers who were agitating in Uttar Pradesh. While the perpetrators are left scot free, cases are being registered against members of affected families. The leaders of the opposition parties who wanted to console the victims’ families had been kept under house arrest. “Why was Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi arrested?’ Dr. Narayana questioned. Speaking to reporters along with CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy and former MP Aziz Pasha on Wednesday, the senior CPI leader said continuance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the post would pose grave danger to the country. The political and economic policies of the NDA Government turned harmful for the common man as the government was doling out largesse to corporates that evaded taxes. He alleged that a corporate house that was indirectly involved in drug supply through its ports and lamented that the government was however not initiating any action on the management. Mr. Aziz Pasha demanded that the Prime Minister sack his Cabinet colleague whose son was allegedly involved in the accident in Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Venkat Reddy demanded that the State Government take steps to pass a resolution regarding regularisation of podu lands in the ongoing session of the legislature and send it to the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-flayed-on-killing-of-farmers/article36870477.ece

In the recent past, Cyber Crime police station of Cyberabad has been receiving several complaints of cheating in the name of updating of KYC for SBI, Airtel and Paytm. Fraudsters send a link created using Ngrok, Bitly, Google View form and survey monkey. “So far, over 140 cases were registered against SBI KYC fraud and an amount of Rs. 67,10,021 has been defrauded and siphoned off from accounts of innocent citizens of Cyberabad this year,” police said. Modus operandi Fraudsters are contacting SBI account and credit card holders by pushing bulk SMS and calls, and have been warning them to update their KYC details. “For updating the KYC, they are asking the customer to download different remote access applications like Any Desk app, Quick Support App, Team Viewer App etc.,” police said. Application When the customer downloads the application, they are asked to transfer a nominal amount like Rs. 1, Rs. 10, Rs. 100 for checking. When the customer transfers the money by entering his bank account details, his accounts were hacked and money is debited into the fraudster’s accounts in different transactions. Recently, cybercrooks have started sending NGROK and Bitly links along with messages asking users to click on the link to update KYC and when they do it, the customers are redirected to fake website page which is similar to SBI net banking. Banking credentials As soon as the customers enter their net banking credentials, fraudsters collect the details and transfer funds to their accounts. Meanwhile, police officials have advised people not to believe in messages or calls seeking updatation of KYC details of SBI or any other accounts, as the bank authorities never send any such messages/mails/make such calls. Never reveal the bank account details to anyone, especially your secret PIN or One Time Password (OTP).  Bank staff never callor send messages/mails seeking updatation of KYC details Police||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/update-your-kyc-cyber-crooks-adopt-new-trick/article36870467.ece
07 October 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||AP-TS farmers frightened by false cases: Jagga Reddy||Sangareddy MLA and Telangana Congress working presiden, T. Jayaprakash Reddy has alleged that the farmers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were frightened by police foisting false cases against them whenever they took to roads on their issues. At a press conference here, he said farmers in both states were not protesting in large numbers against the farm laws as they were afraid of police cases. Telangana Chief Minister,K. Chandrasekhar Rao and AP Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy had been suppressing farmers’ protests with false cases, forcing the farmers to make rounds of the courts, which they could ill-afford. Moreover, Mr Chandrasekhar Rao and Mr YS Jagan had not uttered a word against the farm laws indicating that they were in support of the BJP and all its decisions. He said only Congress could fight on behalf of the farmers whenever they were in trouble and the way Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi responded to the mowing down of the farmers in Uttar Pradesh had sent a strong signal. He said the farmers had been deceived by the Telangana government on the farm loan waiver and also providing financial support when the crops were destroyed due to natural calamities. Not even a single incident of farmers getting compensation for the lost crops was seen under the TRS government and even the enumeration of the lost crop was ignored, he claimed. The Congress MLA accused the BJP of making tall claims on action against the TRS government but doing nothing on the ground. Their state president Bandi Sanjay was physically assaulted in Karimnagar but even then the BJP government at the Centre could do nothing excepting giving a royal treatment to KCR whenever he visited New Delhi, he alleged. Criticising the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, he said the accused in the killing of farmers and others had not been arrested so far but the Yogi government had shamelessly detained Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to prevent them from meeting families of the deceased. Mr. Reddy said the Modi government was busy protecting the few corporate houses while ‘killing’ the farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ap-ts-farmers-frightened-by-false-cases-jagga-reddy/article36870481.ece

07 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Archives building a picture of neglect||The sprawling Telangana State Archives and Research Institute (TSARI) building in Tarnaka is in a state of disrepair. On Tuesday, those perusing documents in its record room were in for a shock when chunks and chips of plaster from the roof of the research room came off and fell on the floor and cupboards containing books from the British Raj, barely a few feet from them. Pointing towards the western portion of the research room, a staffer said, “We are not allowing people to sit on that side of the room because the plaster from the room and wall had come off.” He added that research scholars were encouraged to sit in the row next to the two entrances to the research room. According to official information, the spacious TSARI building was constructed in 1965 on land belonging to Osmania University. It houses as many as 43 million documents, some of which are from 1403 CE, making this one of the largest collections of records of historical value in the country. The TSARI complex comprises repositories, libraries, and records sections, including one for Mughal records, museums and office rooms, among others. “The Telangana State Archives has a rich history. It sees renowned people and research scholars from universities come here to work on their projects, and stores very important documents. But, the upkeep of the building is poor. Plaster from the walls and roof have chipped off, and the corridors are in bad shape because of this. Plaster from the walls of some others sections too, fell in the past. A few months ago, the plaster in one section of the ground floor collapsed,” a worker who did not wish to be identified said. According to sources, funds for building repairs have not been included in the budgetary allocations. While structural repairs or moving the institute out of the existing building was on the anvil around four years ago, no headway was made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-archives-building-a-picture-of-neglect/article36870454.ece
07 October 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CSIR-IICT, IICB discover novel formulation of thermostable insulin||While availability of injectable insulin formulation has been a major breakthrough in diabetes management, insulin needs to be kept in a refrigerator or it will become unfit for use due to fibrillation (‘solidification’) after a few hours. Besides, its prolonged storage even in a normal refrigerator is not good. Hence, its thermal instability and fibrillation at non-refrigerated temperatures demand storage and maintenance of the cold chain, making it expensive. The problem becomes acute for diabetes patients staying at remote locations with no refrigerator facility or those travelling for long hours. Scientists from the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT), Hyderabad, in collaboration with Bose Institute, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB), Kolkata, have announced the discovery of a novel formulation of cost effective thermostable insulin injection on Wednesday. Their joint research helped in identification of a small peptide molecule ‘Insulock’, which inhibits insulin from fibrillation with the first part done by principal investigators from the Bose Institute - Subhrangsu Chatterjee and Partha Chakrabarti whereas determination of 3D structure of ‘Insulock-insulin’ complex and thermal stability by using high-resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, was taken up by IICT’s B. Jagadeesh (chief scientist) and Jithender Reddy (scientist). They had shown that ‘Insulock’ prevents both heat and storage induced insulin fibrillation and thereby loss of effective quantum of insulin. ‘Insulock’ is non-toxic, non-immunogenic, heat-stable and can maintain insulin in the active form at room temperature without any loss for months. It has been tested successfully in mice. “Gaining structural insights about ‘Insulock’ and establishing structural similarity with respect to the native insulin injection are crucial steps and these were carried out at our NMR which is USFDA-audited, has national accreditations, best suited for regulatory studies of drug molecules,” said Dr. Jagadeesh. IICB scientists stated that once the trials in humans are completed, the novel ‘Insulock’ formulation can provide cost-effective insulin to remote patients. The teams are planning to take up the clinical trials in humans by collaborating with Indian pharmaceutical industries. This work was published in iScience , international journal of cell press.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/csir-iict-iicb-discover-novel-formulation-of-thermostable-insulin/article36870449.ece

The BJP claimed that ever since the Modi Government came to power, civilian awards were made more ‘representational’ where poor persons were also chosen rather than based on recommendations or entitlement, hence Mr. Rao could have sent any names to the selection committee rather than blame the PM.

07 October 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Lakaram tank bund under video surveillance||Ahead of the festival season, the 2.6 km-long Lakaram tank bund, the popular recreation spot in the town, has been brought under a comprehensive round-the-clock video surveillance system with the installation of as many as 64 high-resolution Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras last week. The sophisticated CCTV cameras were installed at vantage points on the tank bund at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh to keep the public space, quite popular among morning walkers and nature lovers for its scenic beauty and fitness infrastructure, safe and ensure security of visitors. Recreation spot The lake encompassing a boating facility, a park, an open gym and a sky cycling sporting facility, among other attractions, has emerged a major recreation spot in the fort town. After a pandemic-induced break earlier this year, work on the 220-metre-long suspension foot overbridge across the lake picked up and reached the final stages, sources said. Giving a fillip to the digital initiatives, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar recently announced that he would soon donate around 500 Closed Circuit TV cameras for police department’s Nenu Saitham, community policing programme, to strengthen video surveillance in Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) limits. Meanwhile, the railway authorities gave their nod for setting up 60 CCTV cameras at the railway station in the town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lakaram-tank-bund-under-video-surveillance/article36870483.ece
07 October 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Attendance in junior colleges below 40%||Despite colleges being reopened more than one month back, student attendance continues to be very poor. It’s only 40% in several colleges. The reasons being attributed are fear of COVID-19 and lack of bus facility. There are 20 colleges in government sector where as the number in private sector is 44. The number of students studying in these colleges is about 27,000 - both in Intermediate first and second-years. Though many of the colleges are located in urban areas, students studying in the colleges are from the nearby rural areas. Students allege that the road transport corporation has not yet restored bus facility in several areas, making it difficult for them to reach colleges. The cost for transport in private vehicles is high for the rural students. As the financial condition of many families is not yet normal due to COVID-19 hit, many families are unable to support the studies of their children. On the other hand, the residential colleges are yet to open, which is also one of the reasons for low attendance. Students stage protest  Meanwhile, some students of government junior college in Manoor mandal headquarters held a protest on Monday demanding holding of regular classes. They allege that there are about 60 students in both first-year and second-year, but lecturers are not attending regularly. However, officials say that there are only three regular lecturers and hence - the problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/attendance-in-junior-colleges-below-40/article36870463.ece

07 October 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt.’s campaign against dust pollution to start today||The Delhi government will run an anti-dust campaign from October 7 to 29 to curb pollution. Over 30 teams have been formed to carry out inspections, said Environment Minister Gopal Rai. The government also released a list of 14 rules to be followed by all construction sites. Most of these rules are part of the existing guidelines by the Central Pollution Control Board, which is to be followed by all construction sites round the year. “Today, we held a joint meeting with the engineers of the DPCC [Delhi Pollution Control Committee] and the green marshals of the Green War Room. We have decided that dust pollution will be fought on a priority basis. From October 7 to 29, we will run an anti-dust campaign in Delhi with full force,” Mr. Rai said. The Delhi government had run a similar campaign last year too, before the air pollution levels spiked in winter. According to officials, the rules are not new, but the government will put more manpower to implement the them during the campaign and increase compliance. “Our teams will conduct inspections on construction sites and monitor the situation. The first phase of this campaign will begin tomorrow and continue till October 29. A total of 31 teams have been formed for this purpose. Of these, 17 teams of DPCC engineers will work across various districts and 14 teams of green marshals will work with mobile vans,” the Minister said. Warned of action He also warned of action against government agencies not following the rules while engaged in construction activities. “In case we observe that any department is not taking suitable action, then a show-cause notice will be issued to them. In case the department is unable to clarify the show-cause notice within two days, they will be penalised,” Mr. Rai said. In case of violations, if a plot is up to 100 square metres, it can be fined Rs. 10,000. The fine can be Rs. 20,000 for 100-200 square metres, and if the plot is above 20,000 square metres, then the government can charge a penalty to the tune of Rs. 5 lakh or above. Air pollution in the city rises during winter, chiefly due to a combined effect of stubble burning in the neighbouring States and climatic conditions, which lowers wind speed and mixing height, in turn trapping pollutants. On Monday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a plan to combat pollution during winter and action against dust pollution is a part of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-govts-campaign-against-dust-pollution-to-start-today/article36870603.ece
07 October 2021||New Delhi,||Judge critical of police probe in riots cases transferred||Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav, who was presiding over several cases related to the north-east Delhi riots at the Karkardooma court, was on Wednesday transferred to the Rouse Avenue court where he will serve as a Special Judge for cases pertaining to the Prevention of Corruption Act. ASJ Yadav has been replaced by Virender Bhatt, who earlier served as Special Judge at Rouse Avenue court. The transfer order issued by the Delhi High Court included seven Metropolitan Magistrates and four Additional Sessions Judges. In addition to ASJ Yadav, Metropolitan Magistrate Fahad Uddin, who presided over another of the four special courts hearing matters related to the February 2020 riots, has been transferred as Metropolitan Magistrate, Tis Hazari court. Shama Gupta will replace him. While hearing the riots cases, ASJ Yadav had passed several scathing orders and pointed out loopholes in investigations. During one such hearing last month, he had observed that “failure to conduct a proper investigation will torment sentinels of democracy”. ‘Sorry state of affairs’ A day before his transfer, ASJ Yadav had come down heavily on Delhi Police, saying one of its witnesses was “lying on oath”and it was “a very sorry state of affairs”. He had asked DCP (Northeast) for a report in the matter. He made the observation after Head Constable Sanoj stated on oath in his evidence that he had identified three rioters by their names and professions, namely Vikas Kashyap, Golu Kashyap and Rinku Subziwala. However, Assistant Sub-Inspector Ram Dass stated in his evidence that the three accused “could not be identified during investigation”. ASJ Yadav in his order said it appeared prima facie that one of the police witnesses in the case was lying on oath and the same was punishable under IPC Section 193 (punishment for false evidence). The court noted that while the Head Constable had categorically asserted about the accused’s presence at the spot, it was however admitted by the Investigating Officer (IO) “that there is nothing on record to substantiate that matter” and the fact that the three men were ever investigated despite their names being there on record. “On the contrary, it is stated that the identity of these accused persons could not be established during investigation,” the order read. ASJ Yadav further said there was no material available on record which showed that efforts were made by the IO to apprehend the three men. The case pertains to incidents of robbery and vandalism at multiple houses during the riots in the Johripur Pulia area.  Prima facie, one of the police witnesses is lying on oath punishable under Section 193, IPC ASJ Vinod Yadav||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/judge-critical-of-police-probe-in-riots-cases-transferred/article36870604.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mother, twins die in house fire||A 36-year-old woman and her twin children died while another daughter sustained injuries when their house caught fire following a gas leak, in central Delhi’s Anand Parbat on Tuesday morning. DCP (Central) Shweta Chauhan said the victims were identified as Sushila and her seven-year-old twins — Mohan and Mansi. The injured daughter has been identified as Monika, 10, while another daughter Mehak, 13, escaped unhurt. Police said that a PCR call was received at 9.02 a.m. regarding fire in a house. When they reached the spot in Punjabi Basti’s Gulshan Chowk, four persons were found with burn injuries and were rushed to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Sushila was declared dead and the twins succumbed to injuries during treatment, the police said, adding that Monika is undergoing treatment at Safdarjung Hospital. Sushila’s husband was at his workplace in Lawrence Road at the time of the incident. Mehak said she was preparing tea for the mother and her siblings when the house suddenly caught fire. “I turned on the stove and it suddenly caught fire. I was close to the door of our room so I managed to escape. But the room is small and my mother and siblings were inside.They couldn’t come out,” she said. “The fire was caused due to leakage in rubber pipe which connects the cylinder to the burner,” Ms. Chauhan said. Delhi Fire Service said two fire tenders were pressed into service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mother-twins-die-in-house-fire/article36870608.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU issues guidelines on inclusion of State board subjects in cut-off calculation||On the third day of DU admissions in various undergraduate programmes under the first cut-off list, around 59,000 applications were received by the university. Over 13,000 applications have been verified, a university spokesperson said. Responding to the trend of a large number of students from State Education Boards securing admissions into colleges, DU has issued guidelines on inclusion of subjects from other State boards equivalent to ones taught under the Central Board of Secondary Education in the calculation of cut-off marks. Many candidates had complained that colleges were rejecting or withholding applications without any substantial reason. A DU official said that an equivalence committee, set up by the university, held a meeting to decide which subjects from State boards would be equivalent to CBSE subjects and if they could be included while calculating the “best four” subjects to arrive at the cut-off score. The official said that these guidelines have been shared with colleges after many requests were raised asking if particular subjects that are offered by State boards but not by CBSE could be included. The Students’ Federation of India said that DU is bound to admit students satisfying all eligibility criteria and that it is a matter of shame that applicants are being discriminated based on their boards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/du-issues-guidelines-on-inclusion-of-state-board-subjects-in-cut-off-calculation/article36870601.ece

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||China tensions worst in 40 years: Taiwan||Days after China’s air force sent a record 56 aircraft towards Taiwan, Taiwanese Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng described relations across the Strait as the most strained in 40 years. “It is the toughest situation I have seen in more than 40 years of my military life,” the Defence Minister, also a former General, was quoted as telling the legislature, amid stepped up aerial intrusions from China’s air force. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force sent a record 38 aircraft into the Air Defence Identification Zone on Friday, October 1, China’s National Day. Another 39 aircraft followed on Saturday, with a record 56 aircraft in two waves on Monday. The Taiwanese Defence Minister, who was speaking to the legislature as it revised a defence spending budget, said China had the ability to start a war but would weigh various outcomes, the costs and consequences, before launching one. He said Taiwan had to be able to defend itself rather than rely on others, referring to U.S. commitments to defend the island. Biden-Xi talk Separately on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the Taiwan issue and both “agreed to abide by the agreement”, ostensibly referring to past U.S.-China understandings on Taiwan. Mr. Biden also appeared to be referring to their phone call last month. The U.S. State Department said it was “very concerned” over the air intrusions, which it described as China’s “provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilising, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability.” That statement drew a sharp response from China’s Foreign Ministry. “Taiwan belongs to China and the U.S. is in no position to make irresponsible remarks,” spokesperson Hua Chunying said, saying the remarks “send an extremely wrong and irresponsible signal”. Ms. Hua also hit out at U.S. arms sales “including the launch of a $750 million arms sale plan to Taiwan, the landing of U.S. military aircraft in Taiwan and frequent sailing of US warships across the Taiwan Strait”. The Taiwan tensions are expected to figure in talks this week between U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s top diplomat and Politburo member Yang Jiechi, as they meet in Switzerland. The March meeting in Alaska between the two, which was the first high-level engagement with China after the Biden administration took office, was marked by an unusual rancorous public exchange of words played out in front of the cameras. Challenge to continue In July, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who is currently on a visit to India, was presented with two lists of demands by Chinese officials in talks in Tianjin, as relations between both countries continue to remain strained amid differences on a range of issues from trade and technology to Hong Kong and Xinjiang, besides the Taiwan issue. Speaking to the media in New Delhi on Wednesday, Ms. Sherman said the U.S. will challenge China where it must, compete where there is a level playing field and cooperate where it can. “We will challenge China where we must, we want to make sure there’s a free, open, interconnected Indo-Pacific, as does India,” she said. “And that means that China doesn’t get to decide who gets to use those waterways and who doesn’t. They have sent sorties of airplanes across Taiwan’s path over the last couple of days…. We find that to be a very dangerous action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-tensions-worst-in-40-years-taiwan/article36869972.ece
07 October 2021||Stockholm,||Duo win Nobel Chemistry Prize for work on catalysts||Germany’s Benjamin List and U.S.-based David MacMillan on Wednesday won the Nobel Chemistry Prize for developing a tool to build molecules which has helped make chemistry more environmentally friendly. Their tool, which they developed independently of each other in 2000, can be used to control and accelerate chemical reactions, exerting a big impact on drugs research. Prior to their work, scientists believed there were only two types of catalysts — metals and enzymes. The new technique, which relies on small organic molecules and which is called “asymmetric organocatalysis” is widely used in pharmaceuticals, allowing drug makers to streamline the production of medicines for depression and respiratory infections, among others. Organocatalysts allow several steps in a production process to be performed in an unbroken sequence, considerably reducing waste in chemical manufacturing, the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Dr. List and Dr. MacMillan, both 53, will share the 10-million-kronor ($1.1-million, one-million-euro) prize. “I thought somebody was making a joke. I was sitting at breakfast with my wife,” Dr. List told reporters over telephone during a press conference after the prize was announced. Heads-up note In past years, he said his wife has joked that he should keep an eye on his phone for a call from Sweden. “But today we didn't even make the joke,” Dr. List said. “It’s hard to describe what you feel in that moment, but it was a very special moment that I will never forget.” Asked about what the prize would mean for his future as a researcher, Dr. List promised he had “a few more plans”. Dr. MacMillan, born in Scotland, is a professor at Princeton University in the U.S., while Dr. List is a director at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. “This work requires catalysts, which are substances that control and accelerate chemical reactions, without becoming part of the final product,” it added. Since their discovery, developments in the field can “almost be likened to a gold rush,” with Dr. List and Dr. MacMillan designing “multitudes of cheap and stable organocatalysts,” the science body noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/duo-win-nobel-chemistry-prize-for-work-on-catalysts/article36869967.ece
07 October 2021||London,||Facebook blames outage on error during maintenance||The global outage that knocked Facebook and its other platforms offline for hours was caused by an error during routine maintenance, the company said. Santosh Janardhan, Facebook’s vice-president of infrastructure, said in a blog post that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp going dark was “caused not by malicious activity, but an error of our own making.” The problem occurred as engineers were carrying out day to day work on Facebook’s global backbone network — the computers, routers and software in its data centers around the world, along with the fiber-optic cables connecting them. “During one of these routine maintenance jobs, a command was issued with the intention to assess the availability of global backbone capacity, which unintentionally took down all the connections,” Mr. Janardhan said. That change also triggered a second problem that made things worse by making it impossible to reach Facebook’s servers even though they were operational. Engineers scrambled to fix the problem on site, but this took time because of the extra layers of security, Mr. Janardhan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/facebook-blames-outage-on-error-during-maintenance/article36869969.ece

While life in the UAE has largely returned to normal, it retains strict rules on wearing masks and social distancing.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A strategy for India in a world that is adrift||New situations require fresh thinking. A few of us — Yamini Aiyar, Sunil Khilnani, Prakash Menon, Nitin Pai, Ajit Ranade, Srinath Raghavan, and Shyam Saran — some of whom were authors a decade ago of Non-Alignment 2.0, were prompted by the tectonic shifts in India’s internal and external environment to take another look at India’s path to power in a world between orders. The outcome of our conversations is a discussion paper hosted on the Centre for Policy Research and Takshashila Institute websites called “India’s Path to Power; Strategy in a World Adrift”. It is our hope that we will receive comments, suggestions and criticism of the paper and that it will contribute to the national debate on our country’s course. Many power centres The world is today adrift. We are neither in a bipolar Cold War nor in a multipolar world, though perhaps tending towards a world of several power centres. We are in a world between orders. The lack of a coherent international response to the COVID-19 pandemic is proof of an absence of international order and of the ineffectiveness of multilateral institutions. So is the ineffective international response to climate change and other transnational threats. Secular stagnation in the global and Indian economies and a retreat from globalisation, the regionalisation of trade, a shifting balance of power, the rise of China and others, and structural China-United States strategic rivalry have shifted the geopolitical and economic centres of gravity from the Atlantic to Asia. Inequality between and within states has bred a narrow nationalism and parochialism. We are entering a new polarised information age, and face ecological crises of the Anthropocene, making climate change an existential threat. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated some of these changes and transformed others. All in all, we can no longer take the success of our development model for granted. Asia as the nucleus Over the next decade we expect Asia to remain the cockpit of geopolitical rivalries, and that the U.S. remains the most formidable power, though its relative power is declining. China sees a window of opportunity but acts in a hurry, suggesting that she believes that window may close or is already closing due to pushback from the West and others. China’s crowded geography constrains her both on land and at sea. We see a slim prospect of Chinese hegemony in Asia, but expect her profile and power to continue expanding, particularly in our periphery. The result is likely continued friction, some cooperation, and quasi-adversarial relations between India and China, which others will take advantage of. As neighbours and in the present situation, a mix of confrontation and cooperation is likely to continue to mark India’s relations with China. Overall, we do not expect conventional conflict between the great powers in Asia, though other forms and levels of violence and contention in the international system will rise, with Taiwan a special case. Challenges, opportunities The uncertainty and changing geopolitical environment clearly pose considerable challenges to Indian policy but also throw up certain opportunities, enhancing our strategic options and diplomatic space, if we adjust policies internally and externally, particularly in the subcontinent. Increasing security congruence with the U.S. could enable growing cooperation in fields significant for India’s transformation: energy, trade, investment, education and health. Other areas in which India and the U.S. could increase cooperation are: climate change and energy, on tech solutions for renewable energy, and on digital cooperation. Several middle powers are now India’s natural partners. There is also an increasing possibility of working with partners in the developing world building broader coalitions on issues of common interest. This time of transition between orders is also when new standards and norms are being developed, particularly in the digital space. India can and must be present at the creation. There are opportunities in other domains as well. At sea, the balance is today more favourable to us than before, possibly more so than on the continent. We suggest the creation of a Maritime Commission, a Bay of Bengal Initiative with partner countries, and increasing what we do with South East Asia in maritime security, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism. We should aim for multipolarity in Asia. The way forward that we suggest is based on the core strategic principles in Non-Alignment 2.0 which are still relevant: independent judgement, developing our capacities, and creating an equitable and enabling international order for India’s transformation. Today’s situation makes India’s strategic autonomy all the more essential. At the same time, we must adjust to changing circumstances. We have no choice but to engage with this uncertain and more volatile world. One productive way to do so would be through issue-based coalitions including different actors, depending on who has an interest and capability. Revive SAARC We also suggest initiatives to craft and reinvigorate regional institutions and processes in the neighbourhood, reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) for instance. India could be the primary source of both prosperity and security in the neighbourhood — the subcontinent and the Indian Ocean Region. The over securitisation of policy towards our neighbours has driven trade underground, criminalised our borders, and enabled large-scale entry of Chinese goods destroying local industry in the northeast. While lessening dependence on China, and seeking external balancing, our primary effort has to concentrate on self-strengthening. If there is one country which in terms of its size, population, economic potential, scientific and technological capabilities can match or even surpass China, it is India. Self-strength is key Our paper also suggests several steps that we can take in India to ensure that India’s role and influence abroad continue to serve the task of transforming India. Economic policy must match political and strategic engagement. Globalisation has been central to India’s growth. A more active regional and international role for India is incompatible with a position on the margins of the global economy. Self-reliance in today’s world and technologies can only be realised as part of the global economy. We should not imitate China’s claims to being a civilisational state and its adoption of victimhood. Instead we should affirm our own strength and historic national identity. In sum, we see self-strengthening as an absolutely essential precondition as also safeguarding the foundational sources of India’s international influence. We cannot separate our domestic trajectory from the external course we need to pursue to transform India into a strong, secure and prosperous country.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The recent QES estimates are unreliable||Last week, the Ministry of Labour and Employment released the results of a new Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) for April-June 2021 for the organised (formal) sector. It represents establishments (or units) employing ten or more workers. The surveyed sectors were manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, education, health, accommodation and restaurant, Information Technology/Business Process Outsourcing (IT/BPO), and financial services. The survey reported the following. First, “It is heartening to note that the estimated total employment in the nine selected sectors from the first round of QES works out as 3 crores and 8 lakhs approximately against a total of 2 crores and 37 lakhs in these sectors taken collectively, as reported in the Sixth Economic Census (2013-14), implying a growth of 29%.” Secondly, employment fell from 3.078 crore before the first nationwide lockdown in March 2020 to 2.848 crore post the lockdown on July 1, 2020. Thus, the report showed that 24 lakh jobs lost during the lockdown in 2020 came back by the first quarter of 2021. The new QES is a welcome step as it will help generate timely employment estimates for the larger units. However, the above analysis is fraught with caveats and the interpretation of the survey results calls for caution. Limited coverage As is widely known, establishments with ten or more workers account for a small proportion of all non-agricultural establishments — a mere 1.66% as per the Economic Census (EC) of 2013-14. Also, a disproportionately large share of workers — 81.3% as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS, 2018-19) — worked in the unorganised sector. With its limited coverage, the QES based on data for formal sector enterprises cannot provide a total picture of employment dynamics. Hence, drawing inferences about overall job losses during the lockdown based on this survey is simply misleading. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed that during April 2020, 12.1 crore workers lost their jobs. Most of these workers were informally employed — 9.1 crore job losses reportedly occurred amongst small traders and casual labourers. The official PLFS indicated the extent of distress in the labour market during the nationwide lockdown. The unemployment rate by current weekly status (i.e. the activity status during seven days preceding the survey date) in urban areas increased from 9.1% in January-March 2020 (before the lockdown) to 20.8% in April to June 2020. Significantly, the new QES data suffer from many methodological shortcomings such as an outdated sample frame, non-comparability of employment numbers obtained from the EC-2013 with sample estimates obtained from the QES for only a quarter, and differences in methods used for gathering the information. We elucidate these problems below. Conducting a scientific sample survey requires a “sample frame”, i.e. the list of units (e.g., persons, households, businesses, etc.) in the survey population. Since the basis for sample selection is this list, the frame is of utmost importance for the survey design. To generate a frame for its enterprise surveys, India has been conducting the ECs since 1977, albeit at long and irregular intervals. The most recent one was in 2013-14, which the QES has used. The new QES has a sample of approximately 11,000 establishments. The datedness of the frame implies that the QES does not include units set up after 2013. Further, the EC-2013 has based itself on the “enumeration blocks” of the Population Census, 2011 as the primary geographical units. The outdated nature of the sample frame, which has been acknowledged for a while now, renders the new QES employment estimates irrelevant. To understand the QES’s origin, the Labour Bureau (LB) conducted the first such survey in 2009, with a modest sample size of around 2,000 manufacturing units for eight select labour-intensive and export-oriented industries in 11 States. The survey sought to assess the employment effects of the global financial crisis and was conducted till December 2015. In April 2016, the LB replaced this series with another quarterly series, which had a larger sample size and enhanced sectoral coverage. The EC-2013 served as the sampling frame for this survey, too. However, it was soon abandoned as a government-appointed Task Force on Improving Employment Data (2017) recommended doing away with the QES on grounds of its limited coverage and an outdated sample frame. Given the above background, the rush to produce a new QES that draws its sample from the EC-2013 frame seems baffling. It would have been more prudent to await the release of a newly updated frame in the EC-2020 and then canvass for  the QES. In fact, given the outdated frame, drawing inferences about employment changes even for the organised sector during the lockdown is misleading. It is also worth noting that QES was primarily a telephonic survey and verification of responses of establishments has not been done (as has been the usual practice for the LB’s quarterly surveys). Moreover, the comparison of the employment estimates obtained from the new QES for April to June 2021 with the employment number based on the EC-2013 reported in the first paragraph is confounding. The latter is a census, conducted over an entire year, to provide a frame. The former is a sample survey conducted with a short reference period. The questionnaire of the QES asks establishments about employment details for a specific quarter, in this case, April 1, 2021. In contrast, the EC-2013 questionnaire asks establishments about the number of persons working on the last working day prior to the date of fieldwork in the establishment. Conceptual problem In addition, there is a conceptual problem in comparing employment numbers of the EC with the QES. Although the former asks questions about the number of persons working in an enterprise, it is not a good instrument for estimating the size of the workforce or for analysing employment trends as the principal objective of the EC is generating a frame, not estimating employment. The initiative to produce quarterly employment data for selected industries in the organised sector is desirable. However, in a rush to generate high-frequency estimates, there cannot be a compromise on data quality and its reliability. Hence, the inference drawn using the new survey data, as reported in the opening paragraph, is misleading. The LB’s hurried effort has only created (avoidable) confusion and undermined the potential value of the QES.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The Hindu vote, an emerging ethnocracy||The forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh have seen growing competition over the Hindu vote. Political parties across the spectrum are engaging in competitive Hindutva. Not only are the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party competing with the Bharatiya Janata Party to woo the Hindu vote, but even parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party, whose claim to fame has been in advancing the politics of social justice, are appealing to Hindu sentiments. BSP supremo Mayawati was recently filmed carrying a trishul. The SP, whose founder-patron Mulayam Singh Yadav enjoyed the epithet “Mullah Yam Singh Yadav”, has been promising to build temples to Parshuram, to Vishnu and other divinities. Such appeals demonstrate India’s transition away from a democracy to an ethnocracy. Even as the BJP clamps down on Opposition parties supportive of the farmers’ movements, we must not lose sight of our country’s transition to an ethnocracy. What is an ethnocracy? Israeli sociologist Oren Yiftachel defines ethnocracy as the specific expression of nationalism “where a dominant ethnos [people] gains political control and uses the state apparatus to ethnicise the territory and society in question”. Ethnocracies — think about Israel, Sri Lanka and Malaysia — rigidify distinctions between people considered the core of the nation and others considered peripheral and external to the nation. To be sure, the dominant groups in ethnocracies value democracy (at least for themselves) and often take pride in their democratic institutions. But a polity based on the structural exclusion of a section of its population cannot reasonably be said to qualify as a democracy. A transition, since 2014 An ethnocracy has taken root in India since 2014, with Hindus established as the dominant people. Soon after the BJP stormed to power that year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the unprecedented step of celebrating his victory on the banks of the Ganga in the holy town of Varanasi. Varanasi was the parliamentary constituency that elected him, so it was to be expected that he would thank his voters. However, the spectacle of the Prime Minister, accompanied by senior colleagues who would go on to assume key cabinet portfolios, flaunting his Hindu nationalist credentials was a clear break with the past. To be sure, India’s heads of government — even when personally agnostic — have frequented places of worship on key occasions and regularly greeted the country on religious occasions. But Mr. Modi’s political association with religion as an inaugural act was rare. The links were made even more clear when a few weeks further, addressing India’s Parliament for the first time, Mr. Modi referred to “1200 years of servitude” that Indians had suffered. This was a not-so-subtle reference to the presence of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and associated accounts of conquest, plunder, and domination by invaders of the Islamic faith. Mr. Modi’s early actions offered a glimpse into his future years in office, in which Hindus would come to be considered the core of the Indian nation. The principle that a dominant Hindu ethnos can rule the country and marginalise others has firmly established itself. Images of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, Congress scion Rahul Gandhi emphasising his roots as a janeu-dhari Brahmin, and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, reciting the Chandipath as public declarations of their Hinduness suggest that such a principle is being established well beyond the BJP and the Prime Minister. Indeed, the BJP has been so successful in creating an ethnocracy in India that its rivals are increasingly emulating it. A recent report of tourism development schemes in Uttar Pradesh suggested that an overwhelming majority of legislators from the Opposition SP and BSP, both torchbearers of secularism and social justice in the 1990s, preferred Hindu religious sites over sites of other or no religion. Such performance of Hindu rituals is barely matched by performance of practices associated with other communities. Fulfilment of imagination Such developments resonate with the ideological vision of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the BJP. Established in 1925, the RSS strives to organise society in accordance with and ensure the protection of the Hindu dharma , or way of life. The RSS’s commitment to Hindutva, or ‘Hindu-ness’ at the expense of religious minorities is clear from a reading of its “vision and mission statement” that is publicly available on its website. Invoking the words of its founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, the statement declares: “The Hindu culture is the life-breath of Hindusthan. It is therefore clear that if Hindusthan is to be protected, we should first nourish the Hindu culture. If the Hindu culture perishes in Hindusthan itself, and if the Hindu society ceases to exist, it will hardly be appropriate to refer to the mere geographical entity that remains as Hindusthan. Mere geographical lumps do not make a nation. The entire society should be in such a vigilant and organized condition that no one would dare to cast an evil eye on any of our points of honour.” 22-Oct-2012, RSS The RSS’s vision and mission statement endorse their founder’s reference to India as “Hindusthan”, a cultural term to refer to the land of the Hindus. The competitive Hindutva on display in Uttar Pradesh has brought the RSS’s vision and mission to fruition.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Trade multilateralism at risk||The World Trade Organization (WTO) — the global trade body — is facing a serious existential crisis. The upcoming WTO ministerial meeting scheduled for next month in Geneva provides an opportunity to rescue this critical global institution from irrelevance. Created in 1995, during the heyday of neoliberalism, the WTO became a shining example of triumphant free-market capitalism. Critics of neoliberalism chastised the WTO for pushing the American imperialist agenda. Paradoxically, more than two-and-a-half decades later, the United States seems to have lost interest in it. The feeling in Washington is that the WTO hasn’t served the American national interest by failing to stem China’s rise and regularly indicting the U.S. in several trade disputes. President Joe Biden has continued with the same policy towards the WTO that Donald Trump practised. The continuation of the U.S. policy on the WTO is most evident in the sustained crippling of the Appellate Body (AB). The AB is part of the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism. It is a permanent body with seven members, and acts as an appellate court hearing appeals from the decisions given by WTO panels. However, since December 2019, the AB has stopped functioning due to rising vacancies. Over the years, the U.S. has consistently blocked the appointment of AB members. The U.S. also vetoes proposals to find solutions to this impasse, including stalling the proposal of the European Union to establish an alternative interim appellate arbitration mechanism. The number of pending appeals to the AB has increased sharply to around 20 cases. Countries now have an easy option not to comply with the WTO panel decisions by appealing into the void. Other challenges Additionally, there are four other challenges that the WTO faces. First, no solution has been found to the public stockholding for food security purposes despite a clear mandate to do so in the 2015 Nairobi ministerial meeting. This is of paramount concern for countries like India that use Minimum Support Price (MSP)-backed mechanisms to procure foodgrains. The WTO rules allow countries to procure, stock and distribute food. However, if such procurement is done at an administered price such as the MSP that is higher than the external reference price, then the budgetary support provided shall be considered trade-distorting and is subject to an overall cap. With rising prices and the need to do higher procurement to support farmers and provide food to the poor at subsidised prices, India might breach the cap. Although countries have agreed that legal suits will not be brought if countries breach the cap, it is imperative to find a permanent solution such as not counting MSP-provided budgetary support as trade-distorting. Second, the WTO member countries continue to disagree on the need of waiving the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement for COVID-19 related medical products. It was exactly a year back when India and South Africa proposed a TRIPS waiver to overcome intellectual property (IP)-related obstacles in increasing accessibility of COVID-19 medical products, including vaccines. The WTO needs to adopt a waiver in the upcoming ministerial meeting. Third, the WTO is close to signing a deal on regulating irrational subsidies provided for fishing that has led to the overexploitation of marine resources by countries like China, which is the largest catcher and exporter of fish. However, this agreement should strike a balance between conserving ocean resources and the livelihood concerns of millions of marginal fishermen. An effective special and differential treatment provision that accords adequate policy space is what India and other developing countries should insist on. Fourth, the gridlock at the WTO has led to the emergence of mega plurilateral trade agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) — a treaty between 11 countries. Another key trade treaty is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement between Asian economies and countries down under. These plurilateral agreements not only fragment the global governance on international trade but also push the multilateral order to the margin, converting the WTO to what some call an “institutional zombie”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his recent U.S. visit, rightly pleaded for a rule-based global order. Institutional multilateralism would be the ideal antidote to unilateralism and economic nationalism. Notwithstanding its flaws, the WTO is the only forum where developing countries like India, not party to any mega plurilateral trade agreements, can push for evolving an inclusive global trading order that responds to the systemic imbalances of extant globalisation. What is at stake is the future of trade multilateralism and not just an institution. Prabhash Ranjan is Professor and Vice Dean, Jindal Global Law School, O.P.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Road accidents can be reduced||Fifty-one passengers of an overcrowded bus died in an accident on the morning of February 16 when it fell into a canal near Sarda Patan village in Sidhi district, Madhya Pradesh. A griha pravesh (house-warming) ceremony for the beneficiaries of one lakh houses constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Bhopal, which was to be attended virtually by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, was cancelled due to the incident. Two days earlier, fourteen persons were killed when a minivan they were travelling in hit a divider on a National Highway (NH) near Madarpur village in Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh. The van carrying 18 passengers was on its way to Ajmer in Rajasthan from Chittoor, when the driver lost control and hit the divider, tumbling on the other side of the road where a speeding truck crashed into it. According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 1,51,113 persons were killed and 4,51,361 injured in road accidents across the country in 2019. NHs and State Highways, which account for about 5% of the total road length, claimed 61% of the deaths related to accidents. Around 35,606 deaths were reported on the NHs, which come under the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Speaking at a webinar organised by the International Road Federation on February 9, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said India topped the fatality figures in road accidents in the world, with 415 deaths each day. While commending Tamil Nadu for taking effective road safety measures that had resulted in the reduction of road accidents by 38% and deaths by 54%, he asked other States to emulate Tamil Nadu. It is small wonder that he actively pursued the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, with the well-intentioned motive of bringing down the death rate due to road accidents by 50% by 2020. This was agreed to by all participating nations in the United Nations Brasilia Declaration, of which India was a signatory. Though the number of deaths due to accidents declined to 1.20 lakh in 2020 due to COVID-19, Mr. Gadkari shifted the deadline to 2025. But the steep hike in the fines imposed for traffic violations in the Act was met with stiff opposition, with some States dismissing it as too harsh and, hence, not willing to implement it. What seems to have been ignored while drafting the law was the fact that a good number of those driving vehicles to earn their livelihood were from economically poor backgrounds. West Bengal decided not to implement the new law and continued with the West Bengal Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989. The Madras High Court recently struck down the April 6, 2018 notification of the Union Government wherein the speed limit was hiked to 120 and 100 km/hour on expressways and highways, respectively. This was done as 66.7% of accidents was attributed to overspeeding in 2017, 55.73% in 2018 and 64.4% in 2019. Studies carried out by various organisations have also come out with the causes for accidents and ways to curb them. The Accident Research Cell of the Delhi Traffic Police carried out an analysis of accidents and created a database that facilitates the formulation of policies to prevent accidents. While probing an accident that led to the death of former Union Rural Development Minister Gopinath Munde in New Delhi, the cell concluded that hedges along a road obstructed the visibility of drivers coming from the other direction. After the hedges were pruned, the stretch became free from accidents. While the strict enforcement of traffic safety laws would go a long way, educating citizens about the impact of accidents on the kin of the victims through public discourse could help in reducing accidents. Improving road infrastructure with coordinated efforts by the police and civic authorities, identification of black spots that are prone to accidents and deploying an adequate number of police personnel, particularly during peak hours, could bring down accident rates. Highway patrols with police personnel trained in first aid and ambulances every 10 km could also help save precious lives. M.P.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Recognising altruism||The initiative of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to award Good Samaritans who save lives of road accident victims with a cash prize is a welcome attempt to reduce India’s staggering annual death toll from mishaps. Ranking third among 20 nations that have the highest number of accidents, India fares far worse on an important metric — cases to fatalities ratio — compared to the U.S. and Japan, which have more recorded crashes but fewer deaths. During 2020, even with severely disrupted mobility due to COVID-19, National Crime Records Bureau data show 1,33,715 lives were lost in 1,20,716 cases attributed to negligence relating to road accidents. Under the Motor Vehicles law, a Good Samaritan voluntarily helps an accident victim with no expectation of payment or reward, and has no legal obligation to record his involvement or aid the investigation in the case. In spite of an entire chapter being added to the Motor Vehicles Act last year to sensitise police forces and hospitals on this, altruism is affected by the perception of harassment and legal complications. The Ministry’s latest move seeks to overcome reticence by rewarding socially minded individuals who offer immediate assistance and rush a victim with certain kinds of injuries to hospital, with Rs. 5,000 and a certificate of recognition for saving a life. State governments are responsible for the plan, with the Centre providing an initial grant, but the Union Transport Ministry will give its own award of Rs. 1 lakh each to the 10 best Good Samaritans in a year. Achieving a reduction in mortality on India’s largely lawless roads warrants determined action on several factors, beginning with scientific road design and standards, and zero tolerance enforcement. It was only on September 3 that the Centre notified the long-pending National Road Safety Board, with a mandate to formulate standards on, among other things, safety and trauma management, to build capacity among traffic police, and put crash investigation on a scientific footing. Yet, on enforcement, State police forces generally appear to favour a populist approach of least engagement; regional transport bureaucracies — compared by Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari in 2015 to looting Chambal dacoits — can also benefit from a shake-up. As a steadily motorising country, the goal must be to reduce accidents and the ratio of deaths and injuries to cases. The Good Samaritan plan can work well if District Committees tasked with awarding these individuals readily recognise their contribution, aided by the police, hospitals and RTOs. Many more people will continue to be impelled by sheer altruism to help road users involved in a crash, and governments should get bureaucratic barriers out of their way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/recognising-altruism/article36869796.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Sensing heat||This year’s Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine — awarded to the researchers, David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian from the University of California, San Francisco and Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, respectively — recognises their seminal work in identifying the gene and understanding the mechanism through which our body perceives temperature and pressure. Our ability to sense touch and temperature — particularly noxious temperature — is essential for our survival and determines how we interact with our internal and external environment; chronic pain results when the pain response goes awry. Dr. Julius utilised capsaicin, a key ingredient in hot chilli peppers that induces a burning sensation, to identify a sensor in the nerve endings of the skin and the cellular mechanism that responds to uncomfortably hot temperatures. The receptor for heat gets activated only above 40° C, which is close to the psychophysical threshold for thermal pain, thus allowing us to react to external heat. In 2002, five years after the heat sensor was discovered, the two laureates, and independently, used menthol to discover the receptor that senses cold temperatures. Recent studies have found that discrimination between warm and cool temperatures is possible only through simultaneous activation of warmth-sensing nerve fibres and inhibition of cold-sensing nerve fibres. Using pressure-sensitive cells, Dr. Patapoutian discovered a novel class of mechanical sensors that responds to pressure on the skin and internal organs, and the perception of touch and proprioception — the ability to feel the position and movement of our body parts. The cellular mechanism that senses touch also regulates important physiological processes. Besides laboratory work, insights have been gained by studying people carrying genetic mutations in the cellular mechanism of temperature, pain, touch and pressure sensation. The discovery of pain receptors and the cellular mechanism have attracted pharmaceutical companies as these could be targets for novel medicines. Though there are challenges to be addressed before such drugs can be clinically meaningful, the hope is that newer approaches may one day bypass the hurdles. Further research will help in understanding the functions of the receptors in a “variety of physiological processes and to develop treatments for a wide range of disease conditions”. This year’s Prize once again underscores the great contributions refugees fleeing war-torn countries can make to science and other fields. Dr. Patapoutian, who is of Armenian origin, grew up in Lebanon during the country’s prolonged civil war and fled to the U.S. in 1986 as an 18-year-old. From being blissfully unaware about science as a career in Lebanon, he not only “fell in love doing basic research”, but has also excelled in it to produce path-breaking discoveries in medicine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sensing-heat/article36869797.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Disturbed Malabar||The trouble at Codacal on Sunday night happened in this wise. The alleged offence of the Christian population seems to be that they helped the authorities in apprehending some rebels a fortnight previous and as reprisal, Sunday’s attack appears to have been planned. At midnight, armed Moplahs were seen near Edacoam railway gate, and approaching the petty bazar close by, shouted for a Christian tailor named Polycarp who they suspected had betrayed them to authorities. Local friendly Moplahs warned Polycarp who slipped away. The loyal Moplahs were caught and threatened that unless Polycarp was found, they would be killed. The gang marched to set fire on the Village Mausif who was absent from home. The Tea Factory was the next scene of attack. They surrounded Sukumaran’s tea shop where Jacob and Isac were sleeping. The rebels clubbed them severely. Yesumatran, schoolmaster and father of five children, was then murdered in cold blood. The whole colony became frightened and took shelter in the fields. Before the factory could be attacked, a siren blew loudly. The rioters thought that military would come from Tirur and so bolted away.

Khadilkar, Union Minister for Labour and Rehabilitation, told newsmen here to-day. He did not explain the action the Government was contemplating. Mr. Khadilkar gave a grim picture of the refugee influx. He said that India must be prepared for a steep increase in the refugee influx from Bangla Desh from the present level of 91.46 lakh to over 1.2 crore as a result of the mounting guerilla activity of the Mukti Bahini and the consequent intensified repression from the West Pakistani army. Refugees were now coming to India at the rate of 41,000 per day. India had already spent Rs.120 crore on the refugees and would have to spend Rs.450 crore by the end of the year and Rs.600 crore by the end of March, 1972, assuming that the number of refugees would not exceed 10 million. Mr. Khadilkar called upon the international community to realise its responsibility and come forward with more generous aid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/refugee-crisis/article36869809.ece
07 October 2021||COIMBATORE / DELHI,||Cabinet clears Rs. 4,445-cr. textile parks||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the setting up of seven Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks at an outlay of Rs. 4,445 crore. The mega parks scheme will include brownfield and greenfield projects, spread over five years, said Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal. The parks would be developed by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owned by the Central and State governments and would get two kinds of support. Development Capital Support, aimed at helping develop infrastructure, would fund 30% of the project cost with a cap of Rs. 500 crore for greenfield projects and Rs. 200 crore for brownfield projects. A separate Competitiveness Incentive Support would be limited to Rs. 300 crore per park. ‘TN, Gujarat interested’ As many as 10 States including Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Gujarat had already shown interest, Textiles Secretary Upendra Prasad Singh told The Hindu. States offering the cheapest land (contiguous and encumbrance-free land of minimum 1,000 acres) and facilities such as adequate electricity and water would be selected through a transparent challenge route. The SPV would select a Master Developer to set up and maintain the park for a specified period. Of the park’s area, 50% would be earmarked for manufacturing activity, 20% for utilities, and 10% set aside for commercial development. The parks are expected to generate 7 lakh direct jobs and provide indirect jobs to almost 14 lakh people. Mr. Singh said industries in the parks would comprise four categories — units investing Rs. 300 crore or more, units investing Rs. 100-300 crore, investors of less than Rs. 100 crore and tenant units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cabinet-clears-rs-4445-cr-textile-parks/article36869788.ece
07 October 2021||mumbai,||Domestic air-passenger traffic rises 2-3% in Sept. from August, says Icra||India’s domestic air-passenger traffic grew marginally by 2-3% to about 69 lakh in September as compared with about 67 lakh in August, credit rating agency Icra said on Wednesday.  When compared year-on-year (Y-o-Y), air-passenger traffic growth stood at about 74% in the month under review over September 2020. Airlines witnessed about 61,100 departures in September as compared with 39,628 in the same month of 2020, it said, adding that on a sequential basis, the number of departures in the month gone by were higher by about 6%, as COVID-19 infections demonstrated a downward trajectory.  The average number of passengers per flight during September was 113, against an average of 117 passengers per flight in August. Icra said that aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices have seen a sharp increase of 78.6% on a Y-o-Y basis till October 2021, this coupled with low capacity utilisation of aircraft fleet will continue to weigh on financial performance of Indian carriers in FY22. Furthermore, the credit profile of most Indian carriers continues to be characterised by a weak liquidity position, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/domestic-air-passenger-traffic-rises-2-3-in-sept-from-august-says-icra/article36869791.ece
07 October 2021||HYDERABAD,||3F Oil Palm to invest Rs. 1,750 cr. in 2 NE States||Integrated oil palm development firm 3F Oil Palm plans to invest Rs. 1,750 crore in oil palm cultivation in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Outlining expansion plans for the North East in the backdrop of the Centre announcing National Mission on Edible Oils — Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), it said cultivated area in Arunachal Pradesh would rise from 2,000 hectares to 32,000 hectares over five years.

07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||FM downplays risks from Evergrande, Fed moves||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman downplayed fears of global contagion from China’s Evergrande crisis and said the central bank and the government were keeping a close watch to cope with any ‘taper tantrum’ risks arising from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s likely shift in policy stance. Without naming China, she also red-flagged a growing trend of smaller countries being driven into a debt trap that threatened their sovereignty. “I am sure there will be, not specific to one country, but there will be this larger issue of debt sustainability, sovereignty and how smaller countries are facing a very trying and challenging situation when these two extremes are forced upon them,” she said at the opening session at ICRIER’s annual G20 conference. Stressing that India and the world had learnt lessons from the 2008 global financial crisis, Ms. Sitharaman said she wasn’t sure if the Evergrande crisis would figure in the upcoming G20 summit. “But without specifically referring to the G20 or any one particular country, it can be seen that globally, the sense of worry may be there but the fear that this is certainly going to hit us, is not there,” she said in reply to a query from NITI Aayog vice chairperson Rajiv Kumar on China’s real estate sector’s challenges spilling over to global markets. ‘Debt trap’ “Specifically, not Evergrande, but debt sustainability is an issue. Which I am sure every global forum will have to address and talk about; particularly, debts which are being given, which also bring the sovereignty of a nation into the picture and threatens that; then it is a matter of serious concern and many of the countries are sitting up to say: What is happening around in the world?” Ms. Sitharaman remarked. Emphasising that India had learnt its lessons from the way it handled the last taper tantrum which made it one of the ‘fragile five’ economies, she said: “Together with the Reserve Bank of India, we are definitely keeping a watch.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fm-downplays-risks-from-evergrande-fed-moves/article36869785.ece

The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also made a case for promoting digital and paperless trade procedures by the Asian nations in view of the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Countries should refrain from using export restrictions and other non-tariff measures,” they said in the biennial report. If countries quickened implementation of digital trade schemes, average trade costs could drop by more than 13%, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/asian-nations-asked-to-eschew-trade-barriers/article36869789.ece

07 October 2021||Male,||India looks for first win of tournament||After the disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Bangladesh, India will need to quickly get its act together when it takes on Sri Lanka in its second SAFF Championship football match here on Thursday. India will look game to register its first win in the tournament, which it won a record seven times. Head coach Igor Stimac has come under fire for India’s failure to win enough matches in the recent past and he will be under the pump on Thursday. Fancy it chances India should fancy its chances against the lower ranked Sri Lankans, who have struggled throughout the competition, losing both of their games so far. The islanders will have their task cut out if they are to move up from the bottom of the points table. Skipper Sunil Chhetri will again look to score and add to his tally. Chhetri is just one goal shy of the iconic Pele in terms of international goals scored and a struggling Sri Lanka will be a great opportunity for him. After the disappointment against plucky Bangladesh, Stimac said, “we are ourselves guilty for not winning the match. “We had everything in control, we dominated the game, and had a one-nil advantage, and even had a one-man advantage. “But despite all of that, for some unknown reasons, we started giving away simple passes, making unnecessary mistakes. And if you boost the confidence of your opponent, that’s how it finishes when you give them a chance,” Stimac said. Last opportunity  The chief coach is using the tournament as the last opportunity for the players to play international matches before the start of the third round of 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers in February next year.  The squad: Dheeraj Singh, Vishal Kaith, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Pritam Kotal, Chinglensana Singh Konsham, Mandar Rao Dessai, Rahul Bheke, Subhasish Bose, Seriton Fernandes, Udanta Singh, Brandon Fernandes, Lalengmawia, Anirudh Thapa, Sahal Abdul Samad, Jeakson Singh, Glan Martins, Suresh Singh, Liston Colaco, Yasir Mohammad, Manvir Singh, Rahim Ali, Sunil Chhetri, Farukh Choudhary.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Bhuvneshwar dents RCB’s quest for second spot, gives SRH third win||Royal Challengers Bangalore’s quest for second spot all but ended with a four-run defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Chasing 142, RCB needed 13 from the final over with AB de Villiers still at the crease. But Bhuvneshwar Kumar, despite being hit for a six off the fourth ball by the South African, held his nerve to lead SRH to only its third win of the campaign. Only a crushing defeat for CSK against PBKS and a thumping win for RCB over DC can take Virat Kohli’s side to the second spot. RCB lost Kohli early, out leg-before while trying to hit Bhuvneshwar across the line. Dan Christian and K.S. Bharat fell cheaply too. But Maxwell took charge, with Devdutt Padikkal (41, 52b, 4x4), playing second fiddle. Maxwell hit Rashid Khan out of the attack with two sixes over deep mid-wicket and long-on and a swept four as he raced to 29 off 15 balls. But an off-balance Kane Williamson brilliantly ran the Aussie out with a direct hit from in front of cover to turn the match on its head. Padikkal couldn’t shift gears and even the best efforts of Shahbaz Ahmed — two fours off Umran Malik in the 18th over — couldn’t save the day. Earlier, after being asked to bat first, Jason Roy top-scored for SRH with 44 (38b, 5x4), with the only bit of support coming from skipper Williamson (31, 29b, 4x4). The partnership was worth 70 runs for the second wicket. Williamson was all class, hitting beautifully through the cover region, a boundary each off Mohammed Siraj and George Garton catching the eye. Roy, shaky initially, found some rhythm with a couple of hits to the fence off Shahbaz and Harshal Patel. But from 50 for one after six overs, SRH added just 31 from overs seven to 11. In the 12th, Harshal got the prized wicket of Williamson, rearranging the Kiwi’s stumps with an off-cutter. Roy chugged along but didn’t threaten to go big. Priyam Garg tried, lofting Chahal for a six, but perished to Christian. The Aussie then caught and bowled Roy before Chahal trapped Abdul Samad in front. From 105 for two, SRH was reduced to 105 for five, with Christian (3-0-14-2) and Harshal (4-0-33-3) doing the damage. But it was Williamson and Co. which had the last laugh.   RCB 98 for four  RCB was 98 for four in 15 overs with Padikkal (36) and de Villiers (1) batting.

07 October 2021||Oslo,||Sarita waltzes into the semis||Sarita Mor shocked defending champion Linda Morais en route to the semifinals while Anshu Malik too advanced to the last-four stage of the wrestling World Championship here on Wednesday. Sarita, the reigning Asian champion, had a tough opening bout against the 2019 World Champion from Canada but came out trumps with a tactical 8-2 win in the 59kg pre-quarterfinals. Quick take-down A quick take-down move, followed by an expose together with some superb defence put Sarita 7-0 ahead by the time first period was over.  Later, the quarterfinal against Germany’s Sandra Paruszewski turned out to be a tougher bout, in which the two wrestlers were largely restricted to a standing fight which took a lot out of them. There was only one point-scoring move, a take down effected by Sarita late in the match and that sealed the outcome. Hardly troubled  In the 57kg, young Anshu lived up to the expectations with confident victories. She was hardly troubled by Kazakhstan’s Nilufar Raimova, whom she beat by technical superiority and later outwitted Mongolia’s Davaachimeg Erkhembayar 5-1 in the quarterfinals.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘We want to win the series at any cost’||The momentum is with the women in blue. They won the final ODI against an Australian side that hadn’t tasted defeat in three years, and then held the upper hand right through the Day/Night Test. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur is confident India could win the T20I series, which begins at Carrara on Thursday. “We got the momentum in the ODI series and we hope to take that into the T20I series,” Harmanpreet said at a virtual press conference. “If we could win all the three matches, we could also win the multi-format series. So we will go all out... we want to win the series at any cost.” She feels that such multi-format series benefit the players. “It is a good initiative by the ICC, BCCI and other boards,” she said. “We could get to play ODIs, T20Is and Tests in the same series.” She could not be part of India’s historic Day-Night Test against Australia because of a thumb injury. “It was very disappointing that I had to miss the Test,” she said. “If there had been more days between the ODIs and Tests, I would have been able to play.” She admitted it was tough battling injuries one after another of late, not to mention the problems caused by the pandemic. “I am much better now and am confident about my batting after the sessions at the nets too,” she said. “I can also field well now, which wasn’t the case earlier.” The captain hopes the top-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues will be able to carry her great form from The Hundred, in which she was the second-leading scorer and had a strike-rate of 150.90. “She played really good cricket in The Hundred,” Harmanpreet said. “She played her role perfectly for her side (Northern Superchargers). We hope she does it here too.”  The teams (from):   India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Sneh Rana, Yastika Bhatia, Shikha Pandey, Meghna Singh, Pooja Vastrakar, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Poonam Yadav, Richa Ghosh, Harleen Deol, Arundhati Reddy, Radha Yadav, and Renuka Singh.

Some guests and media were invited to Berlin’s Olympiastadion for the UEFA launch, though no fans were present on a damp evening in the German capital on Tuesday. The logo features an outline of the Henri Delaunay Cup — the bulbous tournament trophy — set on a coloured oval outline that resembles the Olympiastadion’s roof. It features colours from the flags of UEFA’s 55 member nations, set in 24 slices around the trophy to represent the 24 teams that will ultimately qualify for the tournament in Germany. Diversity celebrated  Organisers said the brand will promote a tournament where diversity is celebrated, and everyone should feel welcome. The tournament’s slogan “United by Football. Vereint im Herzen Europas” — or “United at the Heart of Europe” — is meant to convey a message of togetherness and inclusion. Logos for each of the 10 host cities — Berlin, Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart — were also presented. “From now on, the tournament has a brand identity which reflects the ambition we have together with the host association and host cities,” UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/germany-unveils-euro-2024-logo/article36870286.ece
07 October 2021||Dubai,||Jaskaran among ICC nominees for POTM||Indian-born American Jaskaran Malhotra, who became only the fourth player to hit six sixes in an over in an international match, was on Wednesday named among three nominees for the ICC Men’s Player of the Month for September. The other two men’s nominees were Bangladesh spinner Nasum Ahmed and Nepal’s leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane. England captain Heather Knight, her compatriot Charlie Dean and South Africa’s Lizelle Lee were nominated for the ICC Women’s Player of the Month. The 31-year-old Malhotra, who was born in Chandigarh and captained Himachal Pradesh at U-19 level, smashed six sixes in an over against Papua New Guinea in a World Cup League 2 fixture in Oman on September 9 during a scintillating knock of 173 not out. Nasum Ahmed was Bangladesh’s star performer in its home T20I series against New Zealand, leaving the visitors bamboozled with his accurate line and length.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jaskaran-among-icc-nominees/article36870116.ece
07 October 2021||Sao Paulo,||Brazil, Argentina will hope for no interruptions||Brazil and Argentina will be hoping to avoid any more interruptions when World Cup qualifying resumes on Thursday across South America. The game between the two rivals in Sao Paulo last month was suspended shortly after kickoff after a Brazilian health official entered the pitch to remove four Argentina players he considered should be in quarantine due to COVID-19 protocols. Both teams then earned victories in their second game of that international window to remain on course for a place in Qatar. And similar scenes should be avoided when Brazil, which tops the qualifying standings, visits last-place Venezuela and second-place Argentina travels to Asuncion to face Paraguay. This time, England-based players have been allowed to travel to South America despite Britain’s strict COVID-19 restrictions. Premier League players will have to show they have been fully vaccinated to avoid a 10-day quarantine after they return to their clubs. Also on Thursday, third-place Uruguay will host Colombia. Ecuador, in fourth place, will play Bolivia and Peru hosts Chile. Brazil has 24 points and Argentina has 18 from eight matches. Uruguay (15), Ecuador (13) and Colombia (13) follow, but they’ve all played nine matches. The top four teams secure a spot at next year’s World Cup in Qatar. The fifth-place team will enter a playoff against a team from a different confederation. A win in Venezuela would put Brazil on the verge of qualifying for Qatar, but coach Tite might be without a key starter. Midfielder Casemiro is out with an injury, with Liverpool’s Fabinho seen as his likely replacement. Fabinho is one of several England-based players, including goalkeeper Ederson, defender Thiago Silva and striker Gabriel Jesus, who couldn’t play in the previous international window. Jesus, who hasn’t played for Brazil since the Copa America quarterfinals, was widely criticised at home after the last World Cup in Russia, when he failed to score a single goal. Well-organised Paraguay’s well-organised and defensive team has often given Lionel Messi’s Argentina side a difficult time. Argentina managed to beat Paraguay 1-0 at the Copa America, but their previous four meetings resulted in three draws and a win for Paraguay. Expect another tough game for Argentina on Thursday, with Paraguay coach Eduardo Berizzo — an Argentine — having already said he will use a back five to stop Messi and his teammates. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni is sticking with much of the squad that won the Copa America in July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/key-fixtures-for-brazil-argentina/article36870119.ece
07 October 2021||Barcelona,||Spanish NBA great Pau Gasol bids adieu||Wishing his “older brother” Kobe Bryant could be there by his side, Pau Gasol finally put an end to a basketball career that went “way beyond my dreams and expectations.” Gasol announced his retirement from basketball on Tuesday after a career that lasted more than two decades and earned him two NBA titles and a world championship gold with Spain’s national team. Gasol had already announced his farewell from international basketball in August after Spain lost to the United States in the quarterfinals of the Tokyo Games, which marked his fifth Olympics. Gasol had been with Spanish club Barcelona since February. His career had stalled before that because a left-foot injury that lingered and kept him from playing for nearly two years. Gasol won two NBA titles with the Lakers, in 2009 and 2010, and averaged 17 points and 9.2 rebounds in 1,226 regular-season games with five NBA teams, playing as a centre and power forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/spanish-nba-great-pau-gasol-bids-adieu/article36870121.ece
07 October 2021||NEW DELHI,||Khalin Joshi takes two-stroke lead||Khalin Joshi fired four birdies during his flawless back-nine 32 and moved two shots ahead of the field at the halfway stage of the Rs. 70-lakh TATA Steel PGTI MP Cup golf tournament here on Wednesday. In perfect conditions at the Delhi Golf Club Course, Khalin overtook four overnight leaders with a round of six-under 66 to go with this first-round 69 for a tally of 9-under 135. S. Chikkarangappa and Manu Gandas, two of the overnight leaders, along with Veer Ahlawat and N. Thangaraja, shared the second spot at 137. The ‘cut’ came at two-over 146 and kept 53 players in the hunt over the final two rounds. There was plenty of action during the closing holes. Khalin stayed in control to birdie three out of the last five holes, including the final one. Thangaraja also signed off with a birdie but Manu double-bogeyed to fall back. Veer Ahlawat, with a day’s best bogey-free 65, more than made up for his par round on the first day. Chikkrangappa, too, fired seven birdies but a bogey on the 13th hole and a double-bogey on the second hole slowed him down. Viraj Madappa, who shot eight birdies, double-bogeyed the 18th for the tied sixth place with Kartik Sharma at 138. Among the more illustrious names, one of the overnight leaders Rashid Khan (67, 73) and Shiv Kapur (74, 67) shared the 12th and 15th spots while S.S.P. Chowrasia (73, 72) was tied 34th. Jyoti Randhawa and Ashok Kumar withdrew while Olympian Udayan Mane (75, 79) missed the cut.  The scores: 135 - Khalin Joshi (69, 66); 137 - S.

07 October 2021||JAMSHEDPUR,||Abhishek and Jyothi triumph||In an unprecedented finish to the compound competitions, Abhishek Verma and V. Jyothi Surekha shot perfect scores of 150 in their respective gold medal matches to emerge as the men’s and women’s champions respectively at the 40th NTPC National archery championships here on Wednesday. It was a commendable show from both the archers — who bagged a mixed team silver in the World championships in Yankton, USA, recently — as they overcame fatigue to give their best. It was Jyothi’s first 150 at the Nationals, while it was Abhishek’s first on a podium setting at the domestic level. Jyothi scored 15 consecutive 10s to record a 150-146 win over Muskan Kirar in the women’s final. Jyothi maintained her composure to hit the yellow zone consistently. “It was tough. I was not able to sleep after coming from the USA. Still, I wanted to do well,” said Jyothi. Muskan had equalled Mexican Linda Ochoa-Anderson’s women’s World record of hitting 11Xs, including her last nine shots, while scoring 150 in her semifinal match against Raginee Marko. Abhishek handled the pressure well to post a 150-141 win over youngster Mohit in the men’s summit clash.  The results: Compound: Men: Final: Abhishek Verma (Del) bt Mohit (Har) 150-141; Third place: Aman Saini (Del) bt Mohan Bhardwaj (SSCB) 145-143.   Women: Final: V. Jyothi Surekha (PSPB) bt Muskan Kirar (MP) 150-141; Third place: Raginee Marko (MP) bt Pragati (Del) 147-147 (Shoot-off: 10-9).

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Super Kings will look to arrest the slump||Winning is a lot about momentum. Particularly while entering the climactic phase of a high stakes competition. After a stupendous run that saw it become the first team to qualify for the playoff, Chennai Super Kings (18 points from 13 matches) has suffered a slump of sorts, going down in its last two games. Under the circumstances, M.S. Dhoni and his men will attempt to arrest the slump and get back on the highway to glory against Punjab Kings in its last game in Dubai on Thursday. Punjab Kings (10 from 13) is a team that has discovered ways to lose from winning situations. Set batters have been unable to stay on and finish the job; the side has been consumed by the pressures of the chase. Punjab Kings not just has to defeat CSK by a huge margin to get its run-rate above that of Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians, but also hope both these sides lose their last matches. Drakes for Curran CSK has named West Indies’ all-rounder Dominic Drakes as a replacement for all-rounder Sam Curran, ruled out with a lower-back injury. Drakes is a left-handed batsman and left-arm medium-pacer. Punjab Kings needs to get everything right in this clash. Anil Kumble’s men have shown some promise without getting all the pieces together. Young leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh and the hard-hitting Shahrukh Khan are all youngsters with talent. Much focus will be on the in-form openers of both teams — Ruturaj Gaikwad and Faf du Plessis and K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/super-kings-will-look-to-arrest-the-slump/article36870052.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Last chance for KKR to seal playoff berth||Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will look to take a step closer to a playoff berth when it faces Rajasthan Royals (RR) in Sharjah on Thursday. RR’s loss against Mumbai Indians on Tuesday means it is pretty much out of the race. The win against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) took KKR to 12 points and its net run rate to +0.294, the best among the teams eyeing the final playoff berth. A win against RR will likely to ensure it finishes fourth. However, if it loses, it will have to rely on SRH to beat Mumbai, in which case KKR should go through on NRR. The Shakib factor KKR has banked on all-round team effort. Against SRH, playing his first game of the second leg, Shakib Al Hasan made a mark, first by getting out Kane Williamson with a direct hit and then with figures of one for 20. Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy continue to maintain a stranglehold through the middle overs. In the UAE, KKR batters have hammered bowling attacks upfront. However, against SRH, Venkatesh Iyer and Rahul Tripathi were out early. KKR would hope that’s an aberration. On Wednesday, a social media post shared by KKR showed the injured duo of Andre Russell and Lockie Ferguson sweating it out in the nets. Should they return against the Royals, it will be a boost. Meanwhile, Rajasthan’s meek surrender against Mumbai was the exact opposite of its flashy win against Chennai. On a Sharjah wicket that played low and slow, some RR batters were guilty of playing across the line against length balls as it limped to 90 for nine, its third-lowest total in the IPL. Royals could consider playing an experienced Jaydev Unadkat in place of Kuldip Yadav.

07 October 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||KSVA to take legal measures to revoke the suspension imposed by KSSC||The office-bearers of the Kerala State Volleyball Association (KSVA) has said that the association will pursue legal measures to revoke the suspension imposed on it by the Kerala State Sports Council (KSSC). The KSSC on Oct. 1 had suspended the KSVA as per provision of the Kerala Sports Act 2008 after the Union Sports Ministry had disaffiliated the Volleyball Federation of India (VFI). However, the KSVA president Nalakath Basheer and secretary Charly Jacob, in a press conference here on Tuesday, alleged that the KSSC’s decision to suspend the association was done unilaterally as the body was still affiliated to VFI and Kerala Olympic Association (KOA). The KSVA office-bearers also questioned the proprietary of the Mercy Kuttan running her own private academy in Kochi while holding the post of KSSC president. They also alleged that the KSSC had sanctioned Rs. 60 lakh for the Mercy Kuttan Academy while many academies and sports hostels were still struggling for funds. It is a clear case of nepotism and conflict of interest, they alleged. The KSVA office-bearers said that the KSSC, since 2012, owes more than Rs. 29 lakh as grants to the association but has only released Rs. 4,79,095 so far. The KSVA was using the registration fees collected from the 649 registered clubs in the State to run its developmental programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ksva-to-take-legal-measures-to-revoke-the-suspension-imposed-by-kssc/article36870289.ece

Year 2021 has been memorable for Priya, who secured gold medals in cadet women’s and mixed team events and an individual silver in the World youth championships in Wroclaw, Poland, in August and a women’s team silver in the World championships in Yankton, USA, in September. “The World youth medals gave me a lot of confidence. I learned a few things in the World championships. It was windy and I did not understand when to release the arrows in such conditions. Still I got good scores. I have to work on this,” Priya told The Hindu on the sidelines of the National archery championships here on Wednesday. “I also want to shoot better scores in the ranking round,” said Priya, who was 10th with 687 points in the individual rankings and lost to eventual champion V. Jyothi Surekha in the quarterfinals at the Nationals. Priya has been looking up to Arjuna award-winner Rajat, a World championships silver medallist and an Asian Games team gold medallist, ever since she got into archery in late 2017. “My father was Rajat bhaiya’s teacher. He persuaded my father to put me in archery. I just follow his advice.” Focusing on my basics The Jaipur girl, who claimed a team silver on her elite National debut in the 2019 Asian championships, is keen to shine in the Asian Games. “I am focusing on my basics. I am capable of winning gold medals in bigger events. It is the mentality that matters,” said Priya.

Much of the attention in this weekend’s 19-race card would be on the two premier pro-stock open categories, the 301-400cc and 165cc, dominated by the pair of Chennai stars Rajini Krishnan (RACR Castrol Power Racing) and Jagan Kumar (TVS Racing), respectively, both having won three of the four races over two rounds so far.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Dharma protects||‘Dharmo rakshati rakshitah’, it is said. That means if we protect dharma, then dharma in turn protects us. There are rules we have to follow in life. It is like adhering to lane traffic on a highway. Violation of lane rules could lead to accidents. Yajnavalkya Smrti says that a slip from dharma leads to hardship. We have a dharma for each period in our lives. Our elders have laid down rules for us. It is beneficial to follow these rules, said Kidambi Narayanan, in a discourse. After all, they would have been witness to the results of non adherence to dharma, and would, therefore, have framed rules accordingly. So, it is best we follow what was codified on the basis of past observation and experience. As we climb the ladder of success, it is good to keep in mind that if we go against dharma, we could fall. The higher we go, the greater the injury, should we fall. Dharma falls into many categories — sadharana dharma which is common to all. Then there is visesha dharma. This is the dharma a person has to follow because of some high position that he holds. Sometimes it happens that one’s sadharana dharma might clash with visesha dharma. In such cases, visesha dharma takes precedence over sadharana dharma. But how do we know what is dharma, and what we have to follow? The god of dharma was born as Yudhishthira, but even Yudhishthira had questions about dharma. To answer these questions, Krishna tells him to go to Bhishma. Bhishma is on his bed of arrows, awaiting death. Although Bhishma was a man with great moral courage and determination, unfortunately, in his old age he had to stand on the side of adharma.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Straight from the heart||Sivakarthikeyan is not weighed down by the load of the brand he has built over a period of nine years as an entertainer. It is another thing that he doesn’t see it as a ‘burden’, even if it is a staple of mindless entertainers with which he is often associated, despite notable exceptions. He gives a rather practical and measured response to the question of being stuck to the Sivakarthikeyan template. “If I am able to produce Doctor in a budget that was required, and also be part of films such as Hero , it is only because of the success and money those entertainers have made. Before Hero , I don’t think I would have made such an attempt but after its release, I decided to make sure those attempts don’t go in vain,” says Sivakarthikeyan over a steamy cup of hot chocolate, when we meet at a cafe in the city. Siva 2.0, if we were to call him that, is walking a tightrope to balance between regular entertainers and films that make a fresh attempt at storytelling or treatment. One such attempt was Hero (2019), which, Siva says, was his “lowest” in terms of box-office figures. During lockdowns, Siva took some time off to access his choices and look at his films with an objective lens. With respect to Hero , Siva feels it became an info-tainment missing out on the entertainment value, even though critics gave it a thumbs-up. A caped-crusader fighting for a cause, his character’s elevation point was delayed; it should have arrived at the interval point, he says. “It [ Hero ] was a lesson in how to present a subject for the audience in an entertaining way. Let us take Gentleman , which also dealt with a similar idea. But where both films differ is in the entertainment quotient.” Out of the comfort zone  Doctor , too, is a fresh attempt at presenting Siva in a new light. This time, however, he is working with someone all-too familiar: director Nelson Dilipkumar, a long-time friend with whom he has worked in television, and assisted in Simbu-starrer Vettai Mannan , a gangster film with dark humour which was eventually shelved. Nelson became a talent to watch out for, in Tamil cinema, post his directorial debut, Kolamaavu Kokila , which was a box-office hit. But Siva was not too surprised about the reception for Kolamaavu… , having known Nelson and his comedic sensibilities. What did surprise Siva, however, when he was handed over the script of Doctor was Nelson’s “meticulous” work. “I felt the script was a little quirky,” he says, “He [Nelson] is taking me out of my comfort zone, but also retaining certain elements for the hero image. None of which was demanded by me or Anirudh [composer].” Life seems to have come full circle for Siva on the professional front, having produced Doctor for Nelson and starred in it. By his own admission, Doctor ventures into dark zone and has Siva playing a character employed in the business of organ and human trafficking — at least going by the impression of its trailer. He offhandedly mentions the film being his first with a U/A certificate. Siva is tight-lipped about whether he plays an anti-hero, but admits that he would never essay an all-too negative character. “More than a question of whether it would suit my image, it is a question of whether I would be comfortable doing it. I don’t think I am comfortable getting into the mind of such characters,” he says. Aiming for the stars Sivakarthikeyan has produced Doctor on a first-copy basis for KJR Studios, which is distributing the film in Tamil and Telugu. There were whispers that the makers were exploring the possibility of a digital release, skipping theatre, at the height of the second wave. However, Siva says he was insistent on a theatrical release. Would the film have worked on OTT anyway? “It would have,” he continues, “But when you are laughing for a comedy, you laugh with 100 others inside a theatre. That would have been a miss.” Every year, on February 3, Sivakarthikeyan gets nostalgic and overwhelmed at the same time, looking at his career from afar. It was the date Marina (2012), his first on-screen appearance, released, and next year, Siva will complete 10 years in the industry. “Although two years vanished like naduvula konjam pakkatha kannom ,” he laughs. Watching himself on the screen for the first time is among his most memorable moments; each time he thinks about it, he pauses to introspect what he has done so far. “It has been a roller-coaster ride to be honest,” he says, “Although I will be completing 10 years, it feels like I have only started my innings — internally and mentally.” There was a point, Siva says, he took his critics too seriously, something he realised only recently. He does, however, make it a point to read everything written about him but — “I have made sure I don’t bluntly follow what they say, unless it is extremely constructive.” Doctor releases on Friday   in theatres.   InDoctor, Nelson has taken me out of my comfort zone, but has retained certain elements for the hero image. None of which was demanded by me.   Lockdown memoir Sivakarthikeyan became a father for the second time to a baby boy, Gugan Doss; he says the lockdown gave him time to think about his plan for the next few years. Months into the gloom and doom of the first set of lockdowns, Siva and composer Anirudh Ravichander felt a need for a chirpy song that would put a smile on people’s faces. That is how, Siva says, the song ‘Chellama Chellama’, which has crossed over 130 million views on YouTube, came about. “Only after deciding the song did we [Anirudh and I] inform the director [Nelson]. And he simply asked where the song would be placed in the film,” he says with a laugh. Siva isn’t too keen on remakes. He expresses disinterest when posed with a question of whether he would be part of a remake, although he admits that he has been approached a lot for remakes including a Tamil version of Telugu blockbuster Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo . “First of all, who can even dance like [Allu Arjun]? And secondly, how do we even match the popularity of ‘Butta Bomma’ song? So, let us not even go there [remake].”   A hungry beast A self-professed fan of Vijay, Nelson has landed the opportunity to direct the actor in his third directorial, Beast . When the announcement for Beast came out, Siva posted a tweet tagging Nelson that read: “My brother with big dreams joining big names.” About Nelson’s career progression, Siva says, “He spent a really long time on a project that didn’t take off. It has been a wait of 10 years and his patience is now getting paid off.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/straight-from-the-heart/article36870507.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Sambol for the soul||Darshini Thangarasa boards the bus with practised ease, balancing a box heavy with dhodol in one hand and a large stainless steel container packed with freshly steamed, squiggly idiappams in the other. The young college graduate with an unfailingly bright smile is familiar with this journey from the Sri Lankan Tamil refugee camp in Gummidipoondi, to supply friends and well-wishers with her mother’s signature kalu dhodol , made by patiently stirring roasted, powdered red rice, jaggery and coconut milk for hours over a wood fire till it thickens into a luxuriously, sticky confection. Today, she is en route to the home of Poongkothai Chandrahasan, Sri Lankan filmmaker and founder of Serendip Boutique Social Enterprises, to help the team prepare for Yalpanam’s first official pop up kitchen. Explaining why they have spent the last month working on this project, Poongkothai says the focus is to empower women with a livelihood. “When you empower a woman, she uses that money to educate her child,” she says, adding “It is also a dignified way for them to earn their own living, which is especially important now, with the pandemic, as many of their husbands have lost their jobs.” With the help of OfERR (Organization for Eelam Refugees’ Rehabilitation), she says, “we identified women with cooking skills, who are also double vaccinated, from the Puzhal and Gummidipondi camps. Over the past couple of weeks we have been working with them, selecting what they make best.” Darshini’s mother’s dhodol for instance. “It needs at least three hours of constant stirring,” says Poongkothai. “In the camp, the ladies all stand in nighties and take turns standing over the wood fire,” she adds with a smile, as Darshini follows her into the kitchen, which is fragrant with the scent of a spicy, simmering fish curry. There are no nighties today — the women are resplendent in neatly pleated saris in shades of blue — but the cheery spirit of camaraderie has all the comforting familiarity of a family gathering. Reigning over the kitchen is 70-year-old Basilica Dias, stirring rice creamy with coconut milk, before sprinkling it with generous handfuls of cashew nuts crisp with ghee. “I came to India with two of my children, when I was 40 in 1990,” she says, adding that she lost her husband in the civil war. In the sudden move, her third child was left behind with an aunt in Jaffna, and they were only reunited many years later. “I used to be a nursery school teacher. When I came to the Puzhal camp, I began to take on small cooking jobs for birthdays and weddings. Whatever money I made, I used for my children’s education,” she adds. Siva Shantini, who cooks with Basilica, nods in agreement. She explains how they specialise in making spicy coconut sambol and rich coconut curries. “For the chicken curry today, we roasted and ground the spices ourselves, then brought the powder here,” she says, reeling off the ingredients, “chilli powder, fennel, pepper, lots of dry roasted curry leaves…” The menu this weekend includes two set meals (Rs. 999 each), one centred around red rice idiappams — served with stew, sambol and brinjal — while the other stars kaha bhat , or coconut rice. The women are also making fish and chicken curry. “Depending on the response, we hope to eventually run this as a cloud kitchen,” says Poongkothai, confessing that the project is still at an experimental stage with the small all-women team cooking, taking orders and packing the food together. She adds, “The dream is to hire women from more camps: if this is successful, we can set up small cloud kitchens serving Sri Lankan food all over Tamil Nadu.”  The pop up will function for lunch and dinner on Saturday and Sunday.

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Songs of the soil||Versatility has always been the name of the game for composer Amit Trivedi, who has brought musical styles from around the world to his work over the past decade, and is now looking towards Indian folk for inspiration. “We borrow so much from the musical styles of the West — hip hop and rap is especially popular right now, I have done that too, of course, for my films,” Amit has no qualms admitting, “But the folk power of our country is sitting unused. I thought let us explore our own music for a change.” Under his independent music label AT Azaad, the composer stars in a new show,Skoda Sonic Roots, for which he has travelled across the country connecting with talented voices from Gujarat, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. At each place he goes to, Amit immerses himself in the local traditions and stories, and at the end, shoots a music video, which will be available on YouTube. Celebrated folk singers including Nagesh Morwekar, Kirtidan Gadhvi, Goutam Das Baul, Kavita Seth, Rana Mazumder, Mame Khan, Bhanwari Devi and Chennai’s Anthony Daasan have worked with Amit on this show. After observing the Indian mooch (moustache) tradition in Jodhpur, he pays homage to Bengal’s Baul legacy, and moves to celebrating Maharashtrian pride rooted in the Bhagwa style of music. During the Chennai leg of his tour he meets Anthony Daasan to compose a love song titled ‘Meenaatchi’. But the song he starts out with — ‘Tedo Tedo’, is a Gujarati wedding song, and its video, an explosion of colour. “As a Gujarati, I have grown up listening to garba , dayro lok geet … That is what my mom would sing around the house, and my dad would play Hemant Chauhan (folk and bhajan singer from Rajkot).” Over the past year, Amit has been collaborating with indie musicians to bring out ‘songs of love’, ‘songs of faith’, ‘songs of dance’ and now ‘songs of the soil’. “I am hoping we get to bring out a season 2 where we can showcase music from the North and Northeast,” says Amit. The songs composed for the show were on one hand, rooted in folk patterns, but also have Amit’s signature sound. “You need to have an understanding of that genre of course, study the beat patterns, the instrumentation that goes with it. I wanted to be authentic to the style and then experiment in and around that to add my touch,” he says, adding, “I’m mainly there to have fun, whatever be the style.” Skoda Sonic Roots will stream on Voot||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/songs-of-the-soil/article36869942.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||An offbeat tune||One of the first song briefs that director Karthik Swaminathan gave composer Revaa for the Vijay Sethupathi-starrer Mugizh , which releases this Friday, was about a family that bonds with a puppy. Revaa composed a three-minute song that the team was happy with. However, when they went to shoot, there was a problem: the reactions that Scooby, the role played by the pup, just did not sit with the song. This put both Karthik and Revaa in a tight spot, and they decided to do something unconventional: shoot the entire song, and then compose the tune. “Going through the lengthy footage, I sat down and composed depending on the graph that the puppy follows in the film,” recalls Revaa, seated comfortably at her uncle Ramanathan’s Nadabindu Recording Studio at KK Nagar. The song she is referring to is ‘Mayakaara’.  Mugizh marks Revaa’s (Revathi Viswanathan) entry into Tamil cinema. She has earlier worked on Malayalam film Mangalyam Thanthunaena , Marathi film College Diary besides composing for pilot films and more than 200 ad jingles. This film came about after working with director Karthik Swaminathan on a documentary and short film Idaivelai . “We (Karthik and I) have a great working relationship. The story of Mugizh is all about a family’s discoveries about each other; in fact, Mugizh refers to one of the nine stages in the blooming of a flower, during which it gets fragrance.” The runtime of Mugizh is a little more than an hour, which is longer than a short film but less than a feature. “It is all about storytelling, at the end of the day. When I do a jingle, I have to convey the essence musically within a short time. It is a planned execution of music, because it has to be catchy. But films, for me, revolve around emotions; I concentrate on enriching the visuals, and not on what is trending,” she adds. Revaa hails from a Palakkad-based family steeped in music; her grandfather is popular mridangam artiste, Palakkad R Seshamani. Her parents, PV Viswanathan and PS Saradambal, recognised her love for music and enrolled her into violin and vocal classes. Though music was always in the background, Revaa ventured into Fashion Technology: she graduated from Chennai’s National Institute of Fashion Technology and worked in the garments business for a few years, before returning to her first love: music. She believes that the effort put into Mugizh will help her cause. Two of the songs in film are sung by Govind Vasantha and Pradeep Kumar, who are composers themselves. “A lot of people told me that the route is to establish myself as a singer, and then get into composing. But I wanted to break that; it is composing tunes that gives me immense happiness.” That she has to do this in a mostly all-male environment does not bother her too much. “I am thankful to my family. Composing is a lot about tapping the requirements of the director, and executing it. The process involves hours of discussions, corrections and follow-ups, which means late-night work as well. All these things make it challenging for a woman to break into the field.”  An ad jingle is a planned execution of music. But films, for me, revolve around emotions. I concentrate on enriching the visuals with the music, and not on what is trending Revaa, music composer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-offbeat-tune/article36869947.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A dash of colour||Cinematographer Ravi K Chandran has always wanted to direct films. However, his eye for good visuals and the influence of his older brother, the late cinematographer K Ramachandran Babu, changed the course of his career and got him working with some of the country’s biggest filmmakers. A few years ago, he got to direct Tamil film Yaan , but describes it as a ‘bitter experience’. A disappointed Ravi went back to cinematography. During that time, he watched Andhadun and was impressed by it. While speaking with its director, Sriram Raghavan, he learnt that the film was initially planned with a South Indian actor who could not commit dates for the project. He had even found a location in Kochi. With a producer, Ravi made a bid to acquire its remake rights, which took some time coming, and started directing it. The result is Bhramam , releasing on Amazon Prime Video this week. He intends to continue directing. “There are many stories that I want to tell. There are new platforms to show these films to people,” he says. This is an eventful way to make your first film...     (Laughs) Movies are always eventful. However experienced you are, things could go wrong. It is impossible to predict the filmmaking process. How did you get Prithviraj on board the project? When we met for another project, Andhadun came up in the conversation; Prithvi mentioned that he wanted the rights of the film. We decided to go ahead and got the script written by Sarath Balan. Then, the pandemic happened and Prithvi was abroad shooting Aadujeevitham . We almost forgot about the film (laughs) . When things opened in late 2020, we started filming. It was an ideal film to make during a pandemic as it involved just a few people on set. Have you stuck to the original or did you tweak the script?  We had to make changes; Prithvi’s build and body language is different from Ayushmann’s. Tabu played an older character in the original, while Mamta in this version is much younger. The original had a bland palette, so we wanted to introduce some colour into it. I have also been watching a lot of Malayalam films and I find that many restrict themselves to murder mysteries and dark themes. I wanted Bhramam to have a lot of colour, like Pedro Almodovar’s films. Was it difficult wearing two hats simultaneously; that of director and cinematographer?  The first couple of days were difficult. In fact, I called another DoP to shoot it. But Prithvi told me that I had not done a Malayalam film in the last 20 years and that he had always wanted to work with me as cinematographer. I told him doing both would mean that the film would take longer to complete, and he agreed and gave more dates. You have worked with many talented directors. Did some of that influence you?  You learn something from every film. You keep noticing many things. For instance, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is very particular about the junior artistes placed behind an actor, and choreographs a scene before shooting. Mani Ratnam’s approach is completely different; he says that if you have a great team, half the job is done. Your take on Malayalam cinema, which seems to be at a great place now...      Malayalam films have become the Iranian films of India. Whatever we do, people elsewhere are excited. It looks like people in Mumbai have watched every Malayalam film available on OTT platforms! What are your other projects in the pipeline?     There are a couple; let’s see how it pans out. There are some great Malayalam cinematographers at the moment; it is scary to step into their shoes. Why do you say so?     They are doing extraordinary work. People like Girish Gangadharan, Shyju Khalid and Sanu Varghese....  Malayalam films have become the Iranian films of India. It looks like people in Mumbai have watched every Malayalam film available on OTT platforms!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-dash-of-colour/article36869952.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The great||Prim manicured lawns are being put to pasture. In their place, sassy urban jungles are springing up across the country, ablaze with fruit trees, flowering shrubs, water bodies and verdant greenery, much to the delight of ecologists and environmentalists. A colonial legacy of the British, a lush lawn was the hallmark of buildings of the Raj. Irrespective of geographic locations, the lawn spread all over India with the imperialists. Like many British legacies, it stayed, even after the Raj was uprooted from India. However, turf lawns guzzle water, pesticides and fertilizers to stay glossy. Sheetal Patil, researcher at Azim Premji University, says: “The chemicals silence crickets, ants, birds, butterflies and bees.” This is why architect Vinod Mathew, who trained under the renowned Bali-based landscape designer Made Wijaya, used plants endemic to Kerala to landscape the upscale Villa Maya restaurant in Thiruvananthapuram. Expressing his disappointment at seeing native gardens filled with hibiscus, jasmine, moonbeam, coral jasmine and other common flowers that used to flourish in the Seventies and Eighties in Kerala homes being replaced by lawns and imported plants over the past few decades, he says he focusses on environment-friendly landscaping. He is not the only one. Landscape designer Roshni Nair says homeowners realise the disadvantages of a turf lawn only after they have lived with it for a while. “Prohibitively expensive to maintain in a hot, tropical place like Kerala, the lawn requires to be nursed with tender loving care to maintain its lush green look. Since grass needs sunshine, trees with canopy cannot be grown. The house is exposed to the sun and becomes unbearably hot,” she adds. That is why Suchitra Radha in Thiruvananthapuram decided to replace her lawn with a tropical garden and water body. Suchitra found that her house, which faces the West, would become unbearably hot due to the direct sunlight falling on the walls. When she planted trees to shade the house from the sun, her gardener was not happy as the trees were “spoiling” the lawn. Finally, she decided to take out the lawn completely. Landscape designer Malavika Mohan refuses to create lawns, and focusses instead on empowering her clients with alternatives. “It is important to know your garden well so that you know when and where you will get sunlight. So the garden is an evolving one. First, trees are planted along with bushes. Ferns and plants that need the shade come next. Once, the trees grow in a couple of years, I add fillers such as creepers and foliage plants that can come under them so it looks lush. Everything depends on the lay of the garden,” she says. Architect Tony Joseph in Kozhikode had his lawn removed because he wanted his house to be cooler, says landscaper Jacob Klavara. He replaced the turf grass lawn with pearl grass, creepers and foliage plants. Jacob says many residents are removing their carpet lawns because they have become aware of their high environmental cost. Ravindran Daniel, former UN official, asked architect Liza Natarajan to redesign his garden to create a more life-friendly space with endemic flowers. After redesign, his large garden began to attract many birds and bees. “In most cases, architects plan the house and the garden is done at the last minute, usually a lawn bordered with flowers or palms. I insist on doing the interior and the exterior simultaneously so that each corner has its own surprise and a bit of green,” says Vinod. To avoid ‘green deserts’ Chennai-based architect Benny Kuriakose says many clients ask for trees, ferns and evergreens. “Unlike a decade ago, most of my clients don’t want lawns, they want green spaces with waterbodies and a not-so-pruned-and-orderly garden.” Benny avers that in water-scarce regions such as Chennai, having a lawn is harmful to the environment as it sucks up the available water from the water table. “A garden has to grow with the gardener,” says Malavika. “Instead of going for carpet lawns and fully-grown plants, the joy of gardening lies in watching your garden grow and bloom.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-great/article36870516.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Stamping grounds that bridge time||As shadows lengthen on Gothuruth Island, a village 40 kilometres from Kochi, weary feet quicken. Under harsh fluorescent lights, men and women transform into Emperor Charlemagne (the first Holy Roman Emperor), Oliver, Roland, Bethesda, knights, warriors and Turks, all characters from medieval Europe; the mainstay of Chavittunadakam, an indigenous form of theatre popular among the coastal people of Kerala. From North Kollam to Thrissur, makeshift stages come alive with Chavittunadakam ( chavittu means step or stamp and natakam means play in Malayalam) enacted mainly by Latin Catholic residents-turned-actors. Clad in shiny costumes and shoes, they speak in a mixture of Tamil and Malayalam and sing songs about battles fought in faraway lands to protect the early Christians. Charmed by a play he happened to watch, J Bibin Joseph, an engineer-turned-film director from Thiruvananthapuram made The Fragments of Illusion, a documentary on Chavittunadakam, which won the Kerala State Television Award for the best director in the non-fiction category. “Its practitioners are fishermen, weavers, boatmen, masons and so on. It is a legacy that has been preserved by them in the face of great odds,” he says. Without a master voice-over, the actor-singers of Chavittunadakam in Gothuruth talk about the plays and stories in the documentary. The familiarity with which they speak about incidents that are believed to have occurred in medieval Europe, is surreal. “Margam kali, a folk dance that bears a strong resemblance toThiruvathira kali, and Chavittunadakam are the two popular performing art forms unique to Christians in Kerala. Chavittanadakam is anchored in Christian mythology and the Crusades. Since it is cross-cultural in origin, actors wear footwear, a feature unique to Chavittanadakam. Other indigenous art forms in Kerala shun footwear during a performance,” says Arun Surendran, producer of the documentary. Chavittunadakam is said to have been created by Padroado missionaries who arrived with the Portuguese in 1498 in search of God, gold and glory. Folklorist Geetha P Wilson says there are versions in all the regions where the Padroado preached. South America, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Africa have similar plays. Chavittunadakam has elements of Western opera, Koodiyattam, Kathakali andkalaripayattu. Its dance segments are calledkalasam, the name of pure dance sequences in Kathakali. In the past, these plays were staged at night for church festivals. Some plays, like the popular and earliest, Karalman Charitham , were staged over 15 nights. Roy George, anasan(teacher) and practitioner of Chavittunadakam, recalls his father and his contemporaries putting up the plays by borrowing money and working hard to find stages. The art form received some exposure when Mammootty played a Chavittanadakam actor in Shaji N Karun’s film Kutty Srank (2009). In 2012, the Government of Kerala’s inclusion of Chavittunadakam in the Kerala State Schools’ Youth Festival came as a shot in the arm for troupes. Since then, George’s kalari has students of all ages learning the unique footwork, songs and dialogues of Chavittunadakam. According to Geetha, traditional percussion instruments such as the chenda and ela thalam used to be played during recitals in the past. “Now, keyboard, table, rhythm keypad and ela talam are played. There is no fixed number for the musicians accompanying a play. It can differ,” she says. Vigorous footwork Traditionally, Chavittunadakam’s footwork includes 12 distinctive steps. Georgekutty asan created two more. The footwork is physically demanding. Geetha explains that in the past, the stage was a wooden platform constructed on top of wooden barrels: “The performers’ vigorous footwork would create a booming sound as they stepped hard on the wooden stage.” “The Government’s encouragement has given us many stages; we have performed all over Kerala. New plays are in Malayalam, as it would be difficult for audiences to understand the language of older plays,” adds Roy. The five-day Chuvadi festival from December 26 to 31, which began at Gothuruth, had to be postponed last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Roy is upbeat when he says that the play is reaching cities and is not restricted to the coastal belt, once the stamping ground of the Chavittunadakam actors.  Chavittunadakam is said to have been created by Padroado missionaries who arrived when the Portuguese reached the land in 1498, in search of God, gold and glory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/stamping-grounds-that-bridge-time/article36870519.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The strength of silence||Udanpirappe , starring Jyotika, Sasikumar and Samuthirakani, will be a village family drama that explores the relationship between siblings, Vairavan (Sasikumar) and Mathangi (Jyotika). While Vairavan thinks justice has to be wrested, Mathangi’s husband Sargunam (Samuthirakani) rests his belief in the law. Their ideological differences fissure the family. The story, set in Pudukkottai, revolves around this drama, even as it talks about other social issues. The film, written and directed by Era Saravanan, is set to premiere in Tamil and Telugu (as Raktha Sambandham ) on Amazon Prime Video on October 14. It also features Soori and Kalaiyarasan, among others. At the online trailer launch of the film, Jyotika thanked her directors for giving her the roles she has played in her two-decade career. The actor took a hiatus in the mid-2000s after her marriage to Suriya before resuming in 2015. After her comeback, she has mostly starred in female-centric films. “I chose to portray dignified women on screen in my second innings. The character I play in Udanpirappe is special because it shows the strength of a woman’s silence,” she said during the launch.  Udanpirappe, produced by Jyotika and her husband Suriya, is Jyotika’s 50th film. The actor, who debuted in Hindi film, Doli Saja Ke Rakhna , went on to act in several blockbusters such as Sillunu Oru Kaadhal, Kaakha Kaakha and Chandramukhi to mention a few.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-strength-of-silence/article36869949.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The business of dolls||After a year of mostly virtual celebrations, there is a festive frenzy this season. Encouraged by customers eager to shop again after many months of lockdowns, vendors began setting up shop on roadsides in Mylapore and T Nagar, the hub of Navratri doll sales, nearly three weeks ago. Families that have the tradition of displaying dolls for the nine days of Navratri , buy new ones to add to their collection. This season, as people turn to the comfort of nostalgia, there is a growing market for antique dolls. Divya N, designer and faculty member at National Institute of Fashion Technology, says, “People have always kept inherited dolls in the golu, but now they are actively buying old dolls on social media. Sellers are either elderly people or dealers. Labelled as vintage, these dolls are around 40 to 80 years old, and sold as sets of four or more. They cost anywhere between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 20,000.” As this is the 100th death anniversary of the freedom fighter and poet Subramania Bharati, retailers say that the ‘Bharathiyar doll’ is trending. Tea and idli kadai sets are also garnering attention, particularly at Khadi Gramodhyog Bhavan, Anna Salai. Secretary of the Bhavan, G Elangovan, says that sales were rather dull in 2019, and absolutely nil last year. “This year, we are trying to clear the previous stock and give minimal new orders, only enough to help sustain the livelihood of the doll makers in the State.” Divya, who works with doll makers in and around Tamil Nadu as part of the Central Government’s craft cluster development programmes, says that artisan C Bharanidharan of Chinna Kanchipuram has created an IPL theme set (Rs. 3,000) featuring coloured jerseys with names and numbers. The set of 15 pieces comprises fielders, batsmen and umpires. Says Bharanidharan: “We can customise it to any IPL team.” Adding that the cost of production has increased by 20% this year, he says they are stocking less. ‘Seemandham’ sets and ‘Thiruvallur Perumal’ dolls made last year, are being sold this year as new releases. According to K Parameshwaran, proprietor of Sri Jyothi Handicrafts, Mylapore, customers are looking for lightweight dolls either because they are on a tight budget or due to a lack of space. “But dolls made in Tamil Nadu — mostly of gods, saints and leaders — come in big sizes. Therefore we source small dolls from West Bengal and Andhra,” he says.  This year the mood seems to be to keep the golu tradition alive, but on a smaller format.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-business-of-dolls/article36870511.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||My hero looks like me||“Mandrake the Magician may not have worn his underwear on the outside but he was the closest I had to a superhero,” says Twinkle Khanna. The actor, who launched Tweak Books last year, says the idea of what a ‘superhero’ looks like is changing. Her platform is out with its second book, published by Juggernaut, in the When I Grow Up, I Want To Be series for children, that narrates inspiring accounts of 20 real-life ‘heroes’: from ‘Mr Inkredible’ Anirudh Sharma, who found a way to turn carbon emissions from cars into ink, ‘Forest Man’ Jadav Payeng, the environmental activist from Majuli, to ‘Rocket Woman’ Ritu Karidhal, who was the deputy operations director for the Mangalyaan mission. “We want children to get acquainted with our local heroes: men, women, and yes, kids, who have done remarkable things,” says Twinkle, in an email interview. The Tweak team drew up lists of people after combing through news reports, documentaries and recipients of prestigious awards in fields like conservation and invention. “We then had to narrow it down to 20 individuals that had consistently contributed to their individual fields. These had to be stories that children would find both inspiring as well as engaging,” she adds. Accounts of their merit and experiences were turned into stories that would capture the imagination of children. Picture ‘Choti Champion’ Alana Meenakshi lording over her chessboard, surveying the kingdom her pieces rule over, or a 100-kilogram birthday cake for all of Bibi Prakash Kaur’s (founder of Unique Home for Girls) 60 adopted daughters. “We included children like Saarang Sumesh, who invented the smart seat belt, so children would find a hero among their own peers,” says Twinkle. As a mother to her nine-year old daughter, Nitara, Twinkle attributes the changing idea of what makes for a hero to the amount of exposure children have today. She recalls reading Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls with Nitara. “Her favourite story was on Catherine the Great, the German-born princess, who banished her husband and took over as the empress of Russia. She asked me, ‘So is Catherine good or is she evil then, like a witch ?’” “I told her that all witches were perhaps princesses first, just like Catherine, who got tired of their knight in shining armour falling off his high horse. It gave us a chance to talk about gender, equality and ambition. Books about real life heroes, I believe, give parents the chance to have conversations with their kids that can mould their world view,” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/my-hero-looks-like-me/article36870521.ece

07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Songs of the soil||Versatility has always been the name of the game for composer Amit Trivedi, who has brought musical styles from around the world to his work over the past decade, and is now looking towards Indian folk for inspiration. “We borrow so much from the musical styles of the West — hip hop and rap is especially popular right now, I have done that too, of course, for my films,” Amit has no qualms admitting, “But the folk power of our country is sitting unused. I thought let us explore our own music for a change.” Under his independent music label AT Azaad, the composer stars in a new show,Skoda Sonic Roots, for which he has travelled across the country connecting with talented voices from Gujarat, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. At each place he goes to, Amit immerses himself in the local traditions and stories, and at the end, shoots a music video, which will be available on YouTube. Celebrated folk singers including Nagesh Morwekar, Kirtidan Gadhvi, Goutam Das Baul, Kavita Seth, Rana Mazumder, Mame Khan, Bhanwari Devi and Chennai’s Anthony Daasan have worked with Amit on this show. After observing the Indian mooch (moustache) tradition in Jodhpur, he pays homage to Bengal’s Baul legacy, and moves to celebrating Maharashtrian pride rooted in the Bhagwa style of music. During the Chennai leg of his tour he meets Anthony to compose a love song titled ‘Meenaatchi’. But the song he starts out with — ‘Tedo Tedo’, is a Gujarati wedding song, and its video, an explosion of colour. “As a Gujarati, I have grown up listening to ‘garba , dayro lok geet …’ That is what my mom would sing around the house, and my dad would play Hemant Chauhan [folk and bhajan singer from Rajkot].” Over the past year, Amit has been collaborating with indie musicians to bring out ‘songs of love’, ‘songs of faith’, ‘songs of dance’ and now ‘songs of the soil’. “I am hoping we get to bring out a season 2 where we can showcase music from the north and northeast,” says Amit. The songs composed for the show were on one hand, rooted in folk patterns, but also have Amit’s signature sound. “You need to have an understanding of that genre of course, study the beat patterns, the instrumentation that goes with it. I wanted to be authentic to the style and then experiment in and around that to add my touch,” he says, adding, “I’m mainly there to have fun, whatever be the style.” Skoda Sonic Roots will stream on Voot||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/songs-of-the-soil/article36870267.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||An offbeat tune||One of the first song briefs that director Karthik Swaminathan gave composer Revaa (Revathi Viswanathan) for the Vijay Sethupathi-starrer Mugizh , which releases this Friday, was about a family that bonds with a puppy. Revaa composed a three-minute song that the team was happy with. However, when they went to shoot, there was a problem: the reactions that Scooby, the role played by the pup, just did not sit with the song. This put both Karthik and Revaa in a tight spot, and they decided to do something unconventional: shoot the entire song, and then compose the tune. “Going through the lengthy footage, I sat down and composed depending on the graph that the puppy follows in the film,” recalls Revaa, seated comfortably at her uncle Ramanathan’s Nadabindu Recording Studio at KK Nagar. The song she is referring to is ‘Mayakaara’.  Mugizh marks Revaa’s entry into Tamil cinema. She has earlier worked on Malayalam film Mangalyam Thanthunaena , Marathi film College Diary besides composing for pilot films and more than 200 ad jingles. This film came about after working with director Karthik on a documentary and short film Idaivelai . She says, “We [Karthik and I] have a great working relationship. The story of Mugizh is all about a family’s discoveries about each other; in fact, Mugizh refers to one of the nine stages in the blooming of a flower, during which it gets fragrance.” The runtime of Mugizh is a little more than an hour, which is longer than a short film but less than a feature. “It is all about storytelling, at the end of the day. When I do a jingle, I have to convey the essence musically within a short time. It is a planned execution of music, because it has to be catchy. But films, for me, revolve around emotions; I concentrate on enriching the visuals, and not on what is trending,” she adds. Revaa hails from a Palakkad-based family steeped in music; her grandfather is popular mridangam artiste, Palakkad R. Seshamani. Her parents, P.V. Viswanathan and P.S. Saradambal, recognised her love for music and enrolled her into violin and vocal classes. Though music was always in the background, Revaa ventured into fashion technology: she graduated from Chennai’s National Institute of Fashion Technology and worked in the garments business for a few years, before returning to her first love: music. She believes that the effort put into Mugizh will help her cause. Two songs in the film are sung by Govind Vasantha and Pradeep Kumar, who are composers themselves. “A lot of people told me that the route is to establish myself as a singer, and then get into composing. But I wanted to break that; it is composing tunes that gives me immense happiness,” she says. That she has to do this in a mostly all-male environment does not bother her too much. “I am thankful to my family. Composing is a lot about tapping the requirements of the director, and executing it. The process involves hours of discussions, corrections and follow-ups, which means late-night work as well. All these things make it challenging for a woman to break into the field.”  An ad jingle is a planned execution of music. But films, for me, revolve around emotions. I concentrate on enriching the visuals with the music, and not on what is trending Revaa Music composer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-offbeat-tune/article36870269.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A dash of colour||Cinematographer Ravi K. Chandran has always wanted to direct films. However, his eye for good visuals and the influence of his older brother, the late cinematographer K. Ramachandra Babu, changed the course of his career and got him working with some of the country’s biggest filmmakers. A few years ago, he got to direct the Tamil film, Yaan , but describes it as a ‘bitter experience’. A disappointed Ravi went back to cinematography. During that time, he watched Andhadun and was impressed by it. While speaking with its director, Sriram Raghavan, he learnt that the film was initially planned with a south Indian actor who could not commit dates for the project. He had even found a location in Kochi. With a producer, Ravi made a bid to acquire its remake rights, which took some time coming, and started directing it. The result is Bhramam , releasing on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday. He intends to continue directing. “There are many stories that I want to tell. There are new platforms to show these films to people,” he says. This is an eventful way to make your first film...  (Laughs) Movies are always eventful. However experienced you are, things could go wrong. It is impossible to predict the filmmaking process. How did you get Prithviraj on board the project? When we met for another project, Andhadun came up in the conversation; Prithvi mentioned that he wanted the rights of the film. We decided to go ahead and got the script written by Sarath Balan. Then, the pandemic happened and Prithvi was abroad shooting Aadujeevitham . We almost forgot about the film (laughs) . When things opened in late 2020, we started filming. It was an ideal film to make during a pandemic as it involved just a few people on set. Have you stuck to the original or did you tweak the script?  We had to make changes; Prithvi’s build and body language is different from Ayushmann’s. Tabu played an older character in the original, while Mamta in this version is much younger. The original had a bland palette, so we wanted to introduce some colour into it. I have also been watching a lot of Malayalam films and I find that many restrict themselves to murder mysteries and dark themes. I wanted Bhramam to have a lot of colour, like Pedro Almodovar’s films. Was it difficult wearing two hats simultaneously; that of directorand cinematographer?  The first couple of days were difficult. In fact, I called another DoP to shoot it. But Prithvi told me that I had not done a Malayalam film in the last 20 years and that he had always wanted to work with me as cinematographer. I told him doing both would mean that the film would take longer to complete, and he agreed and gave more dates. You have worked with many talented directors. Did some of that influence you?  You learn something from every film. You keep noticing many things. For instance, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is very particular about the junior artistes placed behind an actor, and choreographs a scene before shooting. Mani Ratnam’s approach is completely different; he says that if you have a great team, half the job is done.  Malayalam films have become the Iranian films of India. It looks like people in Mumbai have watched every Malayalam film available on OTT platforms!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-dash-of-colour/article36870271.ece
07 October 2021||October 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The strength of silence||Udanpirappe , starring Jyotika, Sasikumar and Samuthirakani, will be a village family drama that explores the relationship between siblings, Vairavan (Sasikumar) and Mathangi (Jyotika). While Vairavan thinks justice has to be wrested, Mathangi’s husband Sargunam (Samuthirakani) rests his belief in the law. Their ideological differences fissure the family. The story, set in Pudukkottai, revolves around this drama, even as it talks about other social issues. The film, written and directed by Era Saravanan, is set to premiere in Tamil and Telugu (as Raktha Sambandham ) on Amazon Prime Video on October 14. It also features Soori and Kalaiyarasan, among others. At the online trailer launch of the film, Jyotika thanked her directors for giving her the roles she has played in her two-decade career. The actor took a hiatus in the mid-2000s after her marriage to Suriya before resuming in 2015. After her comeback, she has mostly starred in female-centric films. “I chose to portray dignified women on screen in my second innings. The character I play in Udanpirappe is special because it shows the strength of a woman’s silence,” she said during the launch.  Udanpirappe, produced by Jyotika and her husband Suriya, is Jyotika’s 50th film. The actor, who debuted in Hindi film, Doli Saja Ke Rakhna , went on to act in several blockbusters such as Sillunu Oru Kaadhal, Kaakha Kaakha and Chandramukhi to mention a few.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-strength-of-silence/article36870270.ece

07 October 2021||New Delhi,||U.P. govt. protecting ‘killers’ of farmers in Lakhimpur: Kejriwal||Terming it murder and demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi reach out to their next of kin to share their sorrow, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday strongly condemned the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Mr. Kejriwal alleged that the Uttar Pradesh government was “protecting the killers”. The Delhi Chief Minister questioned why “the killers” of farmers were yet to be arrested. The car that mercilessly mowed down the farmers, Mr. Kejriwal alleged, had not only crushed them but the very soul and spirit of all the farmers of the country. “Dear Mr. Prime Minister, throughout the country everyone’s talking about how the entire system is trying to protect the murderers of the innocent farmers who died in Lakhimpur. I want to talk to you, Mr. Prime Minister, on behalf of the people of this country today,” Mr. Kejriwal told a digital press briefing. “Why haven’t those murderers been arrested? Why are those murderers being protected? Those murderers barbarically ran their car over the innocent farmers in broad daylight and yet those murderers haven’t been arrested,” he added. It was, the Chief Minister said further, only in Bollywood films that one bore witness to criminals mercilessly running their cars over innocent people only to have the entire system “bow down before them” and shield them from the law. Mr. Kejriwal questioned whether the message that was sought to be conveyed through alleged inaction in the case was that if someone was a politician or a rich and powerful person they could get away with murdering people under the Prime Minister’s watch. “Those murders did not only kill the group of farmers they ran over, they killed the spirit and soul of all the farmers of this nation. They ran over all those people who are downtrodden in this country. It feels like that car ran over the government itself and killed the entire system,” he added. “Mr. Prime Minister, on one hand the government is celebrating the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, on the other hand it is arresting the leaders from the opposition when they are going to support and console the bereaved families of the victims. Is this how you are celebrating the freedom of this great country, Mr. Prime Minister?” the Chief Minister asked. ‘Tyrannical behaviour’ Adding that such behaviour was akin to the tyrannical British colonial rule, Mr. Kejriwal said that our forefathers did not die in the struggle for freedom to see this day. Farmers, he also said, had been protesting for a year and over 600 of them had died till date. Why, he asked, was “so much hate” for them being exhibited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-govt-protecting-killers-of-farmers-in-lakhimpur-kejriwal/article36870111.ece
07 October 2021||JAIPUR,||Demand for law on ‘right to health care’ revived in Rajasthan||The demand for the enactment of a legislation on the right to health care, for which the ruling Congress had made a promise in its manifesto for the 2018 Assembly election, has been revived in Rajasthan. Health activists here affirmed that the law would streamline medical services and guarantee the availability of essential facilities to citizens. ‘No burden on govt.’ The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a network of civil society organisations, has pointed out that the implementation of a statutory right to health care would not put any immediate financial burden on the State government as a sufficient number of doctors, health service providers, buildings, equipment and medicines are already available. The law, if enacted, is expected to strengthen the monitoring system in the health sector. The JSA, which functions as the Rajasthan chapter of the global non-profit People’s Health Movement, had prepared a draft Act on the subject and submitted it to the Health Department authorities shortly after the new government was formed in December 2018. No progress has been made in the enactment of the statute despite the lapse of two-and-a-half years. Chhaya Pachauli, director of the voluntary group Prayas, said here on Wednesday that the State had gone through the COVID-19 pandemic in this interval, in which several lives had been lost and many patients had to spend huge amounts of money out of their pockets for treatment. “Had the Act been implemented, many lives could have been saved and the expenditure on treatment reduced,” Ms. Pachauli said. Representatives of health rights groups and public health specialists discussed the issue at a State-level consultation here recently and demanded that the State government bring a Bill on the right to healthcare in the Assembly on the basis of the draft provided by the JSA. The legislation should ensure access for every citizen to basic healthcare services within 3 km of his or her residence. Ms. Pachauli said the draft Act had laid emphasis on institutional mechanisms, such as social audit and public dialogues, to augment community participation in healthcare planning. A thorough assessment of all the primary health centres operating on the public private partnership (PPP) mode should also be carried out and any centre found below the standards should be immediately withdrawn from the PPP scheme, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/demand-for-law-on-right-to-health-care-revived-in-rajasthan/article36870283.ece
07 October 2021||Mumbai,||Priyanka a ‘brave fighter’, says Sena||In a scathing attack on the BJP for arresting Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh recently, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday said that Ms. Gandhi, who was as sharp as former Prime Minister and her grandmother Indira Gandhi, did not buckle under pressure of the State Government and continued her fight. Ms. Vadra was on her way to meet the family members of farmers who died during a protest in Lakhimpur Kheri. Slamming the Union Government over the killing of farmers at a time when it was celebrating the Amrut mahotsav of Independence, an editorial in the Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana asked whether it should be termed as ‘blood festival’ now? “Priyanka Gandhi may be targeted for being a political opponent. But those who arrested her illegally should have kept in mind that she is a granddaughter of Indira Gandhi who made the ultimate sacrifice for the nation and avenged Partition by dividing Pakistan into two,” it said. The editorial said that Ms. Vadra was a brave fighter. “She has sharpness of Indira Gandhi in her eyes and voice. She continued her fight from the jail cell of Sitapur,” it said. Attacking the BJP over the killing of farmers, the editorial wondered how the party would have reacted had a similar incident happened in any non-BJP ruled State. “Had any other woman been manhandled like Priyanka Gandhi, the women’s wing of the BJP would have hit the streets. It seems the BJP has come out with new definition of attacks on women and the one on Indira Gandhi’s granddaughter is not part of it,” it said. Reminding the BJP how Lala Lajpat Rai was killed by the British and how Babu Genu was mowed down by the car driven by the British, the editorial said that this time it was an Union Minister’s son.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/priyanka-a-brave-fighter-says-sena/article36870105.ece

07 October 2021||Kolkata,||Kolkata man’s passion to fix fountain pens||“It’s my nesha and not pesha [it’s an addiction and not just a profession],” says Dilip Basak, 56, about his livelihood, which happens to be repairing fountain pens. If the Mont Blanc or Waterman on your desk — whether inherited from your grandfather or a new purchase — has developed a snag, Mr. Basak is not only likely to diagnose the problem but also fix it for you. “I am the only person in whole of India who is still in this profession,” Mr. Basak declares, adding, “and I am able to make both ends meet.” While it may be debatable whether he is the only one in the whole country doing this job, there is no doubt he is one of the very few, and certainly a highly respected member of the several groups on Facebook and WhatsApp formed by connoisseurs of the good, old fountain pen. Mr. Basak’s fame among pen lovers is inversely proportionate to the size of his workplace — a narrow rectangular space under a staircase of an old building in Bhabanipur — which he inherited, along with the profession, from his father Bholanath Basak, who died in 1998. “I was hardly 11 or 12 when I got into this line, holding my father’s hand. I will tell you why I came into the profession this early. I was a good student in school, always stood first or second, but one particular year, they refused to hand me the results because I hadn’t paid the fee. My father eventually managed to get the money, but by then I had decided I will never return to school,” Mr. Basak says. Having dropped out of school that early, Mr. Basak himself may not be highly skilled with the written word, but fountain pens repaired by him have presumably scripted important moments in history. Pens he has fixed include those belonging to Satyajit Ray and Jyoti Basu. “They never came to me personally, of course. Their pens were brought to me by dealers or the showroom people, who would tell me, ‘Handle this with care, they belong to so-and-so’. For a long time, pens from the Raj Bhavan also came for repair,” he recalls. Adding to popularity Fountain pens going out of fashion — combined with Mr. Basak deciding to stick to his profession — has only helped add to his popularity as a restorer. Back during those days, he was one of the many mechanics in Kolkata who could fix a fountain pen. Today, he is known to fountain pen connoisseurs across the country, who routinely courier him their expensive pens for repair. “My father, though he was a skilled craftsman, had one flaw — he would get nervous while handling very expensive pens. Whereas I don’t care whether the pen I am repairing costs Rs. 1 lakh or Rs. 1.5 lakh. If I start worrying about its value, I would never be able to work on it. This confidence I acquired early on in life,” says Mr. Basak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kolkata-mans-passion-to-fix-fountain-pens/article36870101.ece
07 October 2021||New Delhi,||Suspend Tihar men who colluded with Unitech ex-promoters: SC||The Supreme Court Wednesday directed suspension of Tihar Jail officials, registration of case against them and full-fledged probe into their collusion with Unitech’s imprisoned ex-promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, based on Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana’s report filed in a sealed cover. A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah directed registration of cases against the Tihar Jail officials and other unknown persons under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code against those involved in the collusion as per the report. It also directed suspension of Tihar Jail officials, pending proceedings against whom cases will be lodged as per the report, following ED’s disclosure that the Chandra brothers were conducting business from prison. The top court further directed the Home Ministry to comply with Mr. Asthana’s suggestions in the report on enhancing prison management and allowed a copy to be shared with the ministry for necessary compliance of directions. The court listed the matter for further hearing on October 21. Heated exchange During the hearing, which witnessed heated exchange between the Bench and senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Sanjay Chandra, on the issue of sharing of reports of forensic audit and probe agencies, the top court said that natural justice is being followed as under the law and documents which would become part of charge sheet or case diary cannot be shared with the accused. “My 84-year-old father and wife have been arrested by the ED without any charge being proven against me. Now they would arrest my children. This is unfair, without giving me a copy of the forensic audit done by M/s Grant Thornton to put my defence, this court has taken over my company,” Mr. Singh said. “If tomorrow, I am acquitted of the charge of diversion of funds, will the court be able to set the clock back. This will not be possible and the court will have to repent this,” Mr. Singh said. Justice Chandrachud, who seldom loses his cool, said angrily, “What kind of argument is this that this court will repent its mistake. What kind of language is this? You are making allegations against the court. We are bound by law and cannot share the reports which will become part of the case diary. May be you are not briefed properly by your clients. We are very much aware of natural justice”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/suspend-tihar-men-who-colluded-with-unitech-ex-promoters-sc/article36870099.ece
07 October 2021||Dehradun,||Jim Corbett National Park may be renamed Ramganga National Park||Jim Corbett National Park, a world-renowned tiger reserve in Uttarakhand, may be renamed as Ramganga National Park in the future. Union Minister of State for Forest and Environment Ashwini Kumar Choubey hinted about the change in name of India’s first national park which is spread over an area of about 521 km. He recently mentioned it in a museum guest book on his tour of the park. He wrote that the name of Jim Corbett National Park should be changed to Ramganga National Park. Jim Corbett National Park Director Rahul confirmed this but declined to comment further. Move unwelcome However, wildlife lovers have expressed their displeasure over the probable name change. Wildlife lover Prakash Kimothi said, “We should focus more on preserving our heritage than changing the name.” If the Jim Corbett park’s name is changed, it will not be the first time. The park, which was named Hailey National Park at its inception in 1936, was renamed after hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett two decades later. However, for some time in between it was also named Ramganga National Park as the Ramganga, a tributary of the Ganges, passes through it.

Last week, the Central Bureau of Investigation had submitted a list of 13 documents, which include the ‘spot panchnama’, ‘inquest panchnama’, seizure of clothes and articles of the deceased, and various other documents, considered evidence in the case. As charges have been framed in the 2013 murder case, the prosecution had submitted a list of documents to Additional Sessions Judge S.R. Navandar (Special Judge for UAPA cases). Defence counsel Suvarna Avhad said they refused to admit the documents submitted by the prosecution. “We moved an application before the court stating that the defence rejects all the documents submitted by the prosecution. We told the court that we will be contesting the documents during the trial,” she said. CBI’s Special Public Prosecutor Prakash Suryawanshi said the defence rejected all the documents. “I will prove these documents by examining my witnesses. I will submit a list of documents and witnesses and will start with the examination,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dabholkar-case-defence-counsel-refuses-to-accept-prosecution-documents/article36870284.ece
07 October 2021||Mumbai,||AC local trains to resume services in Mumbai today||The Central Railway (CR) on Wednesday announced the restoration of all 16 air-conditioned suburban train services on Mumbai’s Trans-Harbour line from Thursday. The CR will also increase the number of train services on its suburban network from October 7, bringing them to nearly 96% of pre-pandemic level. The Railway had suspended AC local services, along with other suburban trains on its network in Mumbai, last year after the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. Though it restored regular suburban services after coronavirus-related restrictions were relaxed, AC trains were still not available to commuters. As per the schedule released by the CR, the first AC local on the Trans-Harbour line will depart on October 7 from Panvel for Thane at 5.44 a.m., while the last service will leave Panvel for Thane at 10.46 p.m. The suburban train section connects Navi Mumbai, which is on the Harbour line, with Thane on the Central line. “The 16 services will run with AC rakes from Monday to Friday and with non-AC rakes on Saturdays,” Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ac-local-trains-to-resume-services-in-mumbai-today/article36870097.ece
