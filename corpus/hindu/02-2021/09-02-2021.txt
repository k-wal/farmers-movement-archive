09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||171 still missing as death toll in Himalayan tragedy rises to 26||The death toll in the Nanda Devi deluge in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district went up to 26 on Monday, even as operations continued for the second day to rescue nearly 35 labourers trapped inside the 2.5-km-long Tapovan hydel project tunnel filled with slush and debris. A total of 171 persons, including the trapped workers, are still missing. Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who reached Joshimath in the evening to take stock of the situation, said a joint team had entered 130 metres into the tunnel by around 7 p.m. and might take another two to three hours to reach the T-point. Earlier, Union Power Minister R.K. Singh also inspected the tunnel. “There is a turning point at 180 metres where we hope to find the workers, as briefed by the NTPC officials. However, removing the slush is proving to be a time-consuming exercise as only one JCB can enter and exit at a time. We may explore other options to create access routes to the point where the labourers are suspected to be stranded,” said a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) official. Slush removal After personnel from the Army and the Engineer Task Force opened the mouth of the tunnel in the morning, a team comprising personnel from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the NDRF and the State Disaster Response Force started removing the slush using earth movers and excavators. An ITBP official said the rescue team had gone into the tunnel with victim-locating cameras and sniffer dogs. According to the Uttarakhand police, 202 persons were reported missing hours after the disaster struck. Among them, 21 were from one Ritvik company, 100 others associated with it, 46 from Rishi Ganga company, 21 worked for Om Metal and three for H.C.C. Two persons each from the Tapovan, Ringi and Karchho villages and five from Raini village were also reported missing. The missing persons included 12 villagers, 172 staffers of the NTPC project and 46 workers at the Rishiganga project, the ITBP official said. The flash flood in the Alaknanda river system on Sunday washed away the Raini bridge and cut off 13 villages located close to the border with China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/171-people-still-missing-as-toll-in-himalayan-tragedy-rises-to-26/article33787187.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre still open to talks with farmers, says Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said his government was still open to talks with farmers demanding a repeal of the three farm laws passed last September. He said the minimum support price for crops “was, is and would remain in force”. Mr. Modi added that calling the Sikh community names was not doing any good to the country. Replying to the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister claimed that a proper response had been given by India to the situation along the Line of Actual Control. Mr. Modi said the nation was proud of every Sikh. “Some people are feeding wrong things in minds of the Sikh people ... What have they not done for this country? The words and blessings of the Guru Sahibs are precious. Language used by some for the Sikhs in an attempt to mislead them is not going to benefit anyone,” he said. Farmers from many States, including Punjab, have been camping on the borders of Delhi for the past two months in protest against the laws. “We must not forget what happened with Punjab. It suffered the most during Partition. It cried the most during the 1984 riots, ” Mr. Modi said. Comparing the farm laws with the Green Revolution, Mr. Modi said there had been a huge outcry in the country even then. “No one was ready to become Agriculture Minister in (former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri) Shastriji's time. Planning Commission also opposed the agriculture reforms then. But Shastri ji moved forward,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-still-open-to-talks-with-farmers-says-modi/article33787184.ece
09 February 2021||HOSUR/CHENNAI,||In T.N., Sasikala gets massive welcome||The distance between Bengaluru and Chennai is around 350 km — one that is usually covered in 6.5 to 7 hours of driving. However, for V.K. Sasikala, the former aide of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, it appeared to take almost a full day as she started her Chennai-bound journey after completing her jail term in Bengaluru. Though Ms. Sasikala’s journey started at 7.30 a.m. on Monday, her vehicle reached near Kancheepuram town only at 1 a.m. on Tuesday. The convoy stopped several times on the route, as eager loyalists gathered to welcome her, shower her car with flowers, and some even got in the path of her vehicle. During the stops, both scheduled and unscheduled, Ms. Sasikala spoke to the cadre and assured them of her intention to immerse herself in politics, identifying with the AIADMK. The convoy arrived at the inter-State border arch of Zuzuvadi and rolled into Tamil Nadu to chendamelams (ritual drumming), and a reception of pooranakumbams, reminiscent of the welcome accorded to victorious kings and heroes in ancient times. The heavy police deployment and their many injunctions forbidding the use of the AIADMK party flag were swept aside in the face of charged-up supporters. The inter-State border saw flags of the AIADMK and the AMMK waving together, as the police grappled to contain the crowd. Amid videos of Ms. Sasikala leaving Bengaluru in a vehicle bearing the AIADMK flag, the West Zone police at the border were poised to issue a notice to the convoy directing the removal of the flag. However, just ahead of the Athibelle checkpost in Karnataka, a few hundred metres from the inter-State border, she changed to another vehicle, which also sported an AIADMK flag. Minutes later, the convoy rolled into Tamil Nadu. The reason for the change of vehicle was unclear. However, video footage of a minor brush with a minivan that fell into the line of the convoy route in Karnataka was circulated on social media, soon after. In Zuzuvadi in Hosur, tense moments prevailed, when the police stopped Ms. Sasikala’s vehicle and demanded that she collect the notice for violating the police order forbidding the use of AIADMK flag. In a late night directive on Sunday, Krishnagiri SP Bandi Gangadhar had warned against the use of the AIADMK party flags by Ms. Sasikala or her loyalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-tn-sasikala-gets-massive-welcome/article33787185.ece
09 February 2021||MANGALURU,||Govt. officials, others take vaccine in twin dists||Deputy Commissioners of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi K.V. Rajendra and G. Jagadeesha, respectively, Udupi Additional Deputy Commissioner Sadashiva Prabhu, Mangaluru Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar and Udupi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Y. Naveen Bhat were among the frontline workers who received Covishield vaccine in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts on Monday. The three-day vaccination drive for frontline workers comprising police personnel, employees in Revenue Department, panchayat and municipal bodies began on Monday. There are 8,546 frontline workers in Dakshina Kannada, while there are 4,040 workers in Udupi district. Dakshina Kannada District Health and Family Welfare Officer Ramachandra Bairy said as many as 6,525 personnel, including 4,054 health workers, registered their names for the receiving the vaccine at the 41 vaccination centres across the district on Monday. District Reproductive Child Health Officer and Nodal officer for Vaccination B.V. Rajesh said that of the 2,471 frontline workers who registered their names 570 turned up to receive the vaccine on Monday. Of the 4,054 health workers, 1,190 personnel were given the vaccine in Dakshina Kannada. As many as five vaccination centres have been set up at the new AYUSH building of the Government Wenlock Hospital. Soon after his arrival at the centre, Dr. Rajendra underwent the routine check-up for blood pressure. He then volunteered to check the blood pressure of Mr. Kumar, Deputy Commissioners of Police Vinay Gaonker and Hariram Shankar. Dr. Rajendra was the first to receive the jab, followed by Mr. Kumar, Mr. Gaonker, Mr. Shankar and probationary IAS Officer Mona Roat. The officers spent some time at the observation room where each one posed for photograph by holding a frame given to those who receive the vaccine. The officers also took selfies. Before the officers left the observation room, doctors offered them a couple of paracetamol tablets which need to be taken in case of body pain. In Udupi, Mr. Jagadeesha, Mr. Bhat, Additional Superintendent of Police Kumarachandra and Udupi City Municipal Commissioner Anand Kallolikar were among the frontline workers who received the vaccine at the District Hospital in Ajjarkadu. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Jagadeesha said that so far 15,233 health workers have received the vaccine and the remaining 10,000 health workers will be covered by February 21. The district administration has planned to cover all frontline workers, he said. Meanwhile, day one of the second phase of COVID-19 vaccination drive for other frontline workers did not bring much cheer for the health authorities in Udupi with only 132 out of the 593 beneficiaries taking the vaccine in four centres. This constitutes 22% achievement for the day, according to District Health Officer Sudhir Chandra Sooda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-officials-others-take-vaccine-in-twin-dists/article33787847.ece

09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to hear plea against 69% quota in T.N.||The Supreme Court on Monday decided to hear a petition which challenges the constitutionality of a Tamil Nadu State law giving 69% reservation in education and employment. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said it would hear arguments on February 17 on whether the case should be referred to a five-judge Constitution Bench scheduled to hear a bunch of pleas questioning the validity of the Maratha reservation law of Maharashtra. Both laws cross the 50% ceiling prescribed by a Constitution Bench in the Indira Sawhney judgment. However, Tamil Nadu, represented by senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, objected to mixing up the State’s case with that of the Maharashtra reservation law or that of any other State. Mr. Naphade said the Tamil Nadu case should be heard separately. “India is an amalgam of States with varied population, size, history, culture and social fabric. The circumstances and facts prevailing in Tamil Nadu are not the same or similar to any other State. Factual variations contributing to the grant of reservation need to be reckoned differently for different States while deciding the question on its validity,” Tamil Nadu said in a rejoinder affidavit of February 2. The court is hearing a petition filed by Tamil Nadu resident, Dinesh B., challenging the Tamil Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of seats in Educational Institutions and of appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Act of 1993. The law is protected under the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution from judicial review. Section 4 of the Act provides 30% reservation to the Backward Classes, 20% for Most Backward Classes and de-notified communities, 18% for Scheduled Castes and 1% for Scheduled Tribes. “Tamil Nadu is a pioneer in implementation of reservation in public employment and education. The policy of reservation is in practice since 1921 in this State,” the State’s affidavit said. The statute was enacted on July 19, 1994 with the President’s assent. It was placed under the Ninth Schedule to provide “special protection” in the light of the Indira Sawhney judgment. It was meant to protect, preserve and maintain the existing 69% quota, the affidavit said. It said there has been no stay on the quota. The 1994 law was enacted well within the powers of the State. The law helps to achieve the objective of Article 14 (right to equality) of protecting untouchables among untouchables and the weakest among the weaker sections. The affidavit said the Tamil Nadu government had, on December 21, 2020, constituted a Commission headed by former Madras HC judge, Justice A. Kulasekaran, for collection of quantifiable data on castes, communities and tribes. The last survey was in 1983, based on which the 69% reservation was provided, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-to-hear-plea-against-69-quota-in-tn/article33787249.ece

09 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Anti-cow slaughter Bill passed in Karnataka||Amid uproarious scenes with Opposition members tearing copies of the Bill and protesting in the Well of the House, the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, was passed by voice vote on Monday in the Legislative Council. This was even as the Opposition Congress and the Janata Dal (S), whose combined strength forms a majority in the House, demanded a division of vote. It may be recalled that with no support from the Janata Dal (S), the BJP had failed to get the Bill passed in the council during the last session in December 2020, forcing the government to promulgate an ordinance. The Bill was tabled again in the council on Monday. B.K. Hariprasad, Congress MLC, told presspersons that the government had “bulldozed” its way through and passed the Bill and that the Opposition would continue the protest on Tuesday. Significantly, the Janata Dal (S), which is in alliance with the BJP for the Council Chairman’s election scheduled to be held on Tuesday, also opposed the Bill. “Congress and Janata Dal (S) members raised objections to the Bill and sought a division of vote, which was not allowed. When the BJP does not independently hold a majority in the House, how can the Bill be passed by voice vote when division was sought?” Mr. Hariprasad questioned. Extended debate sought After nearly two hours of debate on the Bill on Monday, Congress and Janata Dal (S) members demanded an extended debate on the crucial Bill to be taken up on Tuesday. However, Deputy Chairman M.K. Pranesh said since the motion of thanks for the Governor’s speech was to be taken up for debate on Tuesday, the Bill had to be put to vote on Monday. Janata Dal (S) member Maritibbe Gowda objected to the restriction of debate, saying either the debate must be taken up on Tuesday or everyone must be given a chance to speak even if it meant an “all-night session”. Mr. Pranesh, however, restricted the time of the debate till 7.30 p.m., leading to protests. Mr. Pranesh took up the Bill for voting, leading to more outrage among the Opposition members. Some of the Congress members rushed to the Well of the House and tore copies of the Bill, while others, including Janata Dal (S) members went to the Speaker’s table and protested. Meanwhile, the BJP members raised slogans of “Gomata ki Jai”. Amidst the pandemonium, Mr. Pranesh put the Bill to voice vote and announced it had been accepted and adjourned the House till Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anti-cow-slaughter-bill-passed-in-karnataka/article33787104.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||No glacial lake found, landslip likely trigger: experts||Though the jury is still out, glaciologists and experts in rock sciences are converging on the view that the cause of the Chamoli deluge was most probably a landslip and not a glacial lake burst. A glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) occurs when a breach in the glacial lake causes a sudden surge downstream. Such lakes are formed when glaciers erode land, melt and over time become a large mass of water in the depression formed, and these can be breached, causing floods downstream. However, several scientists, based on an analysis of satellite images, have failed to spot any such lakes. The Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors and prepares monthly reports on the state of glacial lakes and waterbodies measuring 10 hectares and above via satellite. Nothing out of the ordinary was observed. However, it is possible that smaller pockets of water that have not been caught in the satellite images may have flooded. “There is a bit of a mystery and it will be some time before the causes can be determined,” CWC Director Sharat Chandra told The Hindu . The commission constituted a team of experts on Monday to investigate the deluge. Other experts opine that a large mass of rock or debris might have impacted the glacier and triggered an avalanche. ‘Extremely steep’ Kalachand Sain, Director, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, said apart from glacial lakes not being observed, the glaciers were extremely steep and prevented water from accumulating enough to form such lakes. “A sudden surge of water is surprising and had it been from a broken glacier, we would be seeing a continuous flow of water. Right now, this appears to have stemmed,” he said. On Monday morning, the official Twitter account of the CWC reported a “possible second wave of flood” in the early hours of Monday, with water-flow monitors recording a surge and then again ebbing within an hour. “The second wave doesn’t seem concerning and as of now water levels are back to normal.” The winter season would make it extremely hard and the ensuing damage to the connecting roadways make access difficult to reach the glaciers. Satellite data observations showed that until February 6, there was significant snow but the cover appears to have significantly reduced the next day. “What caused this reduction? Did anything happen upstream?... We need to figure out.” Mr. Sain said his colleagues — a team of five — were on the road to Joshimath, close to the spot, for further studies. Mohammad Farooq Azam, Assistant Professor, Glaciology & Hydrology, Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, offered a hypothesis again ruling out a GLOF. “We can now say with some belief that the incident occurred due to the fracture of a hanging glacier [about 0.2 sq. km in size] together with snow and rock avalanches, at a 5,600-metre altitude near the Trishul peak. Though it is hard to fully ascertain the source of the water and slurry, our current hypothesis is that the water accumulated locked in the debris-snow below the glacier was released when the glacier-rock mass fell. This was a drop of almost 2 km before hitting marshy land. Since the temperature in the region is sub-zero, river level is much lower than it would be in the monsoon.” Since 2017, debris and snow had been accumulating at the bottom of the glacier. The stream flowing out from it earlier was very clear, but after 2017, the glacier stream has been hidden below the accumulated debris-snow. It was possible that the debris-snow would have been absorbing and collecting water coming from the upstream glaciers and that could have been released when the ice-rock avalanche hit it, Mr. Azam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-glacial-lake-found-landslip-likely-trigger-experts/article33787131.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Red Fort: Cong. demands probe||Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the violence at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor parade on January 26 and accused the government of a well-organised conspiracy to ‘desecrate’ the monument while participating in the Motion of Thanks debate to the President’s Address in the Lok Sabha. The Lower House also witnessed a massive uproar when Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra made a reference to a former Chief Justice of India as members of the Treasury benches including Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal, calling it shameful and asking the Chair to expunge it. RSP MP N.K. Premachandran, who was presiding, said her remarks would be expunged if found objectionable. Speaking first from the Opposition, the Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha asked for JPC probe into the Red Fort incident, the alleged TRP scam and the purported WhatsApp conversation of a TV anchor that were linked to the Balakot airstrikes. He asked the government why it was ‘afraid’ of 18-year-old climate-activist Greta Thunberg for her support to the farmers. “With such a strong Home Minister like Amit Shah, how can some people reach the Red Fort, that too on January 26 when the highest level of security was in place in Delhi. Why isn’t there a proper investigation into it. It is actually a big, well-planned conspiracy to defame the farmers. The fact is that you have sent some vandals to the Red Fort to create vandalism. Forces within the government are behind it,” Mr. Chowdhury alleged. The Congress leader compared the situation in Delhi with Kabul, Baghdad and Syria, saying barricades, barbed wire and nails have been put in and around the sites of the farmers’ protests. “Farmers are at Delhi’s borders. More than 200 farmers have lost their lives. Why is the Prime Minister not talking to them? Why this arrogance ? You have a majority and you are trying to bulldoze through your majority. Don’t insult the farmers, don’t wage a war against the farmers. Are they your enemy?” he said in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Mr. Chowdhury alleged that the Central government had earlier conspired against the Muslims and now against the farmers. “We should not be afraid of debate. Dissent, disagreement and dialogue are the hallmark of our civilisation. Mahatma Gandhi had once said farmers are the kings. Given a chance, I would make a farmer the Governor-General,” he said quoting the Mahatma. He also asked the government to come clean on China’s alleged transgressions and noted that the Prime Minister had asserted that nobody had intruded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/red-fort-cong-demands-probe/article33787148.ece
09 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala govt. steps up surveillance in schools||The Kerala government has issued directives to enhance school-level surveillance against COVID-19. The directives were issued in the wake of reports that 190 students and 70 teachers of two government schools in Malappuram district had tested positive for COVID-19. Both schools have been closed for disinfecting. Principals and head teachers of State schools have been asked to ensure that all protocols related to COVID-19 issued by the Directorate of General Education are being followed strictly. Daily reports A communication calls for preparation of school COVID-19 cell reports every day and their handover to officials of the Health and Education Departments. Proper use of masks and sanitisers should be ensured. Teachers have been asked to ensure that students do not crowd bus stops near schools. If need be, principals or head teachers can depute teachers to monitor gatherings there. Senior education officials have been told to visit schools and send daily reports to the Director of General Education. Director of General Education Jeevan Babu K. told The Hindu that guidelines for following the COVID-19 protocol had already been issued to schools. Though these were in place, precautionary measures would be strengthened further so that any COVID-19 cases inside schools were contained. Measures such as use of masks and sanitisers, and physical distancing would be re-emphasised.  PTA meets planned As students could be exposed to COVID-19 not only in schools but outside too, meetings of parent-teacher associations would be convened. They would be given guidelines on reducing risks to the extent possible, as not much time remained for examinations, he said.

09 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||JNTBGRI wins patent, lists healer as an inventor||The Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) at Palode has been awarded a patent for a polyherbal formulation which boasts multiple therapeutic properties, but there is something more which makes this achievement truly unique and compelling. Scan the list of inventors of the novel formulation and you will come across the name T.M. Shahul Hamid Vaidyar, a traditional healer from Kollam. A first? This is possibly the first instance of a traditional healer being designated as an inventor of a patent alongside scientists, the JNTBGRI said. The institute terms it an innovative step in the protection of traditional knowledge and equitable sharing of benefits. The formulation, based on knowledge shared by Mr. Shahul Hamid, was validated by the JNTBGRI’s Ethnomedicine and Ethnopharmacology Division as having properties which could help battle diabetes, liver disorders, and fatigue. The full list of inventors include S. Rajasekharan, P.G. Latha, Shahul Hamid, S.R. Suja, and N.M. Krishnakumar. Eligible for benefits “Usually, scientific circles treat individuals such as Shahul Hamid as ‘informants’. By listing him as an inventor, he will be eligible for the benefits once the formulation gets commercialised,” R. Prakash Kumar, Director, JNTBGRI, told The Hindu . “We also hope that it will be an inspiration to others to do likewise. It will help bridge the gap between people or groups who possess such knowledge and the scientific community,” he said. Dr. Rajasekharan echoed this view. “We went ahead with Shahul Hamid signing the prior informed consent, the non-disclosure agreement, and the contractual agreement. Listing him as an inventor is an important step in a scenario where informants or custodians of knowledge often fail to get acknowledged,” he said. Under the pact, JNTBGRI scientists validated and modified the formulation after scrutinising each ingredient for establishing its efficacy for treating diabetes and liver disorders. “It also exhibited significant antioxidant and anti-fatigue effects. Pre-clinical studies, including short-term and long-term toxicity studies, were completed and the healer himself had conducted open trials on patients and found it successful,” the JNTBGRI said. Once the clinical trials are successfully carried out, the JNTBGRI will be ready to transfer the technology. Filed in 2011 The institute had filed for the patent in 2011. It was granted on February 1 this year. The patent is valid for a term of 20 years from September 4, 2011, in accordance with the provisions of the Patents Act, 1970.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jntbgri-wins-patent-lists-healer-as-an-inventor/article33787820.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC stays bail given to serial murder accused in Kerala||The Supreme Court on Monday stayed an order of the Kerala High Court granting bail to Jolly Joseph, the prime accused in the Koodathayi serial murders. “There shall be stay of release from custody of the respondent,” a Bench of Justices Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and Vineet Saran held. The High Court granted her bail on October 15 last year. The State of Kerala had appealed the bail order in the apex court. The High Court had dismissed the prosecution version that Jolly had confessed to her crimes. She is accused of poisoning six persons, including her former husband Roy Thomas. “If an accused in police custody gave a confession to the police that he committed the offence, the same is not admissible in the eye of law,” the High Court had reasoned. The High Court had also rejected the plea that bail for Jolly would spell danger to her life. It had declined the argument that she would influence the witnesses, who were mostly family members. The High Court had said that she would continue in jail despite bail because of her involvement in the other connected cases. The High Court had criticised the police and the media for sensationalising the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-bail-given-to-serial-murder-accused-in-kerala/article33787123.ece
09 February 2021||New Delhi,||Modi sees ‘ andolan jeevi’ and a new kind of ‘FDI’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday coined two terms —‘ andolan jeevi ’ (professional protesters) and ‘Foreign Destructive Ideology’ to lampoon the Opposition and certain protesters and foreign individuals who have tweeted in support of the farmers’ agitation. While replying to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Modi said that India was not merely the world’s largest democracy; it was the “mother of democracy”. A new kind of FDI had emerged in the country and it was “Foreign Destructive Ideology”. “We need to be more aware to save the country from such an ideology.” Mr. Modi spoke about a new breed of protesters — andolan jeevi , who could be seen at every agitation. “These parasites feast on every agitation. When they are not in the front, they operate from behind the curtains, they cannot survive without agitation,” he observed. “People who suspect India’s democracy, I want to ask them to learn to understand it. Our democracy is not a western institution, it is a human institution. India’s nationalism should be protected from multiple attacks,” he said. Recently international pop star Rihanna shared a news article of the ongoing farmers agitation on Twitter, asking why it wasn’t discussed enough. This prompted the government to issue a press statement saying it was “unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them.”  Our democracy is not a western institution, it is a human institution.

09 February 2021||New Delhi,||Azad gets a pat on the back from PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi showered praise on senior Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, asking other members to follow his example of a non-abrasive brand of politics. He also used the opportunity to take a dig at internal differences within the Congress. Mr. Azad is retiring on February 15. While addressing the House in response to the debate on the Motion of Thanks, Mr. Modi appreciated Mr. Azad for praising his government for conducting the civic polls in Jammu and Kashmir. He said Mr. Azad is a soft-spoken and polite person. “Ghulam Nabi ji is not known to use harsh words and I believe everyone here must learn from him. I respect him for this. He congratulates us for the elections in Kashmir.” Mr. Modi said that while he was happy that Mr. Azad had praised his government, he cautioned the Congress not to do the opposite, just because Mr. Azad has said so. “I hope that your party will take it in the right spirit. They shouldn’t make the mistake of doing just the opposite considering it as the view of G-23,” he said. His comments left the Treasury benches in splits. With Mr. Azad leading the group of 23 in the Congress, which argued for reforms in the internal working of the Congress and election of a party president, it is up for debate whether he will win a renomination to the House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/azad-gets-a-pat-on-the-back-from-pm/article33787153.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bengal elections become loud and clear in Lok Sabha||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s appeal to protesting MPs in the Lok Sabha finally got the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address off the ground after a week of disruption, but the debate itself reflected the heat being raised by the upcoming Assembly polls in Bengal. Repeated references to poet Rabindranath Tagore, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and even late president Pranab Mukherjee made Bengal a major flavour of the debate after the three contentious farm laws being protested by the farmers’ unions. ‘Cut money’ tradition BJP MP Locket Chatterjee, who initiated the debate on behalf of the Treasury benches, heaped encomiums on the Narendra Modi government’s handling of the pandemic and panned the Bengal government led by Mamata Banerjee for what she termed was the “cut money” tradition in the Trinamool Congress. “Mamata Banerjee sends her MPs to Singhu border but is on silent mode when it comes to the strike by para teachers in Kolkata as there is no scope for ‘cut money’,” she said. She accused the State government of stopping various Central schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi from being implemented again for lack of “cut money”. She said even relief sent to the State after Cyclone Amphan was pocketed by middlemen belonging to the TMC. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary responded to the Bengal references by pointing out that while it was good that the BJP, with an eye on the Bengal polls, was remembering Netaji in a big way, the Union government had replaced his name on a dock with that of Jan Sangh founder SP Mookerjee. “Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Shanti Niketan and claims Rabindranath Tagore was born there! At least do your studies. Then he [Mr. Shah] goes and sits on the chair used by Tagore. That’s showing disrespect,” he said. Hijacking Netaji Trinamool Congress leader Mohua Moitra’s references to the judiciary got several interruptions from the treasury and while she kept her speech mainly to the farmers’ movement, she packed in at least one broadside on the BJP’s appropriation of Netaji. “The Central government has made every attempt to hijack Netaji. But Netaji had given the chant of ‘Jai Hind’ and the BJP has replaced it with one that has narrow religious significance and is used to heckle minorities and to assert who is in charge,” she said with reference to the “Jai Shri Ram” at a recent function in Kolkata marking the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji where Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed she had been heckled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-elections-become-loud-and-clear-in-lok-sabha/article33787158.ece
09 February 2021||Bengaluru,||22% of targeted workers vaccinated||After healthcare workers, the vaccination drive for frontline workers in Karnataka began on Monday. According to the Department of Health and Family Welfare, as many as 18,763 frontline workers were vaccinated on Monday. A total of 22% of the 87,105 targeted frontline workers were vaccinated. Those vaccinated included pourakarmikas, police personnel and officials of the Revenue and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj departments, among others. In some districts, the response was poor. The lowest target of 5% was achieved by Chamarajnagar. The highest percentage was in Uttara Kannada district where 45% of the frontline workers took the jab. Ramesh, a pourakarmika who works at the Dattathreya Temple ward in Bengaluru, was one of the first frontline workers to be vaccinated in the presence of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at the K.C. General Hospital. He said he was eagerly waiting to get vaccinated as he spends a significant part of the day on the field which puts him at risk. In many districts, Deputy Commissioners and senior IPS officials took the jab to build confidence and encourage their staff to take the vaccine. The vaccination for frontline workers took place in all districts in the State barring Kodagu, where it will begin from Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/22-of-targeted-workers-vaccinated/article33787108.ece
09 February 2021||KOCHI,||Veterinary council warns against quacks||Kerala State Veterinary Council has warned the public against quacks who are passing for qualified veterinarians and treating animals, even as the council is reportedly facing a flood of complaints against frauds in the field of animal care in the State. A member of the State Veterinary Council said on Saturday the council had just investigated a case in which a milch animal, bought for about Rs. 80,000 by a farmer in Palakkad recently, died within 15 minutes of being medically treated by a person, who was not a qualified or registered veterinarian. Similarly, it has also come to the notice of the Veterinary Council that advertisements are issued in leading newspapers with contact numbers and promise of effective medical care for animals by people, whoare unqualified. Many fallouts The council member said that there is not only the risk of animals being killed by unqualified vets, but also the prospects of the poor farmers losing the insurance cover if the animals died after being treated by unqualified hands. There are other serious fallouts too, said a veterinarian, who did not want to be identified. The indiscriminate use of medicines, especially antibiotics and other sensitive animal care products, can lead to contaminations threatening human health. There is a larger threat because more and more zoonotic diseases are threatening humans. It has also been pointed out that lack of proper animal care results in big threats to human health. The veterinarian pointed out that the community of vets in the State are now mostly confined to their desks and office administration instead of being in the field taking care of animal health. The opinion is echoed by animal rights activist and coordinator for Daya Animal Welfare Organisation Ambily Purakkal. She said that veterinarians in the State are now mostly filling up registration forms. Ms. Ambily alleged that with veterinarians being tied up in office works, unqualified persons stand in for the vets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/veterinary-council-warns-against-quacks/article33787444.ece
09 February 2021||KALPETTA,||Kerala CM takes up sanctuary zone issue||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allay the apprehensions of the people in Wayanad over the recent draft notification of the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) that envisages a buffer zone around the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS). Mr. Vijayan, in a letter to Mr. Modi, said the State government had prepared recommendations for notifying ecosensitive zones (ESZ) around 21 protected areas in December 2019. The government after considering the genuine concerns of the people living near the sanctuaries submitted an amended proposal on January 13, 2020. According to the amended proposal for draft notification, the ESZ measures 88.2 sq km around the WWS. The present draft issued by the MOEFCC notifies 118.59 sq km around the WWS as ESZ. Densely populated areas The government is of the view that densely populated areas should be excluded while notifying ESZs. In the case of the WSS, areas such as Tholpetty, Kattkkulam, Panavalli, Kurukkanmoola, Chaligadha, Kappistore, Cheeyambam, Moodakolly, Sulthan Bathery, and Cheeral need to be excluded from the notification to allay farmers’ fears. Hence, the Prime Minister should intervene and give directives to the Ministry for an early hearing on the matter, the letter says. Chennithala’s view Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala also sought the intervention of the Prime Minister. He said the draft notification would create a feeling of insecurity in the farm community and should be repealed, he said in a letter to Mr. Modi. Meanwhile, a 12-hour hartal called by the United Democratic Front on Monday in the district in protest against the draft notification was near total and peaceful. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) district committee had staged road blockades on Sunday in protest against the notification. Farmers’ organisations too have intensified protest against the notification. Environmental organisations said political parties were misleading the people with an eye on the Assembly elections. Though Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had clarified that the notification would not affect farmers or farming activities, political parties and some religious organisations with the support of the resort and quarry mafia were misleading the public for vested interests, N. Badusha, president, Wayanad Prakurthi Samrakshana Samiti said. Farmers seek clarity P.M. Joy, chairman, Karshaka Munnany, a collective 15 farmer organisations in the district, said both the Central and State governments should bring clarity regarding the notification to allay the concerns of farmers. Though the politicians had to take the initiative, they were trying to hijack the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-cm-takes-up-sanctuary-zone-issue/article33787119.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Why not enact law to ensure MSP, farmer leaders ask PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Parliament on Monday was full of insults and empty talk, farm unions said responding to the remarks. If the government is serious about remunerative prices for farmers, then it needs to enact a law to guarantee them, and if it wishes to resume talks, then it must take steps to do so, union leaders said. The Prime Minister’s jibe about “ andolan jeevis ” , or professional protesters, evoked outrage. “Farmers would like to remind the PM that it is andolans that have liberated India from colonial rulers and that is why we are proud to be a ndolan jeevi ,” said a statement from the joint front of unions, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “It is the BJP and its predecessors that never did any andolan against Britishers and they were always against the andolans . They are still scared of public movements.” “This insult comes from a ‘corporate j eevi ’ Prime Minister whose RSS was never a part of the glorious andolan of the people of India against the slavery of British rule,” said Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha. ‘Insult to martyrs’ Noting that 200 people had died during the protests so far, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh spokesperson Abhimanyu Kohar added that it was “an insult to use such a term for martyrs”. With regard to the PM’s statement that minimum support prices (MSP) were here to stay, union leaders asked why Mr. Modi was unwilling to put a legal guarantee in place to back up his words. Rakesh Tikait, who leads one faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in Uttar Pradesh, said without an MSP law, farmers are exploited and cannot count on a fair price. “The way rates of a flight ticket fluctuate three to four times a day, the price of crops will not be decided the same way,” he told reporters. “Those wanting business over hunger will be driven out of the country,” he said. “Without an MSP law, his assurance is empty talk. It is the same with negotiations. If the government really wa-nts to restart talks, let them send us an invitation without terms and conditions. Otherwise, we also have terms and conditions. Should we say that we will not come for talks until the laws are repealed,” said Mr. Kohar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-not-enact-law-to-ensure-msp-farmer-leaders-ask-pm/article33787132.ece
09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||V.K. Singh statement on LAC ‘unwitting confession’: China||China’s Foreign Ministry on Monday said Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways and former Army Chief, Gen. V.K. Singh (retd), had made an “unwitting confession” by saying India had transgressed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on more occasions than China had. On Sunday, Gen. Singh said the border had never been demarcated, and while China had transgressed across the LAC up to its perception, India had done the same but the government did not announce it. “Similarly, none of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it,” he said. “Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” Gen. Singh said. ‘Confirming trespass’ China’s Foreign Ministry on Monday pointed to his statement as confirming “frequent acts of trespass” by India. Its spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, “This is an unwitting confession by the Indian side”. “For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions, which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border. We urge the Indian side to follow through on the consensus, agreements and treaties it reached with China, and uphold peace and stability in the border region with concrete actions,” he said. Gen. Singh’s statement was also highlighted by the Chinese media. “V. K. Singh, an Indian Union Minister of State, also former Army General, accidentally told truth of China-India border situation,” tweeted Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-run Global Times . “It’s India that breaks border status quo, China has to respond to it,” he said. Pointing fingers Last year, China’s official media similarly seized on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comments at an all-party meet saying “nobody has intruded”, in an attempt to justify the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) moves on the border. Those remarks were widely reported in China in and used to point the finger at India for last year’s crisis, which was triggered in May after the PLA mobilised a large number of troops, transgressed the border, and sought to unilaterally redraw the LAC in several areas in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vk-singh-statement-on-lac-unwitting-confession-china/article33787139.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pvt. hospitals await nod for vaccination||Awaiting the green signal from the Union government, private hospitals across India say they are all set to join hands to provide COVID-19 vaccination for the vulnerable population — those over 50 years and people with co-morbidities — and later others. “We have a plan in place but await directives from the government. And as far as the use of certain vaccines (India has approved emergency use of two vaccines), it totally depends on sanctions from the government,” said a statement issued by Max Hospital. Vaccine tracker Apollo Hospitals, which has launched a COVID-19 vaccine tracker, said its objective was to “host a dedicated platform wherein users will be able to voluntarily register themselves and keep abreast of the latest update around vaccine development. The data collected from individuals is kept in a highly secured environment with safety protocols.” Using technology “It is imperative that we leverage the power of technology in every step of the way. Technology will yet again play a large role in ensuring that all citizens have access to the vaccine and how it will be administered and prioritised,” an Apollo Hospital official told The Hindu . Manipal Hospital said its registration portal for vaccination was closed for now for those other than healthcare workers. Meanwhile, India registered 84 COVID fatalities in the past 24 hours with six States accounting for 79.76% of these — Maharashtra reported the most casualties with 30 new fatalities followed by Kerala with 19 daily deaths, noted a release issued by the Health Ministry on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pvt-hospitals-await-nod-for-vaccination/article33787675.ece
09 February 2021||New Delhi,||PM’s speech had no substance, says Cong.||The Congress on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply in the Rajya Sabha to the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to the joint session of Parliament did not have substance or offer any solution to the farmers’ protest over the new farm laws. On Mr. Modi’s comment that the people did not understand the contents of the farm laws, senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge termed it “misleading”. Mr. Kharge was speaking at a joint press conference with his Rajya Sabha colleagues — Deepender Hooda, Shaktisinh Gohil, Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Naseer Hussain — soon after Mr. Modi’s speech. “In the wake of the farmers’ agitation, we expected that the PM would take back the laws and bring them back to Parliament after consulting with all the stakeholders. But he didn’t mention that. He only said people are agitating without understanding the contents of the law,” Mr. Kharge said. Mr. Gohil said the people were hoping for a solution to the over 70-day farmers’ protests but the PM had disappointed everyone. “Farmers have only met with disappointment, it is unfortunate that the government has not been able to understand the gravity of the situation,” Mr. Hooda said. . Congress’ chief whip in the Upper House, Jairam Ramesh, countered Mr. Modi’s new definition of FDI with his own. “In Parliament today, PM Modi said FDI is also ‘Foreign Destructive Ideology’. This from someone whose governance has been based solely on FDI — Fear, Deception, Intimidation,” he tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pms-speech-offered-no-answer-to-farmers-agitation/article33787135.ece
09 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Governor seeks report from Sanskrit varsity||Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Monday sought a report from the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, on the controversy surrounding the appointment of R. Ninitha, wife of Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] leader M.B. Rajesh, as an assistant professor in the Malayalam department at the university. The university had come under fire from the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for ‘perverting’ the selection process and ‘passing over’ eligible candidates to appoint Ms. Ninitha in the Muslim reservation category. Both parties had separately highlighted her appointment as emblematic of the entrenched nepotism in the CPI(M) and the LDF government. They had targeted Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) State president A.A. Rahim and A.N. Shamsheer, MLA, with similar charges. The leaders had denied the allegations.  Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala sought to make an election issue out of the slew of ‘back-door appointments’ by the government. CPI(M) workers and their families had hugely benefited from the flurry of regularisations at the fag end of the administration’s tenure. He released a list of relatives of top CPI(M) functionaries accorded well-salaried jobs in public sector entities and government-owned corporations. The government had made it a practice not to report vacancies to the Public Service Commission (PSC). It had made over 3.5 lakh illegal appointments by circumventing the PSC selection process. Industries Department and Kerala Bank were bywords for favouritism in appointments. If voted to power, the UDF would make non-reporting of vacancies by department heads a criminal offence. The BJP also accused the government of defrauding unemployed youth by bending rules to appoint CPI(M) members and their relatives in government jobs. The State had also witnessed a tide of street protests against the ‘back-door appointments.’ They seemed to take a risky turn on Monday with a PSC rank holder dousing himself with kerosene in front of the Secretariat and threatening to set himself on fire. Organisations of persons waiting appointment via the PSC are on a strike in front of the edifice. The government has promised to extend the span of PSC rank lists. CPI(M)’s defence CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan defended the appointments. The government had regularised persons who were on the jobs for more than 10 years. The previous UDF government had contracted most of them. They earned a pittance compared to permanent employees doing the same work. If retired, the workers would struggle to find another job, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/governor-seeks-report-from-sanskrit-varsity/article33787384.ece
09 February 2021||Patna,||Nitish Kumar to expand Bihar Cabinet today||After much delay and speculation, the Nitish Kumar Cabinet will be expanded on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier on Monday, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the expansion would take place when the BJP’s list was given to him. Late on Tuesday night the CM’s secretariat confirmed that the new ministers will take oath of office at 12.30 p.m. at Raj Bhawan. Party sources told The Hindu that there will be nine ministers from BJP quota while, eight will be from alliance partner JD(U). Earlier on November 16, the Nitish Kumar Cabinet of 14 ministers, including the Chief Minister, had taken oath. With an Assembly of 243 members, there can be a maximum 36 ministers in the Cabinet. Names of young BJP leaders like Sanjiv Chaurasia, Nitin Navin, Neeraj Kumar Babloo, Shahnawaz Hussain, Subhas Singh, Samrat Chaudhury have been floated as new ministers. Similarly, names of JD(U) MLAs Shrawan Kumar, Sanjay Jha, Jayant Kumar, Lesi Singh, Sumit Kumar and Jama Khan who recently had joined the party after winning on Bahujan Samaj Party ticket from Kaimur are doing rounds. Both the ruling alliance parties are said to be for giving opportunities to young faces. State BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal on Saturday had said the Cabinet expansion would take place before the Assembly session scheduled from February 19. Mr Kumar on Monday said, “It (Cabinet expansion) will done when list of (BJP) candidates come. It will be done soon”. Mr Kumar, earlier too, had said that “it has never been so late as I’ve been allocating portfolios of ministry on the same day”. According to sources, BJP has been doing a lot of “long-term mathematics and social engineering” in finalising its list of ministers. “It is in that process BJP brought in senior party leader and former Union Minister Shahnawaz Hussain. Bihar BJP leaders have also been meeting party’s central leadership in Delhi as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nitish-kumar-to-expand-bihar-cabinet-today/article33787761.ece

09 February 2021||Srinagar,||Gupkar alliance sees setback in DDCs||The Gupkar alliance, an amalgam of five political parties, on Monday witnessed a further slide in the election to the District Development Council (DDC) Chairman posts in the Kashmir Valley despite the numbers, while the BJP won Udhampur and Doda districts in the Jammu region. Officials said Independent candidate Nazir Ahmad Khan, who quit the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to contest against the Gupkar alliance’s joint candidate from the National Conference (NC), was declared the winner from Budgam in central Kashmir, despite the alliance having 10 votes out of 14 sub-district segments. “It was a tie between Mr. Khan and the NC candidate, with both bagging seven votes. A draw was organised and Mr. Khan emerged the winner,” an official said. At Kupwara in north Kashmir, the Sajad Lone-led Peoples Conference candidate Irfan Panditpuri won the Chairman’s post. Mr. Lone’s party, which recently quit the Gupkar alliance, had won five seats in Kupwara, followed by the NC with four seats. The Gupkar alliance needed four more votes to win. However, many NC candidates did not turn up to vote. Meanwhile, in a bid to cosy up to the PC, the J&K Apni Party (JKAP), having ideological proximity with the BJP with regard to issues such as Article 370 and special status, decided to abstain from voting in Kupwara and threw its support behind Safeena Baigh, an Independent candidate for the post in Baramulla. The election for the DDC Chairman and Vice-Chairman in Baramulla was adjourned due to a lack of the prescribed quorum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gupkar-alliance-sees-setback-in-ddcs/article33787146.ece

Congress leaders were called ‘American agents’. Thousand protests were organised but Lal Bahadur Shastri moved forward and today we have surplus production,” Mr. Modi said. Stating that the government wanted to accept good suggestions, Mr. Modi urged the Opposition members to take the country forward by explaining the good features of the laws to the farmers. “Agriculture Minister is talking to farmers. There is no tension yet. Protest is your right but I want to request that you should ask the elderly farmers who are sitting there to go home. We should give these reforms an opportunity and see if they benefit you. If there is a lacuna, we will fix it,” he said. Quoting former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was present in the House, Mr. Modi told the Congress that they should be proud that “Modi is implementing what Manmohan Singh said”. Every party had promised farm reforms at some point of time, he said. “The fun part is people who do politics, they have also implemented the laws in some form or the other. They have not questioned the spirit of law. Look at milk production, either private or cooperatives, a strong supply chain has emerged. This was not done only during my government,” he said. “We also face challenges. We have to decide if we want to be a part of solution or part of the problem... A major part of the discussion was about the farmers’ agitation but not on the features of the law,” the PM said. Mr. Modi quoted former Prime Minister Charan Singh on small farmers. Obliquely touching on the ongoing India-China stand-off, Mr. Modi said, “My government’s stand on the situation at LAC is very clear. The entire country can see this and is very proud of us.

However, just ahead of the Athibelle checkpost in Karnataka, a few hundred meters from the inter-State border, she changed to another vehicle, which also sported an AIADMK flag. Minutes later, the convoy rolled into T.N. The reason for the change of vehicle was unclear. However, video footage of a minor brush with a minivan that found itself amid the convoy in Karnataka was circulated on social media, soon after. In Zuzuvadi in Hosur, tense moments prevailed, when the police stopped Ms. Sasikala’s vehicle and demanded that she collect the notice for violating the police order forbidding the use of AIADMK flag. Earlier, in a late night directive on Sunday, Krishnagiri Superintendent of Police Bandi Gangadhar had warned against the use of the AIADMK party flags by Ms. Sasikala or her loyalists. The police also forbid a convoy of more than five vehicles tailing Ms. Sasikala vehicle.

A team comprising of Krishnagiri Additional Superintendent of Police Shaktivel, Hosur Deputy Superintendent of Police Murali, and witnessed by Hosur Tahsildar Senthil issued the notice to Ms. Sasikala’s legal representative. The police also got an acknowledgement of the receipt of the notice. The police, however, did not remove the flag.

09 February 2021||Hyderabad,||Three held for duping over 20,000 depositors||Three people who duped more than 20,000 people across the country to the tune of Rs. 50 crore were arrested by the Cyberabad police, in Hyderabad on Monday. Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said that two Chinese nationals, who are currently at large, are the kingpins behind the multi-crore financial fraud. He said that the victims were asked to invest money offering huge returns, in the name of ‘Shared Bike (BK) and Sharing Economy’ and promised 11 % interest per day. “Around 4.5 times return to their investment was promised in 90 days,” Mr. Sajjanar said. Police froze Rs. 3 crore in 10 bank accounts and seized four laptops and three mobile phones from their possession. The accused, Uday Pratap (41) from Gurugram, Haryana, was the authorised signatory for an account with a private bank at Kukatpally of Mobicentric Technologies, which is one of the fraudulent companies and he was also director of Corporfountain India Private Limited, Gurugram. Other arrested are Nitesh Kumar Kothari (36) from Dwarka, Delhi, and Rajesh Sharma (36) of Gurugram. They were taking instructions from Chinese nationals, Zhang Hongwei alias Peter and Peng Guowei aka Javie. According to the police commissioner, Kothari and Sharma were involved in the mobile application development of ‘www.ciciseo.com’ and current directors of Adstuck Consulting Private Limited. They operated from the office of Adstuck Consulting Private Limited and Corporfountain India Private Limited, from Spaze i-Tech Park, Gurugram, while Uday Pratap and fugitive Peng Guowei were the present directors of Corporfountain India Private Limited. Explaining the modus operandi, Mr. Sajjanar said that the accused through different WhatsApp admins across the country shared the information about ‘Shared BK and Sharing Economy’ widely inviting investments or deposits in their following schemes assuring 4.5 times returns on the deposits in 90 days. Gullible people got attracted to the schemes and shared their personal and bank details through links from www.ciciseo.com and became members. The payment was made through the Razorpay payment gateway. “Depositors would pay by clicking the link received on their registered phone number and this would reflect as virtual balance in their mobile app. As per the scheme, the returns on the sum invested will be shown in the ‘withdrawal or pending payments’ and credited to depositors’ bank account,” Mr.Sajjanar said, adding that the app stopped functioning from January 25 last. Initially, the people were suspicious about ‘returns on investments’ through schemes of Rs. 300 and Rs. 3,000. “When they started receiving credits into their bank accounts, they became more influenced and went on investing in plans of Rs. 30,000 and its multiples. Besides, they have also shared about it with their relatives and friends, which has resulted in an increase in the number of depositors and volume of business in the sharing economy,” the officer said. An investigation by the Economic Offences Wing of Cyberabad revealed that the money paid by the depositors has been credited to the bank accounts of fraudulent Indian companies registered with ‘Razorpay’ payment gateway through various Chinese websites. When verified with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), the addresses of companies, which were registered at Delhi, Kanpur, Pune and Bengaluru, were found to be fake and they do not exist. “In coordination with the RBI, ROCs and other concerned agencies we will try to elicit more information about Chinese directors and payment receipts pertaining to investments of various China-based companies, apps, and also the involvement of Indian companies and their directors in the fraud,” Mr. Sajjanar said. He said that efforts are on to apprehend the absconding accused. He requested people to refrain from investing in such fraudulent schemes. “There is no shortcut to earn money and do not be fooled by hope. If any company approaches with similar offers and attractive schemes, people must inform the police,” he added.  Fake companies:  1. Alidada Technologies Private Limited, RoC - Bengaluru  2. Ashenfallous Technologies Private Limited, RoC - Kanpur  3. Bridge Tera Technologies Private Limited, RoC – Kanpur  4. Cybertel Infotech Private Limited, RoC - Pune  5.

09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hydropower projects in Uttarakhand vulnerable||The hydropower projects in Uttarakhand are particularly vulnerable to damage by extreme flooding events, such as the deluge in the Rishiganga river on Sunday that damaged at least two plants. The 13.2-MW Rishiganga project is classified as a “small hydropower” project (<25 MW) and there are seven such projects under various stages of development in Uttarakhand, according to a response to a question in the Lok Sabha in July 2019. There are eight projects above 25 MW and the damaged Tapovan-Vishnugadh project being developed by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) falls into this category, according to a reply to a question last September. In the aftermath of the cloudburst in June 2013 that killed at least 5,000 and destroyed several large projects, experts have pointed out that those above an elevation of 2,200 metres were a recipe for disaster. “We had warned about this,” said Ravi Chopra of the People’s Science Institute, who submitted a report to the Supreme Court in 2013 on the role of the projects in floods. “This is a para-glacial zone and a combination of snow, water and ice is a deadly combination that wrecks everything in its path. Unless officials who allow commissioning of such projects are held accountable, this will continue,” he told The Hindu . The eight major projects in Uttarakhand are the 171-MW Lata Tapovan (NTPC) Central; 520-MW Tapovan Vishnugad (NTPC), 1,000-MW Tehri PSS (THDC) Central, 444-MW Vishnugad Pipalkoti (THDC); 60-MW Naitwar Mori (SJVNL); 120-MW Vyasi (UJVNL), 76-MW Phata Byung (LANCO) a private company commissioned project and the 99-MW Singoli Bhatwari (L&T).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hydropower-projects-in-uttarakhand-vulnerable/article33787129.ece

There are genuine cases also...” Mr. Raju said the case would be encroaching into policy domain. Justice Khanwilkar said, “Policies are made keeping in mind contemporaneous situation. If you want it done, you can get it done”. Mr. Raju submitted, “All these last-attempt candidates had appeared in the October 4 prelims last year. Had they not been able to prepare well, they could have opted out and benefitted from the one-time relaxation. They took the chance in 2020.

After a photo showing Mr. Kunnappilly receiving the sketch of the proposed Ram Temple from someone identified as ‘district pracharak’ began doing the rounds on social media with a note that he had contributed to the fund for the temple construction, Mr. Kunnappilly told The Hindu that he was in a hurry when a bunch of people approached his personal assistant, and “the impression given was that they were raising funds for the Iringole shrine at Perumbavoor.” He said, “I gave them Rs. 1,000, but even if they said it was for the Ram Temple, I would still have given whatever I can. When they gave me a sketch of the Ram Temple, I received it, as its construction was inaugurated by the honourable Prime Minister in the wake of a court verdict. I donate for any temple or mosque. As a Christian in India, I am indebted to the Hindus. But I was unaware that the people who approached me were from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) [ The Hindu could not verify this independently] and were doing this to make me a laughing stock,” he said over the phone. ‘Nothing wrong in it’ Asked if it was morally right to donate for the Ram Temple, he said there was nothing wrong in it, as even Muslims did not have any objection in a temple coming up in Ayodhya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-regrets-about-donating-for-ram-temple-mla/article33787819.ece

Mr. Singh, 33, a welder, was the first to be rescued from one of the two blocked tunnels at Tapovan. A video where he is seen wriggling out of the tunnel, overwhelmed, chanting slogans in ode to the famous Badrinath temple, has since gone viral. Mr. Singh, a resident of Joshimath, recalled the seven gruelling hours he spent in the tunnel with his colleagues, till they were rescued by a team of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel. “The tunnel, about four metres high, was covered in a mix of debris and water for up to three metres,” he said on the phone from the ITBP’s hospital in Joshimath. Mr. Singh said it was a faint network on his phone that saved them. “We managed to drag ourselves up to 350 metres to the end of the tunnel, where we saw some light... I noticed that my BSNL phone had network. I first called my office manager and then my brother,” he said. An ITBP team, deployed 15 km away, was rushed to the tunnel. Efforts are on to rescue those stuck in the second tunnel at Tapovan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-phone-call-that-saved-a-dozen-lives/article33787137.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi, Biden hold talks over phone||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden. It was the first conversation between the two leaders since Mr. Biden took office on January 20. “We discussed regional issues and our shared priorities. We also agreed to further our cooperation against climate change. President Biden and I are committed to a rules based international order. We look forward to consolidating our strategic partnership to further peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” Mr. Modi said.

09 February 2021||Bengaluru,||HC sets aside decision to hold law exams for intermediate semesters Some students had questioned the correctness of BCI and KSLU communications||In a relief to thousands of students in the State, the Karnataka High Court on Monday quashed the decisions of the Bar Council of India and the Karnataka State Law University (KSLU) to hold exams for intermediate (even) semesters between first year and fourth year of the five-year law course. While setting aside the timetable announced by KSLU through the notifications issued on January 13 and January 29, for the first year to fourth year students, the court said the varsity may announce a fresh timetable for first to fourth year students, scheduling examinations of the odd semesters only. In so far as even semesters went, the court directed KSLU that the same shall be assessed on the basis of internal assessment of students to an extent of 50% of the total marks, and the remaining 50% of the marks should be based on their performance in the previous year, if available. The marks card shall also be issued on such assessment with respect to the even semesters. The order was passed by R. Devdas while allowing petitions filed by law student Ritvik Balanagraj B. of Bengaluru and several others. The petitioner-students had questioned the correctness of BCI November 1, 2020 and the KSLU November 9, 2020, communications for holding exams for the intermediate semesters while contending that the decision was contrary to the April 29, 2020 guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in view of COVID-19 pandemic situation as well as the apex court’s judgement of upholding UGC’s guidelines. “The decisions of BCI and KSLU not being arrived at on the basis of any expert opinion unlike the guidelines issued by the UGC, this court is of the considered opinion that if not all the exams, at least the even semester exams of the first year to fourth year intermediate semester law students require cancellation,” the court observed in its order while upholding contentions of the petitioner-students. “There is nothing on record which would convince this court that there was any material before BCI to deviate from the guidelines issued by UGC,” Justice Devdas observed, while pointing out that BCI, in all its guidelines, had referred to UGC guidelines and had not appointed any expert committee to go into the issues of law university and the law students in view of COVID-19 pandemic as was done by UGC. The HC also noticed that KSLU had not applied its mind and had not given consideration to the interestS of students as it had published the timetable for intermediate semester in such a way that the students were forced to write 12 exams, six of the intermediate semester and another six for the end-of the-year semester.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-sets-aside-decision-to-hold-law-exams-for-intermediate-semesters-some-students-had-questioned-the-correctness-of-bci-and-kslu-communications/article33787105.ece

The advertisement was funded by the Sikh community of Fresno, a city in central California, according to a grateful tweet from the Kisan Ekta Morcha handle, which is the official voice of the protesters. The 30-second spot in this year’s Super Bowl cost $5.5 million, and last year’s viewership of the championship was around 100 million. Martin Luther quote The commercial begins with a quote from Martin Luther King: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”. Images from the farmers’ tractor parade and their border camps are overlaid with text alleging human rights violations against protesters. Punjabi music plays as “No Farmers, No Food, No Future” flashes on the screen. It includes a message from Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer. “We want you to know, our brothers and sisters in India, that we stand with you,” he says. Fresno has a large Sikh population, as high as 40,000, according to some local reports. Pop music icon Rihanna’s viral tweet on the protests also gets a mention. “Fresno City community put that ad during the Super Bowl. This is great work by community to aware people regarding Farmers Protest. Thank you Fresno Sikh Community,” said the Kisan Ekta Morcha tweet.

Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy said J&K had been witnessing speedy development after its conversion from a State to Union Territory in August 2019. Mr. Reddy said the region would be connected by train by December 2022 and would have an elevated light rail system. Already 100% electrification had been achieved. By September 2022, the government aimed to provide 100% piped water in rural households. “Both the Centre and the J&K government are trying to develop the region and will do more. Due to coronavirus, we could not reach the set target,” the Minister said in reply to a debate on the Bill. Local body polls Not only were elections to the rural and urban bodies held, they were strengthened, giving them the responsibility of the midday meal scheme, Anganwadi programme and the MGNREGA. Grievance boxes were installed in the panchayats, he said. Stating that about 54% of the work has been completed under the PM’s development package for J&K, he said some 20 projects, including Central and Union Territory projects, had been executed. Opposition query Initiating the debate, Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad reminded the government that Home Minister Amit Shah had said the Union Territory status was only a temporary measure and statehood would be restored soon. “I want to ask Home Minister Amit Shah, if the present cadre was working well, then what was the need to merge it,” Mr Azad said. No new industries have been set up in the region; instead the ones that were there have also been shut down, Mr Azad said. “Of the 12,997 industries in Jammu, only 5,890 are functional, while 7,160 i.e. 60% are closed... development remains stalled,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-clears-bill-to-merge-jk-cadre-with-agmut/article33787150.ece

09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New tiger reserve may help save Vaigai||The Srivilliputhur Megamalai Tiger Reserve is officially the fifth tiger reserve in Tamil Nadu. In a government order issued on Monday, Forests Secretary Sandeep Saxena announced the creation of the reserve. An area of 1,01,657.13 hectares or 1,016.5713 sq km in the Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary, Srivilliputhur, and the Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary have been combined to create the reserve. “With this new tiger reserve, Vaigai river and its catchments will be fully protected. The river, battling for its life, will be saved. This will help in the long-term sustenance of people in several southern districts,” said a senior official of the Forest Department. “With the creation of the Periyar and Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserves, the water needs of several southern districts have mostly been taken care of. With the new Srivilliputhur Megamalai Tiger Reserve, the forests will be better protected and the Vaigai and its tributaries will start flowing again,” said T.S. Subramaniya Raja of the Wildlife Association of Rajapalayam. “We have seen how the formation of tiger reserves has kept the rivers perennial — be it the Tamirabarani because of the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve or the Bhavani and the Moyar because of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, or even the Periyar,” noted an activist. The concept note says tiger disperses in large areas, and such dispersals are important for the exchange of genes. a process that is essential for the long-term growth of a population. In Tamil Nadu, the Anamalai Tiger Reserve provides one of the largest habitats for the tigers and other co-predators. However, factors of environmental stress such as availability of prey and potential males and absence of human-caused disturbances could make the tigers move and give rise to a metapopulation that could generate more genetic resources for populations to grow more. Significant habitats Now, tigers from the neighbouring Periyar Tiger Reserve and the Anamalai Tiger Reserve can find significant habitats and breeding and home ranges in the highly undulating terrains of Srivilliputhur and Megamalai. ln fact, the forested habitats of the Srivilliputhur region, which are largely uninhabited and undisturbed, can provide excellent buffering grounds to the tigers of the Periyar Tiger Reserve as much as they can offer excellent genetic exchange grounds for the tigers of the Anamalai region. “Tiger comes at the end. Tigers, forests, rivers, climate change. It is a continuum. The creation of the new reserve will help us get the required technical and financial support at the national and international level to protect and preserve this tiger landscape,” the senior official of the Forest Department emphasised. “With the origins of the Vaigai heavily encroached, the river is dying. Now, the government has shown that it is farmer-friendly and that the lives of one crore people dependent on the river in the five districts are important and not the votes of about 4,000 encroachers. The encroachers have to be removed as per the Madras High Court order,” said a Theni-based activist, requesting anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-tiger-reserve-may-help-save-vaigai/article33787289.ece
09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Unregulated industrial growth hits life, livelihood||The civic conditions in 131 villages and two towns under the Gummidipoondi Assembly constituency stem from a delicate mix of ruthless industrial development, failing agriculture and deteriorating public health. Ahead of the election, residents point to the rising pollution of land, water and air caused by more than 100 industrial units, leading to a steady decline of agriculture. As the constituency is represented by the AIADMK, parties like the DMK have launched village-level meetings to address civic issues. Signboards have been erected in villages like Sirupuzhalpettai, warning the industrial units against dumping of hazardous waste in the residential neighbourhoods. The local bodies have erected boards in villages advising people not to buy or sell ‘poromboke’ land. No bus services S. Murugammal of MGR Nagar says villages such as Reddipalayam, Muthureddikandigai, Sirupuzhalpettai and MGR Nagar do not have bus services. “We had bus services during MGR rule. During the rule of Amma [Jayalalithaa], we got mini-buses. Now all the buses have stopped operations to this area. We have to pay Rs. 120 for autorickshaws to reach the market. Our wage is Rs. 140 a day,” she says. “We want fresh air. Pollution is high at certain times of the day. We do not know the reason,” says P. Santhi, a resident. Farming turns unviable V. Munusamy, a farmer of Guruvaraja Kandigai, says he has been unable to farm his four acres because he was asked to pay Rs. 16,000 towards electricity charges for pumping the groundwater. “Our farmland is located a few kilometres away from the SIPCOT industrial complex. We used to grow traditional paddy varieties, depending on borewell. We have stopped farming as we were asked to pay huge sums towards commercial electricity charges,” he says. Farmers who could not grow traditional rice varieties have started raising eucalyptus, which depletes the groundwater. Farmers say they get Rs. 2,000 for every tonne of eucalyptus after raising it without water for five years. “We stopped paddy cultivation and switched to eucalyptus plantations,” says P. Mahesh of Pathapalayam. “Over 100 electors in the age group of 20-29 in our village are unemployed after completing higher education. The condition is worse because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The local youth have started demanding jobs at the industrial units that have polluted their villages. The local residents have been denied jobs and business opportunities by the management of these units. Many of the industrial employees and entrepreneurs are from northern States. So many local residents depend only on agriculture for livelihood,” Mr. Mahesh says. Campaign for jobs Ahead of the election, the residents have started a campaign to demand jobs in the polluting industries as a compensation for the deteriorating health of their family members. A section of the residents has demanded better regulations by government agencies to prevent pollution. “More than 1,000 residents in villages around Gummidipoondi have kidney ailments because of industrial pollution. As the government facilities are inadequate, the families of the patients have requested better facilities for dialysis,” says D. Chalapathi, a resident. Residents have also protested against industrial units processing huge quantities of biomedical waste in their villages. Opposition to the copper industry has gained momentum after the protest against the Sterlite Corporation’s copper smelter in Thoothukudi. Residents of many villages have complained about crop damage from flooding this monsoon. Some have demanded ‘patta’ for ‘neernilai poromboke’ land and ‘meikaal poromboke’ land. Gummidipoondi MLA K.S. Vijaya Kumar says the Chief Minister has assured the villagers of ‘patta’. “Over 4,000 families are expected to benefit from the decision to issue ‘patta’ for this land.” Residents have demanded a high-level bridge along the stretch from Mangalam to Arani. Many roads are closed for over 10 days when rivers like the Kosasthalaiyar are flooded every monsoon. “The number of higher secondary schools has increased from 10 to 17 in the past five years. All schools have furniture now. Eight villages have got bus services in the past five years,” Mr. Vijaya Kumar says.  Over 4,000 families are expected to benefit from govt. decision to issue ‘patta’ for ‘neernilai poromboke’ and ‘meikaal poromboke’ land K.S.

09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Colleges reopen but only 60% of students return to campuses||The first day of this academic year was one of a kind, with the freshers unable to interact with their seniors. Many colleges reported 60% attendance on Monday. The government had issued an order last week permitting colleges to reopen to all students, following standard operating procedures. Some colleges decided to keep first-year students out of the campus and others staggered the classes for senior-year students. “We will have to wait and watch as we are not confident enough to ask all the students to come. Since the Directorate of College Education has not provided any guideline, each principal takes a call as per the college’s strength and infrastructure,” said a faculty member at Loganatha Narayanasamy Government College, Ponneri. The college, which has a student strength of 5,000, including 1,500 in the first year, saw around 60% attendance. “That is the situation in most colleges. Students from the local areas came but those who had to commute long distances using public transport had difficulty,” said a professor. First- and second-year undergraduate students were asked to come while online classes were offered for final-year students, he added. The Chennai Institute of Technology, affiliated to Anna University, continued to offer online classes to first-year students. The university’s schedule had to be adhered to, pointed out principal A. Ramesh. “Even if we ask the students to come, it may be for just a week. We plan to open on February 22 for the first-year students. As per schedule for the first semester, the last working day is February 15, and from February 26, they will have practical exams. From March 4, they must undergo theory exams, all of which will be conducted online. Even model exams will be conducted online. So we decided to permit students to complete their course work before coming to college,” he said. Lalitha Balakrishnan, principal of MOP Vaishnav College, said that though in the beginning of the academic year, many final-year students wanted to spend some time in the college, the mood had since changed. “I thought they will all come, but I think either they’ve got used to the new normal or still the fear has not gone. We are conducting online classes,” she said. For students, the lack of interaction was a disappointment. R. Varshini, a final-year undergraduate student of SDNB Vaishnav College, said her institution had called only the first-year students. She had not met any of the freshers yet, she said.

Sunil Kumar, Siddha Central Research Institute, Arumbakkam, M. Senthil Kumar, Department of Botany, Vivekanandha College for Arts and Sciences for Women (Autonomous) Erode and a research student S.A. Wasim Akram. “We first found it in a coffee estate in Yercaud and again in Servarayan hills during our subsequent visits. We checked the existing literature on plant species and herbarium collections and could not find any description of the new species,” Mr. Abdul Kader said. He said the genus Passiflora L. belonging to Passifloraceae family contains about 550 species and are distributed mostly in the Americas. “Only about 20 species occur in India, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, and in the islands of Oceania. Of the 20 species only two of them are native to India. Now we have found one more native species,” he explained. Asked how did he come to the conclusion that it was a new native species, Mr. Kader said of the 13 species so far documented in Tamil Nadu 12 were exotic. “The new species resembles the exotic plant Passiflora. Suberosa L. in solitary axillary apetalous white flower. But its three-lobed leaves are extremely thin. It comparatively has a long petiole (leaf stalk) and pedicel (flower stalk) and short corona. The fruit is a green berry and turns red after ripening,” he said.  We presented it at the International Conference on Innovative and Emerging Trends in Botany in 2019, held at Alagappa University||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/scientists-find-new-climber-plant-species-in-tamil-nadu/article33787911.ece
09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown has revived practice of lawyers indulging in land grabbing: HC||It appears that COVID-19 lockdown period has revived the despicable practice of advocates indulging in illegal activities of grabbing properties, the Madras High Court has said after coming across three such incidents in the last one month. It has called for a report from the city police regarding lawyers who attempted to grab a house at George Town. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh wrote: “This practice was prevalent in the past and due to stringent action taken by this court, by suspending some of the advocates, the situation was brought under control. It looks like the lockdown has again revived this despicable practice… It is high time that this court again comes down heavily and stops such activities before they go out of control.” He went on to state: “When it comes to conduct of advocates, there will be zero tolerance shown by this court. It has to be ensured that the activities of some advocates do not spoil the image of the entire profession.” He directed the police to list the advocates involved in the George Town incident by March 2 so that a complaint could be made to the Bar Council. The orders were passed after directing the police to provide protection for the property. Its owner had complained that some unruly elements, along with a group of advocates, had attempted to break open the locks and were continuing to create law and order problem. The judge pointed out that the landlord had rented out the property in 2012. The house spread over 2,163 square feet on Coral Merchant Street at Muthialpet was rented out for Rs. 20,000 per month. In 2019, the landlord called upon the tenant to vacate the premises because of default in payment of rent and failure to renew the agreement. The tenant sought three months to vacate but ended up filing an anti-eviction suit before a city civil court. Subsequently, the tenant obtained an ex-parte decree in his favour by submitting a forged sale deed before the trial court. An address of a liquor shop was given as the address of the landlord in the suit and the court was made to believe, with the connivance of the bailiff, as if the summons were served on the landlord and yet he did not enter appearance to contest the suit. When all these instances were brought to the notice of Justice P.T. Asha on October 1, 2020, she found prima facie material for the charge of perjury and directed the Registrar General of the High Court to lodge a police complaint. Despite all this, the illegal activities continued forcing the landlord to move the present writ petition seeking police protection for his property.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-has-revived-practice-of-lawyers-indulging-in-land-grabbing-says-hc/article33787298.ece
09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Of Sasikala’s return and political unease||The return of V.K.Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the AIADMK and aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, has caused disquiet in political circles, more so in the ruling party. Though prominent leaders of the AIADMK and the DMK have been on the campaign trail for more than a month, electioneering has not generated any heat, which is the norm otherwise. But once the date of Ms. Sasikala’s return to Tamil Nadu was known about a week ago, the ruling party went into overdrive to ambush her plans. “By reacting in the fashion it did, the ruling dispensation has converted a non-event into a political event of some significance,” says G. Palanithurai, a veteran academic dealing with political science and development administration. “Had the powers that be ignored her arrival in the State, their image would have gone up,” he observes. However, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, who is regarded as the spokesperson of the Cabinet, denies the suggestion that the ruling party has panicked. Asked whether the party should have protested the way it did, another senior Minister feels that had there been silence on its part, “there is every likelihood of the cadre interpreting it wrongly. We do not want to be the cause of any confusion among our workers.” Party flag Regardless of the AIADMK’s “strong objections” to her using the party flag or symbol, a couple of vehicles that brought Ms. Sasikala from Bengaluru to Chennai did sport the party flag. At a temple at Hosur in Krishnagiri district, she was wearing a scarf that bore the colour of the party flag. “The message from her is that she represents the AIADMK and she is the general secretary of the party,” feels P. Palaniappan, former Higher Education Minister and deputy secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK). His observation has reflected Ms. Sasikala’s statement issued on Monday (which was shared with the media through the pro-Sasikala television channel Jaya TV). She stated that she would devote the rest of her life to the “progress” of the party. Seeking to identify herself with the AIADMK, she said, “My objective is that all of us should work together to ensure that our common enemy does not return to power and be defeated. It is our responsibility to protect the idea of ‘Puratchi Thalaivi’ [Jayalalithaa] of not falling a prey to the design of our adversary in dividing us.” She added that the party should not “disintegrate owing to the personal likes and dislikes of a few individuals.” Notwithstanding her appeal, the AIADMK leadership seems to be in no mood for reconciliation, a position reiterated by Mr. Jayakumar earlier in the day. AIADMK supporters feel that barring some disenchanted elements, who may cross over to her camp, the party’s rank and file will rally behind Chief Minister and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister and coordinator O. Panneerselvam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/of-sasikalas-return-and-political-unease/article33787285.ece
09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Sasikala, TTV are DMK’s B team’||Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Monday accused V.K. Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the AIADMK and aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, and T.T.V. Dhinakaran, her nephew and general secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), as being part of the “B team” of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). In the by-elections held during April-May 2019 to 22 Assembly constituencies, the AMMK had put up candidates against the AIADMK to help the DMK indirectly. “Had Ms. Sasikala and Mr. Dhinakaran been loyal to the AIADMK, they [the AMMK] would not have contested in the by-elections,” Mr. Jayakumar said, adding the “pact,” worked out between Mr. Dhinakaran and DMK president M.K. Stalin a few years ago, continued to this day. However, they could not succeed in their objective. “Still, we emerged victorious,” he said, referring to the AIADMK retaining its majority by winning in 9 of the 22 constituencies. “Regardless of the number of B teams being promoted by Mr. Stalin, there is no force that can defeat our team [the AIADMK],” he said, adding that the DMK president had been “acting as per the advice of Ms. Sasikala and Mr. Dhinakaran.” When it was pointed out that a functionary at Soolagiri in Krishnagiri district had lent his car to Ms. Sasikala, Mr. Jayakumar said the party would act against betrayers. He decried Ms. Sasikala’s attempts at using the AIADMK flag on her vehicle or wearing a neck piece in the colour of the party flag. Reiterating that Ms. Sasikala had no connection with the AIADMK, he said the ruling party was not anxious about her return to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sasikala-ttv-are-dmks-b-team/article33787290.ece
09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ahead of election, city set to get 703 new polling stations||The District Election Office will develop 703 polling stations at new locations outside the existing ones. As a result, a number of electors in the 16 Assembly constituencies of the city will vote in new polling locations in the coming election. Starting February 10, the District Election Office will conduct SVEEP (Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation) activities to create awareness among electors about the new polling locations. All the new polling locations will be developed within a distance of 2 km from the existing facilities. The District Election Office conducted a meeting with representatives of political parties before finalising the locations this week.

09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Advocate’s son died due to homicide, not suicide: HC||The Madras High Court has held that the death of Chennai advocate R. Sankarasubbu’s 24-year-old son S. Sathish Kumar, a law graduate, in June 2011 was a homicide and not suicide as claimed by the CBI in 2012. A Full Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash, G. Jayachandran and N. Sathish Kumar agreed with the findings of a court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by retired CBI Director R.K. Raghavan, that the youngster had actually been murdered. However, since the SIT could not detect the culprits despite best efforts, the judges directed the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (Metro) to take over the case and investigate it as and when they stumble upon some clue in the future. The law graduate had gone missing on June 7, 2011 forcing his father to file a habeas corpus petition (HCP) in the High Court after lodging a police complaint. His motorcycle was located near Integral Coach Factory (ICF) North Colony lake. Later, the victim’s body was found floating in the lake near ICF Railway Police rest room on June 13, 2011. A post mortem conducted by a team of three doctors found him to have died of shock and haemorrhage due to cut injuries in the throat. Thereafter, the court ordered a CBI probe into the death. The CBI concluded that it was a case of suicide and sought permission to file a final report before the magistrate concerned. Not satisfied with its conclusion, the court on December 7, 2012 constituted an SIT which in its 24th report, filed on December 5, 2017, concluded that the death was due to homicide. The SIT also recommended penal action against six officials attached to State police and two attached to the CBI for alleged lapses in investigation. State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan opposed the recommendation as the local police probed the case only for eight days. The Full Bench left it to the Centre as well as the State government to take a call on the basis of the SIT’s report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/death-of-advocates-son-was-a-homicide-not-suicide-rules-hc/article33787741.ece

09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Researchers come up with new brake system||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras have developed strategies to improve the braking performance of electric vehicles (EVs) that could help make the ride comfortable in heavy commercial vehicles. The research was led by C.S. Shankar Ram of the Department of Engineering Design and his Ph.D., student V.S. Kesavan. They worked on strategies to incorporate the effect of different dynamic characteristics of “friction brake” and regenerative brake on a vehicle’s braking performance. The results of their study have been published in Vehicle System Dynamics . Mr. Shankar Ram said: “Given the increasing adoption of electrified heavy road vehicles, it is imperative to study their dynamic response during on-road operation. Brakes are used to ensure safe operation of vehicles, and this research focuses on the braking of electrified heavy road vehicles.” At present, two braking systems are used in electrified vehicles: friction-based braking system where kinetic energy of the vehicle in the moving state is converted to heat energy. Thus, a part of the energy obtained from burning the fuel is wasted in the form of heat energy dissipated during friction braking. In the regenerative braking system in the electric vehicles, the driver would press the brake pedal and a portion of the kinetic energy due to the movement of the wheels is converted into electrical energy that gets stored in the battery. In electrified vehicles both friction and regenerative braking should be used in a co-operative manner for energy conservation and stopping the vehicle within a reasonable distance.  Brakes are used to ensure safety and this research focuses on braking of heavy EVs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-m-team-comes-up-with-new-brake-system-for-evs/article33787719.ece

They point out that the circulars on syllabus prioritisation for Classes 11 and 12 indicate that the French language students will have all 8 lessons in their textbooks and mention no reduction in units or chapters.  Running out of time “We are running out of time and concerned about completing the portions especially for Class 12. Instead of a 40% reduction, we better have the last two lessons reduced since they deal with tough grammar components which we will not have adequate time to teach,” said A. Chandrasekaran, secretary, Indian Association of Teachers of French (South Zone). A.S. Rajapraveen, another French teacher handling Classes 11 and 12, argues that since the academic year started in June 2020, they have been teaching the language online, a mode which has its own challenges.  Language classes can be conducted at a quicker pace only with face-to-face interactions, especially when students are learning the language for the first time, he pointed out. “While Class 12 students are back to school, we are worried whether we will be able to complete the portions and help them revise,” he said.

09 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||10 more Emergency Care and Recovery Centres to come up in Tamil Nadu||To expand facilities for the care of the wandering mentally ill, 10 more Emergency Care and Recovery Centres (ECRCs) will be established in two phases in Tamil Nadu. The National Health Mission (NHM)-Tamil Nadu, in coordination with the Directorates of Medical Education and Medical and Rural Health Services, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and The Banyan, an NGO, entered into a tripartite agreement in the presence of Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan. The aim was to operationalise ECRCs to cater to homeless persons with mental illness. Already, the NHM has established ECRCs in 10 districts. According to the agreement, this was not adequate for the increased load of cases, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Several people with mental health issues were living on the streets requiring acute care, treatment and rehabilitation services, raising the dire need to scale up the efforts of ECRCs to meet the increased demand. The additional ECRCs will come up in Madurai, Tenkasi, Sivaganga, Thanjavur, the Nilgiris, Erode, Krishnagiri, Cuddalore, Kanniyakumari and Tirunelveli. The identified NGOs would extend services, including outreach, rescue, treatment, rehabilitation, reintegration and after-care. Earlier, care for the wandering mentally ill was taken up through the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP). Now, this has gained additional momentum through ECRCs, according to P. Poorna Chandrika, Director of IMH and State Nodal Officer of the DMHP. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ECRCs were of help in protecting and giving shelter to the wandering mentally ill. In the districts, there was always the question of where to take a wandering mentally ill person. ECRCs were the answer,” she said. The ECRCs, a model developed by The Banyan, are faring extremely well, The Banyan director K.V. Kishore Kumar said. “This model of ECRCs has been extremely useful in serving the most vulnerable sections that did not receive any care as there has been no specific system to respond. In this model, there is a high possibility that all will get care, and it is happening now,” he said. The proportion of people requiring emergency and recovery care will definitely run into thousands, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/10-more-emergency-care-and-recovery-centres-to-come-up-in-tamil-nadu/article33787276.ece

Class 10 and 12 students have been attending in-person classes since January 19. Following the COVID-19 lockdown, schools were closed in March last. Keeping in mind the instructions from the School Education Department, many schools that have no adequate space or that have a large body of students are running classes on alternate days to ensure physical distance. Schools in the southern districts reopened with 90% attendance of Class 9 and 11 students, said officials of the School Education Department. “In schools that lack space, classes are being conducted at 31 high and higher secondary schools in Tirunelveli district on alternate days. While students of Classes 9 and 11 will attend classes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, those of Classes 10 and 12 will attend classes on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, Chief Educational Officer Sivakumar said. In Tiruchi district, the attendance was more than what was anticipated by the School Education Department. Officials said a majority of the schools reported good attendance on the first day. “The classes will continue to be conducted for six days a week for students of Classes 10 and 12. As for Classes 9 and 11, they will be conducted on alternate days at some schools,” Chief Educational Officer R. Arivazhagan said. The attendance in Coimbatore district was just over 50%. While 51.22% of students of Class 9 attended in-person classes, 52.3% of students of Class 11 returned to the campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-reopen-for-classes-9-and-11/article33787287.ece

Officials of the Airports Authority of India said the unit had been set up in the arrival hall of the international terminal by a Government of India authorised lab. Passengers could get their COVID-19 results in six to eight hours for Rs. 1,200 and within two to four hours for Rs. 2,500, The lab had been getting about 15-20 departing passengers every day. “Any passenger who has to fly out of the country needs to have a COVID-19 negative certificate. Some passengers are still unaware of this and when airlines find someone without this certificate, they send the passengers to get tested here,” a staff said. So far, only one passenger, who arrived from Abu Dhabi, was tested. He was asked to get tested and give the results as he had arrived without a certificate. A few weeks ago, the State government authorities inspected and gave approval for opening the testing lab. Later, they had suggested some changes with regard to the testing kit to be used and allowed the opening of the lab, officials said. “The passengers can be seated in the waiting area till the results are given. This will be beneficial for symptomatic passengers and for arriving and departing passengers who need to get tested,” an official said.

Stalin and MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Monday condemned the UPSC’s decision to fill 30 posts at the level of joint secretaries and directors for lateral recruitment with the candidates from the private sector. Mr. Stalin alleged that the motive behind the decision was to recruit BJP and RSS ideologues from the private sector to the government service and to destroy social justice. Undermine social justice “The recruitment will undermine social justice in the country since there will be no reservation for the appointments. Ever since it came to power, the BJP government has been seeking to destabilise the reservation policy in the country. It has not implemented 27% reservation for the OBCs in any department,” Mr. Stalin alleged in a statement. “After handing over public sector organisations to corporate houses, the BJP government also is trying to privatise government departments through the recruitment. This is against the Constitution. The recruitment will pave way for appropriation of higher posts by corporate houses and forward castes,” he alleged. Urging the Centre to give up the decision as it would amount to playing with fire, Mr. Stalin warned that history will not forgive the BJP government. Objective of BJP Mr. Vaiko said the decision was against the Constitution since the UPSC was established under Article 315 of the Constitution to conduct recruitment for various public services. “The objective [of the BJP] is to appoint RSS ideologues in higher posts of the government. It is dangerous to appoint private sector candidates in government posts,” he said.   The recruitment will pave the way for appropriation of higher posts by corporate houses and forward castes M.K.

The funding will allow the Chennai-based firm to expand its operations and pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities. The company plans to scale up its supply chain and technology infrastructure to support innovation and accessibility of its products and services.  Nishanth Chandran, founder and CEO of TenderCuts, told The Hindu that this financial year the company would expand to new cities like Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai. “We will double our presence in our existing market like Chennai and Hyderabad,” he said. At present, the company has 25 stores and “we intend to reach over 100 stores in the next one year,” he added. Rajesh Ranjan, chief executive officer of NABVENTURES, said, “The direct-to-consumer meat market is at a nascent stage in India with less than 1% penetration.

Usually held in December-January, the camp was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is being held in February-March. Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department officials said the mahouts of all the elephants and their assistants submitted COVID-19 negative certificates prior to entering the camp. A release from the Coimbatore district administration said the rejuvenation camp for elephants had been organised by the State government at over Rs. 1.67 crore. The elephants comprised 21 temple elephants and three mutt elephants from the State along with two temple elephants from the Union Territory of Puducherry. An official from the Forest Department said six watchtowers had been set up on the camp premises to monitor the camp. As all the participating elephants were female, their presence in large numbers might attract wild male elephants from the surrounding forest areas, he said. About 50 personnel from Mettupalayam, Karamadai and Sirumugai forest ranges would be deployed every day at the camp, the official added. Diet for the elephants would comprise green fodder, fruits, and supplements as per the advice of veterinarians. The elephants would also undergo walking exercises in the mornings and evenings, the release said. Mohammad Fazil from Erode, who visited the camp with his wife S. Arshu and two children, said this was the first time that he was visiting the camp. “We have visited many zoos, but we cannot see the elephants this close,” Ms. Arshu remarked. S. Yuvaraj from Mettupalayam said he regularly visited the camp’s inauguration every year with his family. Many of the visitors engaged in video calls with their family members to show the elephants, apart from taking selfies and photos using their smartphones. HR&CE Minister Sevvoor S. Ramachandran, Minister for Municipal Administration S.P. Velumani and Minister for Forests Dindigul C. Sreenivasan inaugurated the camp at around 6 p.m. Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, over a hundred visitors including AIADMK cadre and general public were present to witness the inaugural event. Restrictions on visitors will be implemented from Tuesday, according to the officials. The 48-day-long rejuvenation camp will end on March 27. Second postponement The annual rejuvenation camp that is being conducted on the banks of River Bhavani was postponed to February for the second time in four years. Sources in the HR&CE Department said the 48-day camp was being held at Thekkampatti since 2012 and it usually began in December or January. However, the camp that was slated in December 2016 was postponed following the demise of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. It was subsequently held in February 2017 and the camp was cut short from 48 days to 30 days, the sources said. The 2018 camp began in January and the 2019 camp began in December. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic played spoilsport, following which the State government decided to begin the camp this February, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rejuvenation-camp-for-temple-mutt-elephants-begins-at-thekkampatti/article33787330.ece

Another mahout said the rejuvenation camp was a welcome break for the elephants, the mahouts and their assistants after a difficult year, he said.

09 February 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Governor has not made mistake in Perarivalan case: Annamalai||BJP State vice-president K. Annamalai has said that Governor Banwarilal Purohit has not committed a mistake by declining to take call on a plea for the early release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict A.G. Perarivalan for two years and saying that President of India is the competent authority to decide on the issue. Addressing mediapersons here on Monday, he said Rajiv Gandhi assassination case was not only a ‘rarest of rare’ case, but also a serious one. The CBI was still probing the larger conspiracy behind the assassination. “He was killed for the decision he took when he was the Prime Minister,” Mr. Annamalai said and added that of the seven convicts, four were Sri Lankan nationals and three were Tamils. “Since a central investigation agency is involved in probing, only the President can take a decision on remission,” he added. As per Constitution Asked about the delay on the part of the Governor, Mr. Annamalai said there was no time limit for the constitutional authorities such as the President or the Governor to take a decision and added that he acted only as per constitution. ‘DMK, anti-national party’ To a question that BJP leaders in the past had termed the Dravidian parties as corrupt, but the party was having an alliance with the AIADMK, he said the DMK was an anti-national party and was against Tamil and its culture. “BJP wants a stable government, but not with DMK. The party’s central parliamentary board will decide on alliance and we accept it,” he added. Mr. Annamalai said that the police were assaulted in Delhi on Republic Day and added that the government had conducted 13 rounds of talks. “Are they farmers or the Congress members who have no work and are protesting in the guise of farmers?” he asked and sought an answer from Congress leader P. Chidambaram. He also asked why no farmers in the State were protesting against the three laws. Mr. Annamalai said that members of power loom and weavers’ association in Erode had submitted petitions over the prevailing problems and assured them that their representatives would be taken to New Delhi to meet the Minister concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/governor-has-not-made-mistake-in-perarivalan-case-annamalai/article33787296.ece

09 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools see good student turnout||There was a good turnout of students of Classes IX and XI in most schools in Madurai district on Monday when they reopened with necessary safety precautions after a gap of around 11 months. The schools have been functioning for students of Classes X and XII since January 19. District Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said that most of the schools recorded over 80% attendance for Classes IX and XI on Monday. “Only three schools in the district have classes for Classes IX and XI on alternate days due to some constraints,” he said. Aruna M. Visvessvar, Senior Principal and Correspondent of Adhyapana School, said that circles were drawn from the school gate to ensure compliance with personal distancing norms. S. Christopher Jeyaseelan, Headmaster of Government Higher Secondary School at A. Vallalapatti, said that only up to 25 students were accommodated in each classroom. “Since the sixth, seventh and the eighth standard classrooms are empty, we accommodated the students of Classes IX to XII in these classrooms in compliance with physical distancing norms,” he said. Ms. Aruna Visvessvar said that additional sections were introduced for each standard to avoid crowding in classrooms. “Lunch break for standards was allowed at different times to avoid crowding of restrooms,” she said.

09 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK is ‘B’ team of BJP: Kanimozhi||The AIADMK is functioning as the ‘B’ team of the BJP, but the DMK is functioning independently, according to DMK women’s wing leader and Thoothukudi MP M.K. Kanimozhi. She was addressing the mediapersons here on Monday. To a question on the claim of Minister D. Jayakumar that the DMK was the ‘B’ Team of V.K. Sasikala, Ms. Kanimozhi said: “In the past, AIADMK leaders called Ms. Sasikala, not as ‘chinamma’, but as ‘amma’. But, today they are making derogatory remarks against her,” she said. On a two-day campaign in Madurai ahead of the Assembly elections, Ms. Kanimozhi said the AIADMK was canvassing votes by making false claims regarding projects that they had completed. “No job opportunities were created and no investments made in Tamil Nadu during the AIADMK rule,” she said. But, the DMK was canvassing votes based on the achievements accomplished during the party’s rule. The DMK would win the upcoming Assembly elections and form the government, she said. Ms. Kanimozhi said there were no major investments in southern districts during the AIADMK rule. DMK president M.K. Stalin had announced in January that outstanding crop loans of farmers would be waived once his party came to power. “The Chief Minister copied the announcement made by Mr. Stalin and only recently announced that the government would waive crop loans,” she said. During a meeting with farmers at Madakulam, Ms. Kanimozhi said huge amounts of funds were allocated for rejuvenating waterbodies under the AIADMK government. However, none of the projects was properly implemented. “They were only carried out so that the government can get ‘commission’ and ‘collection’,” she charged. Stating that the DMK would always be in support of the farmers, she said, “Though the CM calls himself a farmer, he supports the new agricultural laws. These laws will pave the way for corporates to exploit farmers.” Ms. Kanimozhi assured the farmers that their party would take steps to ensure water storage in Madakulam tank throughout the year. Ms. Kanimozhi held a meeting with the Federation of Madurai Manufacturers and Traders Association. The Federation members submitted a list of demands to her. Ms. Kanimozhi also inspected the road overbridge at T.V.S. Nagar, along with Madurai Central MLA P.T.R.P. Thiagarajan. She visited the ‘uzhavar santhai’ at Palanganatham and participated in a gram sabha meeting at Paravai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-is-b-team-of-bjp/article33787252.ece

The waterbodies were not being rejuvenated properly, she said, addressing villagers of Madakulam in Madurai during the election campaign. She recalled that DMK president M.K. Stalin had announced in January that outstanding crop loans of farmers would be waived once the party came to power. “Following that, the Chief Minister had only recently announced that the government would waive crop loans. But the AIADMK will not be in power to waive them,” she claimed. Ms. Kanimozhi said the DMK would always be supporting farmers. “Although the Chief Minister calls himself a farmer, he supports the agricultural laws recently passed by the Union government. These agricultural laws will pave the way for the corporates to exploit the farmers. It is the DMK which is opposing these laws,” she added. She assured the farmers that her party would take steps to ensure that water was stored in Madakulam tank throughout the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/waterbody-projects-used-only-for-earning-commission-kanimozhi/article33787743.ece

In the petition taken up for hearing by a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi, M. Soundarya of Madurai said that the study must be conducted to assess the impact of turbines on birds before setting up wind farms. She pointed out that during migration, a large number of birds died as a result of collision with windmill turbines and high intensity power lines. In 2016, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in a report titled ‘Eco-friendly measures to mitigate impacts of linear infrastructure on wildlife’, had issued several recommendations in this regard. These recommendations must be adhered to, she said. Apart from the study of the impact of the turbines in wind farms on birds, the design and configuration of power lines must be modified. The vane tips of turbines must be coloured in black or orange as per the recommendation of experts, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/study-of-impact-of-wind-turbines-on-birds-must/article33787302.ece

09 February 2021||MANAMADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Why privatise public sector units, asks Chidambaram||Clarifying that the Congress was opposed only to privatising public sector institutions, senior leader P. Chidambaram on Monday said the BJP government may give licences to “rich friends” to commence private banks, insurance companies and ports. Speaking at a booth committee meeting of Congress workers in Manamadurai, he said that there were private sector, multi national and public sector institutions in the country in the banks, insurance and among others. “We are not against this arrangement. Let the people choose from the facilities available,” he said. However, the BJP’s plan to hand over prime institutions to rich friends could not be accepted. Banks, which were over 100-years-old and had branches across the country, could not be given on a platter to the friends of the BJP, Mr. Chidambaram said. Though Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was a learned person, he charged that she only read out the budget written by the friends of the BJP. “This is set to raise the inflation,” he added. Attacking Union Home Minister Amit Shah, he said the BJP was determined to impose Hindi in Tamil heartland. What happened to the DMK MP Kanimozhi at the airport a few months ago was just the tip of an iceberg [A CISF personnel apparently asked her if she was an Indian for not knowing Hindi]. The Home Minister had written a letter in Hindi to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, expressing his condolence, when the CM’s mother passed away. “Can't he write in English...We don't expect him to write in Tamil. It showed the arrogance of the BJP leader,” he charged. The southern States were the only pockets, which could halt the imposition of Hindi. Hailing the richness of Tamil and explaining the features of the artefacts from Keeladi in Sivaganga district, he said the people of Tamil Nadu were ready to chase away the BJP and its ally, the AIADMK. The party workers, he said, should ensure that the Congress combine emerged victorious in the State and urged them to work round-the-clock. The Congress leader also blamed the BJP for sowing the seeds of bias among the people from different castes and communities in North India. There were rifts between the Hindus and Muslims. The people of southern States should stop such designs of the BJP, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/why-privatise-psus-asks-chidambaram/article33787250.ece

Bicycle rides, introduced last week by the Forest Department as an eco-friendly initiative, will help the visitors spend hours together in the quietness of greenery and enjoy a slice of wild life. The distance from the entrance to the farthest point near the sea is close to six km. “Unlike the fleeting impressions one gets while travelling in vehicles in the sanctuary, a bicycle ride offers the visitors ample opportunities to watch blackbuck and other wildlife species in a leisurely way,” said S. Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forest, Thanjavur Circle. Ten bicycles are available for hire now. Encouraged by good patronage, the Forest Department will buy 10 more bicycles, Mr. Ramasubramanian said. Guards will also be encouraged to undertake patrolling on bicycle. At the farthest end, the visitors can spend time in the watch tower overlooking the sea. “A bicycle ride will be a test of endurance, especially for parents. Besides being eco-friendly, the initiative promotes fitness among the visitors,” he said.  A bicycle ride offers visitors opportunity to watch wildlife in a leisurely manner S.

09 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||BJP’s ambitions upset electoral calculations of AINRC, AIADMK||An electorally ambitious BJP has upset the political calculations of the All India N.R. Congress (AINRC) and AIADMK in Puducherry in the coming Assembly elections. The national party, which had joined the AINRC-AIADMK alliance as a “junior partner” during the Nellithope Assembly bypoll in 2016, has since spread its political net wider. BJP national president J.P. Nadda and Puducherry unit chief V. Saminathan, who is also a nominated legislator, have in recent days indicated their desire to be a dominant player or at least being treated an equal partner in the alliance. Mr. Saminathan even went to the extent of projecting recently inducted former Minister A. Namassivayam [who quit the Congress] as a possible Chief Ministerial candidate. In 2011, the AINRC had contested in 20 seats leaving 10 for the AIADMK, which shared a seat with the CPI. The alliance won in 20 constituencies and the AINRC, with 15 seats, had formed the government with the support of an Independent. Sources in the AINRC and AIADMK told The Hindu that they have received enough indications of the BJP’s desire to play a larger role in the alliance. “They [BJP] have set a target of contesting a minimum of 10 to 12 seats and are bargaining even for the Chief Minister’s post. Talks are on, but the final decision will be taken by our leader and former Chief Minister Rangasamy. The Prime Minister and our leader share mutual respect but that will not lead to any climb down with regard to our position on seat sharing,” a top AINRC functionary said. Mr. Rangasamy, while addressing cadres during the foundation day on Sunday, urged them to strive hard to bring the party back to power. He also warned the workers to beware about forces from “within and outside” trying to foment trouble. An AIADMK functionary pointed out that in terms of cadre strength and vote share the party was way ahead of the national party. “In fact, we are facing the electorate with four sitting legislators and not without any elected representatives like the BJP. Anyway, our alliance is decided by the party leadership in Tamil Nadu. We have already apprised the leadership about our concerns,” an AIADMK legislator said. The BJP leadership was of the view that it was a national party and the ground situation had changed in the last five years. “With the Supreme Court upholding the rights of the Centre to nominate three legislators [belonging to BJP], we are going to the Assembly already with the strength of three members. Besides, we have worked hard for the last five years in strengthening the party at the booth level. We would like to play a dominant or at least as an equal partner in the alliance,” a senior BJP leader told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjps-ambitions-upset-electoral-calculations-of-ainrc-aiadmk/article33787921.ece
09 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Former MP welcomes AINRC chief’s call to boycott elections||Former MP M. Ramadass has welcomed the call made by former Chief Minister and AINRC chief N. Rangasamy to collectively boycott Assembly elections to push for the Statehood of Puducherry. In a statement, Mr. Ramadass said Mr. Rangasamy’s call to all political parties to boycott the forthcoming Assembly election as a measure of pressurising the Government of India to confer Statehood on the Union Territory had to be appreciated in the larger interest of development and democracy. Last 50 years The experience of the last 50 years had shown that democracy and its instrument of elections are incompatible with the Union Territory Act, 1963. Only in a full-fledged State can democracy as a form of government for the people by the people and of the people flourish and periodical elections were imperative to elect the representatives of the people to the Assembly. But in a territory where the Raj Nivas has become the centre of power and the people and their representatives were downgraded, elections had no real relevance, Mr. Ramadass said. The repeated resolutions passed by the Assembly and the unanimous recommendations of the Sushma Swaraj Home Affairs Committee to confer special category State status on Puducherry have fallen on deaf ears, he added. The unanimous boycott of elections would draw national attention as it would create a near Constitutional crisis. The issue would receive the serious attention of the Government of India and the Election Commission. Possibly, the Government of India could agree to accept the recommendation of the Sushma Swaraj Committee Report submitted in 2006 to the Rajya Sabha Secretariat and pass the Statehood Bill in the current Parliamentary Session itself or alternatively give an assurance to confer Statehood within three months after the elections, Mr. Ramadass said. United front “Therefore, all political parties may get the consent from their leadership for boycott of polls and stand united in this noble public cause,” he said. In the meantime, a comprehensive report on Statehood can also be prepared by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy and an all party delegation take up the demand with the Prime Minister and leaders of other parties in Parliament, Mr. Ramadoss added.

09 February 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin takes a dig at CM, insists his party will win all 234 seats||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday claimed that the alliance led by his party would emerge victorious in all 234 Assembly constituencies. He also anticipated trouble in the ruling AIADMK from V.K. Sasikala, aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. “A person [Sasikala] has left Bengaluru with a flag [AIADMK] fitted on the car. Whatever should happen, will happen now. That is sure,” he said, speaking at a wedding ceremony of a party functionary in Pudukottai. Taking a dig at Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Stalin charged that he had come to occupy the high post by “crawling up”. Mr. Stalin, who was confident of an emphatic victory in the upcoming election, said he was hearing the grievances of the people in a phased manner. “There is no doubt that the DMK is going to regain power in the forthcoming polls within three months,” Mr. Stalin claimed. The DMK had initially organised a campaign christened ‘Vidiyilai Nokki Stalinin Kural’ (Stalin's voice for a new dawn) and had now embarked on ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin’ (Stalin in your constituency) campaign to hear the grievances of the general public. The third phase of the campaign would begin on February 12, Mr. Stalin said. “I had said at the party’s district secretaries’ meeting that the DMK’s target was to win 200 seats. It is wrong. We are going to win all the 234 constituencies. The party is hearing the grievances of the people in all segments,” he said. Speaking in Gandharvakottai, Mr. Stalin claimed that Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami had become apprehensive as he was aware that the people were getting ready to overthrow the AIADMK regime. “His fears have been heightened now,” he said in a veiled reference to Ms.Sasikala. “God alone knows what is going to happen,” Mr. Stalin said. The Chief Minister had been coming up with sudden announcements of late. The DMK’s poll promise on waiver of farm loans had reached the public well following which the Chief Minister had made the announcement that crop loans would be written off, he claimed. Mr. Stalin accused the government of being subservient to the Centre and said the time had come to put an end to this rule. In Sivaganga district, he reiterated his claim that the law and order situation had deteriorated in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-predicts-dmk-victory-in-all-234-assembly-seats/article33787259.ece

Led by R. Selvan, Thoothukudi south district secretary of the party, the petitioners said Tiruchendur – Paramankurichi road, being used by a large number of vehicles, including ambulances carrying patients, was in a worst shape after the monsoon and caused accidents every day, particularly during night hours. Hence, the Collector, considering the safety of road users, should instruct the State Highways to re-lay this road, the petitioners prayed. A group of transwomen from Tiruchendur area submitted a petition seeking green houses on free house sites given by the government.

09 February 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation Commissioner takes charge in Thoothukudi||A permanent solution for rainwater stagnation woes in the coastal town would be arrived at shortly, Corporation Commissioner Sharanya Ari has said. After assuming office here on Monday, Ms. Sharanya, a 2016 batch IAS officer from Thanjavur, said that she was informed by the Corporation officials that rainwater stagnation was the major issue the town was facing after a downpour. Hence, due and early action would be taken to put in place a permanent solution for this nagging civic issue. Ms. Sharanya, who was previously serving as Sub-Collector, Padmanabhapuram, said she felt proud of being posted as Commissioner of Thoothukudi, an ancient town. Her husband Vishwesh Balasubramaniam Shastri is the ASP of Colachel. Though the Corporation officials are fully aware that rampant encroachments along almost all the streets of Thoothukudi, unauthorised constructions and poor maintenance of drainage channels across the town were the prime reasons behind the monsoon woes, no sustained efforts had been made to put an end to this menace. Consequently, the port town virtually ‘floats’ during every monsoon, sources in the Corporation said. “When outgoing Commissioner V.P. Jayaseelan started removing encroachments on a particular day of every week, he was forced to give up the exercise. He served notices on a leading textile showroom, a jewellery showroom and the hospital of a ruling party heavyweight for unauthorised constructions made on their premises in violation of permission given by the urban civic body. Even before a reply from these establishments is received, he has been transferred,” said a senior official of Thoothukudi Corporation, adding that encroachment eviction in a sustained manner across the town after giving stern warning to the encroachers alone would yield desirable results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-commissioner-takes-charge-in-thoothukudi/article33787314.ece
09 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Colleges exercise discretion in starting classes for UG students||Arts and Science colleges have exercised their discretion in starting regular classes for UG students in the wake of the State Government permitting the institutions to engage first and second year students in classroom sessions. Since there was no compulsion from the government for starting the classes for all the three years of UG at one go, the colleges have chosen to conduct regular classes in a staggered manner. At the Jamal Mohamed College, for instance, the final-year UG students pursuing Science programmes who have been attending regular classes since the first week of December, 2020, will undergo practicals and end-semester before mid-February. Subsequently, the classes will be initiated for first-year students, and the third-year students will be engaged online. After a few weeks, intermediate students of UG will be asked to attend regular classes, Principal Ismail Mohideen said. But, government arts and science colleges witnessed the entire strength of students turning up for regular classes. Though use of sanitisers and wearing of masks could be enforced effectively, social distancing is a difficult proposition in government colleges, P. David Livingston, Zonal Secretary, Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers' Association, said. The maintenance of toilets is pathetic in the colleges, particularly in the government arts and science colleges, another teacher said. There is a section of teachers in government-aided colleges who are wondering why the government had decided on the lines of starting classes for the UG students at this critical juncture. “The government ought to have desisted from starting classes, taking into consideration the smooth progress of online classes,” a teacher of a government-aided college said. Opening of hostels has become a ticklish issue. “The government emphasises on allotting a room for every student is practically impossible to do so”, another teacher said. The government could have permitted online teaching-learning for this entire academic year, and thought of starting offline classes afresh from the next academic year, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/colleges-exercise-discretion-in-starting-classes-for-ug-students/article33787254.ece
09 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Burning of solid waste is becoming a cause for concern for Tiruchi residents||Indiscriminate and unmindful burning of garbage, mainly plastic bags, on streets has caused concern among the city residents. Instances of burning garbage have gone up in recent weeks. It has become a common sight to see garbage accumulated on streets being burnt in the mornings. What is causing concern among the residents is the burning of plastic bottles, carry bags and other hazardous waste mixed with other garbage. In most cases, it is alleged that conservancy workers set fire to the garbage so as to clean up the garbage mounds on street corners. In some places, local residents, unable to bear the stench from uncleared garbage mounds, set fire to it without realising the danger of burning plastics. Depending upon the size of garbage it takes at least two hours for the fire to die down. It is a regular phenomenon to see solid waste being burnt on Reynolds Road, V.O.C. Road, Heber Road and Periya Milaguparai. Often, the dark fumes pose difficulties for residents living nearby. “We encounter the burning of solid waste almost on a daily basis. It troubles the elders, patients, children and morning walkers,” says James, an apartment dweller on V.O.C Road in Cantonment. “Though the issue has been brought to the notice of the Tiruchi Corporation on many occasions, burning of waste on street continues”, he adds. Health experts view that incineration of plastic waste poses a great threat to humans and animals. They say plastic waste on being burnt releases toxic gases such as dioxins, furans, mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls into the atmosphere. It further liberates hazardous halogens and pollutes air. “Air pollution caused by burning of plastics increases the risk of heart diseases, aggravates respiratory ailments such as asthma, emphysema and causes rashes, nausea and headaches and damages the nervous system. Under no circumstances burning of solid waste should be allowed,” says M. A. Aleem, former vice-principal, K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College, Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/burning-of-solid-waste-is-becoming-a-cause-for-concern-for-tiruchi-residents/article33787269.ece

Vishnu on Monday, appealing to him to ensure continued disbursal of family pension to him. According to S. Raja of Kottur Road in Palayamkottai, his father Sudalai Muthu, who was working with Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) as driver, died in 2007 and his mother Esakkiammal was getting the family pension. After Esakkiammal also passed away on January 1, the youth, a postgraduate, was left with no income. “My mother and myself were the legal heirs to my father and we managed to meet our expenses with the family pension we were getting from the TNSTC. After the demise of my mother, I submitted the death certificate to the TNSTC administration asking them to stop the family pension as per the norms. Since, I am alone and have no income, I want the Collector to recommend to the government to continue to give the family pension to me so that I can lead an independent life without being a burden for others,” Mr. Raja said. Temple land lease A group of persons from Sernthimangalam submitted a petition to the Collector to fix nominal lease amount for 54 cents of Swami Nellaiyappar Temple land on which they have built their houses. The petitioners, led by T. Natarajan, said they had been living on the temple land for more than 40 years and paying the lease money to the temple management. When 11 families received notice from the temple authorities on July 5, 2018 asking them to pay the lease amount of Rs. 2.64 lakh immediately, they had been paying the dues in several instalments though the breadwinners of these families are poor manual labourers. “Against this backdrop, 11 more families received notice from the temple authorities on November 30, 2020 asking them to pay arrears of Rs. 26 lakh. Since we are all labourers, the Collector should order the temple authorities to fix a nominal lease amount, considering our hand-to-mouth existence,” Mr. Natarajan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/orphaned-differently-abled-youth-in-tirunelveli-seeks-family-pension/article33787316.ece

09 February 2021||TIRUPATTUR,TAMIL NADU||Law and order situation has deteriorated in State: Stalin||Law and order situation in Tamil Nadu had deteriorated that every day, murders, robberies and waylaying crimes happened, said DMK president M.K. Stalin here on Monday. Speaking at the ‘Stalin Ungal Thoguthiyil’ at Tirupattur near here, he said the State government’s inefficiency had touched a new low, that womenfolk were unsafe and insecure. The Edappadi K Palaniswami’s government had come in for severe criticism from within their own partymen is a proof that he was counting his days in the seat of power. In a hurried manner, the AIADMK government had made announcement with regard to waiver of farm loans. Where did the Chief Minister go? Did he not know that farmers were suffering due to drought and floods all these years. Why didn’t Mr. Palaniswami come to the rescue of the needy earlier, Mr. Stalin went on posing questions and wanted the people to think about it before casting their votes this time. Taking a dig at the Khadi and Village Industries Minister G Baskaran, Mr. Stalin said that the Minister had neither spoken a word in the Assembly, nor done anything worth for the people in the constituency in Sivaganga district. All that the minister had done is to amass wealth for himself through some projects which were brought in exclusively to make money like few other ministers in the Edappadi Palaniswami’s cabinet. To name a few, he said that the kudimaramathu scheme, some road works, underground drainage and drinking water projects, which too had not been completed, were given funds only to siphon them off by some people in the AIADMK, he charged. He said “The day we come to power, we will definitely ask for the missing money in the State and nobody can escape from the clutches of law,” he said. On excavations Attacking the BJP and the AIADMK in equal terms, Mr. Stalin said that Keeladi, which had come out with a lot of excavations, had not been showcased as it should have been by the Centre and State governments. The BJP, he alleged, was not keen to promote it as the leaders were not interested in Tamil culture. Though the officials had submitted two reports on Keeladi, the Centre had not released them. The AIADMK government had also remained silent all these years, fearing trouble, if they raised any questions on the nonchalant attitude of the Centre. Instead of giving jobs to the unemployed youth, the AIADMK government had opened up Amma Mini Clinics to make money for themselves. The DMK, after elections, would bring in drinking water to the parched district from Mullaperiyar river, he said. He also had interaction with the people. Former Minister and MLA KR Periakaruppan and other functionaries were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/law-and-order-situation-has-deteriorated-in-state-stalin/article33787305.ece
09 February 2021||Tiruvarur,TAMIL NADU||Mannargudi ropes in service organisations to maintain cleanliness||Social service organisations in Mannargudi have come forward to assist the civic body in maintaining cleanliness and raise awareness on source segregation of solid wastes among residents in the town. The town, an important centre for business and a hub for the floating population in view of the famous temples within the municipality, generates around 20 tonnes of garbage every day. At present the garbage collected from the town is being dumped at the compost yard which is already overflowing. As per the norm, the Mannargudi civic body should have a compost yard measuring not less than seven acres to handle the garbage generated in the town since it has a total population of little over the 70,000, according to official sources. Further, the efforts taken by the civic body to ensure that the compost yard receives segregated wastes in order to generate bio-manure from the bio-degradable waste under solid waste management exercise hit a roadblock as most of the residents and as well as the trading community continued to deposit unsegregated waste at places convenient to them throughout the town. Hence, the civic body decided to rope in social service organisations functioning in the town in order to create awareness among the residents and trading community people to keep the town neat and tidy. A meeting in this regard was convened recently where the social service organisations have agreed to work with the civic body. They assured the civic authorities that the organisations would distribute pamphlets and make public announcements through autorickshaws fitted with public address systems. They would also convene awareness programmes for the trading community, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mannargudi-ropes-in-service-organisations-to-maintain-cleanliness/article33787255.ece

Eyewitnesses said they had shared information with field staff about the incident on the very night a torched object was hurled at the elephant, The elephant, known to locals as ‘S.I’ and ‘Ronaldo’ was a frequent visitor to the Mavanallah and Vazhaithottam villages in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) because the owners of resorts used to feed the animal to draw in tourists. On January 3, three persons, S. Prasath, 36, from Masinagudi, M. Raymond Dean, 28 and Ricky Rayan, 31, from Vazhaithottam, threw a firebomb at the animal when it came to their illegally functioning homestay. The animal suffered for over two weeks till the Forest Department acted on media reports. However, the animal died soon after it was captured, and two of the three accused were arrested, while Ricky Rayan is absconding. Three persons told The Hindu that the Forest Department was informed of the incident on the night it occurred. “We informed three local field staff. One of them even told us to stay out of the business of the Forest Department,” said one of them. Local residents also alleged that the Forest Department took no efforts to treat the animal till January 18. N. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based conservationist, said that timely treatment could have saved the tusker, known to be a very docile, non-aggressive. “The only reason the elephant had started entering the villages was because these resort owners were feeding it. Their actions have resulted in the mindless death of a majestic elephant, and the Forest Department should act against all the staff responsible for withholding the information,” he said. The family of the two accused also allegedly threatened the whistle-blowers, who shared the video of the incident to the Forest Department. MTR Field Director K.K.Kaushal said the family of the accused would be served a notice. They would be booked under the Wildlife Protection Act if they continued to intimidate local residents. “We will also follow up, conduct an inquiry and take departmental action against the staff responsible for not sharing the information in a timely manner,” said Mr. Kaushal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-took-no-efforts-to-treat-elephant/article33787295.ece

09 February 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Students of Classes 9 and 11 back at school after so long||After 11 months of closure due to COVID-19 pandemic, classroom teaching resumed for Classes 9 and 11 in 388 high schools and higher secondary schools in Virudhunagar district on Monday. The students have returned to the schools with all enthusiasm. Teachers have been mandated to ensure social distancing in classrooms. A maximum of 25 students can be accommodated in one classroom. “We are following all the standard operating procedures (SOP). Whatever we have been following for Classes 10 and 12 have been extended to Classes 9 and 11,” said Chief Educational Officer, K. Baladhandayuthapani. When some of the government and aided schools found that they did not have adequate number of classrooms to accommodate only 25 students in a classroom, the officials have advised them to opt for having classes on alternate days for Classes 9 and 11. “While classroom teaching will go on for six days a week for Classes 10 and 12, the students of standards 9 and 11 will come on alternate days. Thereby, the schools will have adequate number of classrooms for the students,” he added. Twenty five government schools and seven aided schools will follow the alternate days pattern of working for Classes 9 and 11. The CEO has been visiting schools in various parts of the district to find out whether the schools were following the SOPs scrupulously. The CEO saidone of the teachers of a government school in Aruppukottai was found to have contracted COVID-19 few days back. However, since the infection was very mild, there was no need for any panic. The teacher would join duty only after completing the mandatory 14 days quarantine, he added.  In other districts According to School Education department officials, over 90% of the students of Classes 9 and 11 turned up in Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga districts. Teachers and non-teaching staff members ensured that physical distancing norms were adhered to by the students both inside the class and on the campus. Since, many students were meeting each other after a long time, they were happy and exchanged greetings, the teachers said. Some of the education department officials in Karaikudi told reporters that it was not compulsory for parents to send their wards. “If at all anyone feels that their wards can stay back home and continue to study online, we have no objection,” they said. Colleges have also started functioning in full strength.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-of-classes-9-and-11-back-at-school-after-so-long/article33787320.ece

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||It’s back to school for students of classes IX and XI||Regular classes that began on Monday for students of IX and XI was a smooth process since there were still a number of empty classrooms in schools where students could be split and seated. In most of the schools, the usual timetable with eight periods of 45 minutes duration each was not in force. “We chose to follow the pattern of one hour each for five subjects every day. This seems to be workable under the prevailing circumstances,” said James, a teacher of a government-aided school in the city. According to officials, the student turnout was more than the anticipated numbers. Though the physical presence of students was not compulsory, the parents appeared to be inclined towards making the most of the available working days in this academic year, according to school heads. The attendance of students in Tiruchi district was a little more than 70% for ninth and eleventh standards. The classes are already in progress for students of 10th and 12th for which the attendance was in the range of 74 percent. For these students, the classes are beingfor six days a week. As for ninth and Plus One students, classes will be conducted on alternate days, R. Arivazhagan, Chief Educational Officer, said. The level of attendance was similar in Perambalur district - 70 % for ninth standard and nearly 67% for Plus One. The school heads had made arrangements before hand to disinfect the classrooms and adhere to other aspects of the standard operating procedure. To tide over resource constraints in government schools in interior parts, teachers coughed up with their contributions. In many schools the expenditure was made out of the funds provided annually for maintenance purposes. As per the instruction of the school education department, each student was provided with three re-usable face masks. The noon meal centres will become functional during the week, a school head said, adding that most of the students had thought it fit to bring drinking water from their homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-back-to-school-for-students-of-classes-ix-and-xi/article33787264.ece

09 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Basavakalyan project: Case of misplaced priorities?||The kalyani (also called Tripuranta lake) at Basavakalyan in Bidar district is a shadow of its former glory. Built by the Kalyani Chalukya kings, who gave the town its name, a large part of the kalyani is dry because the feeder channels have been blocked. They have not been cleaned for years, while developers have created residential layouts in the watershed. Despite its connection with Basaveshwara, the 12th century reformer and saint-poet, the town remains as backward as the Kalyana Karnataka region. While Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has laid the foundation stone for ‘New Anubhava Mantapa’ to mark the town’s association with the saint, an icon of Veerashaiva-Lingayats, questions have been raised about the priorities of the BJP-led government that banks heavily on the community for electoral reasons.  CM’s pet project  The memorial to Basaveshwara’s Assembly of thinkers, reformers, and activists in the 12th century will cost Rs. 600 crore. In the Assembly session last week, the Chief Minister repeatedly asserted his commitment to the project and said it will be completed within two years and Rs. 200 crore has already been released for the work. “What we need is to see that Basavakalyan is developed as an international centre for culture that Basaveshwara represented,” says R.K. Hudgi, who has written books about Basaveshwara and his contemporary Sharanas. “All his life, Basavanna spoke of the importance of the dynamic against the static. Hence, spending that kind of money on a building in memory of Basavanna is ironic,” he said. “We need to spread Basavanna’s message of equality, fraternity, and dignity of labour and his opposition to caste, class, and gender discrimination to the world. Only a cultural centre can do that.” Bhimashankar Biradar, writer and founder of the Jayadevi Tayi Ligade Literary Association, says that it would have been more meaningful if the government had built a cultural complex with a well-stocked library, an auditorium, and a grand amphitheatre. “We would be happier if the government organises literary events, especially those that compare Vachanas with the Marathi Abhangas and the songs of Telugu Bhakti and the Sufi chants and Naats,” Dr. Biradar said. A senior IAS officer, who has served in Basavakalyan, said funds to the tune of Rs. 600 crore would transform the place and meet all its infrastructure needs. “A smart city gets Rs. 1,000 crore. We can only imagine how Rs. 600 crore would transform a small town like Basavakalyan,” she said. Neglected town The town is so neglected that on most lanes, the gutter runs in the middle of the road since there is no underground drainage system. The town gets drinking water only twice a week and the water purification plant needs an upgrade. The taluk has one government degree college and two government pre-university colleges. Basavakalyan has no postgraduate centre. Gulbarga University is yet to act on its promise of setting up a Vachana Research and Study Centre in Basavakalyan. The 112 villages of the taluk have only 36 high schools between them.  Tourist attractions Basavakalyan, which was the seat of the Kalyani Chalukyas, has several tourist attractions. At the end of town is the well-preserved three-storey vertical fort that houses a temple and a mosque. History buffs come from afar to look at the tripod-mounted long cannons whose bearings are still functional. The taluk headquarters town has the resting places or monuments dedicated to 27 Sharanas. They have all been repaired, conserved, and beautified by the Basava Kalyan Development Board. The other attractions developed by the BKDB are the gardens at Bandavara Oni and Tripuranta, the lake temple of Madiwala Machideva, and the meditation chamber of Basaveshwara. The Chalukyan temples of Umapur and Narayanpur predate the stone temples of Hassan and Banavasi. The Raja Bag Sawar Dargah and the Mallikarjun Swami Dargah are centres of multi-faith worship. The Basavanna temple, the Anubhava Mantapa, and the giant cement statue of Basavanna on the main road attract the faithful in large numbers. However, there is no system of conducting guided tours. There are neither guides nor special taxis to ferry people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/basavakalyan-project-case-of-misplaced-priorities/article33787383.ece
09 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Govt. to set up temporary schools, continue Vidyagama||The State government will set up temporary schools near brick kilns and continue the Vidyagama scheme till regular schools start all classes, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said in Khanapur on Monday. This will help keep a significant number of children in school, he said. “In some taluks, child labour and child marriages are increasing due to the long period of school lockdown in this academic year. It is unfortunate. One of the ways that we can prevent such things is to start colleges in the off-line mode. We will start all classes once the State government takes a decision based on a report from the Health Department’s monitoring committee. Till then, we will open temporary schools for children of workers and continue the Vidyagama programme,” he said. He inspected some government schools and held a meeting of officers in the Block Education Officer’s office. He clarified that regular classes have been opened up for classes 9, 10, 11 and 12 across the State and they are being conducted effectively. To a question, he said that there is no proposal to start mid-day meals in high schools as of now. He said that the pandemic and the lockdown have derailed several schemes and projects of the department. However, “we will try to implement all development programmes in a sustained manner,” he added. He said that English-Kannada dual medium schools have received a positive response. This experiment has not changed the State government policy of teaching Kannada as a compulsory subject in all schools, he said. In the government Marathi-medium school in Jamboti, the Minister sang Jai Bharat Jananiya Tanujate, the State song. He later told journalists that the leadership in Maharashtra should attain maturity and focus on development issues. “They should stop raising old issues and stop diverting people’s attention away from the real ones,” he said. He said that the State government was committed to promoting Kannada and introduction of Kannada in schools. “I have visited schools in border areas across the State. I will be visiting some border area schools in Kalyan Karnataka too,” he added. He said that he recognised the handicap suffered by students in remote areas in reaching schools that are far off. Students in forest areas or remote villages without bus connectivity suffer greatly. “We are requesting the KSRTC and other State-run transport undertakings to introduce more buses to such areas. We are also asking them to distribute student passes to a larger number of school-goers. The Education Department will also consider arranging alternative transport facilities to remote areas if buses cannot reach there,” he said. The government will ensure that no school suffered from shortage of teachers, he said. Later, the Minister inaugurated the high school building renovated by the Vidya Vikas Samiti in Jamboti village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-to-set-up-temporary-schools-continue-vidyagama/article33787362.ece
09 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Case filed against Kangana Ranaut||A lawyer from Belagavi has filed a criminal case against actress Kangana Ranaut for allegedly insulting farmers and the country. City-based advocate Harshvardhan Patil, said he filed a complaint chargeing her with offences under IPC sections 153, 154, 503, 504 505- 1, 505 A, 505 B, 505-2, and 506. Mr. Patil told journalists in Belagavi on Monday that he would approach the court if the city police refused to file an FIR against the actor and start an investigation. He said that he had filed cases against the Bollywood celebrity, as he found that her social media posts had insulted protesting farmers by calling them terrorists. “She had insulted India, its Army and the people, by describing it as a divided house,” he said. “Farmers are fighting for their rights. They are leading a peaceful agitation against oppressive farm bills. The actor has spoken against them and termed them terrorists. This is not acceptable,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/case-filed-against-kangana-ranaut/article33787376.ece
09 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Smart City plans opposed||Residents of Tilakwadi area in Belagavi who frequent the Vaccine Depot Grounds for morning walks and open air meetings in the evenings have opposed Smart City plans to utilise the area for purposes other than afforestation. They held a meeting in the Vaccine Depot area here on Sunday saying that they will explore legal action against Smart City plans to construct an art gallery and aviation gallery on the grounds, as these will destroy greenery in the park. They clarified that they were not opposed to the city getting art galleries, but they will prefer to have them outside the grounds, in drier areas without much green cover. They demanded that Smart City officers should instead use the grounds for afforestation and developing the area as a medicinal plant nursery and garden. Some of the residents volunteered to take care of the medicinal plants, if they were to be so planted. However, some other residents said that such protests were politically motivated to bring a bad name to Member of Legislative Assembly Abhay Patil who is trying to set up the art galleries. The meeting ended without a conclusion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/smart-city-plans-opposed/article33787359.ece
09 February 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||IIHR develops new water-conserving irrigation tech||Scientists at the Hesaraghatta-based Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) have developed a new irrigation method, which conserves even more water than drip irrigation. The new method, developed on a small experimental plot at the institute, uses only one-tenth of the water used in drip irrigation, according to C. Aswath, principal scientist and head of IIHR's Division of Floriculture and Medicinal Plants. Dr. Aswath, who developed the model on display at the IIHR’s National Horticulture Fair that began on Monday, told The Hindu that the institute would further test the model on a bigger plot. “The new model is a hybrid (combined) version of two different hydroponics methods of nutrient film technology (NFT) and wick system,” he explained. In this model, water is circulated through a pipe that is laid underground. This pipe will have holes through which wicks are inserted. They will suck water that flows through the pipe and dampen the roots of plants. The water which is pumped through the pipe is collected at the end and recirculated. Dr. Aswath said water is made to circulate to ensure availability of more dissolved oxygen to help the growth of plants. “The main disadvantage of drip irrigation is that it supplies water above the ground. But when the water percolates into the ground, it clogs the air pores present in the soil. These air pores that have oxygen pockets are crucial for plant breathing. The new hybrid version does not clog the air pores as it works on capillary force,” he says. The nutrients and fertilizers are supplied to plants through the pipe, he pointed out. According to him, the new system may turn out to be a game changer if it turns out to be successful on large tracts and it can boost farming in dry areas. It can be adopted only for cultivation of horticultural crops like fruits and vegetables as well as greens, he notes. He wants to take up another experiment to know whether the hybrid model helps in purifying chloride water from deep borewells. The wick system has been developed in both vertical and horizontal mode for terrace gardening in urban areas. This, he says, would encourage urbanites to pursue terrace gardening as a hobby. He has grown greens using the vertical model and vegetable crops with the horizontal model, which are on display at the ongoing fair that will go on till February 12 at the IIHR campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/iihr-develops-new-water-conserving-irrigation-tech/article33787373.ece
09 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Anti-cow slaughter Bill will hurt farmers’||Members of the Opposition Congress and JD(S) came down heavily on the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, that was later passed amid din through voice vote on Monday. They dubbed it “anti-farmer” and alleged that it intends to a target a particular community. Senior Congress member C.M. Ibrahim said he was a farmer himself and the Bill, which prohibits slaughter of all cattle except buffaloes above the age of 13, would adversely impact the farm economy. “Once a cow stops giving milk, or an ox turns old, a farmer sells it and uses that money to buy new cows and oxen. A complete ban on slaughter of cattle now disrupts this chain. If the government wants a complete ban on slaughter, they must buy the cattle from farmers,” he said. JD(S) MLC P. Thippeswamy suggested a long list of amendments, including sections that impose a complete ban on cattle slaughter. Senior Congress leader B. K. Hariprasad, quoting a 2012 cattle survey, said that States with stringent cow slaughter laws had reported the sharpest decline in cattle population. “A cattle slaughter ban makes cattle rearing unviable and farmers, who presently dominate the milk sector through cooperatives, will slowly move away from it. This might only lead to corporatisation of the sector,” he said, to loud protests from the Treasury benches. He also said, “Neither the Hinduism of Swami Vivekananda nor the Hindutva of V.D. Savarkar that the BJP follows prescribed fanatic cow protection.” He alleged that the ruling BJP was only using the law to play “communal politics” and encourage vigilante gau rakshaks . Mr. Ibrahim and another Congress member, Naseer Ahmed, appealed to the government “not to give a communal colour to the Bill” and said it had the potential to encourage cow vigilantism, which has earlier led to lynchings. Mr. Ahmed also said that it was a cheap source of protein consumed by a section of the Hindu community as well. Minister’s defence Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai defended the Bill, arguing that it was for the protection of cattle “that play a key role in our lives, especially cows that are considered sacred in Indian tradition”. He promised that the State government would make sufficient budgetary allocations to take care of cattle. “We will increase the capacity of existing goshalas and open more as well,” he said. Though he promised to respond to the concerns raised over farm economy issues, the Bill was put to vote before he could respond. The BJP was keen on the Bill being passed in the Legislative Council on Monday itself, before JD(S) member Basavaraj Horatti was elected as the new Chairman on Tuesday, a member of the saffron party explained.

09 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ayanur criticises Ministers for participating in protests||Senior BJP member Ayanur Manjunath took an oblique dig at senior Minister K.S. Eshwarappa for participating in the protest by Kuruba community members demanding Scheduled Tribe status on Sunday. Speaking on the motion of thanks for the Governor’s address in the Legislative Council on Monday, Mr. Manjunath, without naming Ms. Eshwarappa, said it was strange to see sitting Ministers participating in protests. “Ministers may go and accept a memorandum from protesters. If the Ministers themselves are part of the protest, to whom should the protesters submit their demands?” he asked. “I am not talking only about what happened on Sunday; this has happened with leaders from all parties for some years now, especially when the protests are led by their communities. Ministers take an oath to act without showing any favour or grudge towards anyone. So is this not against the Constitution? Shouldn’t the Governor, who is the constitutional head, have called and advised them?” Mr. Manjunath, a close associate of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, made snide remarks about some other Ministers too. He said that Mr. Yediyurappa had started as a councillor and grown to become Chief Minister through struggle. “Such leaders who have a connect with the people are open to criticisms and suggestions and try to correct themselves,” he said, adding that this was not the case of with “people who fall from above”. Policies criticised Mr. Manjunath was also critical of certain policies of the BJPgovernment in the State. “I demand that the government accept the recommendations for hike in the salaries of 32,000 National Health Mission workers. They are the ones who went to the homes of COVID-19 patients, which is like knocking on the door of death,” he said. He also appealed for a resolution to the “guest lecturer crisis” in the State. “As a BJP leader, I am all in support of the anti-cow slaughter Bill. I consider cows sacred and they need to be protected. But just like gau , gurus have to be protected. Our priorities should not be restricted,” Mr. Manjunath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ayanur-criticises-ministers-for-participating-in-protests/article33787512.ece
09 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Modi lauds Deve Gowda for his remarks on farmers’ agitation||In yet another sign of the BJP and the JD(S) warming up to each other, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday lauded former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda for his remarks on the ongoing farmers’ agitation during his reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha. Mr. Modi said that the JD(S) supremo’s observations had “brought seriousness to the discussion” and that Mr. Gowda had lauded some steps taken by the government while also giving “constructive suggestions”. He also later tweeted that Mr. Gowda’s words had “added great perspective to the debate” and recalled his “strong association with the agriculture sector”. Earlier, raising the issue during the motion of thanks on the President’s speech, Mr. Gowda, while not asking for a repeal of the three new and controversial farm laws, asked the Union government to hold talks with the protesting farmers instead of “building concrete walls”. He also condemned the violence that broke out on January 26, but said the government should not punish farmers for the actions of “a few miscreants”. He highlighted the fact that agriculture was a State subject and said the Centre should have sought the States’ concurrence on the matter. “I am on the last leg of my life. I demand that the government end this matter peacefully. Let them call for a meeting with the farmers’ delegation. Some leaders of this House can also join and we will give our suggestions to close this matter... The government thinks punishing them will solve issues.

09 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||After HC rap, govt. sets up disaster response fund||After the High Court of Karnataka cautioned the Chief Secretary about passing a drastic order on the government’s failure, the State government has finally set up the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) 13 years after the Disaster Management Act, 2005, came into force. In his affidavit filed before the court, Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar said that a new account, by the name of SDRF, has been created, and the funds available with the heads of the existing Management of Natural Disaster, Contingency Plans in disaster-prone areas would transferred to it. On the District Disaster Response Fund (DDRF), the Chief Secretary stated that the Calamity Personal Deposit Account of Deputy Commissioner has been converted into DDRF, and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) would be able to operate this fund through the DC, who is the head chairperson of the DDMA. The notifications issued last week have been submitted before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum during the hearing of PIL petitions filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority and Mallikarjuna A., an agriculturist from Tumakuru district, on the issue of implementation of the DM Act. During an earlier hearing, the court had viewed seriously the Chief Secretary’s two separate statements, that the SDRF would be established only in the next financial year, and that the SDRF would be set up only after the State legislature granted approval for budgetary allocation. The Bench adjourned further hearing till March 1 while directing the government to comply with various other provisions of the DM Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/after-hc-rap-govt-sets-up-disaster-response-fund/article33787380.ece
09 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Leopard caught at Bheemanakuppe||A leopard which was on the prowl was caught by the Forest Department on Monday morning at Kolur, near Bheemanakuppe, in Kengeri limits. This comes close on the heels of a leopard being caught near an apartment complex in Begur. According to A.A. Gopal, Range Forest Officer, Kaggalipura, the nearly five-year-old leopard had been sighted multiple times over the past fortnight in Bheemanakuppe, Kolur and surrounding areas by local residents who had also complained about the disappearance of their dogs and goats. “Many residents were scared to step outside their homes. We had kept two cages – one in Bheemanakuppe and another in Kolur, which is around 4-km away. The young male leopard was trapped in a cage at Kolur around 4.30 a.m. on Monday,” he said. Forest officials suspect that the wild cat could have strayed into human habitation in an attempt to escape the blasting at nearby Muddenapalya, where a government housing project is coming up. “But we cannot say for sure that this is where the leopard is from. Wild cats roam in a 40-km radius,” they said. A senior official said the leopard underwent a medical test and the health assessment report is awaited. “Veterinarians checked the animal’s claws and teeth, and also for any physical injury. The animal is healthy, and will be released into the wild soon,” an official said. Citing the case of the leopard that was caught at Begur, the official said health assessment had revealed that its hunting capacity had reduced. “The animal will once again stray into human habitation if released, since it cannot survive in the wilderness. The animal is currently in the Bannerghatta Rescue Centre,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/leopard-caught-at-bheemanakuppe/article33787685.ece

09 February 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Seers should not cross the Lakshman Rekha’||Taking exception to the kind of language used by Dingaleshwar Swami while commenting on the ongoing Moorusavir Mutt land row, Chairman of VRL Goup and former Member of Parliament Vijay Sankeshwar has said that heads of religious institutions should not cross the Lakshman Rekha while speaking on public platforms. Speaking to presspersons on the sidelines of a book release function at his residence in Hubballi on Monday, Mr. Sankeshwar expressed his displeasure over the language being used by seers of various mutts, including Dingaleshwar Swami, and said that it was unbecoming of a religious head to speak in such a tone and language. Without naming any other seer, Mr. Sankeshwar took exception to the language and tone of a few other seers while they commented on the Chief Minister of the State recently. Committee Regarding the allegations being made by Dingaleshwar Swami against the high-level committee of the mutt on the issue of handing over of the mutt land to KLE Society for the establishment of a medical college, he said that the committee was constituted by Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami and he (swami) persuaded them [members] to be part of it as he was finding it difficult to run the mutt. “However, as the committee failed to meet on regular basis to take decisions, I came out of the committee 10 years ago,” he said. On the land row, Mr. Sankeshwar said that KLE Society belonged to all and not just Lingayats. “The decision was taken by the earlier swami 35 years ago as he wanted to save the land and use it for a good cause. It was because of the legal issues and delay in getting government permission that the process was delayed,” he said. Land value Mr. Sankeshwar said that Dingaleshwar Swami was erring in his conduct. “Dingaleshwar Swami has spoken about using the money of Balehosur Mutt for the development of Moorusavir Mutt. Who gave him the authority in the first place. The mutt gave the land 35 years ago and I know the value of the land. If the swami [Dingaleshwar] can mobilise Rs. 100 crore for the mutt, I will get the land back from KLE Society,” he said. On how to resolve the issue, he said that the simple way forward will be a dialogue between the two seers on the issue and the solution will emerge on its own. No devotee of the mutt will object if the seers sort out the issue amicably as also the issue of successor to the mutt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seers-should-not-cross-the-lakshman-rekha/article33787368.ece

09 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Students coming from Kerala to be tested on mission mode||All students coming from Kerala to colleges in Dakshina Kannada will be tested for COVID-19, while daily pass holders will be tested once in every fortnight, according to Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra here on Monday. Talking to reporters following a meeting with Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar and officers from the Revenue and Health departments and Mangaluru City Corporation, Dr. Rajendra said that the district administration will work with other departments to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from Kerala in Dakshina Kannada. “It is a difficult task for the district administration as the boundary with Kerala is porous. We will try to tighten measures without placing restrictions on movement (across borders) and stop the rise of cases in Dakshina Kannada,” he said. Dr. Rajendra said that Rapid Antigen Test will be carried out for people entering the district from the three important check-posts. Some people will be subjected to RT-PCR tests at these check-posts. He said that the district administration has set a target of testing about 8,000 students coming from Kerala to study in colleges in Dakshina Kannada. “They will be asked not to commute to their places. If they visit their native places, they will be asked to produce RT-PCR test negative report when they come back (to their institutions),” Dr. Rajendra said. The district administration, he said, has planned to have one officer for every 50 daily pass holders and test people, who are in touch with these pass holders, once every 15 days. Teams comprising police, revenue and municipality personnel will be deployed for enforcement of COVID-19 protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-coming-from-kerala-to-be-tested-on-mission-mode/article33787866.ece
09 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Vishnugupta Vishwa Vidyapeetha to open gurukulas for Halakki, Mukri communities||Seer of Ramachandrapura Mutt Raghaveshwara Bharati Swami said on Sunday that the Vishnugupta Vishwa Vidyapeetha (VVV) set up by the mutt in Gokarna of Uttara Kannada district will open two special gurukulas for Halakki and Mukri communities in Gokarna from the academic year 2021-22. Addressing a virtual press meet from Gokarna, he said that Gurukulas that have already been started at the vidyapeetha have received tremendous response from society. Taking inspiration from this and to preserve the culture and tradition of Halakki community, Halakki Gurukula and for the overall development of Mukri community belonging to Scheduled Castes, Chandragupta Gurukula will be opened from class six. The two Gurukulas will be established by creating an environment that sheds light on the special features of both these communities at an estimated cost of Rs. 10 crore, he said. With Indian traditional education, modern education based on NIOS curriculum will be imparted. Along with residential education, students are allowed to travel to and fro from their houses daily for studies. In both these Gurukulas, while introducing students to the unique arts, culture, rituals, food, traditions and beliefs of the respective community, they will also be allowed to study the richness of the Hindu culture. Thus, by providing these students with the best contemporary education, the intention is to develop these students as an asset to society, the seer said. Due to the influence of Western ideology, each and every branch of traditional Indian knowledge has either lost its original form or has its meaning. The rest are on the brink of extinction. The Gurukulas have been started with the idea that revival of these dwindling branches of knowledge should begin from the ground up, he said. The seer said that even amid the pandemic, Gurukulas started by the vidyapeetha have received tremendous response in its first year itself and VVV will gradually open itself up to higher education. In this connection, VVV Vidya Parishad and Vyavastha Parishad have come up with a working plan and once VVV becomes fully operational, it will be called as the resurrection of Takshashila, he said. Halakki community people are found in large numbers in Karwar, Ankola, Kumta and Honnavar taluks of Uttara Kannada district. Their Gurukula will be gradually developed into a permanent centre for holistic study of Halakki community, he said. Like Halakkis, the Mukri community people are traditional disciples of the mutt based in Hosanagar in Shivamogga district. The mutt has decided to ensure their development on a priority. The intention of the Gurukulas is that the people of this community should join mainstream society, while retaining the individuality and uniqueness of their culture, the seer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vishnugupta-vishwa-vidyapeetha-to-open-gurukulas-for-halakki-mukri-communities/article33787858.ece

09 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Charmadi GP begins imposing fines on garbage throwers on the ghat||Throwing or dumping garbage on the evergreen Charmadi Ghat section on the National Highway 73 in Dakshina Kannada will henceforth cost one’s pocket as the Charmadi Gram Panchayat has begun imposing fines on such persons. Panchayat Development Officer (PDO) Prakash Shetty has cautioned that the panchayat will also file criminal cases against such persons. Mr. Shetty told The Hindu that as a first step, the panchayat imposed a fine of Rs. 500 on a man after catching him red-handed while throwing garbage by the side of the highway on Sunday. Incidentally, the man who threw garbage was from nearby Ujire. He said that the panchayat and the local people together have been creating awareness against throwing garbage by the side of the highway and in other public places in the jurisdiction of the panchayat for the past two months. The panchayat has been making announcements using a loud speaker mounted on a vehicle. The local people and the panchayat together have begun lifting the garbage dumped by the side of the highway for a stretch of about 5 km between the Forest Department nursery in Mundaje and Ninth Cross on the Charmadi Ghat. The panchayat will shortly install CCTV cameras in identified places to catch the garbage dumpers in the act, he said. People threw garbage on the stretch usually between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. It also includes some tourists using the highway which links Chikkamagaluru with Mangaluru and Dharmasthala, he said and added that the concentration of tourist vehicles is high during weekends and holidays as the highway connected both tourist destinations and religious places. “There is a team of local youths that has volunteered to keep a vigil against garbage dumpers,” he said and added that it will also take photographs of such persons while they made attempts to throw garbage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/charmadi-gp-begins-imposing-fines-on-garbage-throwers-on-the-ghat/article33787865.ece

According to Puttur Women Police, the victim was among the 20 friends who had attended a party at the guesthouse. The party had been hosted by a naval officer Joylin Pinto on his posting to Andaman Nicobar Islands. As it was too late, the victim and three others stayed back at the guesthouse. At around 5 a.m. on Saturday, the accused, Brayen Richard Amanna, who was among the four persons who had stayed back, entered the room of the victim and sexually assaulted her.

09 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||DCs of Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar districts get the jab||Arguing that the country’s COVID-19 vaccine was safe, three deputy commissioners of Mysuru region – Rohini Sindhuri (Mysuru), M.V. Venkatesh (Mandya) and M.R. Ravi (Chamarajanagar) – took the jab on Monday on the occasion of the launch of second phase of vaccination for the frontline warriors. The first phase of vaccination was launched for the healthcare workers. Ms. Sindhuri, who took the first dose of the vaccine at the District Hospital on KRS Road here, said the vaccine India has produced against the contagion was totally safe and there have been no adverse effects. Therefore, the officials and the staff of the departments identified for the vaccination in the second phase need not have to worry and can take the vaccine without any fear, she advised. “I have taken the vaccine and I am perfectly fine. There is absolutely no need for those taking vaccines to get nervous about the jab. We should not doubt the country’s innovation. Moreover, many countries were seeking the vaccine produced in India, expressing their confidence in the country’s innovation,” she said. Ms. Sindhuri said everybody will get the vaccine in different phases and nobody should resist when their turn comes. There shouldn’t be any room for laxity since the vaccine was easily available. The vaccine may take some more time to reach the entire population and therefore the people must take all necessary precautions, especially wearing masks, until they get vaccinated, she added.. Mandya Mr. Venkatesh took the jab to send a message that the vaccine doesn’t cause any adverse effects. “I am taking the Covishield vaccine as a frontline warrior,” the DC said, after taking the injection along with ZP CEO Zulfikar Ulla, at the Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS) Hospital in Mandya. Mr. Venkatesh said he was perfectly fine after taking the jab. “I had no adverse effect. I am healthy and spent 30 minutes in the observation room as advised by the doctors. Whoever has been scheduled to take a vaccine this phase can take the jab without any worries. All necessary measures have been taken in the second phase of the vaccination by the health and MIMS authorities,” he said, expressing hope to conquer the pandemic soon. Chamarajanagar Mr. Ravi got vaccinated against COVID-19 at the district hospital in Chamarajanagar town. Then the vaccination of frontline warriors of the district began.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dcs-of-mysuru-mandya-chamarajanagar-districts-get-the-jab/article33787506.ece
09 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||It’s now the turn of frontline workers in Mysuru||After the healthcare workers, it’s now the turn of frontline workers to get the jab against COVID-19 with the launch of the second phase of vaccination on Monday. Though not all the registered healthcare workers of the district took the vaccine, the authorities in Mysuru hope to cover all the frontline workers identified for the inoculation, with sufficient stocks of Covishield vaccine available for carrying out the task, like the way it was done for the healthcare workers in the first phase complying with the protocols. The target in Mysuru is to cover 16,657 beneficiaries belonging to the Departments of Revenue and Police, and pourakarmikas from the city corporation and the municipalities. In Mysuru city, six vaccination centres at the trauma care centre on KRS Road and three at the district hospital on KRS Road will carry out the task. The frontline workers in the taluks will get the vaccine at the respective taluk hospitals and those from the rural areas will get the jab at the respective primary and community health centeres. Unlike the vaccine sessions for the healthcare workers where a maximum of 100 persons a day could be vaccinated, the vaccination centress had been told to administer a maximum of 200 beneficiaries a day in the second phase. Sources told The Hindu that the vaccinated healthcare workers would be getting their second dose from the third week of this month, based on the date of their immunisation, completing 28 days from the first dose. “All the healthcare workers should have taken the jab as the vaccine was safe. They have missed the opportunity and we don’t know when will their turn come again if they wish to take the vaccine,” a senior doctor from the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI), who took the vaccine, told The Hindu . Kodagu In Kodagu, the vaccination for frontline workers will begin from Tuesday since the administration was occupied in making arrangements for the visit of President Ram Nath Kovind on February 6. As many as 3,152 beneficiaries are to be covered in three days at 14 centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/its-now-the-turn-of-frontline-workers-in-mysuru/article33787498.ece
09 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Two youths murdered||The brutal murder of two youths after a drunken brawl near at Yele Thota in Krishnaraja police station limits late on Sunday night has given a jolt to the citizens of Mysuru. The deceased, Kiran and Kishan, both in their late twenties, were hacked to death with sharp weapons by another group comprising four persons when their talks over a property dispute turned sour. One more person, Madhusudan, who accompanied Kiran and Kishan, escaped with injuries and is undergoing treatment at a hospital. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) A.N. Prakash Gowda, who visited the spot, told reporters that Kiran, an auto driver and resident of Gowrishankar Nagar in the ity, had an old dispute with the accused, Swami, over a plot of land near Chamundi Hills. On Sunday evening, Kiran, along with his friends Kishan, who works in a car showroom, and Madhusudan, an autodriver, went to meet Swami and his relative Dilip at a spot near Yele Thota, which falls on the road leading to Mysuru-Nanjangud Road from Chamundipuram. Mr. Gowda said the talks, which were held after consuming liquor, soon led to a confrontation between the two groups. Swami and Dilip left the place only to return soon with two more accomplices and unleash an attack on Kiran and Kishan, killing both of them on the spot. Madhusudan, however, managed to flee from the spot and report the matter to the police, who admitted him to a hospital. “He is out of danger”, Mr. Gowda said. Surrender Meanwhile, two of the accused persons, Swami and Dilip, surrendered before the police on Monday. “We have taken them into custody and interrogating them”, Mr. Gowda said. The two groups had nurtured enmity between them for a long time over a plot of land, he said. The police is looking for two more accused persons – Raghu and Dilip. The police is questioning the accused in their custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-youths-murdered/article33787502.ece
09 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Land acquisition for highway opposed||Hundreds of farmers belonging to Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) and Hasiru Sene staged a protest in Mysuru against land acquisition for the new highway linking NH 275 and connecting to Madikeri. The project requires over 900 acres for which the land acquisition process has commenced but the farmers claimed that they have not been consulted. Badagalpura Nagendra of the KRRS said a protest against the project launched sometime ago forced the government to stall the project but there are indications of the works commencing once again. He said the existing Mysuru-Bantwal highway provided a link to Madikeri and the same stretch could be further upgraded without causing further diversion of farm land for infrastructure development. The KRRS activists said the proposed alignment of the new road cuts through the Lakshmanthirtha and Harangi command areas and thousands of families will be left in the lurch if the land was acquired. The KRRS activists said the new project requires 900 acres of land most of which is highly fertile and irrigated tracts with coconut plantations. Acquiring farm land will throw out hundreds of farmers out of work and render them unemployed. The farmers also said the compensation by the government does not merit serious consideration as the rate quoted was way below the prevailing market rate. Any compensation paid dissipates within matter of years and the land losers tend to be on streets eking out a living as daily wagers, according to the activists. The agitating farmers groups said though the land in question is highly fertile and irrigated, the government has pegged the cost of acquisition at Rs. 1 crore per acre and said that it was inadequate. Drawing attention to similar land acquisition exercise in the past, the farmers said that the government had procured land at the cost of Rs. 36 lakh per acre for a housing society in Naganahalli way back in 2008 and hence the present valuation of Rs. 1 crore was an under-estimation. They wanted all works related to the project to be disbanded until the issues raised were resolved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/land-acquisition-for-highway-opposed/article33787496.ece
09 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Respite for Kodagu coffee industry?||Will the crisis-hit coffee industry in Kodagu be helped from the Centre’s ‘One District, One Product’ initiative? The continuous landslides and floods in the hill district had badly hit the industry which had sought a relief package to overcome the loss it suffered. Kodagu was identified under the Centre’s new initiative as it was the largest coffee producer in the State. Nearly 40 percent of the country’s coffee was produced by the estates in Kodagu, which has nearly 30 percent of the country’s coffee growing area. The coffee output was affected by nearly 50 percent in the wake of extensive rains besides landslides and waterlogging. In 2020, the pandemic added to the difficulties, causing further loss to the industry, which faced many hurdles during the COVID-19 induced lockdown. The coffee growers and the industry have welcomed the initiative under the PM Formalisation of Micro Enterprises (PMFME), hoping that Kodagu’s coffee industry would bounce back and regain its old charm. Thanks to the launch of PMFME, Kodagu was identified for the promotion and support of coffee where it is cultivated extensively. The initiative under Atma Nirbhar Bharat aims to help those engaged in coffee processing. The programme intends to support the processing units in storage, segregation, grading, branding, labelling, marketing, and export of coffee. The scheme will be in force from 2020-21 to 2024-25. The Food Processing Organisations (FPOs) and cooperative units having experience of coffee processing for over three years and having a turnover of Rs. 1 crore and above can get 35% of the loan on the project cost. “Financial aid for value addition and other needs is possible up to a maximum of 35 percent of the project cost of Rs 10 lakh for each beneficiary,” said Kodagu Joint Director of Agriculture Shabhana M Sheikh. What is important here is that the units would get technical support from the prestigious CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru and IIFPT. Interested individuals can submit their applications for the financial aid visiting http://pmfme.mofpi.gov.in However, associations, FPOs, groups, federations, self-help groups, and cooperative bodies can submit applications directly to the office of Joint Director of Agriculture, Madikeri. For more information about the initiative and its benefits, interested persons can call the office of the Joint Director or 1-1302281089 (New Delhi number). They can get inputs by sending mail to support-pmfme@mofpi. gov.in The applications are to be submitted on or before February 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/respite-for-kodagu-coffee-industry/article33787489.ece
09 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘Quota soon for Mayor, Dy. Mayor posts’||Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, on Monday expressed hope that the State government will announce reservation for the post of Mayors and Deputy Mayors of different City Corporations in two to three days’ time. He told reporters in Mysuru an announcement in the regard was taking time in view of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s preoccupation with the ensuing Legislature session and pre-Budget meetings. However, he said he was hoping for the announcement soon. In Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which is a hung house, Mr. Somashekar said the BJP was looking forward to secure the post of Mayor by aligning with the JD(S). In the 65-member MCC, the BJP has 22 members while the Congress and JD(S) have 19 and 18 members respectively. One BSP member and 5 independents make up the rest. Though the JD(S) and Congress are presently in alliance in the MCC, sharing power, Mr. Somashekar referred to a recent statement made by Mr. Siddaramaiah that the Congress was not in alliance with the JD(S) in the State and said the BJP was open to joining hands with JD(S).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/quota-soon-for-mayor-dy-mayor-posts/article33787499.ece

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BMRCL has a plan to ease traffic congestion on Old Madras Road||Traffic bottlenecks and disruption of vehicular movement, especially near Tin Factory, are proving to be a major hurdle for construction of the Namma Metro elevated corridor on Old Madras Road. To fix this problem, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is spending Rs. 300 crore to acquire land for widening the road on either side. It will also build five bus bays to ease traffic congestion. A total of 75 properties will make way for road widening. The existing stretch of road from the under-construction K.R. Puram metro station to Tin Factory will be widened to five lanes with the addition of three lanes. A portion of the stretch has already been widened to ease traffic. The BMRCL is planning to add one more lane to the existing three-lane road to help traffic moving towards the city. On the opposite side – from Benniganahalli lake to K.R. Puram railway station – the corporation wants to build two additional lanes to the existing three-lane road. The elevated metro corridor will extend the existing Purple Line from Baiyappanahalli to Whitefield. According to officials, 82% of civil work has been completed from Baiyappanahalli to Visvesvaraya Industrial Area metro station and 97% in Visvesvaraya Industrial Area. Compared to other stretches on the line, Tin Factory is proving to be problematic given that the busy area is already congested. Officials hope that widening of the road will ease the problem. The proposed line from Outer Ring Road to Kempegowda International Airport will pass via K.R. Puram. “Easing traffic congestion is very crucial for carrying out metro work,” said Channappa Goudar, General Manager (land acquisition), BMRCL. Land acquisition is also proving to be a challenge as a huge number of buildings are located on either side of the busy road. “Final notification has already been issued for acquiring land from Benniganahalli lake towards K.R. Puram railway station. Under K.R. Puram cable bridge, the BMRCL is acquiring railway land to widen the road, and provide a link to Whitefield Road and ORR. The BMRCL will provide alternative land to South Western Railways (SWR) by acquiring land of their choice near the station,” he added. Under the cable bridge, the BMRCL is acquiring over 5,000 square metres of land to widen the road. The official added that primary notification has already been issued to acquire several properties to widen the road from Tin Factory towards the flyover that links the ORR (Hebbal side).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-has-a-plan-to-ease-traffic-congestion-on-old-madras-road/article33787690.ece

The cost of the project is estimated at Rs. 120 crore. Land acquisition According to a communiqué on Monday, the iconic rotary ROB will be constructed with minimum acquisition of private properties and the existing service lanes will remain untouched. The rotary will connect Banaswadi Main Road, Kammanahalli Main Road and Old Madras Road with the new Sir M. Visvesvaraya railway terminal at Baiyappanahalli. The two lanes are being added to the two-lane ROB without any additional land acquisition from the defence establishment. Status of work The communiqué stated that the goods terminal at Baiyappanahalli is being converted into a passenger terminal, and the expected footfall is likely to be over one lakh each day. Work on the terminal is nearing completion. Railway authorities had urged the State government and BBMP to develop the road connecting Banaswadi Main Road to Old Madras Road, which leads to the terminal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-to-give-fillip-to-baiyappanahalli-terminal-with-robs/article33787684.ece

Random checks were leading to slowing down of traffic movement. However, the decision to resume random checking across the city was taken up as motorists are ignoring repeated notices to pay outstanding dues, police said. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police, Traffic, said that in the last three years, they have not stopped vehicles for random checks. They were booking violations through contactless enforcement cameras and the Public Eye mobile app, and sending notices to motorists. Through this, the police have booked 95 lakh traffic violations, which translates into fines amounting to Rs. 390 crore. However, very few people have paid the fines. The rest continue to ignore multiple notices to pay up and also repeat the offences. This would not only increase indiscipline on the roads, but also lead to accidents, which can sometimes prove fatal for other road users and motorists, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/random-checking-of-vehicles-back/article33787688.ece

According to the Department of Health and Family Welfare, as many as 18,763 frontline workers were vaccinated on Monday. A total of 22% of the 87,105 targeted frontline workers were vaccinated. They included pourakarmikas, police personnel and officials of the Revenue and Rural Development & Panchayat Raj departments, among others. In some districts, the response for vaccination was poor. The lowest target was achieved by Chamarajnagar where only 5% of the target was achieved. The highest percentage was in Uttara Kannada district where 45% of the frontline workers took the jab. Ramesh, a pourakarmika who works in the Dattatreya Temple ward in Bengaluru, was one of the first frontline workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the presence of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at K.C. General Hospital. He was eagerly waiting to get vaccinated as he spends a significant part of the day on the field, which puts him at risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection. “Many of my colleagues are worried about getting vaccinated. Hopefully, they will see people like me as examples and get vaccinated quickly,” he said. He had mild fever, and the doctors had very clearly briefed him of the possible side-effects after vaccination. In many districts, the Deputy Commissioners and senior IPS officials took the jab to encourage their staff to take the vaccine. The vaccination for frontline workers took place in all districts in the State barring Kodagu, where it will begin on Tuesday as the district administration was occupied in making arrangements for the visit of President Ram Nath Kovind on February 6. In many districts, the number of people to be vaccinated at each site was increased from 100 to 200 as both healthcare workers and frontline workers had to be administered the vaccine. For instance, in Mysuru, unlike the vaccine sessions for healthcare workers where a maximum of 100 persons a day could be vaccinated, the vaccination centres had been told to administer a maximum of 200 beneficiaries a day in the second phase. Some frontline workers who had co-morbid conditions and those who were on immune suppressants drugs said that they would write to the government to leave them out of the list of beneficiaries, a health department official in Mysuru said. In addition, 23% of the targeted 20,754 healthcare workers were vaccinated on Monday. The vaccination for healthcare workers did not take place in 20 of the 30 districts as the focus was on vaccinating frontline workers. Second dose Sources told The Hindu in Mysuru that vaccinated healthcare workers would start getting their second dose from the third week of this month, based on the date of their immunisation. The second dose is to be administered 28 days after the first one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/22-of-targeted-frontline-workers-vaccinated/article33787697.ece

Four films that deal with the farmers’ suicides, land disputes, and corporate farming were screened as part of the festival organised jointly by Manujamata Siniyana, a group of film enthusiasts, Sahamata Film Society and the Trust. More than 40 people from different parts of the State watched the movies and participated in the discussion. Chikkamagaluru Assistant Commissioner H.L. Nagaraj, inaugurated the festival on Saturday. In his inaugural address, he opined that though the monetary value of agricultural land had been on the rise in recent years, it had lost its fertility necessary to meet the demand. “The advances in agricultural practices in the recent decades have impacted the quality of crops”, he said. Later, participating in discussions, the officer said he had seen hundreds of farmers facing difficulty for decades because of their ignorance concerning maintaining documents of their land. The officers had the task of relieving them of their problems, he added. Ivan D’silva of Sahamata Film Society said the festival was organised with agriculture as a theme to understand the problems faced by the farming community. The film lovers actively participated in the festival and responded to the issues that the films handled. K. Phaniraj of Manujamata Siniyana said this was the first film festival after the COVID-19 pandemic. “We have been organising at least three film festivals in a year at different places of the State. For the last year, we could not hold one due to the pandemic. This is an exercise to watch movies selected on a certain theme and discuss to understand the movies better”, he said. The participants included Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy member Pradeep Kumar Shetty, writer B. Chandre Gowda, advocate H.M. Poornima, poet C. Ravindranath and member of the trust Bapu Dinesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/film-fest-on-farm-sector-challenges/article33787492.ece

Buses are one of the major reasons for congestion on the stretch. “In the absence of bus bays, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses going towards Hoskote and city buses headed towards K.R. Puram and other areas, halt in the middle of the road. The existing bus stops do not have adequate parking space. These bus bays will ease traffic in the coming years too,” said Channappa Goudar, General Manager (land acquisition), BMRCL. He added that BMRCL will use government land to build bus bays at Jyothipura. Traffic police and motorists say that Old Madras Road is a nightmare during peak traffic hours. Ishwar Prasad, a regular BMTC passenger, says, “Every day, people risk their lives standing near the ramp of the cable bridge to catch a bus towards Hoskote.” “Congestion is a problem as all buses moving towards Hoskote stop right in the middle of the ramp of the cable bridge. In the absence of bus bays, we cannot force them to stop somewhere else,” said a traffic police personnel. BMRCL is building new metro pillars near the down ramp of the cable bridge, but regular commuters said work needs to be expedited as it is adding to the congestion. “To construct the pillars, BMRCL occupies at least four metres of the road,” a commuter said. Bhargava R., who travels on the stretch regularly, said it takes him more than 30 minutes to cross the one-kilometre stretch from ORR flyover to K.R. Puram. “People travelling towards Whitefield are waiting for the BMRCL to open the line as early as possible,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bus-bays-at-five-points/article33787692.ece

Workers found a six-year-old male leopard trapped in a snare at a vegetable farm on Thalayar Estate, 24 km from Munnar, and alerted the Forest Department. Officials accompanied by a veterinary surgeon reached the spot by 9.30 a.m. and released it to the wild after giving preliminary treatment.  Timely information “The leopard was found healthy. It was trying to escape from the snare. We could reach there soon after the animal entered the snare so it did not suffer injuries,” Munnar Range Officer Hareendrakumar said adding that timely information helped them save the animal. “It was immediately released into the forest. The department has registered a case. It is suspected that the snare was not aimed at the leopard but for some smaller animals that enter the cultivated area of the tea estate,” Munnar Range Officer Hareendrakumar said. He said the area was not human inhabited but part of the tea estate where workers cultivated vegetables.  Leopard poaching On January 22, five persons were arrested for trapping a leopard and consuming its meat at the buffer zone at Mankulam near Munnar. The leopard was killed for its skin, nail, and tooth, preliminary inquiries found.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/leopard-found-trapped-in-snare-in-munnar/article33787481.ece

This is the first time that the department is conducting a direct bird survey in Ranipuram, which has been attracting a lot of tourists with its pristine forest and grasslands. The survey team was led by Maxim Rodriguez, Shyamkumar Puravankara, Raju Kidoor, Harish Babu, Manoj Karingamadathil and K.K. Lathika. Mr. Rodrigues said that high altitude and the forest untouched by humans has created a fertile habitat for many bird species. “Not much study has been done in the Ranipuram area, which makes this survey more interesting,” he said. During the survey, bird species which are found only in the district were identified. They included Fork-tailed drongo cuckoo, Rufous woodpecker, Lesser yellownape, Blue rock thrush, Jungle nightjar, Sri Lanka frogmouth, Golden-headed cisticola, Banded bay cuckoo, and White bellied woodpecker. Kanhangad Range Forester K. Ashraf said that Ranipuram has become a tourist destination and it has been attracting a lot of tourists. “Besides the grasslands, the forest also has a lot of bird species, which many are unaware,” he said. The initiative aims to identify such bird species and introduce them to people, which would help create awareness among them about the need for preserving their habitat. The department conducted the survey with the support of Kasaragod Birders Club.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/98-species-spotted-in-bird-survey/article33787390.ece
09 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Brahmapuram project remains a non-starter||The proposal for a new biomedical waste treatment plant that was supposed to have been set up at Brahmapuram by Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-Friendly (IMAGE) is at a standstill. The paperwork had made no progress after the land was allotted to IMAGE last year, said Dr. Abraham Varghese, former IMA State president. The proposed project was to have come up on around three acres of land at Brahmapuram, near the Kochi Corporation’s dumping yard, but a lease agreement for the land has not yet been finalised. “The possession document issued to IMAGE last year for the land says that the land belongs to the Kochi Corporation, but it was the State government that allotted the land. This created a confusion,” said IMAGE secretary Dr. Sharafudheen K.P. A meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary would soon be held to resolve the issue, he added. When the Corporation Council had refused to hand the land over to IMAGE last year, the government had asked the District Collector to step in and handle the takeover. The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 20-23 crore, and the plant will have an initial capacity to treat 20 tonnes, which can be expanded to 30 tonnes. A detailed project report had been submitted to the State Pollution Control Board for sanction, said Dr. Sharafudheen. The municipal waste lying on the allotted land will have to be biomined before the project begins. Facility at Palakkad Meanwhile, the State’s only operational biomedical waste treatment facility in Palakkad, managed by IMAGE, has expanded its capacity to handle waste, considering the large quantities that have been arriving at the plant from COVID care centres. Around 60 tonnes of waste is taken to the plant daily, from COVID care facilities and other centres such as laboratories and palliative care centres. The plant had the capacity to treat 37 tonnes daily. It has recently been enhanced to around 55.8 tonnes to handle the higher load. The quantity of waste coming to the plant from COVID centres has fallen compared to the earlier phases of the pandemic. Around 130 first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) were closed across the State when the premises began to be used for other purposes, bringing the quantity of COVID-related waste down from an earlier figure of around 25 tonnes daily to around 16 tonnes at present, said Dr. Sharafudheen. Ambalamedu facility While the IMAGE facility waits to take off, the district will soon get its first functional biomedical waste treatment plant at Ambalamedu. The plant, set up by Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Limited (KEIL), would have a capacity of 16 tonnes per day and would be commissioned by the end of the month, said N.K. Pillai, CEO of KEIL. The plant, set up at a cost of Rs. 14 crore, would be able to treat waste from Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Idukki and Thrissur districts, he said. While most health centres were already registered with IMAGE for biomedical waste collection, the government would have to make arrangements to ensure that some of waste was sent to the new KEIL facility to relieve the burden on the centre at Palakkad, added Mr. Pillai. KEIL is a public limited company that has been treating hazardous waste from industrial units since 2008.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brahmapuram-biomedical-waste-plant-a-non-starter/article33787828.ece

The project kicked off with an inaugural event at the cultural corner of Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) at Jos Junction. Actor Jayasurya inaugurated the event. An earlier conversation between Mayor M. Anilkumar and Mr. Jayasurya had sparked off the idea for the project. “The aim is to turn Kochi into the State’s cultural capital,” Mr. Anilkumar said. C-HED to coordinate Through Arts Space Kochi, the corporation hopes to be able to identify and provide public spaces for artists, dancers, musicians, and other performers, to present their works without the hassle of booking a venue. The project will be coordinated by the Centre for Heritage, Environment and Development (C-HED). “We have so far identified eight such spaces. The corporation will set up light and sound systems. If necessary, particularly for amateurs, school students or solo performers, we can identify sponsors. We hope to initially facilitate at least five or six performances a week. If permissions are required from the police or other agencies for such performances, we could arrange that too,” said Rajan Chedambath, director, C-HED. Eventually, individuals or groups will be able to take it up on their own and use such spaces to perform, he added. Areas identified The Koyithara park, Marine Drive, Vyttila Hub, Vasco da Gama Square at Fort Kochi, Veli grounds at Palluruthy, Palarivattom town square, and the Chathiath walkway are the areas that have been identified, besides the KMRL cultural corner.

09 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||DPR for bypass project suffers delay||The preparation of the detailed project report (DPR) for the much-awaited access-controlled Kundannoor-Angamaly NH Bypass, which was mooted to decongest the Aroor-Edappally NH Bypass, has slowed down thanks to the pandemic situation and the alleged delay in constituting special land acquisition units. Sources in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the Palakkad project office of the NHAI had been tasked with taking ahead the approximately 40-km project. A consultant who had been entrusted with suggesting probable alignments had come up with three proposals, from which a greenfield alignment was chosen. A fresh consultant appointed by the agency’s Palakkad office is at present preparing the DPR based on the shortlisted alignment. This and a land acquisition plan may be ready by the end of the year. The NHAI has, in the meantime, submitted a request to the District Collectors concerned to ready notifications to commence land acquisition to develop NH 544 (which includes the Kundannoor-Angamaly NH Bypass), the NH corridor which runs largely perpendicular to NH 66. “This is because the Revenue Department must provide surveyors and other officials who ought to work in tandem with our consultant to identify and mark boundary stones for the project,” NHAI officials said. Alignment On the tentative alignment, NHAI officials said it would be published only after the alignment plan was approved. Being access-controlled, direct entry of vehicles from side roads will not be permitted into the proposed NH corridor. A decision ought to be taken whether to go in for a four- or six-lane corridor. U-turns will be scarce on six-lane stretches, and motorists will have to rely on underpasses for the purpose. The NHAI officials added that the compensation package would include fair value of land that would be acquired, 100% solatium, and value based on ‘multiplication factor’. It will enable land owners to get compensation which is up to four times the fair value of the land. Thus, land owners in rural areas will get much more than the fair value of the land, as compared to their urban counterparts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dpr-for-bypass-project-suffers-delay/article33787832.ece

Mani at a programme organised on the Kaloor premises of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The facilities commissioned on Monday include the 7-km underground Thuthiyoor-Kaloor 220-kV cable system and the Brahmapuram-Thuthiyoor 220/110-kV multi-circuit-multi-voltage line. The Minister said the KSEB was looking ahead with state-of-the-art projects to ensure steady power supply. He said the Board was looking forward to getting a positive report on the proposal for starting a second power generation unit at the Idukki hydroelectric generation facility, for which a study was being conducted by a Central agency. The State is also aiming to produce 1,000 MW of solar power. While it costs about Rs. 15 crore to generate 1 MW of electricity, saving a megawatt of electricity requires Rs. 3 crore to Rs. 4 crore only. Hence, the State is introducing a slew of programmes to save power. It includes a total shift from the conventional lighting system to LED lighting system. The shift is being undertaken under the programme ‘Nilavu’, through which one crore LED systems will be distributed. The new electricity supply facilities have been set up under the Transgrid project with a total outlay of Rs. 130 crore. KIIFB has supported the project, according to a communication from the Public Relations Department. The new facilities will improve power supply in areas like Kaloor, Palarivattom, Edappally, Vennala, Vaduthala, Ernakulam North, Marine Drive, Perumanoor and Thammanam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/projects-to-meet-citys-power-needs-inaugurated/article33787833.ece

An expert committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change had earlier rejected the ESZ of the sanctuary, as the park managers had marked zero zone on the eastern and south-eastern sides of the protected area. However, they had included an extent of 1 km on other parts around the boundary of the sanctuary in the zone. The park managers drew up the ESZ following the State government’s directive to exclude populated areas from the purview of the zones. The government order was in the backdrop of public protests against inclusion of agricultural land in the zones. The expert committee, which reviewed the proposal, noted that no agricultural practices would be affected in the zones. The decision to convene a wider meeting of stakeholders on Sunday was taken at a meeting of people’s representatives, called by the Forest Department, on Monday. Antony John, MLA, who represents the area in the Assembly, wanted the department to completely exclude populated areas from the zones. Any decision to modify the zones shall be taken after wider consultations with all stakeholders, including people’s representatives and sections of society. All decisions regarding the zones shall be taken in a transparent manner and taking people into confidence, the MLA said. He also wanted the re-fixing of boundaries to be completed. The alterations suggested for the ESZ, including marking of three waterbodies, which are extensions of the Periyar, in the zone were explained at the meeting, said B. Rahul, wildlife warden of the sanctuary. Some participants were apprehensive about the fate of the holdings located inside the sanctuary. It was clarified that the zones would be marked outward from the boundary of the protected area. The proposals will be explained to people at the meeting to be held on Sunday, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stakeholders-to-take-up-esz-issue-at-thattekad/article33787824.ece

When RAC 354 (KL 15/7508) Venad bus was not found in its regular parking spot on Monday morning, the driver, who had left the bus near municipal office on Sunday night after the last service, informed the depot authorities. After checking with other drivers, it was confirmed that the bus has been stolen and the officials approached Kottarakara police who filed a case. While the search was on, the bus was found abandoned at Parippally. “Though we have collected the CCTV footage, it’s difficult to identify the person driving the bus from the visuals,” said an official. In 2017 a drunk person had driven a KSRTC bus from Kollam depot to some distance after he found there were no frequent services to Attingal, his hometown, after midnight. The driver was nabbed at Chinnakkada after he slammed the vehicle into an electric post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-bus-stolen-from-kottarakara-depot/article33787450.ece
09 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||CM reviews situation in Pala||Amidst a hardening of stance by Mani C. Kappen, MLA, over Pala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday attended a meeting at the CPI(M) District Committee office in Kottayam to take stock of the situation. Official sources said the party leaders had briefed the Chief Minister about the prevailing situation in Pala and the complaints raised by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) faction that backs Mr.Kappan. The meeting on Monday also preceded a proposed discussion between the NCP leader Praful Patel and Mr. Pinarayi to iron out the differences over the seat's allocation. As to whether this meeting will take place anytime soon is yet to be known as Mr.Vijayan is learnt to have adopted an uncompromising stance towards Mr.Kappen’s claim . Among the issues that came up for the discussion on Monday also included a proposed allocation of the Kanjirappally segment to the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani and the possibility of handing over the Poonjar or Changanassery seat to the CPI instead. With the LDF most likely to allot Pala to the KC(M), Mr.Kappan is counting on contesting from the assembly segment as a candidate of the United Democratic Front. Speculation is rife about him joining the UDF camp by the time the Statewide rally led by Ramesh Chennithala enters Kottayam on February 14. “Dejected by the LDF’s mistreatment, Mr.Kappen has also sought to meet the NCP national leadership once again before deciding on his further course of action. Prior to the meeting, he has also sent a letter to the NCP president Sharad Pawar briefing him about the recent developments including the CM’s alleged denial of an appointment to Mr.Patel to discuss the issue,” said an NCP leader. Playing down Following a meeting with the NCP national leaders including Mr.Pawar, the NCP State leadership has sought to play down the tussle over Pala for the time being. Mr.Kappan, however, has been unrelenting and kept asserting his claim over the seat time and again. “Pala is still my heart. Nobody has asked me to hand over the seat. I will contest from here,” he had told reporters the other day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-reviews-situation-in-pala/article33787451.ece

He was interacting with a select group of students at Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam and the Sree Sakaracharya University, Kalady as part of the Navakeralam Yuvakeralam programme. Highlighting the need to bring in major changes in the State's education sector to develop Kerala as a hub of higher education, the Chief Minister said steps were being implemented to provide vocational training along with education. “The higher education sector of Kerala should change in line with the changes taking place in the field of science and technology across the globe,”’ the Chief Minister noted. During the interaction, as many as 24 students presented their concepts on higher education in front of the Chief Minister. In his response, Mr. Pinarayi said the State government had already announced a system that would enable students to work while studying.

09 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vehicles jostle for space at Karaparamba||Karaparamba Junction, an intersection on the Kozhikode mini bypass and the Balussery State highway, is now one of the biggest traffic bottlenecks in Kozhikode city. The narrow 1-km-long Karaparamba-Karikkamkulam stretch on the Balussery State highway disrupts traffic not just during peak morning and evening hours but also at other times. And, the traffic police have a tough time controlling vehicles at Karaparamba Junction even as commuters negotiate choke points from Karikkamkulam junction. The authorities say too many people behind the wheel, especially after easing of pandemic restrictions, has resulted in a similar or even worse chaotic situation before the pandemic. A major reason is that five roads converge at Karaparamba Junction, and the Karaparamba-Karikkamkulam stretch on the Balussery State highway has not been widened as yet. At the same time, Karaparamba-Eranhipalam, Karaparamba-Kunduparamba and Karaparamba-West Hill Chungam were widened using funds from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). People’s Road from Karaparamba to East Hill Road was developed under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Rural Transformation (Amrut) project. City planners say the mushrooming shopping centres in the Karaparamba-Karikkamkulam corridor has made driving more dangerous. The diversions towards Krishnan Nair Road, Civil Station from Government Homeopathy College, and the LIC Housing Colony are adding to commuters’ woes. These are apart from the narrow roads leading to the Karaparamba Bazaar and the parallel road running via Canoly canal. The signal system provided by the Vadakara-based Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) is not used properly. It is learnt that the signal system had not yielded the desired result. To put an end to the chronic problem, the State government had decided to conceive a Rs. 80-crore project to widen the 20-km road from Karaparamba to Balussery a year ago. “The stretch from Karaparamba to Kakkodi bridge will be converted into four-lane, and the remaining will be two-lane,” said A. Pradeepkumar, MLA, Kozhikode North. He added that land acquisition procedures had already started with the survey in progress. “However, a few more notifications are required to kick-start the acquisition. Also, we expect KIIFB to fund the project, ” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vehicles-jostle-for-space-at-karaparamba/article33787398.ece
09 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Technical issues delay salaries of aided HSS teachers||Thousands of aided higher secondary school (HSS) teachers across the State are worried over the delay in release of their salary for the month of January. Officials in the Directorate of Higher Secondary Education, however, claimed on Monday that the amount was expected to reach their accounts by February 10. Functionaries of the Kerala Aided Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association (KAHSTA) claimed that the delay was due to the ongoing cross-verification of their service records with the newly launched service data software. Cross-verification “This process had started after January 15. There is a possibility of mismatch in the records and it will have to be corrected. It is learnt that the salary can be processed only after the verification is over,” K.K. Sreejesh Kumar, organising secretary, KAHSTA, told The Hindu . There are around 11,000 teachers in 750 aided higher secondary schools in Kerala. The KAHSTA functionaries said teachers should not suffer because of technical delays. Sources said the directorates of Higher Secondary Education, Vocational Higher Secondary Education, and Collegiate Education were the last ones to be included in the digitisation of salary disbursal. For higher secondary school teachers, the plan was to roll it out with the salary for January. Technical aspects An official in the department claimed that though school authorities had been given directives to keep the data in order in 2018 itself, many documents and records were found to be not matching. The school authorities, however, pointed out that there were no clerical staff or office assistants in the higher secondary sections, and it was left to the respective Principal to do the job. Many teachers were unaware of the technical aspects as well. “Earlier, Principals of higher secondary schools had to get all the salary bills counter-signed from the respective regional deputy director’s office. After completion of the digitisation,, the Principals can get it done online. But, all the information on teachers’ service records should be correct. There have been some mismatch, which are being cleared now. We expect to release the salaries by February 10,” a senior official in the directorate said on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/technical-issues-delay-disbursal-of-salary-to-aided-hss-teachers/article33787479.ece
09 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Concern over tree felling around sanctuary||Areas around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary are witnessing large-scale tree felling as landowners believe that they won’t be able to sell trees after the classification of ecologically fragile areas around the sanctuary. Even small trees on large acres around the sanctuary have been cut believing the false propaganda over Ecologically Fragile Land (EFL) notification. Greens say this will lead to unexpected environmental issues in the area, which has witnessed several episodes of landslips and soil piping phenomena. Low prices Many wholesale wood traders, including from neighbouring districts, are taking advantage of the situation by procuring trees at low prices. Flouting environmental norms, many new village roads have also been carved out for transporting trees. Leaders of Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti say Kattippara and Karincholamala villages are now witnessing speedy felling of trees as there are no measures in place to create awareness among farmers. “Forest Department officials are hardly noticing the issue in the environmentally sensitive area where many people had been killed in landslips,” they add. They point out that the uncontrolled cutting of trees will further increase the chances of soil erosion in the fragile area and trigger natural disasters. There should be proper intervention on the part of the disaster management authorities and the Forest Department to prevent the unhealthy trade and create awareness among landowners, they say. Earlier, large-scale purchase of land in environmentally sensitive areas for quarry business also had led to the clearing of trees. Chengottumala was one such location where acres were cleared of trees for preparing ground for the business. Though a local action council made all possible efforts to prevent it, quarry operators managed to get the clearance for their business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/concern-over-large-scale-tree-felling-around-sanctuary/article33787400.ece
09 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Calicut varsity refuses to disclose details on reservation roster||The Calicut University authorities have reportedly refused to disclose the details of the reservation roster meant for the appointment of faculty in various departments even as a Syndicate member accused them of creating non-existing vacancies in the departments of Statistics and Russian and Comparative Literature. This follows a letter signed by P. Rasheed Ahammed, Syndicate member, to the Vice Chancellor. Mr. Ahammed said that though the Syndicate meeting held on January 30 had approved the roster meant for the appointment of faculty members, details of the minutes sent to him did not have its copy. “I cannot understand the logic behind hiding such an important document, which forms the very basis of a transparent appointment system,” he claimed. Mr. Ahammed also alleged that the VC had also hidden the date of creation of the vacancies. There was “egregious violation of seniority norms and also sabotage of the reservation criteria in notifying non-existent vacancies in the departments of Statistics and Russian and Comparative Literature.” Mr. Ahammed claimed that University Grants Commission guidelines on clearing backlog vacancies had been violated. Through the letter, he sought the government orders on the creation of teaching posts in these departments and university records specifying how the vacancies arose. “If they were due to retirement, death, or relieving of duties on other grounds,” he added. VC’s stance Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj, however, said that the roster cannot be given now and it can be given only after the completion of appointments. He claimed that it was in in accordance with an order of the Kerala High Court in 2016, which said that the roster could be applied during the time of appointment. “If I give roster now, then the reservation details will be known before the selection,” he said. The interview for the appointment of faculty in one department in Sree Sankaracharya University, Kalady, was reportedly stayed because of the denial of opportunity for appearance for interview of candidates from other communities, said university sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/calicut-varsity-refuses-to-disclose-details-on-reservation-roster/article33787392.ece

A dozen-odd protesters and a news photographer were injured in the police action. Satheesh Kumar K.B., photographer of Mathrubhumi newspaper, suffered injuries on his head as a policeman thrashed him despite holding up his camera and showing his media credentials. MSF-SFI clash A group of MSF workers turned against V.P. Sanu, the national president of the Students Federation of India (SFI), when he made provocative comments against them while addressing a meet to support the farmers’ agitation from a nearby pandhal in front of the Collectorate. MSF protesters destroyed the flags in front of the pandhal. They shouted slogans against Mr. Sanu. The SFI accused the MSF of “shamelessly attacking the farmers’ agitation.” Mr. Sanu said that the MSF attack was against the farmers. MSF State president P.K. Navas condemned the attempts by the SFI and Mr. Sanu to divert the anti-government agitation to an “anti-farmer, anti-SFI attack.”  Journalists’ protest Journalists protested here against the police attack on the news photographer. “Assistant sub-inspector Santhosh brutally attacked Mr. Satheesh Kumar even after showing his media identity. It looked like a premeditated and vengeful act from that police officer who had behaved rudely and badly with the mediapersons here several times before,” said K.P.M. Riyas, district secretary of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists.  In Kozhikode The protest march taken out by MSF activists to the Kozhikode collectorate flaying the alleged back-door entry of some into government services was almost peaceful.

The draft of the proposed law was ready and the front would review all illegal appointments, he said. Accusing the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government of conducting a ‘Kumbh Mela’ of back-door appointments, Mr. Chennithala said the UDF would make it mandatory for all heads of departments to report vacancies to the Public Service Commission (PSC) once in six months. “Our proposed Bill will consider the failure in reporting of vacant posts as a criminal offence,” he told mediapersons here. Mr. Chennithala’s Aishwarya Kerala Yatra received a warm reception in the district on Monday. Cognizable offence The Congress leader said criminal proceedings would be initiated against those making temporary appointments while a PSC rank list was in place, and against those failing to report vacancies to the PSC. “It will be a cognizable offence inviting imprisonment from three months to two years.” He alleged that the LDF government made nearly three lakh back-door and temporary appointments in the past four-and-a-half years. “The LDF has denied jobs to at least three lakh qualified youngsters,” he said. Mr. Chennithala said that former MP M.B. Rajesh was in the forefront to besmear three Malayalam subject experts who spoke up against an illegal appointment given to his wife at the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. “These subject experts were all Left supporters. Now, they are being portrayed as offenders for revealing the fraud,” he said.

The museum—a mix of curated, professional works on the life and evolution of elephants and different stages of captive elephant management—will be the first of its kind in the country. The entrance wall of the building has huge-scale murals of elephants with a mixture of bright colours while touch screen kiosks and information panels narrating stories of human-elephant relationships have been set up inside. “It is designed as an investigation into the profound impact elephants have had on the life of Kerala and the extraordinary things we have learned from them. It is not about looking at the past, but rather find it as a place where people can take pride in their culture while educating others about this heritage of tradition, culture, and wisdom that has been passed on for generations,” explained K.N. Shyam Mohanlal, Divisional Forest Officer, Konni. One with nature The overarching theme of the project, according to the official, will be about creating awareness on ‘coexisting with nature’. The exhibits also include a set of implements used for capturing and training wild elephants in Kerala and 14 art pieces procured from the Wildlife Trust of India, besides an art gallery exhibiting 10 paintings on the concept of elephant and nature. This is in addition to a life-size statue of the animal, its skeleton, and a set of miniatures showing the evolution of captive elephant training in Kerala. The museum will also expose the threat wild elephants are facing amid wanton destruction of forests, in addition to poaching. 3D theatre Official sources said the authorities were also planning to establish a 3D screening theatre and procure artifact with assistance from the Kerala Museum. The building that houses the museum, which was originally opened in 2006 by displaying an elephant skeleton and implements associated with the training of captive elephants, was awaiting renovation for the past several years. The Kerala Tourism Development Corporation had renovated the building at Rs. 49 lakh recently and it took the authorities nearly three months to complete works on the museum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-mammoth-labour-of-love-comes-up-in-konni/article33787461.ece
09 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Another Round of laughter and reflection||One of the year’s most moving, and funny films in the festival circuit happens to have four middle-aged friends who are drunk, to various levels, most of the time. Another Round , directed by Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg, has been garnering praise from all over ever since it was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. At the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), it could be one of the crowdpullers, since Vinterberg, whose past films have featured at the festival, is one of the favourites of the delegates here. Vinterberg, along with Lars Von Trier, was one of the creators of the Dogme 95 filmmaking movement, which stood for a pared down style of making, focussing more on the content rather than big budget technology and special effects. Another Round too somewhat matches that philosophy. Here, he once again teams up with Mads Mikkelsen, after their brilliant collaboration for The Hunt , which was screened at the 2013 edition of the festival. Those who are familiar with Mikkelsen only as a James Bond villain might be in for a surprise here. Bored lives The film has four school teachers, who are struggling and bored in their careers as well their personal lives. They decide to jazz up things by testing a scientist’s theory that controlled intake of alcohol through the day can improve productivity. Things do turn around, with students all suddenly paying attention to their uncharacteristically creative measures, and reigniting the missing zest in their daily lives. Things are rosy until they decide to increase the daily alcohol levels, one step at a time. No judgements Though said to be a commentary on the drinking culture in Denmark, Vinterberg stays clear of any judgements, leaving it all to us. What he gets right here, thanks to the editing, is the rhythm and tone of the film, which seems to match the state of mind of the characters and the levels of alcohol in their bloods, swinging from the upbeat to the moody and languid. To get a perspective, one only needs to compare this to the Malayalam film Vellam , currently running in the theatres, which mostly progresses in the same rhythm, focussing on the ills of drinking. The mostly upbeat mood of Another Round does not give one a clue on the personal tragedy that Vinterberg suffered in the death of his 19-year-old daughter Ida in a road accident, as soon as he began shooting for the film, in the high school where she studied. Yet, there is an underlying melancholy for things lost, if one were to look a little deeper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/another-round-of-laughter/article33787447.ece

09 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) seeks to clarify Sabarimala stance||CPI(M) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai said public opinion would guide the Left Democratic Front (LDF) policy on Sabarimala issue. On Monday, he sought to set the record straight on matters of faith and Marxian world view. Mr. Pillai said the party had examined the Sabarimala issue from the prism of past experience. The government would strive for a consensus among stakeholders. Mr. Pillai repudiated the Opposition’s criticism that the party had forsaken Communism. Congress charge KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran had seized on CPI(M) central secretariat member M.N. Govindan’s statement to accuse the party of disavowing working-class principles. Mr. Govindan had said a purely theoretical Marxian approach to matters related to faith might not gain traction in the largely traditionalist Sabarimala temple setting. So, while remaining staunchly secular, the CPI(M) should take a pragmatic approach to religion. Such a middle ground was essential, especially when the BJP sought to brazenly exploit Hindu faith to improve its electoral prospects in Kerala. The Congress had also made Sabarimala the central election plank.  Mr. Ramachandran had interpreted Mr. Govindan’s words as an indication that the CPI(M) had shed its secular philosophy moored to dialectical materialism and veered hard to the right to harness the power of Hindu majoritarian politics. Mr. Pillai said the media had cherry-picked Mr. Govindan’s speech and quoted him out of context. CPI stand CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said dialectical materialism lay at the heart of Marxian world view. No Communist party could hope to keep its political identity by denying Hegel’s theory further modified by Karl Marx. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran said the CPI(M) had developed cold feet. It had realised that the ire of Ayyappa devotees could turn the tide of the electoral battle against the LDF. Hence, the CPI(M) had thrown off the mantle of Communism and showed its true colours: a party with no ideological moorings except power and profiteering. BJP’s invitation He urged CPI(M) cadres to dump their party and join the BJP. He said CPI(M) leaders should go to Kashi for pilgrimage since they have washed their hands of any communist ideological pretences.  Mediapersons cherry-picked M.V.

Chinta Mohan observed that the farmers in the country were left in the lurch as the NDA government failed to find a solution to the agrarian unrest. “During the last seven years, the NDA government has been supporting the privatisation of airports and seaports, air travel and insurance and manufacturing sectors. After shelving the Mannavaram BHEL factory and Dugarajupatnam seaport, the Centre has sold its shares in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited too, which runs Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.

Sharmila, daughter of former Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and sister of present Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy is holding a meeting with the loyalists of her late father here on Tuesday. Sources close to the developments confirmed that a meeting of the admirers of YSR at Lotus Pond will be presided by Ms. Sharmila. It is learnt that the meeting would elicit views of the invitees whether she can once again take the plunge into active politics in Telangana. “Yes, the loyalists of YSR in Telangana and those who rever the late leader’s contribution to the development of the united Andhra Pradesh are meeting in the City. The meeting will deliberate on the scope for floating a new political party with the aim of attracting all the YSR loyalists,” a source privy to the discussions in the last couple of days told The Hindu on Monday night. The move of Ms. Sharmila to convene a meeting in what is being termed as a ‘get together’ of admirers of late YSR has raised curiosity. Another source said the timing of the meeting is to coincide with the 50th wedding anniversary of YSR and Vijayamma. Dr. Rajasekhara Reddy and Ms. Vijayamma were married on February 9, 1972 in Pulivendula of Kadapa district. Although, the YSR Congress Party has a State unit in Telangana it is almost inactive ever since the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. Sources said telephonic invitation was extended to a number of former leader’s admirers. Interestingly, none of the present or former YSRCP leaders of Telangana find a place in the list of invitees. Ms. Sharmila on arrival from Bengaluru is said to have met a couple of leaders at the office of her husband Anil Kumar at Lotus Pond. A leader, who had interaction with her said the consultation with the well wishers of the late leader would continue for next couple of weeks. It was pointed out that several leaders of the Congress party and others, who had close association with the late leader would welcome any move by her to launch a party. “She will not hastily make any announcement about launching a political party. We will take the feedback of the participants and accordingly plan the next move,” the leader said pointing out that the move to form a party could not be viewed as differences having cropped up within the YSR family. When contacted, YSRCP leaders downplayed the significance of the proposed meeting maintaining that they have little information.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sharmila-to-hold-meeting-with-ysr-loyalists-today/article33787355.ece

Members of the students’ unions went round the city and other places forcing closure of degree, post-graduation and professional colleges. They raised slogans demanding that the State government take responsibility for educating all students, including those pursuing education in the private sector, as promised during elections. Later, they staged a demonstration in front of the private college, where K. Tejasree had been studying, demanding compensation to the family of the girl, who had reportedly felt humiliated when she was disallowed from boarding the college bus for not having cleared bus charges. Instead of taking up the issue of fee reimbursement arrears with the State government, the college managements were pressuring students to pay fees, alleged Progressive Democratic Students Union(PDSU) State vice-president L.Rajasekar while leading the protest. ‘Act against erring colleges’ The Jagan Mohan Reddy government should fulfil its poll promise to provide free education to students from K.G. to P.G., added Andhra Pradesh Students Joint Action Committee president Rayapatti Jagadeesh. Some of the colleges collected more fees from students, he alleged. The three-member committee constituted to probe the circumstances leading to the suicide of Tejasree, a second year B.Tech student, should be an impartial probe and fix responsibility for the incident. The committee should come out with a series of recommendations to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future, said Students Federation of India District Secretary Ch.Vinod.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fulfil-promise-of-free-education-to-all-state-government-urged/article33787194.ece

09 February 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||A saga of steely grit, struggle and sacrifice||Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP)has a long saga of struggle and sacrifices. It was a people’s movement in then combined Andhra Pradesh, in which students from Andhra Medical College, Andhra University, Ms. AVN College and many other colleges from Guntur, Krishna, Warangal and East Godavari districts, had participated. They were led by stalwarts such as Tenneti Viswanadham, Gouthu Latchanna, Puchalapalli Sundarayya, Chandra Rajeswara Rao, Nallamalla Giriprasad Rao, T. Nagi Reddy and Vavilala Gopalakrishnaiah. The movement for a shore-based steel plant in Visakhapatnam began with C. Subramaniam announcing that a steel plant would be set up in the city in 1963. In 1965, the Centre asked the Anglo American Consortium to indetify a suitable location . A report was tabled in Parliament on July 3, 1965, citing Visakhapatnam as a feasible location. On July 1, 1966, the State Assembly, then led by Chief Minister Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, unanimously passed a resolution favouring the plant in Visakhapatnam. But, the project went into a limbo thereafter. It again gained momentum, when Amruta Rao from Guntur, sat on an indefinite fast at the District Collector’s office, on October 15, 1966. “For about three days, nobody noticed Mr. Amruta Rao. There was a small report about his fast in a local Telugu newspaper. We learnt from him the relevance of the plant ,” recalls Kolla Rajmohan, who was then the general secretary of students union of Andhra Medical College. On October 22, the students held a public meeting and took out a rally. Two days later, an all-party committee was formed to champion the cause, followed by an independent strike and ‘hartal’ called by students. “On October 29, 1966, we organised a ‘rail roko’ and the Calcutta-Madras Mail was held for hours at Gopalapatnam. We received spontaneous support from all colleges across the State and it was followed by a general strike on October 30,” recalls Dr. Rajmohan. 32 die in police action November 1 was the day, when the history of the VSP was written in blood. In an effort to quell the agitation, the police opened fire on the protesters near the Old Post Office in the Old Town area, killing 12 people. “All the bullet wounds of the deceased were on their chests.More than 100 protesters suffered bullet and lathi injuries,” says Ch. Narasinga Rao, State secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). Within the next few days, 20 more protesters were killed, including five in Vijaywada and five in Guntur, two in Vizianagaram, one in Kakinada, one in Warangal, one in Rajahmundry, one in Sileru, one in Palasa, one in Jagtial and two in other areas. This gave the agitation national and international recognition and it was only on April 10, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced in Parliament that a steel plant would be set up in Visakhapatnam. She also laid the foundation stone on January 20, 1971. Land acquisition After much ups and downs and acquiring about 22,000 acres of land in 68 villages, the first blast furnace Godavari was dedicated to the nation by the then Prime Minister V.P. Singh, on March 20, 1990. On August 1, 1992, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, with 3 million tonne capacity, was dedicated to the Nation by the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. In 2006, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone for its expansion project from 3.2 MT to 6.3 MT. All the three Prime Ministers, in their speechs, had described the VSP as pride of the State, the city and the country. The VSP had gone into production in 1991 and till 2000, it accumulated losses to the tune of about Rs. 4,000 crore. In 2,000, it was referred to the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), but after much pressure, it was given a restructuring package of Rs. 1,333 crore. Members of Steel Executive Association (SEA) says that the original estimate was Rs. 1,900 crore, but by the time it had gone into production and due to delay in construction of about 25 years, the cost had gone over Rs. 8,000 crore. The government had given only Rs. 4,986 crore and the balance was raised by the VSP from the market. Between 2001 to 2016, the palnt earned profits and went into losses again from 2016, due to a number of factors. ‘Heavy interest on loans’ The VSP has so far paid interest on loans of about Rs. 18,000 crore. It has accumulated losses of Rs. 12, 973 crore and profits of Rs. 18,069 crore. Heavy interest on loans and lack of captive mines have been the main reasons for its losses, says members of the SEA. “If mines are given, the cost of raw material will drop by Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 5,000 per tonne and we can bounce back. This plant is emotionally rooted to the people and the Union government should revisit the proposal to privatise it,” they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-saga-of-steely-grit-struggle-and-sacrifice/article33787892.ece

Speaking at the meeting, Visakhapatnam Member of Parliament M.V.V. Satyanarayana questioned how the Union government intends to turn a ‘loss-making’ public sector unit into a profitable one, just by selling it to a private company. He also alleged that there was a hidden agenda behind the decision. Participating in the programme, Anakapalle Member of Parliament B. Satyavathi said that she has already drafted a letter and would approach the Minister of Steel, Finance Minister and even the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that the sale proposal be stopped with immediate effect. Captive mines CPI (M) leader Ganga Rao said that terming the VSP as a loss making unit was a false propaganda. “The VSP has always been making operating profit and the loss that is being showed is due to the high interest that the public sector undertaking has been paying for its loans and lack of captive mines. A major portion of the production cost is going up due to lack of captive mines. If mines are allotted, the steel plant would make profit from the Day one,” observed Mr Ganga Rao. A.J. Stalin of the Communist Party of India (CPI), said that earlier, many PSUs, including Hindustan Zinc Limited in Visakhapatnam, were sold but that had not changed their fortune. He also alleged that selling the steel plant was a ploy to benefit private companies by selling its vast resource of land through real estate ventures. Next meet tomorrow A large number of employees from the steel plant and recognised trade unions participated in the all-party meeting. The next gate meeting is scheduled to be held on February 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/parties-vow-to-continue-protest-against-vsp-sale/article33787117.ece

09 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ganta seeks Assembly resolution||Former Minister and TDP leader Ganta Srinivasa Rao, who resigned as MLA in protest against the decision of the Centre to privatise Visakhapatnam Steel Plant(VSP), has said that the plant was established following several sacrifices by the people and it is wrong to privatise on the plea of losses. At an all-party meeting on the issue, organised by the Congress here on Monday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that no other steel plant in the country was established after such prolonged struggles. Appreciating Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for writing to the Prime Minister, opposing the decision, Mr. Srinivasa Rao sought that a resolution should be adopted in the Assembly, without any delay, against privatisation of the VSP and sent to the Centre. The Cabinet should also make a resolution on the issue, he said. The Chief Minister should also meet the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and strive for continuation of the plant in the public sector, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. He said that all parties should set aside their political differences and work for safeguarding the interests of VSP. AITUC leader Adinarayana recalled that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had laid the foundation for VSP, bowing to the sacrifices of the Telugu people. He attributed the losses of the plant to the inefficiency of the management and the Central government. CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy said there was no public sector organisation was fully privatised so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pass-resolution-against-privatisation-of-vsp/article33787930.ece

They alleged that the management failed to clear the dues for the last eight months despite their protests. As many as 50 lecturers and non-teaching employees raised slogans against the Trust, saying that they were leading a pathetic life due to inordinate delay in payment of salaries. They tried in vain to meet MANSAS Chairperson Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju and correspondent K.V.L. Raju to air their grievances. Mr. Raju reportedly cautioned them of taking disciplinary action as they had left the college without prior permission.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission – II, Hyderabad bench, comprising president Vakkanti Narasimha Rao, and members P V T R Jawahar and R S Rajasree was dealing with a complaint filed by P Ramchander Rao, a senior citizen, and resident of New Bhoiguda. The complainant stated that on February 9, 2019 he booked a train (train number 12786) for a trip from Bengaluru to Kachiguda scheduled on February 16, 2019 after paying amount after which his ticket status was shown as wait-listed. It was then changed to reservation against cancellation (RAC). On the day of departure, the passenger checked the status which continued to reflect as RAC. He stated that after a while he checked the status of other trains and found out that the train which he was scheduled to board was cancelled. It was at 8.09 a.m. that he received a message that the train was cancelled. With no option left, he had to book a seat on Garib Rath Express. For their part, the SCR stated that they had informed passengers of the cancellation by means of a news bulletin on February 15, a day in advance. The cancellation was on account of the SCR being engaged in changing signal systems. The complainant contended that intimation should be given much in advance and that he lost money on account of the train cancellation. Taking the evidence placed on record, and arguments into consideration, the commission noted, “If the opposite party intimated the complainant immediately after the issuance of news bulletin about the cancellation of train, he might have made alternative arrangements on 15.2.2019 itself in order to avoid unnecessary delay and inconvenience. As per the attitude of the opposite party and due to late intimation about the cancellation, he booked another ticket in Garib Rath by paying Rs. 1,063.40 towards Tatkal ticket(sic)”.

09 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Favours investment in urban centres across State||The 15th Finance Commission has asked the State government to invest in the development of urban centres across the State for inclusive and balanced growth across all the districts. Commenting on the inter-State development disparity, the commission said that out of the 33 districts in the State, only four — Rangareddy, Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy — were contributing 52% of the GSDP. All the secondary and tertiary activities are concentrated in these districts. “Telangana should invest in the development of other urban centres in the interest of inclusive development,” the commission said.  No SFC report yet  The 15th Finance Commission expressed concern that the first State Finance Commission, constituted in 2015, has not submitted its report despite lapse of more than four years. As enshrined in Article 280 (3) of the Constitution, the Finance Commission of India makes grant recommendations to local bodies based on the recommendations of the SFCs. The commission said the SFCs however, face significant challenges in the form of poor administrative support, inadequate resources for their smooth functioning and the delayed placement of action taken reports before the State legislatures. Act on report “The State government must constitute State Finance Commission, act upon their recommendations and lay the explanatory memorandum pertaining to the action taken thereon before the State Legislature on or before March 2024,” the Finance Commission said. The Finance Commission expressed concern that the educational outcomes of the State are either poorer than the national average (such as reading abilities) or have substantially deteriorated over a period of time (arithmetic abilities). It said the expenditure on education in 2016-17 as a percentage of the GSDP was only 1.8% against the general State’s average of 2.6%.  Stamp duty The commission in its report saw the scope for vast improvement in stamp duty collection. Stamp duty collection was very low at only 8% as compared to same category states like Maharashtra where it was 15%. “This presents scope for vast improvement,” the commission said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/commission-favours-investment-in-urban-centres-across-state/article33787797.ece
09 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Panel favours grant for Mission Bhagiratha||The 15th Finance Commission has recommended a grant of Rs. 2,350 crore for operation and maintenance of Mission Bhagiratha, the flagship programme of the State government to provide safe drinking water to all households across the State. The commission said in its report that the State government had sought grants for operation and maintenance of Mission Bhagiratha to provide safe, adequate and treated drinking water to people. The project would cover a geographical area of more than one lakh sq. km and 10% of water supply was earmarked for the industrial sector also. Duct laid The State government had informed that the Mission would provide piped drinking water to every household. Along with the pipelines laid for water supply, optical fibre cable duct has also been laid to provide broadband services to each household under the Digital Telangana programme. “We propose an amount of Rs. 2,350 crore for this purpose,” the commission said. The 15th Finance Commission is the second national level body after the NITI Ayog to recommend assistance to Mission Bhagiratha. The NITI Ayog has recommended assistance of Rs. 19,205 crore for Mission Bhagiratha in view of the larger public interest the project envisaged to serve, but the recommendation had not translated into action so far. Interest payments The finance panel, however, lamented that the State resorted to borrowing for critical social infrastructure like drinking water and irrigation. “The mounting interest payments for such huge off-budget borrowings (without provision for cost recovery) is expected to create fiscal challenges soon,” the commission said. The report said the current level of loan debt repayments is also cause of worry. Interest repayment at 13% of the total revenue expenditure in 2018-19 is higher than class average (comprising similar States like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka) and this is growing fast, the Finance Commission noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/finance-panel-favours-grant-for-mission-bhagiratha/article33787798.ece

09 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC issues notices over Nizam’s money||Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of Telangana High Court on Monday issued notices to the Union of India and others in a writ petition challenging a purported confidential settlement arrived by the Centre with princes Mukarram Jah and Muffakham Jah involving 35 million pounds. Suit over 35 mn pounds Shafia Sakina, great granddaughter of seventh Nizam, filed the writ petition. The matter was posted after four weeks for next hearing. The petitioner contended that a suit over 35 million pounds held in Natwest bank of London was pending in High Court of Justice Business and Property Courts of England. The money belonged to the Nizam. She contended that Union of India had entered into a secret settlement with the two princes over the money without the knowledge of the Nizam’s Trust. This action of the Centre was illegal and arbitrary, the petitioner argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-issues-notices-over-nizams-money/article33787785.ece
09 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court directs Serilingampally Tahsildar to mutate Hafeezpet lands||Telangana High Court had directed the State government to mutate 8.07 acres of land in Hafeezpet village of Serilingampally mandal in Ranga Reddy district, on the name of M/s Kraft Alloy Private Limited in all revenue records within four weeks. Pronouncing verdict in a writ petition filed by the company, the HC imposed costs of Rs. 50,000 on Ranga Reddy district Collector and Serilingampally Tahsildar-cum-Joint Registrar. A bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and T. Vinod Kumar observed the contention that State was the owner of the said land was “wholly vexatious and cannot be countenanced”. The company purchased the land in an auction conducted by the authorised officer of M/s SREI Equipment Finance Limited, a finance company under the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI Act). It paid Rs. 102.60 crore.    Sale certificate A Sale Certificate was also issued to the company to this effect a year ago. The company claimed that, however, the Serilingampally Tahsildar declined to register the land on its name claiming that the said land in Hafeezpet belonged to the State government. The company approached the HC challenging the officer’s contention. The company said that earlier such claims made by the State government were rejected by the High Courtin a preliminary decree in 1963. Pleas lost The government challenged this in Supreme Court on several occasions. At least six times, the government lost such pleas in the Apex court. The bench observed that when the State government has no title to the said land, it had no business to include it in the list of lands prohibited for registration. Hence, Serilingampally Tahsildar cannot refuse to receive, register and release the Sale Certificate issued to the company, the judgement said. The bench also rejected the government’s contention that it had power to take call on the title of a land under the Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act -2020. “There is no power conferred on any Authority under the said Statute to adjudicate questions of title,” the bench ruled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-directs-serilingampally-tahsildar-to-mutate-hafeezpet-lands/article33787780.ece
09 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bandi asks KCR details of the proposed caste bhavans||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Monday demanded that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao provide details of the funds allotted, spent and the land given for the proposed exclusive buildings for various castes in the twin cities. “This Chief Minister remembers the backward classes only during elections when big announcements are made, government orders are issued and land plots are declared but nothing happens after that. He has the money and resolve to build ‘Pragati Bhavan’ and demolish the Secretariat but has no money for the backward castes’ buildings. Does the CM have no money, land or sand to build the caste bhavans?” he charged at a public meeting held in Uppal Bhagat. “Not a single building has come up. Are we his slaves? Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao is anti-poor, anti-BC, and against the economically weaker sections of the upper castes. Only a BJP government working for the poor and the deprived classes can do justice and I request all the caste organisations to come under our fold to fight against the TRS government. We are not hankering for power but to work for the poor,” claimed Mr. Sanjay Kumar.  Matter of shame The BJP leader said the BC leaders within the TRS and even the ministers should hang their heads in shame for maintaining silence despite the injustice being done to the deprived sections. “What has happened to the BC Commission and Federation? There is a big scam in the distribution of sheep and goats. We will expose this government which is a sinking ship like the ‘Titanic’. Like the Centre’s new vehicle scrap policy for 20-year-old vehicles, the TRS too should be scrapped,” he said. “We need to put an end to this tyrannical rule mired in neck-deep corruption, contracts, land grabbing and commissions. He has also insulted the Telangana people by dismissing the CM’s post which came to him because of the sacrifices made by scores of people for a separate State. Why does he not relinquish it if he’s not respecting the post?” questioned the Karimnagar MP. The BJP party will fight against the land grabbing by the ruling party leaders across Telangana, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/where-are-the-proposed-caste-bhavans/article33787804.ece
09 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Funds and functions for Mandal and ZPs too||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has assured funds and specific functions for Mandal and Zilla Parishads also like it was done for gram panchayats. The funds for Mandal and Zilla Parishads will be allotted in the 2021-22 budget itself, Mr. Rao said at a review meeting on Panchayat Raj on Monday. He added that the State government was committed to strengthening the local self-governments and activate their role in rural development. The provisions of new Panchayat Raj Act which envisaged that the gram panchayats could spend their funds in toto without the approval of district-level officers should be effectively used, he asked officers. A policy decision to strengthen local bodies and implement it was taken by the government. As part of it, Finance Commission funds were directly released to gram panchayats and municipalities. The gram panchayats got Rs. 308 crore per month and municipalities Rs. 148 crore. Since there was no dearth of funds, the Palle Pragathi programme in villages and Pattana Pragathi in towns were a grand success. Central programmes Tractors, dumpyards, nurseries and cremation grounds were made available wherever the funds were released. In the same way, Finance Commission funds would also be released to Mandal and Zilla Parishads. The funds if dovetailed with programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme could result in further utilisation of Central funds, he said. Apart from funds, the Mandal and Zilla Parishads should also be vested with specific responsibilities. Therefore, the officers must work out what kind of specific functions could be handed over to them. The recommendations made by them will be discussed by him with Zilla Parishad chairpersons. Then, he will take a final decision. He recalled that the new Panchayat Raj Act of the State government had permitted gram panchayats to spend their funds totally but a provision in the earlier legislation which mandated gram panchayats to take approval of Mandal Parishad officals for works exceeding Rs. 2 lakh was implemented at places. This went against the new Act. Therefore, the officials must clarify the position, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/funds-and-functions-for-mandal-and-zps/article33787809.ece

It is our job to safeguard any property, whether public or private property,” Mattampally sub-inspector said. The officer added: “There were more non-locals — residents of neighbouring mandals and those from Hyderabad — than the aggrieved tribals.” All the 21 accused were booked for rioting and causing hurt to public servants in the discharge of duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-name-bandi-sanjay-for-violence-in-gurrambodu/article33787805.ece

But the CITU, through these protests, wanted to send across a message that it was a mass movement and involved the working class as well. “The workers and labourers are also impacted by the agriculture so as the economy.

This exercise has been completed at the Singhu border,” said advocate Ramandeep Bhathal, member of the legal team. Apart from checking the trolleys, Ms. Bhathal said that the team on the ground shares details with their seniors who further check at police stations. “Our own Information Technology cell also tries to trace the numbers of those that we have,” Ms. Bhathal said, adding that they fear that most of the missing persons would have been arrested. Making announcements However, a problem being faced by advocates is that there are a few names in the list of “missing persons” for whom they have no contact details. “We have been making announcements at the stage too, but we need people to come and tell us about numbers of families or persons who are missing so that we can get their details,” Ms. Raman said. The open school, ‘Sanjhi Sathh’, also opened for the second day at the Singhu border on Monday. The school was shut since January 24. “Initially because of January 26 preparations and later, because of Internet suspension, we couldn’t open the school. Today, over 50 children had come for the class. It’ll slowly increase,” said Sukhwinder Singh Barwa from Ropar who is among the group which runs the open school. Protesting farmers also said that despite no formal resumption of talks with the government yet, they’ll continue their agitation till the laws are repealed. “This fight is to be fought with love. Whether they agree or not, we won’t leave till they do. All struggles take time to reach their desired end. We are willing to stay here for even two years,” said Balbir Singh (51) from Patiala, adding that they’re not scared of arrests being made.

However, Mr. Bajinder never returned after the rally and since then his whereabouts are unknown, Mr. Baljeet said in his plea. Advocate Soayib Qureshi, representing Mr. Baljeet, said when his client along with other relatives went to a police station in Nangloi for registering a missing complaint, “to their complete shock” the station house officer refused to register any missing complaint. The SHO gave “false assurance that they will let him know in case any information regarding his brother is received,” the plea added.  The petition stated that the “inaction and negligent attitude of the Respondent No.3 have led to the apprehension that his brother has been illegally detained by the Respondent No.3 and therefore, they are deliberately resisting from writing any official complaint or FIR and providing any information to the petitioner in this regard”. The High Court will hear the case on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/report-on-whereabouts-of-man-hc-tells-police/article33787521.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nihang Sikhs lose third horse in two weeks||Another horse of Nihang Sikhs died on Monday after undergoing treatment for 12 days, the group at the Singhu border said. Two horses had died earlier on January 26 taking the total count to three. Dheera Singh Nihang (40) said that the horse’s name was Chhinda and he was six years old. “On January 26, when we had gone to the Red Fort, the horse was attacked. We called the doctors to check on him but his condition worsened,” Mr. Dheera said. Chhinda breathed his last on Monday after which he was laid to rest for a brief period at the protest site where members of the group chanted for his peaceful departure. “He has died during the protest. He is a martyr,” said Mr. Dheera. Two horses, Mor and Gehna, aged five and seven had died on January 26 allegedly due to tear gas shell fired by security personnel as a crowd control measure. “Mor couldn’t handle and died on the spot at Karnal bypass but Gehna was in pain. It was taken to a gurdwara nearby where it stayed for a few hours in pain and died later”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nihang-sikhs-lose-third-horse-in-two-weeks/article33787424.ece

09 February 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha to move SC over border dispute with Andhra Pradesh||The Odisha government on Monday decided to move Supreme Court challenging the conduct of panchayat elections in three of its villages in Koraput district and violation status quo in respect to border dispute. “Andhra Pradesh is conducting panchayat elections in three of our bordering villages. It is violation of status quo continuing as per the Supreme Court order. We will challenge the election as well as other administrative steps being taken by Andhra Pradesh in our villages in the top court,” said Bishnupada Sethi, Revenue and Disaster Management Secretary, here. “The last general and Assembly elections had been conducted by Odisha in the three villages. How could Andhra Pradesh hold election in the same place now,” questioned Mr. Sethi. According to sources, the State government is in favour of an amicable solution to the border dispute. Deployment of police force to guard the territory is likely to escalate the situation and make matter worse for people living on both sides of border. Koraput district administration on Monday consulted with the Advocate General of Odisha on this issue. Names to be changed Andhra Pradesh is scheduled to hold panchayat elections in three villages — Talaganjeipadar, Patusineri and Phagunseneri in Kotia gram panchayat by changing their names to Ganjeibadara, Pattuchennuru and Pagluchennuru on February 13. Nominations have been filed for the post of Sarpanch and Ward Members from the three villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/odisha-to-move-sc-over-border-dispute-with-andhra-pradesh/article33787768.ece
09 February 2021||GUWAHATI,||Seat-sharing worry for grand alliance in Assam||Perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) appears to be making ally Congress uncomfortable in poll-bound Assam. Meeting planned The Congress, AIUDF, Communist Party of India, CPI (Marxist), CPI (Marxist-Leninist) and the regional Anchalik Gana Morcha had in January formed a grand alliance to take on the ruling BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections to be held by May. The Congress heads this grand alliance. The six parties are expected to meet later this week on seat-sharing arrangements. But the AIUDF is believed to have made the Congress nervous by organising rallies in constituencies the latter won in 2016 and by finding fault with the MLAs from these seats. “We are a constituent of the grand alliance, so I cannot say if Mujibur Rahman will be the consensus candidate. But you have elected him in advance from the Dalgaon seat. I will say in the meeting of the grand alliance that the demand for Mr. Mujibur is huge,” Mr. Ajmal told a crowd at a rally in Dalgaon. The Dalgaon seat in northern Assam’s Darrang district is currently held by Ilias Ali of the Congress. Mr Rahman is the projected candidate of AIUDF. Apart from Dalgaon, the AIUDF is reportedly eyeing Baghbor, Sarukhetri and Mankachar — all Muslim-majority constituencies which the Congress had won in 2016. Mr. Ajmal, who represents the Dhubri Lok Sabha seat, had held a rally at Sarukhetri a few days ago. ‘Friendly contest?’ “The chances of Mr. Mujibur winning Dalgaon are high. But what if the grand alliance does not accept his candidature? In that case, would you like a friendly contest,” he asked the crowd, adding that the AIUDF and Congress could go for a friendly fight in three-four other constituencies. The AIUDF chief seems to have unnerved the MLAs of these constituencies, if not the Congress leadership. “It is natural that I, as the sitting MLA, will contest the Dalgaon seat. It is confusing why Mr. Ajmal wants to field someone from his party here,” Mr. Ali said. He did not rule out the possibility of a third party taking the seat away if the Congress and AIUDF engaged in a friendly contest. The upcoming Assembly elections in Assam are likely to be fought among three alliances — one is led by the BJP, another is the six-party mahajot (grand alliance) and the third is the regional alliance between the newly floated Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and jailed peasants’ rights activist Akhil Gogoi’s Raijor Dal (RD). The Congress has been appealing to the AJP-RD to come on board for a united front against BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/seat-sharing-worry-for-grand-alliance-in-assam/article33787770.ece
09 February 2021||Mumbai,||MVA govt. to probe celebrity tweets on farmers’ protest||Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday said the State government’s intelligence department will conduct a probe into allegations that some celebrities were pressured by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to post identical tweets in support of the Central government over the farm laws. Mr. Deshmukh made the remarks after a group of Congress leaders, led by party spokesperson Sachin Sawant, raised the demand for an investigation into the BJP’s alleged connection with the tweets, in a meeting via videoconferencing. “The Congress delegation wanted to meet me regarding the ongoing farmers’ agitation. As I am COVID-19 positive, I accepted their letter digitally. They have raised serious questions. I have given directions to conduct the probe as per the procedure,” Mr. Deshmukh said. After the virtual meeting, Mr. Sawant tweeted, “Demanded investigation of BJP connection into the tweets of celebrities & security to be provided to our national heroes if needed & find out whether these celebrities were arm-twisted by BJP.”  BJP national president J.P. Nadda took a swipe at the Maharashtra government over the move. “MVA in Maharashtra has a unique model of governance - hail noises of anarchy from overseas who show India in poor light but harass patriotic Indians who stand for the nation. It is difficult to decide what is more flawed: their priorities or their mindset?” he tweeted. Devendra Fadnavis, Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, termed the move “disgusting and deplorable”. “Has this MVA Govt lost all its senses? MVA should feel ashamed while using the word ‘probe’ for BharatRatnas! Actually, now it seems necessary to probe the mental state & stability of the ones who made such demand & of people who ordered probe against our BharatRatnas!” he tweeted. Mr. Sawant said that the BJP was misinterpreting the party’s demand. “Our demand is a probe against the BJP and its hand in planting these tweets and not against these celebrities. We have also demanded protection to these celebrities from threat posed by the BJP,” he said. “Why BJP is keeping mum on why tweets of Akshay Kumar and Saina Nehwal are matching with each other? Why Suniel Shetty tags his tweet to a BJP office-bearer? Why BJP is scared of probe?” Mr. Sawant tweeted. The Congress spokesperson also said many of these celebrities had never posted political tweets before. “We want a probe as to whether they were politically pressured,” he said. Mr. Sawant added that everyone has a constitutional right to express their personal opinion, but if it is done under pressure, then it must be probed.  Congress leaders have raised serious questions.

09 February 2021||Mumbai,||Somaiya writes to I-T Department against CM||Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Kirit Somaiya has filed a complaint with the Income Tax (I-T) Department against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly concealing property information in his election affidavit. In his letter to M.V. Bhanumathi, director general (investigation) of the I-T Department, Mr. Somaiya alleged that Mr. Thackeray had concealed the ownership of 19 bungalows/houses (held jointly) in the election affidavit and I-T returns. “In the affidavit it seems that Mr. Thackeray has knowingly not shown or disclosed these 19 bungalows which were jointly bought by his wife along with Manisha Ravindra Waikar,” the BJP leader claimed. Ms. Waikar is the wife of Shiv Sena MLA Ravindra Waikar. Mr. Somaiya alleged that the total value of these bungalows is Rs. 5.29 crore. “The concealment is visible in properties bought from Anvay Naik at Korlai, Alibaug. In the agreement, the market value stated was Rs. 4.14 crore but the purchase price stated was Rs. 2.10 crore. In the election affidavit, the purchase price declared was Rs. 4.37 crore,” the letter said. It further said that Rashmi Uddhav Thackeray had paid property/house tax on the 19 houses to the gram panchayat for eight years (1/4/2013 to 31/3/2021) on November 12, 2020. “The market/circle price shown by the gram panchayat/government was Rs. 5.29 crore. Thus the Thackerays have land and properties worth Rs. 10.50 crore at Korlai but shown the cost and value as Rs. 2.10 crore in the election affidavit,” Mr. Somaiya wrote in his complaint letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/somaiya-writes-to-i-t-department-against-cm/article33787427.ece

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing the appeal filed through senior advocate Kapil Sibal on September 9. Mr. Sibal had argued that 34 of days of Mr. Navlakha’s house arrest was not considered as detention and the NIA did not file its charge sheet within the stipulated period of 90 days as per the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court held, “The circumstances cumulatively leads us to conclude that the appellant is not entitled to the benefit of 34 days for claiming statutory default bail.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-dismisses-navlakhas-plea-challenging-rejection-of-bail/article33787435.ece

Mr. Abbott surrendered himself at the police station on Monday morning. Two brothers, aged 30 and 29, were killed when Mr. Abbott’s SUV rammed into their bike on Palm Beach road in Vashi on Sunday morning. The victims, identified as Sanket Anil Gamare (30) and Akshay Anil Gamare (29), were the sons of a police constable from Borivali who is attached to the Mumbai Police. The accident occurred when the brothers were returning from a party at a friend’s house. The SUV rammed into the bike outside K Star Hotel near APMC area. The accused then abandoned the vehicle at the spot and fled. Suresh Mengade, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I), said, “We learnt that the owner of the car resided in Panvel and contacted him. However, he said that the car had been sold to Mr. Abbott. The accused then surrendered himself on Monday.” The police made the accused undergo a blood test to ascertain if there were traces of alcohol. The accused said the accident occurred when he was returning after meeting a friend, Mr. Mengade said. “Even if no traces of alcohol are found in his blood, we have charged him under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act, which will ensure that he gets severe punishment for taking two lives,” Mr. Mengade said. Mr. Abbott was presented before the Belapur court later in the day and he was granted bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/apmc-police-arrest-hoteliers-son-in-vashi-hit-and-run-case/article33787430.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Punjab defending Ansari, U.P. govt. tells apex court||The Uttar Pradesh government accused its Punjab counterpart in the Supreme Court on Monday of “vociferously” defending politician Mukhtar Ansari, who is in district jail Rupnagar in connection with an alleged extortion case. Appearing for Uttar Pradesh before a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Punjab government is “supporting a gangster”. Mr. Mehta said Ansari, a BSP MLA from Mau constituency, is accused in cases involving several heinous offences. “The State (Punjab) says Mukhtar Ansari is suffering from depression. Ansari says he belongs to a family of freedom fighters. The point is there are several cases of heinous offences lodged against him (in Uttar Pradesh). He is a gangster. He is happy in jail in Punjab,” Mr. Mehta submitted. “Why should the State of Punjab support Mukhtar Ansari,” the Solicitor General asked. The apex court was hearing a plea filed by U.P. seeking a direction to Punjab and Rupnagar Jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari to District Jail, Banda. It has also sought a direction to transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the extortion case in Punjab to the special court in Allahabad. The counsel appearing for Ansari said that he has also filed a petition seeking transfer of case from U.P. to Punjab and that plea should also be heard along with this matter. The court scheduled the case for hearing on February 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-defending-ansari-up-govt-tells-apex-court/article33787767.ece
09 February 2021||Pune,||Cong. banks on Nana Patole to revive fortunes||The new chief of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee, Nana Patole, who quit as Assembly Speaker last week, faces a daunting challenge to transform the organisation riven with factionalism. A particularly uphill task facing Mr. Patole, a former BJP leader from Vidarbha, is to revive the Congress’ sagging fortunes in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra. ‘Lost youth vote’ “In western Maharashtra, the rural areas are the veritable fiefdom of Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party, while the BJP is dominant in the urban pockets like Pune city. Importantly, the Congress is no longer able to woo the youth in this region,” says Pune-based political analyst Rajendra Pandharpure. Other observers point out that despite Mr. Patole’s leadership qualities, he is unlikely to be fully accepted by a core group of party workers. “Being a former BJP legislator and MP from Bhandara-Gondia, Mr. Patole’s loyalty will remain suspect,” said an analyst. Key urban bodies Three crucial civic body elections in this region — the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation in March this year, and the Pune and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations polls in 2022 — will be the acid test. According to Mr. Pandharpure, of all the four major parties, the Congress is at a disadvantage in the PMC and the PCMC, which are both dominated by the BJP. “The big challenge in Pune is rebuilding moribund party structures. Unfortunately, in the organisational rejig carried out last week, there are no new faces from Pune. The only young face is that of Praniti Shinde, the Congress MLA from Solapur City Central and the daughter of former Union minister and chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who was been appointed one of the six MPCC working presidents,” he said. Another Pune-based election observer wondered how Mr. Patole’s appointment as new party chief would help heal the endemic factionalism that has been the Congress’s undoing in Pune for the last several years. “In Pune, the youth have veered towards either the BJP, the NCP or even Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena on occasion. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has already set the ball rolling and is seen to be making a strong bid to recapture his erstwhile bastion PCMC from the BJP. In contrast, the Congress is on the back foot. Furthermore, Mr. Patole is from Vidarbha. So, it is doubtful how far he will be able to influence political equations in western Maharashtra,” he said. The 2017 civic polls saw the BJP reign supreme in the PMC, which the saffron party swept by winning 100 seats. It also broke the NCP’s stranglehold over the PCMC, winning 77 of the 128 seats. BJP gets headstart Under State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, the party is already girding up for the civic polls next year, having prepared an agenda and steadily working towards it. “Mr. Patil has been holding regular meetings on critical urban issues like the pending Pune Metro project, river cleaning, the condition of the local PMT buses, the slum rehabilitation authority, while BJP Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has his eye firmly on retaining Pune. Furthermore, young leaders like Siddharth Shirole have taken up a number of germane issues during the pandemic, which forced the Uddhav Thackeray government to sit up and take notice,” said a local BJP leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-banks-on-nana-patole-to-revive-fortunes/article33787434.ece

09 February 2021||Yangon,||Myanmar issues crackdown warning||Myanmar’s Generals issued a stern warning on Monday against further protests as an uprising against their coup gathered pace, with hundreds of thousands on the streets demanding the release of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta has so far refrained from using deadly force to quell the demonstrations sweeping most of the country, but with pressure building riot police fired water cannon in an attempt to disperse thousands gathered in Naypyitaw. The military last week detained Ms. Suu Kyi and dozens of other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party, ending a decade of civilian rule and triggering international condemnation. In the face of an increasingly bold wave of defiance, state broadcaster MRTV warned that opposition to the junta was unlawful and signalled a potential crackdown. “Action must be taken according to the law with effective steps against offences which disturb, prevent and destroy the state’s stability, public safety and the rule of law,” said a statement read by an announcer on the channel. Tens of thousands of people overcame a nationwide Internet blockade to rally over the weekend in the first major outpourings of opposition to the coup. The movement built on Monday, with protests across the country and the start of a nationwide strike. In Yangon, the nation’s commercial capital, crowds spilt onto the city’s main roads, immobilising traffic and dwarfing the previous day’s rally. “Down with military dictatorship” and “release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and arrested people”, protesters chanted, flashing the three-finger salute that has come to symbolise their movement as car horns were honked in support. Nationwide strike Calls for a nationwide strike gathered momentum over the weekend, with textile workers, civil servants and railway employees walking out of work in the commercial hub. “This is a work day, but we aren’t going to work even if our salary will be cut,” one protester, 28-year-old garment factory worker Hnin Thazin, said. Construction worker Chit Min, 18, joined the Yangon rally, saying his loyalty to Ms. Suu Kyi outweighed concerns about his financial situation. “I am jobless now for a week because of the military coup, and I am worried for my survival,” he said. Similarly, large crowds marched in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city. Police attempted to disperse thousands of people in Naypyitaw, where the deposed leader is believed to be detained. Water cannon was fired into the crowd, injuring at least two demonstrators, according to a photographer on the scene. Huge rallies were also reported across the country, from Muse on the Chinese border to the southern cities of Dawei and Hpa-an. State of emergency Protesters started to disperse in the early evening. Myanmar’s Generals detained Ms. Suu Kyi, 75, and other top NLD leaders last Monday, justifying the coup by claiming fraud in last November’s elections, which the party won in a landslide. The junta proclaimed a one-year state of emergency, promising to hold fresh elections after that without offering any precise timeframe. U.S. President Joe Biden has led global calls for the Generals to relinquish power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-issues-crackdown-warning/article33787102.ece
09 February 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka clears Chinese energy project, 50 km off Tamil Nadu||Sri Lanka’s recent decision to pull out of the East Container Terminal (ECT) deal with India and Japan is not the only challenge to New Delhi’s interests emerging this year. A week before reneging on the 2019 Colombo Port terminal agreement, Sri Lanka cleared a Chinese energy project in three islands off Jaffna peninsula that are barely 50 km from the Tamil Nadu coast. On January 18, the Cabinet approved a proposal to involve Sinosoar-Etechwin Joint Venture in China to install ‘hybrid renewable energy systems’ in Nainativu, Delft or Neduntheevu, and Analaitivu, located in the Palk Bay. The islands are connected to the Jaffna peninsula by a limited ferry service, managed mostly by the Sri Lankan Navy. India has not commented on the development, but sources in Colombo said: “concerns were raised”, citing the project site’s proximity to the Indian coastline. Delft island is one of the closest points to India from northern Sri Lanka. The three islands, where the energy systems are coming up, are home to a few thousand people. Several families residing in these islands fled the civil war, and crossed over to Tamil Nadu in boats, according to residents. Following years of neglect, the islands have remained much less developed compared to Jaffna peninsula. Housing project The energy project is not the first instance of a Chinese role in northern infrastructure in Sri Lanka. In 2018, India voiced concern over China’s $300 million housing project for war-affected areas, accusing the Resettlement Ministry [of the former government] of holding an “opaque” bidding process. The project was eventually dropped. Commenting on the development, Austin Fernando, Sri Lanka’s former High Commissioner to India, said the Sri Lankan government cannot be blamed for this decision, because the project is backed by the Asian Development Bank, which has its “own procurement guidelines that should be followed by the borrower”. However, India raising concern is “understandable” and “unsurprising”, he said, adding that the reaction was consistent with New Delhi’s positions in the past, when a Chinese submarine called at the Colombo Port in 2014, and when the government had a Chinese offer to develop housing in the north. “The islands chosen now are even closer to the Indian border. India would not like another source of tension at a time when the confrontation with China in Ladakh is yet to be resolved,” Mr. Fernando said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-clears-chinese-energy-project-50-km-off-tamil-nadu/article33787101.ece

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Enhance combat readiness, Xi tells People’s Liberation Army||China’s President Xi Jinping urged the Chinese military “to enhance combat readiness” as he inspected a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force division, ahead of a major national holiday in China. Following Mr. Xi’s call, the PLA had been carrying out exercises near Taiwan while “high-altitude border defense troops of the Xinjiang Military Command received several new weapons and equipment, including advanced howitzers and assault vehicles as holiday gifts”, Communist Party-run Global Times reported. Mr. Xi, who is also Chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited the PLA Air Force in the southwestern province of Guizhou last week in his last major trip ahead of China’s biggest annual holiday, the Lunar New Year, which runs from Thursday until February 17. “It is usual practice for the Chinese military to enhance its combat readiness in major holidays,” Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times . “History tells us that many wars broke out on holidays or at night when troops let their guard down. That is why we need to stay on high alert particularly when there are holidays, so we can stop any potentially dangerous moves or hostile reconnaissance.” Official media affiliated to the PLA reported over the past few days moves to bolster logistical support to military commands near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including the Xinjiang Military Command commissioning “its first batch of China’s newly developed Type 15 light tanks, which excels at rapid reaction combat in plateau regions”. The official broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported a regiment attached to the PLA Xinjiang Military Command received the first batch last month and “immediately after the commissioning, the regiment sent the tanks to a freezing region at 4,300 m altitude for adaptation exercises, so they can rapidly form combat capability”. Media affiliated to the PLA also reported earlier this month a border defence company at Shenxianwan near the Karakoram mountains at an elevation of 5,380 m had been equipped for long-term winter deployment by “introducing high-tech planting technologies” for vegetable growing in the harsh environment. The PLA had also recently completed “an off-grid new-energy microgrid that integrates wind energy, solar energy, diesel oil and battery storage systems” to provide “stable, all-weather power supply that will benefit troops’ routine training”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/enhance-combat-readiness-xi-tells-peoples-liberation-army/article33787098.ece
09 February 2021||London,||South Africa halts roll-out of AstraZeneca vaccine||South Africa on Monday halted the planned roll-out of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine after data showed that it gave only minimal protection against mild infection from one variant. The coronavirus has killed 2.3 million people and turned normal life upside down for billions but new variants have raised fears that vaccines will need to be tweaked and people may require booster shots. Researchers from the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Oxford said, in a prior-to-peer analysis, that the AstraZeneca vaccine provided minimal protection against mild or moderate infection from the so-called South African variant among young people. “This study confirms that the coronavirus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected,” said Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial. South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Sunday that the government would await advice from scientists on how best to proceed. The vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca with the University of Oxford, was the big hope for Africa as it is cheap and easier to store and transport than the Pfizer shot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/south-africa-halts-roll-out-of-astrazeneca-vaccine/article33787668.ece

Confirming, opposition parliamentarian and Leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance Mano Ganesan told The Hindu: “The Speaker [Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena] informed us today, at the party leaders’ meeting that PM Khan will be addressing the Parliament.” Mr. Khan is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on February 22 on a two-day official visit. He will hold talks with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, officials said. Mr. Khan will be the first head of government to visit the island nation since the pandemic struck early last year. Colombo has maintained close ties with Islamabad, and usually refrains from commenting on India-Pakistan tensions. In 2015, PM Narendra Modi addressed the Sri Lankan Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/imran-khan-to-address-sri-lankan-parliament/article33787100.ece
09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||A Budget not for the environment||In 1991, when the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh ushered in economic reforms that catapulted India into the global economy, I had asked him how he intended to balance rapid economic growth with environmental protection. He said that the experience of the West is that once there is enough money in the economy through growth, it can be put for ecological purposes. A dismal gap Leaving aside the fallacy of believing that all ecological damage can be compensated (a rainforest drowned under a dam can’t be recreated, however much money you pour into it), the truth is that governments have not put in the substantial new financial resources raised through rapid growth into environmental protection. Budgetary allocations for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) have consistently fallen as a percentage of total allocations. Second, even when there are increased allocations, such as for cleaning up the Ganga, their usage is ridden with such design flaws, inefficiencies and corruption that the environment is no better off than before. Steadily increasing levels of pollution, biodiversity loss, decline in forest health and destruction of wetlands is testimony to the dismal gap between governmental rhetoric and the environment, regardless of the party in power. The 2021 Budget is no different. On several significant items relating to the environment, and taking inflation and needs into account, allocations have remained stagnant or fallen. This includes the MoEFCC and crucial institutions such as the Wildlife Institute of India and the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education. As Debadityo Sinha of the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy points out, this follows an earlier recommendation by the Ministry of Finance that the government should disengage with many such institutions. One consequence of this is that these institutions are having to raise funds through the private corporate sector, which inevitably compromises their ability to speak the truth when this sector indulges in ecologically damaging activities. The government could argue that while direct allocations to environment-related institutions and schemes may not have risen significantly, there are substantial allocations to sectors that have a positive environmental impact. For instance, the 2021 Budget has allocated Rs. 3,500 crore for wind and solar energy, Rs. 4,000 crore for a ‘Deep Ocean Mission’, and Rs. 50,011 crore for urban drinking water. All of these have positive ecological potential, but let’s examine them a bit more closely. India’s major push for renewable energy (RE) has earned it global appreciation. Back home, it is not so rosy. For one, there is no intention to phase out fossil fuels; on the contrary, coal mining and thermal power are being promoted under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package. And large hydropower is being promoted as RE, though its massive ecological and social impacts are well documented. Finally, even much of the solar and wind energy is coming in the form of massive energy parks that take up huge areas of land, displacing people and wildlife. There is no indication in the Budget that the RE push would be predominantly decentralised, community-managed, and with full environmental impact assessments (currently not required for RE projects). Nor does the Budget have anything on curtailing wasteful and luxury consumption of energy or other products and services by the rich. Without controlling demand, even a complete shift to RE will be unsustainable; after all, silica has to be mined somewhere. According to Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, the same issue bedevils the drinking water allocations. In principle any scheme for urban drinking water is positive. But with the continuation of a highly centralised approach to all such schemes, there is a ‘one size fits all’ approach, heavily focused on expensive infrastructure like big reservoirs and pipelines. Instead, a decentralised approach that uses a mix of local rooftop and backyard harvesting, restoration and conservation of urban wetlands, and regenerating groundwater could achieve much better results. And as in energy, there is no focus on incentivising responsible consumption, restraining luxury uses, and redistributing water more equitably, without which no amount of infrastructure will be enough. The ‘Deep Ocean’ allocation is intriguing. It is being projected as a programme for conservation of biodiversity in the depths of our marine areas. This would be cause for cheer, given the serious neglect of our oceanic areas. But the institutions that are given responsibility under this are the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Indian Space Research Organisation, the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the Department of Atomic Energy, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Department of Biotechnology, and the Indian Navy, none with expertise in or even significant focus on marine conservation. Instead, this could become a project for deep sea mining, for which already explorations are going on. Potentially, an allocation of Rs. 18,000 crore for public transport could have significant benefits for people and the environment if it helps to reduce private vehicle density in cities. But if much of this is allocated to the metro rather than to buses and other such earthy alternatives (including last mile connectivity, incentives for walking and cycling), the picture becomes murky. Experience with the metro so far in India’s cities is one of significant environmental impact, as also eventual lack of affordability for the poor. Some worrying allocations There is then the very worrying issue of allocations to non-environmental sectors that have a negative impact on the environment. For instance, the Budget proposes 11,000 km more of national highway corridors. In the last few years, massive road and dam construction has fragmented fragile ecosystems and disrupted local community life in the Himalaya, Western Ghats, north-east India and elsewhere. It is not only the road itself but what it brings with it that results in opening up previously intact ecosystems. As Kanchan Chopra of the Institute of Economic Growth says, how much more can we afford to destroy our ‘natural capital’ without it rebounding on us in forms like COVID-19? Given that this could have been the occasion to climb into a green, nature-and-land based livelihoods recovery that could create tens of millions of jobs as also regenerate India’s depleted environment, this Budget is disappointing. But it is not surprising. It is in the logic of neoliberal ‘development’ planning, with a blind trust in growth as the panacea for all ills, to treat nature as a commodity for exploitation, or a ‘sink’ into which to dump waste. With global alarm about the ecological catastrophe we are rushing headlong into, COVID-19 recovery packages announced by the Indian government since mid-2020 ought to have put environmental regeneration and conservation, and self-reliance built on this, at the core of the Budget. That has unfortunately not happened. Ashish Kothari is with Kalpavriksh and Vikalp Sangam.

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||The long and the short of India’s Naypyitaw dilemma||The long-lingering power struggle in Naypyitaw has finally ended, and the Myanmar junta, led by General Min Aung Hlaing, has won the struggle, dashing decade-long hopes for a truly democratic Myanmar. The future of Myanmar’s democracy is uncertain, but the country, sandwiched between two powerful states competing for power and influence, is certain to be a key piece in the region’s geopolitics. Given its high-stakes in Myanmar, New Delhi would need to be nimble-footed and creative in its responses with well-thought-out strategic choices taking precedence over knee-jerk reactions.  Coup, politics and geopolitics If Myanmar’s democracy prior to the February 2021 coup was inadequate and intolerant towards minorities, its political future will be a lot more complicated, making the choices of outside powers far more constrained. Strong reactions and the threat of sanctions from the United States and the West in the wake of the recent coup could lead to unique political realignments in Myanmar. As a result, even though the democratic credentials of the former State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, remain deeply diminished today, thanks to her shocking justification of the ill-treatment meted out to the Rohingya, the international community may not have any alternatives when it comes to pursuing the restoration of democracy in the country. Ms. Suu Kyi no doubt made a Faustian bargain to cling on to power, certainly since the bloody crackdown against the minority Muslim community in 2017, and yet the recent events have brought her right back into the centre of the international community’s political calculations in Myanmar. Sometimes, good intentions have deeply compromised outcomes. To rebuild the charisma of the fallen messiah, those batting for Ms. Suu Kyi in the international community may have to condone her government’s past actions against the Rohingya in order to highlight her suitability to be the saviour of democracy in Myanmar once again. She will now be the poster girl for the international campaign to restore democracy in Myanmar and the case against Myanmar’s conduct during her government’s tenure at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will most likely be put on the backburner. In this process, the plight of the hapless Rohingya will take a backseat or be conveniently forgotten. Put differently, increasing global support for Ms. Suu Kyi could potentially spell doom for the persecuted Rohingya. The China factor This is a coup that seems to suit no one except the Tatmadaw, the armed forces of Myanmar. In the short run, the coup stands to hurt the interests of China, India and even the rest of the international community, all of whom were able to do business with Myanmar in their own unique ways. However, the international community’s sharp reactions will likely force the Tatmadaw to turn to China. Even though international sanctions are unlikely to have a major impact on the country’s largely inward-looking junta and its Generals with little external interests, it would still expect Beijing to give them political and diplomatic support both within the region and globally. For China, the coup has complicated its larger regional economic plans in Myanmar, at least for the time being. Beijing has recently been cultivating Ms. Suu Kyi, who was keen on a strong relationship with China given the growing criticism she was facing from the West. But the junta’s jailing her could complicate Beijing’s plans for the country. On the positive side for Beijing, decisive western sanctions will force the military to get closer to China. For Beijing, given that it does not come with the ‘baggage’ of democratic norms, it may simply be a matter of rejigging its schedule in Myanmar and getting used to the new scheme of things there. To that extent, China will be its biggest beneficiary of the February coup by default. China, therefore, has every reason to go easy on the junta and offer them support in return for increasing the Chinese footprint in the country. On its part, the Tatmadaw, which has traditionally not been an ardent fan of Beijing, would have to change its tune. While China’s choices are straightforward, it is far more complicated for others, especially India.  New Delhi’s quandary New Delhi faces the most challenging dilemma on how to respond to the military coup in Myanmar. The dual power centres of the military and the civilian government that existed in Naypyitaw until recently, suited New Delhi quite well as it did not have to worry about hurting the international community’s normative concerns or sacrificing its national interests while engaging them both. More so, until recently, New Delhi’s Myanmar policy was not shaped by a difficult choice between norms and interests: neither was Ms. Suu Kyi’s political experiment without its faults nor were India’s national interests hurt by the Tatmadaw. The February coup has undone that comfortable space New Delhi’s Myanmar policy occupied for close to a decade. While India’s national interests, under the new circumstances, would clearly lie in dealing with whoever is in power in Myanmar, India would find it difficult to openly support the junta given the strong western and American stance. On the other hand, it can ill-afford to offend the junta by actively seeking a restoration of democracy there. Being a close neighbour with clear strategic interests in Myanmar, offending the junta would be counter-productive. While Ms. Suu Kyi was getting cozy with Beijing, it was the Myanmar military that had been more circumspect, to Delhi’s delight of course. With Ms. Suu Kyi in detention, Beijing will focus its energies on wooing the Generals. Although the Ministry of External Affairs statement — “We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely” — is definitely in favour of restoring democracy, its past support for the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar is unlikely to return; this is particularly because the nature of the regional geopolitics has changed thanks to the arrival of China on the scene. New Delhi’s new Myanmar policy will therefore be a function of interests rather than norms. Cooperation, Rohingya issue While a friendless Myanmar junta getting closer to China is a real worry for New Delhi, there are other concerns too. For one, Myanmar’s military played a helpful role in helping New Delhi contain the north-eastern insurgencies by allowing Indian military to pursue insurgents across the border into Myanmar. Coordinated action and intelligence sharing between the two forces have in the recent past been instrumental in beating back the insurgent groups in the northeast. Equally important is the issue of providing succour to the Rohingya in the wake of the military coup in Myanmar. Unless the military decides to engage in a peace process to gain some brownie points for itself, the Rohingya question is likely to be pushed aside with the campaign against them continuing relentlessly, perhaps with even more ferocity. The inability of the states in the region to address the legitimate concerns of the Rohingya or increased violations of their rights could potentially lead to a rise of extremism within the community, which in the longer run would not be in India’s interests. New Delhi then is left with very few clear policy options. And yet, it must continue to maintain relations with the government in power in Myanmar while discreetly pushing for political reconciliation in the country. In the meantime, the focus must be on improving trade, connectivity, and security links between the two sides.

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||First steps in the journey to universal health care||About 20 years ago, Thailand rolled out universal health coverage for its population at a per capita GDP similar to today’s India. What made this possible was a three decade-long tradition of investing gradually but steadily in public health infrastructure and manpower. This meant that alongside the availability of funds, there also existed robust institutional capacity to assimilate those funds. For India, the lesson of COVID-19 entails setting forth on a steady and incremental path to universal health coverage; not attempting a sudden and giant leap. This is important because enough evidence exists on weak fund-absorbing capacities particularly in the backward States — at times, such unused funds have been to the tune of over half of the State’s public health expenditure. Budgetary allocations The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare budget for 2021-22, viz . Rs. 73,932 crore, saw a 10.2% increase over the Budget estimate (BE) of 2020-21 — a modest increase even nominally. Also, a corpus of Rs. 64,180 crore over six years has been set aside under the PM Atma Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana, (PMANSBY) for strengthening health institutions, and Rs. 13,192 crore has been allocated as a Finance Commission grant. While the allocations still leave a lot to be desired, these could make the first steps of a journey that steadily builds towards sustainable universal health coverage through incremental strengthening of grass-root-level institutions and processes. Two important and prominent arms of universal health coverage in India merit discussion here. Universal insurance The BE for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), which covers over 50 crore poor Indians for hospital expenses up to Rs. 5 lakh per annum, has stagnated at Rs. 6,400 crore for the current and the preceding couple of years. And so have the actuals and revised estimates at around 50% of the BEs, which should be cause for concern. Large expenditure projections and time constraints involved in input-based strengthening of public health care have inspired the shift to the insurance route for achieving universal health coverage. However, insurance does not provide a magic formula for expanding health care with measly levels of public spending. Available estimates have pegged the costs to be between Rs. 62,000 crore and Rs. 1,08,000 crore for 2021, if PM-JAY is to meet its stated commitments. Given these circumstances, making do with such paltry spending year after year would mean that the scheme benefits are being spread out too narrowly or too thin, implying the inability to afford enough protection against catastrophic health expenses to the poor. Beyond low allocations, poor budget reliability merits attention. Another related issue is the persistent and large discrepancies between official coverage figures and survey figures (for e.g. the National Sample Surveys, or NSS, and National Family Health Survey) across Indian States, indicating that official public health insurance coverage fails to translate into actual coverage on the ground. This is particularly intriguing for forward States such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka, where state-level public health insurance schemes have been operational for around a decade. Robust research into the implementational issues responsible for such discrepancies and addressing them is warranted. Without the same, the PM-JAY’s quest for universal health coverage is likely to be precarious. Finally, even high actual coverage should not be equated with effective financial protection. For example, Andhra Pradesh has among the highest public health insurance coverage scores (71.36%, NSS 75), but still has an out-of-pocket spending share much above the national average (72.2% of total health expenditure). In contrast, Himachal Pradesh (H.P.)with a much lower public health insurance coverage (3.87%, NSS 75) has a lower out-of-pocket (46.4%). Among other factors, this could be attributable to the much higher per capita public health spending in H.P., more than twice that of Andhra Pradesh, which highlights the importance of government investment. Comprehensive primary care Health and Wellness Centres — 1,50,202 of them — offering a comprehensive range of primary health-care services are to be operationalised until December 2022. Of these, 1,19,628 would be upgraded sub health centres and the remaining would be primary health centres and urban primary health centres. Initially, most States prioritised primary health centres/urban primary health centres for upgradation over sub health centres, since the former required fewer additional investments. Till February 2, 58,155 health and wellness centres were operational, of which 34,733 were sub health centres and 23,422 were primary health centres/urban primary health centres. This means that of the remaining 92,047 health and wellness centres to be operationalised by December 2022, 84,895 will be sub health centres. This offers huge cost projections — as per early (conservative) estimates, turning a sub health centre into a health and wellness centre would require around Rs. 17.5 lakh, and around Rs. 8 lakh annually to run it thereafter. The current allocation of Rs. 1,900 crore, an increase of Rs. 300 crore from previous year, is a paltry sum in comparison. Since 2018-19, when the health and wellness centre initiative began, allocations have not kept pace with the rising targets each year. Additional funding under the PMANSBY and Finance Commission grants is reassuring, but a greater focus on rural health and wellness centres would be warranted. Issues with funds Two untoward implications could result from under-investing and spreading funds too thinly. Continuing the expansion of health and wellness centres without enough funding would mean that the full range of promised services will not be available, thus rendering the mission to be more of a re-branding exercise. Second, under-funding would squander an opportunity for the health and wellness centre initiative to at least partially redress the traditional rural-urban dichotomy by bolstering curative primary care in rural areas. This opportunity arises on account of the expanded array of services that health and wellness centres are supposed to provide, and the fact that an overwhelming majority of them will be in rural areas. Since curative care implies larger costs, they could be largely confined to delivering merely preventive, wellness, and referral services without adequate funding. COVID-19 has prodded us to make a somewhat stout beginning in terms of investing in health. The key, and the most difficult part, would be to keep the momentum going unswervingly. Dr. Soham D.

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Improving Covishield efficiency||On January 16, large-scale vaccination of healthcare workers began across India. Two vaccines are in use — Covishield and Covaxin — both rolled out under emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), with the condition that all information on adverse reactions following immunisation (AEFI) be collected. For Covishield, the responsibility of AEFI monitoring is with the Government of India, since the authorisation for restricted use is at the discretion of the government. The government has defined who should be prioritised for vaccination — the first priority is healthcare workers. Since the epidemic was transitioning to the endemic phase (when, on average, each infection reproduces another and the effective reproduction number or R0=1) from the third week of January, the vaccination is not expected to impact on the epidemic, but offer protection to healthcare workers since repeated exposure to infection is an occupational hazard. The vaccine roll-out is without a need assessment and includes those previously infected. It is essentially a token of appreciation to the healthcare workers who stoically faced the brunt of the epidemic and efficiently managed infected individuals. Longer interval  The Lancet has just published a paper (that is not yet peer-reviewed) describing the clinical protective efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (called Covishield in India) in Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa. The critical lesson is that the efficacy after the second dose was only 54.9% when given 4-6 weeks after the first dose but 82.4% when the second dose was delayed to 12 weeks. It is an accepted principle in vaccine immunology that the second dose of a vaccine administered after 28 days functions as a booster and the longer the time interval between the two doses — upto six months — the higher the booster response. The results of the Oxford vaccine trial are therefore no surprise. For the vaccine roll-out in India, the due date of the second dose will begin from February 13 to 27 if at 4-6 weeks, but April 10 if delayed for 12 weeks. Which is preferable for India under the present endemic phase of infection (by our estimates) — early low efficacy or delayed but high efficacy? This is a question that the government must answer immediately, so that the due dates for the next dose can be revised in case the longer interval is chosen. Had we begun the vaccine roll-out in the middle of the epidemic, early protection by two doses would have been preferred in order to accelerate the decline of the epidemic curve. But now that we are in the endemic phase, the 12-week interval between doses would be more appropriate. If the longer gap is chosen, a larger number of persons would be able to access the first dose and this would ensure better community coverage. The present COVID-19 vaccination roll-out in India has completed first dose administration of vaccine to 43.9 lakh (47%) out of 92.6 lakh registered healthcare workers from the public and private sectors by February 3, 2021. It is important to understand that in this group, the earlier infections would have been much more than in the general population figure of about 60% at endemicity — may be 70%-80% already. The vaccination centres are achieving only 50%-60% of their potential (50-60 vaccinations per day as against the possible 100). These slots are sought to be filled by other essential workers like the police and those in public service. Slots for the elderly and vulnerable It would be important to start registering the empty slots for the elderly and vulnerable and to administer the first dose of the vaccine to these subjects who are at high risk of serious disease and death from the novel coronavirus infection. After all, a single dose of the Covishield vaccine has some degree of protective efficacy starting about three weeks after the vaccination lasting up to 12 weeks. Delaying the second dose to 12 weeks and starting the first dose of the vaccine for the elderly and vulnerable will ensure that vaccination centres run to full capacity and the elderly and vulnerable are protected against serious disease or death. This is very important because, with relaxation of curbs on assembly and reopening of schools, these so far cocooned subjects will be exposed to the infection. The U.K. is already following the schedule of delaying the second dose of the Oxford vaccine by 12 weeks. It is important that India does the same and ensures that serious disease and death are prevented in elderly and vulnerable subjects. Dr. M.S.

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||An uphill task for Mario Draghi||It won’t be an easy ride in Rome for Mario Draghi, the man who soothed Europe’s financial markets in 2012 with his bold declaration to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro during the eurozone’s sovereign debt and banking crises. Less than 15 months after he stepped down as President of the European Central Bank (ECB), when his negative interest rates policy was criticised for sucking money out of savers, he now finds himself thrust to the centre of Italy’s fractious politics. On Wednesday, Mr. Draghi, who was previously Governor of the Bank of Italy, accepted the mandate by the country’s President, Sergio Mattarella, to form a new national unity government following the collapse of the coalition led by Giuseppe Conte in the last week of January. A crucial verdict During his eight-year stewardship, the Frankfurt-based institution’s policy to buy unlimited quantities of sovereign bonds of ailing economies was a pivotal moment in stabilising the single currency area, even if the initiative incurred the wrath of Germany and other affluent European Union (EU) States of straying into uncharted fiscal territory. Now, Mr. Draghi’s efforts to rescue the Italian economy, drawing on €200 billion in grants and loans from the EU €750 billion recovery fund, would pronounce, so to say, a verdict on the bloc’s response to the pandemic. Crucially, Mr. Conte’s government collapsed because Italia Viva, the party of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, withdrew backing citing strong differences with the government’s recovery plans that must be approved by Brussels. The sheer political complexity of the latest endeavour the technocrat has embarked on could not be overstated. Above all, Mr. Draghi must attempt to cement the differences among Italy’s several feuding parties. The most recent government collapse, where Mr. Renzi was primarily responsible, was the second in the last couple of years. In 2019, the populist Five Star Movement, the largest party in the Italian Parliament, fell victim to the personal ambitions of Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Northern League. Mr. Draghi faces the unenviable task of bringing these rival parties on board, failing which Italy will have to go to election before the scheduled 2023 date. With 88,000 deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, this would amount to a costly and unacceptable distraction. Reactions The League, which would still prefer to test its recent high ratings at the hustings, has said that the party would back Mr. Draghi’s bid to form a government, given its strong base among business classes in the industrialised northern regions. Mr. Salvini, whose personal authority has eroded somewhat, would have to be mindful of the Brothers of Italy party linked to post-fascist forces, which has likened the proposal to a government born in a laboratory. On the other hand, soon after the President’s invitation to Mr. Draghi, the acting leader of Five Star declared his opposition to a government led by an unelected technocrat. The centre-left Democratic Party and Viva Italia are expected to support the unity government. Mr. Draghi’s stint at the ECB was underpinned less by a concern to mirror the German Bundesbank’s anti-inflationary stance than the overarching priority to ensure the survival of the euro. It is arguable that his stance was vindicated by a prolonged cycle of persistently low inflation and ultra-loose interest rates, although Wolfgang Schauble, Germany’s Finance Minister at the time, blamed Mr. Draghi’s policies for the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. That kind of decisiveness could trigger very different consequences in Italy’s highly fragmented polity. ‘Super Mario’ was the sobriquet Mr. Draghi had earned for the calming effect of his interventions into financial markets. At the current juncture in Italy, something close to that seems like securing a parliamentary majority and averting an avoidable general election.

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Troubled mountains||The staggering collapse of part of a glacier in Uttarakhand’s Nanda Devi mountain and the ensuing floods that have claimed many lives come as a deadly reminder that this fragile, geologically dynamic region can never be taken for granted. A significant slice of the glacier, dislodged by a landslide, according to some satellite images, produced roaring torrents in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers in Chamoli district, trapping unsuspecting workers at two hydro power project sites. Scores of people are still missing in the wave of water, silt and debris that swamped the rivers and filled tunnels in the Tapovan power project, although the immediate rescue of nearly 15 people by the ITBP, the Army and other agencies brings some cheer. The rescuers face a challenging environment as they try to locate more survivors and bring relief supplies to paralysed communities. These immediate measures are important, along with speedy compensation to affected families. But the Centre and the Uttarakhand government cannot ignore the larger context of the State’s increasing frailty in the face of environmental shocks. Once the crucible of environmentalism, epitomised by Sunderlal Bahuguna, Gaura Devi and the Chipko movement, the State’s deep gorges and canyons have attracted many hydroelectric projects and dams, with little concern for earthquake risk. Red flags have been raised repeatedly, particularly after the moderate quake in 1991 in the region where the Tehri dam was built and the 2013 floods that devastated Kedarnath, pointing to the threat from seismicity, dam-induced microseismicity, landslides and floods from a variety of causes, including unstable glacial lakes and climate change. India is heavily invested in dam development and growth of hydropower, largely in the Himalaya region — especially to cut carbon emissions. By one estimate, if the national plan to construct dams in 28 river valleys in the hills is realised in a few decades, the Indian Himalayas will have one dam for every 32 km, among the world’s highest densities. Yet, as researchers say, this may be a miscalculation for reasons, including potential earthquake impacts, monsoonal aberrations that could repeat a Kedarnath-like flood, severe biodiversity loss and, importantly, extreme danger to communities downstream. There is also some evidence that the life of dams is often exaggerated, and siltation, which reduces it, is grossly underestimated: in the Bhakra dam in Himachal Pradesh, for instance, siltation was higher by 140% than calculated. The need is to rigorously study the impact of policy on the Himalayas and confine hydro projects to those with the least impact, while relying more on low impact run-of-the-river power projects that need no destructive large dams and reservoirs. Unlike what the NITI Aayog seems to think of environmental accounting, this would be a sound approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/troubled-mountains/article33787078.ece
09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Law and compassion||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit has decided that only the President can decide the issue of granting remission to the seven life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. Is the Governor correct in putting the ball in the President’s court, contrary to the State Cabinet’s advice? It has often been stressed by the Supreme Court that the clemency powers of the President, under Article 72, and the Governor, under Article 161, stand on an equal footing, and are exercised solely on Cabinet advice. The only limitation in Article 161 is that it should relate to “the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends”. It may be that the Governor decided that it is beyond the State’s executive power because the Rajiv Gandhi case was tried under a central anti-terrorism law and under CBI probe. Further, in a situation arising from the State government’s attempt in 2014 to remit their sentences under the Cr.P.C., the apex court had ruled in 2015 that such remission would require the Centre’s concurrence. However, this is not a tenable argument, as the same judgment made it clear that its opinion was limited to the Cr.P.C. and would not bind the sovereign power conferred on the President or the Governor under the Constitution. Also, it cannot be forgotten that the apex court had dropped charges under the now-defunct TADA, and sentenced the convicts only under the IPC for the murder conspiracy. As the only surviving sentences are under the IPC, there seems to be nothing in law that bars the Governor’s jurisdiction. The decision is debatable for the unusual delay in the Governor reaching his conclusion as much for its legal correctness. It took Mr. Purohit more than two years — since the State Cabinet advised him in September 2018 to order the convicts’ release — to decide the question. The Supreme Court has been asking him to avoid a situation in which it would have to intervene. One could speculate that the delay reflected the Centre’s concern about releasing those involved in the plot to assassinate a former Prime Minister, and its ramifications for its policy of ‘zero tolerance’ towards terror. It is equally a matter of speculation whether the ruling party at the Centre is reserving the issue for appropriate use closer to the Assembly polls. It is unfortunate that a new legal question on which authority has the power to decide the issue has been tossed into the equation so late in the day. The Court should settle this. The convicts’ continuing incarceration for nearly 30 years, notwithstanding the gravity of their crime, has acquired a humanitarian dimension to many. It is vital that law and compassion, rather than politics and electoral considerations, form the basis for any decision on their release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/law-and-compassion/article33787079.ece
09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||The way to freedom (From an editorial)||The strongholds of irresponsible power and reaction in any country are maintained not only by the threatened exercise of physical coercion but also to a very large, if not actually greater, extent by the acquiescent support of the very victims of oppression. This silent submission of the people at large to the yoke of autocracy is mainly due to the hypnotic influence of organised power and prestige on the mentality of the masses, who unconscious of their collective might, feel themselves helpless against the serried ranks of exalted officialdom and military power. It is this deceptive vision and self-enslaving cowardice, born of the ignorance and inertia enveloping the mass mind, that is sedulously sought to be cultivated by the demonstration of costly functions in the name of the public and cleverly exploited by the self-styled guardians of ‘Law and order’ to sustain their sway over the people. By a peculiar process of political alchemy in the Governmental laboratory, the involuntary share of the masses in these demonstrations as idle spectators and ignorant admirers is transmuted into a manifestation of loyalty and love and loudly proclaimed to the world as a symbol of peace and plenty in the land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-way-to-freedom-from-an-editorial/article33787087.ece

Pakistan, in a note, three days ago, proposed “mutual discussion” to settle the problem of overflights. India’s reply, expected to be conveyed to-morrow to Pakistan, will reiterate its earlier stand that Pakistan meet India’s twin demands before talks could be initiated on the resumption of overflights, these sources said. India has not yet received any such indication, the sources said. India has charged Pakistan with “direct involvement” in the hijacking and blowing up of the aircraft. Pakistan, meanwhile, has reserved the right to make counter-claims for compensation for alleged damage to its High Commission in Delhi and injuries to the members of its staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-likely-to-agree-for-talks-with-pak/article33787088.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Panel slams DoT for delay in 5G trials||Slamming the government for its ‘laid-back approach’ and delay in conducting 5G trials, a Parliamentary Panel has said that sufficient preparatory work had not been undertaken for introducing 5G services in India and that the country was likely to witness only partial deployment by 2021-end or early 2022. In the report tabled in Parliament on Monday, the committee, headed by Shashi Tharoor, added it was very likely that after missing the 2G, 3G and 4G buses, India was going to miss out on 5G opportunities, unless time-bound action was taken in areas where governmental intervention was required. “The committee, while deploring the Department’s [Department of Telecom’s] unconscionably long delay in auctioning of spectrum, recommends that spectrum auction including auctioning of 3300 MHz to 3600 MHz be conducted at the earliest,” the report said, adding that the DoT had assured that the said spectrum would be auctioned in the next six months or so. The panel said inadequate availability of spectrum, high spectrum prices, poor development of use cases, low status of fiberisation, non-uniform right-of-way issues and deficient backhaul capacity are some factors coming in the way of a 5G services roll-out in India. The committee noted that telcos had submitted 5G trial applications in January, 2020 but that till date, guidelines for trials had not been made clear and there was no set date for commencement of trials. “It is really disturbing to note that 5G trials have not yet been permitted. This is in complete contradiction to what the Department had informed the Committee... in February, 2020, that the government has allowed all applications for 5G trials in limited areas and for limited time to test potential 5G India-specific use cases.” The panel has sought the reason for delay from the DoT. “The committee has been informed that by the end of calendar year 2021 or beginning of 2022, there will be some roll-out in India for some specific uses, because 4G should continue in India for at least another 5-6 years. From the foregoing, the committee [is] inclined to conclude that sufficient preparatory work has not been undertaken for launching 5G services in India.” The committee was of the view that the issue of allocating the right amount of spectrum as demanded by the industry needed to be addressed if India were to realise the benefits of 5G. “The committee recommends that the DoT needs to have fruitful deliberation with the Department of Space and Ministry of Defence and an understanding must be reached... for identification of adequate spectrum for 5G services.” The panel found fundamental differences between the versions of telcos and TRAI on fixing of spectrum prices and urged a review of the spectrum-pricing policy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/panel-slams-dot-for-delay-in-5g-trials/article33787061.ece

The bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said that statutory authorities such as the National Company Law Tribunal, Competition Commission of India, and the SEBI, cannot be restrained from proceeding in accordance with the law with regard to the deal. The order came on an appeal filed by FRL challenging the February 2 interim order by a single judge bench directing status quo with regard to its assets sale deal with Reliance Retail.

09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Budget’s infra push with support to worst-affected would have been better’||The 2021-22 Union Budget’s bet on pushing infrastructure spending to revive the economy faces implementation risks and it may have been better to combine it with some income support for those worst affected by the pandemic, economists at leading think tanks said on Monday. The rising tendency towards protectionism doesn’t sit well with India’s objective of attracting more foreign direct investment and integrating with global value chains, and a liberal tariff policy maybe more effective, argued Rajat Kathuria, director and chief executive of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER). Stressing that India needed globalisation more than other countries due to its growth potential, he said it would be better for India to maintain a sustainable current account deficit rather than celebrate the current account surplus expected this year. “This is a double-edged sword — an unwelcome surplus primarily due to the economic slowdown as imports have shrunk more than exports. We can’t have a surplus with every country… we may want to run a sustainable deficit by importing the right kind of capital goods, and technology,” he said, speaking at a seminar on Unpacking the Budget, hosted by the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), ICRIER, the India Development Foundation (IDF), the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), and the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP). Recovery concerns NCAER director general Shekhar Shah said the plan to privatise large sections of the public sector and returning to a more classical role for the government could change the economy’s direction. He expressed concern about a K-shaped recovery unfolding thanks to divergence between those who need to protect their lives and livelihoods, and those who are able to sustain themselves. “The entire burden of the Budget’s strategy is on high-quality infrastructure coming up quickly, and that has not always been the case. “A dual strategy of infrastructure spending with income support for those who have lost jobs, with ways in which we could create demand among those sections of society that have the highest propensity to consume might have been better,” he said. NIPFP director Pinaki Chakraborty called for caution in managing fiscal and macroeconomic balances, stating that it took just one macroeconomic crisis to recalibrate general government debt targets from 60% of GDP, to the 85% that the Finance Commission has now recommended for 2025-26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/budgets-infra-push-with-support-to-worst-affected-would-have-been-better/article33787065.ece

It had reported a net loss of Rs. 20 crore in the year-earlier period. Total revenue from operations stood at Rs. 439 crore (Rs. 437 crore). Performance during the quarter was impacted following an increase in fair and remunerative price without a corresponding increase in the minimum selling price of sugar and also due to lower selling prices. The selling prices were under severe pressure due to the carry-over surplus and higher sugar production, said S. Suresh, MD. “Further, the much-expected export programme did not come through during the quarter. Cane crushing is expected to be marginally better than the last sugar year in Karnataka.” To reduce debt, the firm had sold 2% more stake in Coromandel International Ltd., a subsidiary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/eid-parry-back-in-black-with-rs-339-cr-profit-in-q3/article33787069.ece

09 February 2021||Melbourne,||Djokovic, Osaka, Serena make flying starts||Novak Djokovic served a reminder of why he's the greatest Australian Open champion in history as he demolished France's Jeremy Chardy in straight sets in round one on Monday. The eight-time winner's 6-3, 6-1, 6-2 win showed that normal service had resumed at Rod Laver Arena after the year's first Grand Slam was delayed three weeks owing to the coronavirus. Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Simona Halep also enjoyed convincing wins as the tournament finally got underway in front of limited crowds after a troubled build-up. Form and fitness are highly unpredictable after the coronavirus wiped out five months of last season and badly disrupted preparations, but Djokovic left little doubt about his readiness to pursue a record-extending ninth title in Melbourne. Women’s third seed Osaka struck the first serve on centre court against Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and strode out just 68 minutes later a 6-1, 6-2 winner. Williams started her quest for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title in style with a 6-1, 6-1 romp past Germany's Laura Siegemund in 56 minutes. Later, the 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu won an emotional first match after 15 months out against Romania's Mihaela Buzarnescu 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. The 20-year-old Canadian last played at the WTA Finals in October 2019 at Shenzen, China, where she suffered the knee injury that scuppered her entire 2020 season.  But Angelique Kerber, the 2016 Australian Open winner, was the first significant casualty of the women's championship when the 23rd-seeded German lost 6-0, 6-4 to 63rd-ranked American Bernarda Pera. In the men's draw, US Open champion Dominic Thiem was made to work hard in the first set by Kazakh veteran Mikhail Kukushkin before coming through 7-6(2), 6-2, 6-3. Sixth seed Alexander Zverev dropped a set and smashed a racquet before grinding to a 6-7(8), 7-6(5), 6-3, 6-2 win against American Marcos Giron. Meanwhile, Gael Monfils, the French 10th seed, was stunned 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 by Emil Ruusuvuori of Finland, the World No. 86. Japan's Kei Nishikori also fell at the first hurdle with a straight-sets defeat to Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/djokovic-osaka-serena-make-flying-starts/article33787235.ece
09 February 2021||Chennai,||Advantage England despite stellar shows by Washington and Ashwin||Washington Sundar delighted with an exhibition of high quality batting in the morning, timing the ball like a dream on a challenging surface. He belongs to this stage. Then, the wily R. Ashwin bowled with craft, exploiting a wearing surface, harnessing the angles, getting the ball to turn and bounce, and finishing with six wickets even as the Englishmen, seeking quick runs, adopted a confused ‘start-stop’ approach. Despite the double punch from the Chennai duo on home turf — Washington made 85 not out and Ashwin grabbed six for 61 — England held the aces going into the final day of the first Test here. Massive lead Set a target of 420 after trailing in the first innings by a massive 241, India lost Rohit Sharma, bowled by left-armer Jack Leach. The delivery pitched middle, turned, and hit off. At stumps on Monday, the host was 39 for one at Chepauk. When England batted again, Ashwin struck with the innings’ first delivery, spinning one away from left-hander Rory Burns after drawing him forward. He went round the wicket, spun one, and got Dom Sibley, taken at leg-slip. And southpaw Ben Stokes edged a sharply turning delivery from Ashwin to ’keeper Rishabh Pant who pouched it with agility. Only the in-form Joe Root stroked with any fluency for his 40 before he was trapped leg-before by a Bumrah delivery that kept low. Ishant Sharma had earlier brought one back into Dan Lawrence for his 300th Test wicket. There were more wickets for Ashwin as England failed to achieve the desired acceleration. In the morning, Washington held centre-stage. On view were poise, balance and a distinctive quality some left-handers possess — lazy elegance. Actually, it’s a lot about picking the length early and making subtle adjustments in footwork that creates more time for the batsman and makes his response appear relaxed and languid. He possesses a pronounced back-lift but the willow, importantly, comes down straight. A forward press Washington has, but can so easily shift his weight to his back leg. And then, he has the gift of timing. On occasions he appeared to be just pushing the ball but the sphere raced to the fence. Classy, he certainly is. Crucially, his head position is still — indication of the distribution of weight — as he strokes the ball. He opened the field on the off-side with the ball’s length dictating his footwork. When Dom Bess pitched short, he went back and smoked him through cover-point. When he bowled fuller Washington eased him off the front foot. And he flashed Leach past covers to reach his second half-century in only his second Test. And after being beaten by the clever James Anderson, Washington responded with a compelling straight six. Crucial stand Washington and Ashwin (31) added 80 crucial runs for the seventh wicket; Ashwin drove handsomely. Leach, bowling with the harder second new ball, took out Ashwin with extra bounce; ’keeper Jos Buttler diving forward to snaffle a fine catch. Even as Washington stroked with consummate ease, Leach and Anderson cleaned up the Indian tail. The final day should be a gripping affair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/advantage-england-despite-stellar-shows-by-washington-and-ashwin/article33787166.ece
09 February 2021||Chennai,||Ishant — Indian pace attack’s long-distance man||Kapil Dev, Zaheer Khan and now Ishant Sharma. The 300-wicket club in Tests for Indian pacemen is elite in nature. And when the lanky Ishant trapped Dan Lawrence leg-before on day four here, he had reached a significant milestone for an Indian paceman. The landmark reflects sweat, resilience and toil apart from longevity, ability to bounce back from injuries and deliver for his team consistently. Bright start Ishant is 32 now but was a lot younger when he made his Test debut as a tearaway against Bangladesh in 2007. It is said the then Indian selection panel chief Dilip Vengsarkar had one look at him in a domestic game and was so impressed with Ishant’s speed and bounce that he soon included him in the Indian team. When he began his career, the tall Ishant extracted lift with his high-arm action but primarily brought the ball into the right-hander. His fiery spell to Aussie legend Ricky Ponting in the Perth Test of 2008 is still remembered for its hostility and control. At the end of his burst, Ishant, undaunted by reputations, got his man. In subsequent years Ishant was a regular feature in the Indian attack but without the sort of strike-rate that would take him a level higher. He was tending to be a tad shorter in length and did not have a potent away-going delivery. There has been a remarkable change in Ishant in the last four years, though. He was now pitching the ball up and moving the ball away from the right-hander or getting it to straighten. Ishant’s bowling had gained the cutting edge. During this period, his average is around 20 and he has been the senior man of a resurgent and potent Indian pace pack. The ongoing match is Ishant’s 98th Test. His record reads: 101 wickets in 38 home Tests at 31.05 and 199 in 60 matches abroad at 32.88. A balanced record. Ishant will reach another milestone soon. His 100th Test. He is contemporary Indian pace attack’s long-distance man.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ishant-is-the-third-india-pacer-to-300-wickets/article33787164.ece
09 February 2021||MELBOURNE,||Electronic line judges make their debut||The days of tennis players arguing whether balls are in or out could be coming to a close, after the smooth introduction of electronic line judging at the Australian Open on Monday. The coronavirus pandemic has prompted a major change, with human judges replaced by ball-tracking cameras to reduce the number of people on site at Melbourne Park. Real time calls The cameras are set up along each line and automatically announce their decisions in real time, with a recorded human voice calling “out”, “fault” and “foot fault”. “It’s interesting, It’s definitely different,” said 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams after powering into the second round. “I’m loving it here, so... I just needed to adapt, and now I’m adapted to it. I think it’s for the best.” The electronic calls feature pre-recorded voices of Australia’s front-line workers in the country’s pandemic response such as firefighters and other emergency response personnel. Keep the ball kids! Novak Djokovic, the eight-time Australian Open champion, agreed. “I don’t see a reason why we need the line umpires, to be honest, if we have technology like this. I would of course keep the ball kids, but line calls I’m in favour of this technology.” US Open champion Dominic Thiem was another supporter of the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/electronic-line-judges-make-their-debut/article33787233.ece

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||FC Goa snatches a draw in six-goal thriller||For the second game in a row against FC Goa, Mumbai City FC appeared to have struck in the final minutes to nick a win in an Indian Super League contest. But Goa’s super-sub Ishan Pandita nodded home in the sixth minute of added time to share the spoils in a 3-3 thriller at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Monday. Mumbai went ahead against the run of play through Hugo Boumous, when he ran half the length of the pitch to run onto a through ball from Adam le Fondre and rounded Dheeraj Singh to slot in. For its second, Mumbai scored its 14th goal from set-pieces — the most in the league — when le Fondre headed in a rebound after Dheeraj’s save bobbled up in the air. But it was Goa, which continued to dominate possession. It had its first effort at goal through Igor Angulo, who forced a save from Amrinder Singh. The Mumbai custodian, however, had no chance to keep out Glan Martins’ strike just before half-time when he fired in a pile-driver from 35 yards out into the top corner. Goa got its equaliser in the second half when Angulo, played onside by Mourtada Fall, headed in an Alberto Noguera cross from the left. After this, Mumbai began to assert itself but spurned many chances that came its way. Rowllin Borges had three swipes at goal in the second half — he first blazed over the bar, then lost his footing for a simple tap in before poking in an inch-perfect Boumous’ free-kick as the clock struck 90 minutes.   The result: Mumbai City FC 3 (Hugo Boumous 20, Adam le Fondre 26, Rowllin Borges 90) drew with FC Goa 3 (Glan Martins 45, Igor Angulo 51, Ishan Pandita 90+6).   Tuesday’s match: Bengaluru vs ATK Mohun Bagan, 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fc-goa-snatches-a-draw-in-six-goal-thriller/article33787242.ece
09 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Sathiyan eager to tick off his bucket list||Star paddler G. Sathiyan has won quite a few laurels for the country — two International Pro tour titles, the first Indian to break into the world top-25, a men’s team gold in the 2018 Commonwealth Games and a men’s team bronze in the Asian Games. Elusive crown What has, however, eluded him is the men’s singles title at the National table tennis championships. Sathiyan has lost thrice each in the final and in the semifinals. The senior Nationals to be held in Panchkula (Haryana) from February 14 to 23, presents Sathiyan the best chance to win his first title, according to coach S. Raman. Raman, an Olympian and four-time men’s National singles champion, said this is the first time that Sathiyan has spent a considerable (three weeks) time in Chennai to fine-tune his game. “To be honest, it is the first time he (Sathiyan) has spent more time in Chennai. Earlier, he used to play in a pro tour or a pre-Olympics. This time, he has got a reasonable opportunity to train in the city,” said Raman. “In the bio-bubble era where he has to return immediately after playing abroad, it has turned out to be advantageous. He has acclimated to the Indian conditions well. “We are driving the idea that this year we can have a go at the National title given the fact that there are good players. Sathiyan said he will give his best. “Definitely, Nationals is quite an important tournament, which is on my bucket list. I will try my best. This is a special year as due to COVID there are only singles this time and moreover there will be less exposure to the table before we start playing. “It will be a different Nationals, which will be mentally more challenging. We have to adapt quickly to the conditions. “That’s one of the reasons why I got the table so that I can train well,” said Sathiyan, after inaugurating the ‘Sathiyan TT Hall’ at his father’s house, here on Sunday. He expressed his desire of making it a double. “I hope I can tick both my boxes of winning the Nationals and secure a berth for the Olympics,” said Sathiyan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sathiyan-eager-to-tick-off-his-bucket-list/article33787238.ece

09 February 2021||Chennai,||We fought back very well: Ashwin||With India needing 381 on the final day, R. Ashwin said the team has fought back well over the last two days and felt confident of a good show on Tuesday. The off-spinner, who picked up his 28th five-wicket haul and third at his home ground, also said the toss has played a significant role in the match. “When I saw the wicket, I believed it would be a good one to bat on. But I thought it would do a bit more on the first day than what it did. It was really flat and it was a crucial toss [to lose] for us,” said the 34-year-old. “But I think we fought back very well yesterday and today [Sunday and Monday]. If we can have a good fifth day, we will be happy to win this Test,” he added. Surprised Ashwin also said he was surprised by the deterioration of the SG ball over the innings, with the seam unravelling after 40 overs, saying it was “bizarre” and not something he has seen often. Speaking about his partnership with fellow Tamil Nadu player Washington Sundar, Ashwin said, “We believed we could wipe out the follow-on and go on big because we have played on pitches here. We got nicely settled in, but I got one that bounced a bit high. “Washington is a fantastic batsman. I think a lot of people, going by the T20 format, where he plays at No. 7, don't recognise the batting talent. He is quite special,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/have-fought-back-very-well-ashwin/article33787168.ece

09 February 2021||KOLKATA,||Government invitees breach AIFF’s bio-bubble||Around 3000 spectators turned up for the goalless I-League match between Churchill Brothers FC and Real Kashmir FC at the newly inaugurated Kishore Bharati Stadium here on Monday, making it the first competitive match to have attendance after the COVID-19 restrictions were brought into force. The bio-secure bubble mandated by the All India Football Federation does not allow spectators in the galleries but the protocol was seemingly breached by the State Government that owns the stadium. “The spectators were government invitees but we managed to keep the competition arena and other areas in the bio-bubble,” said Sunando Dhar, the CEO, Leagues of AIFF. Compelled The National federation was apparently compelled by the decision of the State Government, which invited a huge gathering, including the media, to witness the inauguration of the new stadium by the state’s Sports Minister, Aroop Biswas. The latest Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) issued by the Union Government allows 50% attendance in the stadiums and the State Government department seemed to be following that in inviting a few thousand in the stadium which has a stated capacity of 14100. The remainder of the I-League will played without spectators according to Dhar. Earlier, Mohammedan Sporting got the better of Gokulam Kerala FC by the odd goal in three (2-1) to pick up its second win, at the Kalyani Municipal Stadium.

09 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Jalaj disappointed there is no Ranji this season||Jalaj Saxena is disappointed that there will be no Ranji Trophy this season. “When I read media reports that the Ranji Trophy was very much on the cards, I began to look forward to it. So, it was very disappointing to learn that the tournament would not be held this season,” Jalaj told The Hindu over phone from Krishnagiri, Wayanad,. Understandable “Since my aim is to play Test cricket, Ranji Trophy is very important to me,” he said. He, however, said it was understandable why the BCCI had taken such a decision, given the pandemic. “It is good, though, that we will have the Vijay Hazare Trophy,” he said. “After the good show in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20s, the entire Kerala team is confident of doing well in the one-day tourney, too.” The Kerala team camp is underway at Krishnagiri. “It is nice to be back here in Wayanad, after playing for India-A against England Lions in the unofficial Test two years ago,” he said. “The camp is going on well under our coach Tinu Yohannan, who works hard with every player.” Jalaj, one of the few all-rounders in the present-day First Class cricket to have scored more than 6,000 runs and taken 300 wickets, said he was happy that his Kerala teammate Sanju Samson was named the captian of Rajasthan Royals. “I enjoyed playing under him at the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament,” he said. “I am looking forward to see him captaining the Royals at the next IPL.” Looking back at Kerala’s campaign, he said defeating giants like Mumbai and Delhi in successive matches was great. “And, what an innings Mohammed Azharuddeen played against Mumbai!” he said. “It was one of the best knocks I have ever seen. I hope Azhar gets picked by an IPL franchise this season, and if he does, I am sure, he will perform.” At Mumbai, Jalaj returned 10 wickets from five matches. It was evident that he had been working on adding variety to his bowling. Adding to arsenal “Though I had been wanting to try out new things I never could find the time earlier. But, during the lockdown I was staying with my brother Jatin (also a First Class cricketer) in Bhilai and we practised with the tennis ball for about three hours every day,” he said. That’s when I got to try out and work on the carrom and reverse-carrom balls, he concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jalaj-disappointed-there-is-no-ranji-this-season/article33787443.ece

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||He controls our actions||With the Lord’s blessing in Adhikarana Saravali, Vedanta Desika explains briefly the concepts found in Ramanujacharya’s Sri Bhashyam, which in turn is a commentary on Sage Vyasa’s Brahma Sutra. He begins Adhikarana Saravali on an auspicious note, with the word ‘svasti, said Veliyanallur T.S.R. Narayanachariar, in a discourse. Desika had a fondness for Lord Varadaraja of Kanchi, but his mangala sloka in Adhikarana Saravali is in praise of Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam. It was Ranganatha who gave Desika the title of Vedantacharya, and it was only natural, that in a work dedicated to explaining Vedanta, the mangala sloka should be in praise of Ranganatha. By authoring Adhikarana Saravali, Desika proved clearly that the title of Vedantacharya was well deserved. In any case, whether it is Ranganatha or Varadaraja, it is none other than Lord Narayana, the pati of Sri Devi. Ramanuja presented His work Vedartha Sangraha in Tirupati. In this work, he refers to the Lord as ‘seshasayee’ — the One reclining on a serpent bed. But, the Lord in Tirumala is in standing posture. But when Ramanuja presented his Sri Bhashyam in Srirangam, he said — Brahmani Srinivase. So there really is no difference whether one speaks of Varadaraja or Srinivasa. They all refer to the Supreme One. All our actions are under His control. Nothing happens without His willing it. Desika’s works too are a result of His will. Such explanations are a matter of delight to Him. We teach a parrot to talk and when it repeats what we say, we are delighted. Likewise, He gave us the power of speech and thought and the ability to express ourselves. And when an Acharya like Desika, blessed by Him, explains Vedanta, the Lord is joyful. Desika establishes that Lord Narayana is the One who grants moksha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/he-controls-our-actions/article33787161.ece

09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Battle-ready, for the web||It was in 2015 that the Supreme Court of India struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, terming it ‘unconstitutional’. Section 66A, through its vague language, was a handy weapon that allowed people to clamp down on any online statement that could be considered “offensive”. Even now, five years after being scrapped by the highest court in the land, the Section is being used to book and arrest people. On January 15 this year, the Delhi-headquartered Internet Freedom Foundation and CivicDataLab launched the Zombie Tracker, an online page monitoring cases filed using the ‘dead’ Section 66A. So far, they have collected data from 11 states in the country. A 2020 report by the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) traced its journey from 2008 to 2020, discovering that the Section is being used against — surprise, surprise — political dissidents. Some people have languished in custody for as long as six months before being given bail, and “the battle against the 66A Zombies,” as the IFF puts it, continues to this day. ‘Obligation and curiosity’ Who are the people fighting these battles for us? Who spends their days poring over civil rights legalese and digital data, to make sure that our rights in the virtual world are kept safe? Like Internet Freedom Foundation’s founder Apar Gupta, digital rights organisations around the country are being spearheaded by like-minded people from various backgrounds including engineering, law, management and international relations. They have banded together out of a sense of obligation and curiosity, often leaving prolific careers to work in donor-funded organisations. As Amber Sinha, executive director of CIS-India (Centre for Internet and Society - India), Bengaluru, puts it, “We try to study how our interests, which earlier existed in an analog world, are changing and reorienting themselves with our digital interactions. The impact that they [these interactions] have on our digital rights; what we need to do to preserve and enhance them… this is one clear focus of our research.” ‘Digital rights’ is a broad term: it can imply the right to privacy and data protection; it can be related to trolling, online threats and hate speech; it can address broader issues of equitable Internet access regardless of economic backgrounds and disabilities. For instance, one of CIS-India’s earliest areas of focus was on the right to knowledge of people with print impairment. It later expanded this to look into how many people are unable to use technology and the Internet because of mental, visual and other impairments. According to Sinha, in 2013, CIS’s “advocacy and research contributed towards India becoming the first nation to adopt the Marrakesh Treaty, which grants major copyright exceptions for the print disabled”. Till date, 65 countries have ratified the treaty, which enables international access and production of special books for the blind and the visually impaired. It was also in 2013 that the Indian government approved a National Policy on Universal Electronic Accessibility, for equal access to electronics and information and communication technologies (ICTs). Sinha also adds that in 2009, CIS-India was the first organisation to call Section 66A ‘unconstitutional’. In 2012, it played a part in the Justice A.P. Shah Committee, which wrote a report on the state of privacy law in India, and made recommendations for privacy guidelines in legislation and policy. CIS’s research on privacy was noted with appreciation in the Puttaswamy and Aadhaar judgments of the Supreme Court in 2017-2018, and its research was also cited by the Srikrishna Committee on data protection in 2018. The Bengaluru-based Aapti Institute, founded by former management consultant Sarayu Natarajan, who has a PhD in political science from King’s College, London. Her alma maters also include Columbia University and National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru. Co-founder Astha Kapoor has experience with the Planning Commission. The institute recently released a report on the gaps in online access to municipal services. Delhi-based Internet Democracy Project looks into developing a feminist approach.  Founding fathers Pranesh Prakash, former (and co-founding) member of CIS-India, recalls how it was created with initial funding from “the billionaire Anurag Dikshit. He got together with Lawrence Liang, who is currently a professor of law at Ambedkar University in Delhi”. On the other hand, Internet Freedom Foundation was born out of the Save The Internet campaign, a volunteer-led initiative that not only fought for net neutrality, but also simplified the complicated issue to make sure ordinary citizens understand how their lives were being directly affected. Today, IFF not only works in advocacy and research, but also provides pro-bono legal aid to Indians fighting for their digital rights in court.  ‘Digital rights’ is a broad term: it can imply the right to privacy and data protection; it can be related to trolling, online threats and hate speech||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/battle-ready-for-the-web/article33787413.ece

09 February 2021||LUCKNOW,||HC dismisses plea on mosque land||The Allahabad High Court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by two Delhi-based sisters claiming ownership over the five-acre land in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village allotted by the Uttar Pradesh government for a mosque and hospital project. Fresh petition A Lucknow Bench of Justices Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Manish Kumar granted the petitioners liberty to file a fresh petition. H.J.S. Parihar, senior advocate who argued the case for the petitioners, said he may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh petition. “In view of the aforesaid, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the aforesaid liberty,” the court said. The State government, through its counsel, had opposed the plea saying the plot allotted for the mosque was different from the one mentioned in the petition. The trust entrusted with building the mosque and hospital quoting a revenue official last Friday also said the same. The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation issued the clarification days after the two women moved the Allahabad High Court claiming the ownership in Sohawal Tehsil of Ayodhya. They claimed their father Gyan Chandra Punjabi had come to India during partition from Punjab and settled in Faizabad (now Ayodhya) district where he was reportedly allotted 28 acres in Dhannipur village by the Nazul Department for five years which he continued to possess beyond that period. Later, his name was included in the revenue records but it was struck down from the records against which their father had filed an appeal before the Additional Commissioner, Ayodhya, which was allowed, they claimed. In the petition, Rani Kapoor alias Rani Baluja and Rama Rani Punjabi demanded that the authorities be restrained from transferring the land to the Sunni Waqf Board till the pendency of the dispute before the settlement officer. IICF secretary Athar Hussain said the land dispute was in neighbouring Sheikhpur Jafar village. Formal construction of the Dhannipur Mosque Project was launched on Republic Day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-dismisses-plea-on-mosque-land/article33787422.ece

Ms. Irani was speaking at a discussion organised on a self-reliant Budget by the Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party and PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry here ‘Nobody slept hungry’ State BJP president Adesh Gupta, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, former State president and MLA Vijender Gupta, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Sanjay Aggarwal were among those in attendance. “The Prime Minister ensured nobody slept hungry during the critical time of the pandemic and the government provided free ration to the poor,” she said. The Minister also took a dig at the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, saying that one party was engaged only in promoting the identity of one family and the other party was busy ensuring it does not honour its own promises. “Congress is today opposing farm laws while its own government in Punjab has made provision for contract farming there,” she alleged. Mr. Gupta alleged that work and projects that should have been completed by the Delhi government are now done by the Union government such as the construction of a bio-park and development of JJ clusters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/budget-takes-care-of-every-section-of-society-smriti-irani/article33787212.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||DDA, civic bodies accountable for illegal use of parks: NGT||Following a plea alleging illegal and unregulated use of parks for commercial purposes, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to maintain vigil and prevent violation of environmental norms. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and civic bodies were also directed to ensure enforcement of existing norms. A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said that in view of Delhi High Court orders prohibiting the use of parks for social, cultural, commercial and marriage functions, the DDA and civic bodies will be held accountable for the violation. “Further direction of installing ETP [Effluent Treatment Plant] is contradictory as such question does not arise if no such social, cultural, commercial or marriage function is to be held in the parks. This needs to be strictly enforced by the Horticulture Department of DDA and the civic bodies,” the Bench said. The tribunal in its order further added: “A plea of DPCC to depend on amendment by DDA is an attempt to avoid responsibility as even without such amendment powers under the EP [Environment Protection] Act and the Water Act override any statute, which cannot stand in the way of enforcement of environmental norms, particularly in view of orders of Delhi High Court, prohibiting use of parks for such functions.” The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by the Budhela Welfare Association, which sought action against the unregulated use of parks for commercial purposes in Vikaspuri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dda-civic-bodies-accountable-for-illegal-use-of-parks-ngt/article33787216.ece
09 February 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi CM’s daughter duped of over Rs. 30K||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s daughter Harshita Kejriwal was allegedly duped of Rs. 34,000 by a person who approached her as a buyer on an e-commerce platform, the police said on Monday. An FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Civil Lines police station. The police said Ms. Kejriwal had put up a sofa for sale on an e-commerce website, following which she was approached by a person, who was interested in buying the item. To check if the bank details shared by Ms. Kejriwal were correct, the accused initially transferred a small amount into her account. Later, he sent a QR code and asked her to scan it so that the amount fixed as per the deal could be transferred to her account. Money deducted twice When she scanned the QR code, Rs. 20,000 got deducted from her account, a senior officer said. When she enquired about it, the man claimed he sent a wrong QR code by mistake and soon sent another link, asking her to do the same. This time, he assured her she would get the deducted amount along with the price for the sofa. But again, an amount of Rs. 14,000 got deducted from her account, he said. “A probe is under way. We are trying to trace the suspect,” the officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-cms-daughter-duped-of-over-rs-30k/article33787217.ece
09 February 2021||New Delhi,||One held for illegal phone exchange, key accused on the run||The police on Monday said they have busted an illegal international telephone exchange running from Old Delhi's Chawri Bazar with the arrest of a 40-year-old man. The accused, Imran Khan, has been running a tools shop for the past 13 years but due to a financial crisis, he provided the space to his uncle, Zulfiqar Ali (47), who used it for the illegal telephone exchange. He also provided a high-speed Wi-Fi connection for the set-up. Ali from Turkman gate in Central Delhi — main accused in the case — is absconding. Ali, also known as Raja in his locality, had taken the proprietorship for the illegal set up under the name of Adeeba Enterprises. He also owns an agency for soft drinks. The matter came to the fore after police received a complaint from the Department of Telecom (DoT) that claimed to have received a tip-off regarding an illegal telecom setup being run by Ali at Choori Walan. The police said calls from foreign countries, including the USA, UAE, Canada, Nepal and Australia, were being terminated illegally to Indian telephone and mobile numbers.  Loss to exchequer The police said international calls can only be terminated in India through DoT licensed operators. The accused was bypassing the legal international gateways thus causing financial loss to the government exchequer, internal long-distance licensees, national long-distance licensees, and access service licensees to the tune of Rs. 60,74,000/day. However, the total financial loss is under calculation. The police suspect that the relatives of the accused may be actively involved in assisting the accused in operating the setup. As per the invoices and documentation accessed, Ali had taken telecom resources from a service provider — Adeeba Enterprises. He had taken the connection on November 26 last year. When the police reached the spot, Ali was not present. The neighbours informed the team that the premise is owned by Ali and occupied by his relative named Yusuf, he said. During the investigation, it emerged that the illegal setup was terminating foreign calls in India by passing the legal international and national gateways and displaying those numbers with an Internet connection. He had also taken 2,500 trunk channels from the service provider as per the documents, an officer said. A laptop was recovered from the spot. “It had apps for remote sharing,” an officer said. The value of recovered items has been estimated to be around Rs. 1 crore approximately. Porbe is under way, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/one-held-for-illegal-phone-exchange-key-accused-on-the-run/article33787206.ece

Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Monday said though international crude prices had witnessed record fall in recent times, the Central government was still selling fuel at a high price. He said the protests on February 11 would be held from 11 a.m. till 1 p.m. “I will lead the march from Abohar against the oppressive policies of the Centre. The Centre has been putting undue financial burden on the common man by hiking prices of petrol, diesel and gas. The government has been blocking the benefit of a decrease in the price of crude oil. The Union government must take measures to control the prices of petroleum products and give relief to the citizens.” “A gas cylinder used to cost Rs. 438 in 2014 when Dr. Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister,” said Mr. Jakhar pointing out that the cost had now crossed Rs. 750. “This too when price of crude oil is almost half than what it used to be in 2014,” said Mr. Jakhar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-cong-to-hold-protest-against-fuel-prices/article33787421.ece
09 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||DPCC told to regulate banquet halls||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to ensure enforcement of directions pertaining to the regulation of banquet halls to curb pollution. Parking amendment Taking note of the Delhi Development Authority’s stand that regulations for parking had to be amended, the NGT observed that such regulations of the urban body cannot stand in the way of compliance of environmental norms. A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “With regard to the stand that the DDA has to amend its regulation for parking, it may be noted that the regulations of the DDA cannot stand in the way of compliance of environmental norms which can be enforced even without the DDA amendment in view of the fact that the provisions of [relevant environmental laws], override in case of conflict with any other statute and environmental norms may thus be strictly enforced as already directed.” The tribunal disposed the plea by directing the DPCC to regulate the banquet halls and enforce directions of both the DPCC and the NGT. Remedial action The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Deepak Datta seeking remedial action against illegal running of banquet halls in Shivaji Marg. The plea alleged that the banquet halls were operating without statutory consent and were in violation of the environmental norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dpcc-told-to-regulate-banquet-halls/article33787202.ece

Ex-MLA Alka Lamba said over 2 lakh cases relating to assaults and harassment on women and girl children are pending in the 55 Fast Track and POCSO courts in Delhi. She said each of these courts is under pressure to deal with 4,500 cases with only 37 government lawyers. In short, she alleged that each lawyer has to tackle 6,500 cases.

Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress president Amrita Dhawan said harassment and assaults on women are rising daily. She also criticised the Delhi Commission for Women for its toothless functioning. “Women’s safety seems to be just an election stunt for AAPas after coming to power, it blames the police and the Union Home Ministry for the rising crimes,” Ms. Dhawan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/congress-hits-out-at-aap-govt-on-womens-safety/article33787221.ece

The air carrier had earlier stopped flights to the popular tourist destination amid losses on the route because of high cost and low passenger load during the COVID-19 pandemic. The alliance of stakeholders, including hotel and desert resort owners, taxi operators, tour operators and guide associations, has offered to reduce the airline's business risk through a new model. According to the agreement, the operational cost of flights will be calculated for 15 days and losses will be borne by local businessmen. A guarantee fund of Rs. 84 lakh has also been created to facilitate resumption of flights from February 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bid-to-boost-tourism-in-jaisalmer/article33787423.ece
09 February 2021||February 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Reddit app installs exceed 6 million||Social networking website Reddit (AKA the ‘front page of the Internet’) hit 6.6 million app installs worldwide last month, making January its best-ever month. The app gained significant traction last week as individual investors coordinated on the platform to buy shares of GameStop Corp, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, and BlackBerry, and squeeze hedge funds that had bet big on the struggling companies to tank. Reddit’s installs rose over 40% last month, compared to 4.6 million installs in December last year, according to app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. The app grew about 128% in January, compared with the same period in the previous year. The app has about 122 million installs globally from both Google Play store and Apple’s App Store. Most of these downloads, including in-app purchase revenue, comes from the U.S., which accounts for nearly 46% of the total installs. According to Sensor Tower, U.S. consumers represent more than a third of total spending in the app to date. The California-based company’s monthly active users grew more than 50% in January compared to the previous year. This trend is likely to continue, the research marketing agency estimates. However, the pace of Reddit’s continued growth may depend on how many users it can retain after the conversation dies down around the platform’s role in last month’s stock market disruption, the app intelligence firm added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reddit-app-installs-exceed-6-million/article33787415.ece
