11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Both sides disengaging from Pangong lake area, says China||China’s military announced on Wednesday that frontline troops of India and China had begun disengaging in a “synchronised and organised” manner from the north and south banks of Pangong lake, where both sides have been locked in a stand-off for months which, an official source in Delhi said, was the first step in the long process of disengagement and de-escalation. This restarts the stalled process of disengagement in the most protracted military stand-offs between India and China in decades that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese casualties at Galwan last year. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh would make a statement in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday on the situation in Ladakh,, his office tweeted. This is the first phase of disengagement with some tanks and armoured elements on the south bank being withdrawn as well as thinning down of troops on the north bank, a Government of India source said. However, troops continue to remain in key positions. It would be a multi-step process for disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control and would take time, said a second government source. People’s Liberation Army Senior Colonel Wu Qian, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, said in a statement issued in Beijing: “The Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern banks of Pangong Tso start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10. This move is in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the 9th round of China-India Corps Commander-Level Meeting.” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a statement: “According to the consensus reached at the Chinese and Indian Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Moscow and the ninth round of commander-level talks between the two sides, the frontline troops of the Chinese and Indian militaries began to conduct simultaneous and planned disengagement in the Pangong lake area on February 10. We hope the Indian side will work with China to meet each other halfway, strictly implement the consensus reached between the two sides and ensure the smooth implementation of the disengagement process.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/both-sides-disengaging-from-pangong-lake-area-says-china/article33805935.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao lost his cool at a public meeting at Haliya on Wednesday when some people tried to distract his speech by waving papers. “Stay calm or just leave, no one would be affected if you are trying to disturb. There will be many dogs like you,” an annoyed Chief Minister said of the few who tried to distract him. “You are not even a handful, you will be turned into dust,” he said, and ordered the police to remove them . Mr. Rao, at the same time, noted that leaders from Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party in recent times were behaving as if they have lost control. He described the BJP leaders as “new beggars”, and said they should not indulge in senseless activities and disturb the atmosphere, but organise a public meeting for the people to decide. “There are limits to patience, if you cross them, we know what we should do,” he warned. The Chief Minister also cautioned people to be aware of “political jackals”. Lashing out at the Congress, he said the grand old party was responsible for the backwardness of Nalgonda. He said development programmes of the government like Mission Kakatiya were labelled as “ projects for commissions”. While the TRS was Rythu Bandhu, the Chief Minister termed Congress as “rabandhu (vultures), under whose regimes farmers committed suicide. “Loot was yours, blame is on us,” he said of the Congress leaders.  “There are limits to patience, if you cross them, we know what we should do.” K.

11 February 2021||CHENNAI,||T.N. parties divided over postal ballots||Representatives of major political parties in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday urged the visiting team of the Election Commission of India (ECI), led by Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, to hold the Assembly election in a single phase. However, opinion was divided on allowing voters aged above 80 and the differently-abled to cast postal ballots. As of January 20, Tamil Nadu had over 6.24 crore eligible voters, including 12,98,406 persons aged above 80. Mr. Arora, along with Election Commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar, met the representatives of nine parties in Chennai. They also held a meeting with the District Election Officers, the Superintendents of Police and senior officials to review preparedness. “Since it would be hot in May, we requested the Commission to hold the Assembly election in the fourth week of April,” AIADMK leader and Deputy Assembly Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman told journalists. The AIADMK preferred single-phase polling and welcomed postal ballots for the elderly who are unable to make it to the polling booths. Mr. Jayaraman justified spending on government advertisements ahead of the election. DMK MP R.S. Bharathi, who raised the issue of the six representations the party had submitted to Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Satyabrata Sahoo, said, “He [the CEC] instructed the CEO to reply to the complaint within three days.” The party was prepared to face the election “even tomorrow”. The DMK sought security at Madhavaram, where EVMs from several Assembly constituencies would be stored. Mr. Bharathi complained about government spending on advertisements. The Congress, too, preferred single-phase polling. “We wanted the election observers to be from other States,” said its vice-president R Damodaran. He also wanted adequate paramilitary forces deployed across the State and the counting completed within 10 days of polling. He felt that postal ballots for the elderly would lead to malpractices.  The Commission will hold meetings with Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan and senior officials on Thursday before leaving for Puducherry. The Congress, too, preferred single-phase polling. “We wanted the election observers to be from other States,” said its vice-president R Damodaran. He also wanted adequate paramilitary forces deployed across the State and the counting completed within 10 days of polling. He felt that postal ballots for the elderly would lead to malpractices. BJP leader K.T. Raghavan placed a set of demands, including web-casting from all polling stations and avoiding election on Tamil New Year Day. He urged the Commission to exercise caution on postal ballots as there were chances of irregularities. “We have not totally rejected it,” he said. CPI(M) leader T.K. Rangarajan said his party favoured national political consultations to decide on postal ballots for the elderly. The party called for increasing CCTV networks during the election. CPI representative Mu. Veerapandian urged the Commission to restrain the government from conducting functions closer to the election and sought implementation of the Indrajit Gupta Committee’s recommendations on electoral reforms. The CPI was against postal ballots for the elderly. B. Parthasarathy, representing the DMDK, complained about the allotment of certain symbols to independents, which closely resembled his party’s ‘murasu’ (nagara) symbol. It wanted the Commission to disallow parties from making “unimplementable” promises. NCP representative G.P. Sarathy preferred a return to ballot papers, while Trinamool Congress’s A. Kalaivanan sought updating of the electoral rolls. The Commission will hold meetings with Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan and senior officials on Thursday before leaving for Puducherry.

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi bats for reforms, invites farmers for discussions again||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday once again invited the protesting farmers to the negotiating table to discuss the three contentious farm laws. Responding to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to both Houses of Parliament, he termed, in the Lok Sabha, the protest as “pure”. During his more than 90-minute speech, first the Congress and later the Trinamool Congress and the DMK staged walkouts. The laws, Mr. Modi said, were a response to the need to introduce reforms to avert the crisis that was looming over the agricultural sector and sought to provide alternatives to farmers for a market for their products. Mr. Modi made a strong pitch for reforms, ending status quoism regarding many sectors of policy and negotiating a strong space for India in what he called “a new world order” that was unfolding in the post COVID-19 era. PM clarifies Clarifying on his coinage of the word andolan jeevi (professional agitator) when he spoke in the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Modi differentiated them from what he said were andolankaris, or agitators, among farmers whose specific issue was with regard to the three laws. “I consider the farmers agitation as pure, but when andolan jeevis join them, what happens? Placards of rioters, those in jail for violence pop in these protests. Toll plazas are public property; to capture them, is this part of a ‘pure agitation’? When telecom towers are broken in Punjab, is that commensurate with the aims of the farmers with regard to these laws?” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modi-makes-a-strong-pitch-for-reforms-invites-farmers-again/article33805932.ece
11 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Govt. will leave no stone unturned to stop VSP privatisation: Vijaya Sai||YSRCP general secretary and Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy has said that the State government will leave no stone unturned to stop the proposed privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). Protests were organised at the steel plant gate and near the Mahatma Gandhi statue near the GVMC administrative building on Wednesday. The protesters blamed the successive governments for the present crisis in the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, saying that it was set up after relentless struggles by the people. Speaking at a hunger strike launched by MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar against the Centre’s plan of disinvesting the steel plant, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider the proposal and suggested alternatives to make the steel plant profitable. The VSP, which was initially under the purview of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), was moved out of it.  “The successive governments at the Centre have deliberately avoided sanctioning captive mines to the plant with the idea of privatising it. Now, the issue calls for an apolitical fight. The YSRCP is ready to wage a struggle to champion the cause. Allocation of captive mines there by stabilising the production and conversion of loans into equity can help the VSP achieve profits within six years,” said Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy. He called for revival, restructuring and reorganisation as the key to keep the plant going. Referring to the suggestion of CPI (M) leader Ch. Narasinga Rao that a hunger strike should be organised to exert pressure on the Centre, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said that the YSRCP leaders would take permission of the Chief Minister and participate in it. At his hunger strike camp, Mr. Ganesh Kumar said that people would not forgive the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if he went ahead with the proposal of raising Rs. 2 lakh crore on the plea of ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-will-leave-no-stone-unturned-to-stop-vsp-privatisation-vijaya-sai/article33805867.ece
11 February 2021||Kolkata,||BJP’s ‘parivartan yatra’ an insult to Hindu religion: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday exhorted the people of the State not to bother the candidates fielded by the Trinamool Congress but to vote for her in the coming Assembly polls. She targeted the BJP’s “parivartan yatra” by calling it an insult to the Hindu religion. Ms. Banerjee addressed two gatherings in the day — the first at Raiganj in Uttar Dinjapur district and the second in Malda district. Speaking at a workers’ convention at Malda, she said the ‘raths’ have facilities like “10-star hotels” and BJP leaders travelled in them because they think they are “gods”. “I pull the ISKCON ‘ratha’ every time. Whenever I go to Puri, I pray to Lord Jagannath. The daitapatis [bodyguards of Jagannath] of Puri also come to my house and offer prayers. We know all this… But the BJP leaders are now proclaiming themselves to be Jagannath, Balaram, Subhadra, Sri Krishna, Arjun,” she said. She asked whether BJP leaders were driving the chariot of Ravana. “Ravana also abducted Sita in a chariot. Are you driving that chariot as well?” she asked. The BJP has flagged off two “parivartan yatas” in the State, both by party president J.P. Nadda on February 6 from Nabadwip in Nadia and February 9 from Tarapith in Birbhum . Union Home Minister Amit Shah is likely to flag off more such ‘yatras’ across the State on Friday. The ‘yatras’ brought out by the BJP, resembling “raths (chariots)”, are colourful buses that will travel across the State. The BJP has plans to flag off five such ‘yatras’ across the State. “The way you [the BJP] are insulting the Hindu religion, people will not forgive you,” Ms. Banerjee said. She accused the BJP of trying to incite “communal riots” in the State. Imploring the people that the coming elections are “my vote”, Ms. Banerjee said that people should not give too much importance to the candidates fielded by the party. “This is my vote ... Vote for me if you love me. I will nominate candidates who will not defect. For those who have defected I can say that it was good riddance,” she said at Raiganj. During the 2016 Assembly polls, when her party was facing the heat of the Naradha sting videos, Ms. Banerjee repeatedly said she was the candidate in all the 294 seats. She added that despite working for the people of Malda, her party had not much success in the district, but she would not go “empty-handed” this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjps-parivartan-yatra-an-insult-to-hindu-religion-mamata/article33806083.ece
11 February 2021||MYSURU,||Plaster from ceiling falls; three students hurt||Three students of Maharaja’s College here suffered minor injuries when the plaster of the ceiling of a classroom fell on them while they were preparing to write an exam around 11.30 a.m on Wednesday. They were taken to a private hospital and provided treatment. One of the students suffered a head injury and he was sent home after treatment. All of them are out of danger. The three are MSc students of the Department of Forensic Science and Criminology and the exam was being conducted in a classroom on the first floor of the two-storeyed building which, according to officials of the University of Mysore, is over a century old. While Vishal suffered a head injury, Salim and Yeshwanth received minor injuries. The panicked students rushed out of the classroom after chunks of plaster started falling. The scheduled exam was put off following the incident. Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar visited the hospital and enquired about the students’ health. He told the college principal to shift all classes being run in the building to another building (possibly a building of University Evening College) until further instructions. “The building where the incident occurred was identified for renovation and the works were supposed to have carried out on the ground floor. All steps will be taken for the safety of students. The university engineers have been called to assess the condition of the classrooms,” he told The Hindu.  Meanwhile, Mr. Hemantha Kumar asked the university engineering division to conduct an audit of all the varsity buildings that are 100 years old and submit a report to him soon. As the buildings are heritage property, they could be conserved only as per the guidelines recommended for the conservation of heritage buildings, and without altering their heritage value. Registrar Shivappa, who inspected the classroom, said the three students were doing fine. In the wake of the incident, some students reportedly refused to write the exam, arguing that the classrooms were unsafe and demanded that classes be shifted to other buildings. Wednesday’s classes of the department were also suspended after the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/plaster-from-ceiling-falls-three-students-injured/article33805975.ece
11 February 2021||New Delhi,||Twitter must follow Indian laws: Centre||With the government and Twitter at loggerheads over issues related to content removal and freedom of expression, the Centre on Wednesday expressed “deep disappointment” over the microblogging platform’s partial compliance of its orders “grudgingly” and with substantial delay. In a videoconference with Twitter’s vice-president of global public policy Monique Meche and deputy general counsel and vice- president (legal) Jim Baker, Information Technology Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney said while Twitter was free to formulate its own rules and guidelines, Indian laws, which are enacted by Parliament, must be followed irrespective of Twitter’s own rules, according to a Ministry statement. An official source told The Hindu that during the meeting, requested by Twitter, it was informed that the government expected full compliance of the blocking orders and that it was unlikely to revisit the list.Twitter, however, said that no action had been taken against the accounts of news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians. “To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law. We informed MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) of our enforcement actions today, February 10, 2021,” it said. The meeting follows a blog post by Twitter, where it said it withheld “a portion of the accounts identified in the blocking orders given by the government”. The firm has been under fire over non-compliance to block 250 accounts using hashtags related to “farmer genocide”, and about 1,178 accounts that security agencies suspect are backed by Khalistani sympathisers and Pakistan. In a blog post, Twitter said it had taken enforcement actions, including permanent suspension of accounts in certain cases, against over 500 accounts escalated across all MeitY orders for clear violations of Twitter’s Rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/twitter-acts-against-over-500-accounts/article33805946.ece
11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC orders status quo on INS Viraat dismantling||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered status quo on the dismantling of the Navy’s decommissioned aircraft carrier, INS Viraat . A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Union of India and Shree Ram Group of Industries, who were arraigned as respondents in the special leave petition filed by Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Vishnukant Sharma and Rupali Vishnukant Sharma. “In the meantime, parties are directed to maintain status quo with regard to dismantling/breaking of the subject-ship known as INS Viraat , as on date,” the SC ordered. Museum proposal Envitech had earlier approached the Bombay High Court with a request to buy the decommissioned Viraat so that it could be converted into a maritime museum and a multifunctional adventure centre. The High Court had asked the government to take an appropriate call. The warship is currently awaiting dismantling at the ship-breaking yard at Alang in Gujarat. “The hull is still intact,” Ms. Rupali Sharma, appearing in person, submitted before the Bench. The petitioners have argued that Viraat , which was the oldest serving warship at the time of its decommissioning, should not be sold as scrap. In the High Court, the Centre had reportedly said that the 67-year-old ship, which had served the Navy for about three decades, was sold to the Gujarat-based Shree Ram Group, a ship-breaking firm, which won the bid. It had said that communications to various States for proposals on the ship were unanswered. The government, it was reported, had suggested in the High Court that the petitioners could approach the Shree Ram Group with a proposal to purchase the ship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-orders-status-quo-on-ins-viraat-dismantling/article33806101.ece
11 February 2021||KALABURAGI,||Anand Singh cannot be in charge of Ballari: Somashekara Reddy||The notification of Vijayanagar district as a separate district, carved out of Ballari, has led to another round of power struggle. On Wednesday, MLA for Ballari G. Somashekara Reddy urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to relieve Infrastructure Development and Haj and Wakf Minister B.S. Anand Singh of the responsibility of being Ballari in-charge minister. At an interaction with presspersons in Ballari on Wednesday, Mr. Reddy said people of Ballari would never accept Mr. Singh, whom he held responsible for the bifurcation of the district, as their in-charge Minister. “We [all MLAs from Ballari] are going to meet the Chief Minister and request him to do so,” Mr. Reddy said. When asked whether he had any specific person in mind for the post, Mr. Reddy said that his preference was Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu. “We will demand the Chief Minister to replace Mr. Singh with Mr. Sriramulu. If that is not possible, let the Chief Minister choose somebody else from outside... Emperor Krishnadevaraya expanded Vijayanagara Empire. Mr. Singh has, however, shrunk it to only five taluks. If the district was united, we all would have gained greater strength. The shrinking process appears to continue and Hampi alone may become a district in the days to come,” Mr. Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/anand-singh-cannot-be-in-charge-of-ballari-somashekara-reddy/article33806190.ece
11 February 2021||Pune/Mumbai,||Koshyari under fire for delay in appointing 12 MLCs||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday took a veiled jibe at Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over the latter’s delay in announcing the names of the 12 nominees to the Legislative Council from the Governor’s quota, wryly remarking that he hoped the government would not have to go to court on this account. “The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had prepared a list of 12 nominees in adherence to the Constitution. The list has been sent to the Governor. But Mr. Koshyari has not yet made a decision even after two months. He is expected to announce the names soon. So, I don't think he will let us go to court on this,” Mr. Pawar said in Nashik. While the term of legislators (from the Governor’s quota) in the Upper House of the State legislature had already expired in June last year, the three MVA partners — Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress — had deferred sending its list of nominees until November in a bid to avoid friction with the Governor owing to the raging COVID-19 situation. The Congress cautioned Mr. Koshyari to not overstep the Constitution. “The State Cabinet has cleared the names of 12 individuals and sent the list to Mr. Koshyari. If he has any problem with those names then he can point out those issues or send the proposal back. But he is doing neither of them and not taking any decision,” Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap said. Mr. Jagtap said that even though the pandemic had reduced the work load for Mr. Koshyari, he must not have found time to clear the file in between his meetings with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and actors such as Kangana Ranaut. “He was visiting Goa and may have had other appointments. But he should not overstep the Constitution and do what the Constitution tells him to do,” he said. The BJP on the other hand came out in support of Mr. Koshyari. “We are confident that the Governor will take the right decision,” former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Mr. Fadnavis further said that instead of telling Mr. Koshyari what to do, the ministers in the State government should behave while speaking about the constitutional head of Maharashtra. “First, mind your language while speaking about him and only then make demands,” the BJP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/koshyari-under-fire-for-delay-in-appointing-12-mlcs/article33806416.ece

Bobde issued notice to Vikas Kharge, Principal Secretary, Department of Revenue and Forests, Mumbai, and other Maharashtra Forest Department officials on a contempt petition filed by activist and petitioner-in-person Sangeeta Dogra. “They should be no celebrations or rewards... On this, we issue notice,” Chief Justice Bobde orally observed. The court also decided to examine the claim that the tigress was really a man-eater. Ms. Dogra had submitted that human nails, hair and teeth were not found inside the animal during the autopsy. The court asked Ms. Dogra to establish her claim. It also asked for the autopsy report. “We want to see a clear finding that human hair, nails, teeth do not disintegrate within six months,” Chief Justice Bobde said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tigress-avni-killing-sc-issues-notice-to-state-officials/article33806414.ece

11 February 2021||New Delhi,||Deceased farmer’s kin move HC, seek SIT probe||The grandfather of a 25-year-old farmer, who died during the tractor rally on Republic Day, moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking a court-monitored Special Investigating Team (SIT) probe into the incident. The plea, which is listed for hearing before Justice Yogesh Khanna on Thursday, states that the circumstances in which Navreet Singh lost his life are “highly suspicious”. According to the plea, “eyewitness statements corroborated by medical opinion do not rule out that the petitioner’s grandson was shot by policemen”. ‘No investigation’ “The Delhi police have without any inquiry or investigation hastily prejudged the cause of death by declaring that the petitioner’s grandson died in an accident and there were no bullets fired,” says the petition filed by 69-year-old Hardeep Singh. The plea filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Soutik Banerjee, Mannat Tipnis and Devika Tulsiani alleges that “the post-mortem report of the petitioner’s grandson, while stopping short of mentioning that firearm injuries were present on the body, describes the wounds in a manner that irresistibly suggests that there is a high possibility of him having received a gunshot/firearm injury”. It also contends that X-rays conducted prior to the post-mortem by District Hospital, Rampur, were not shared with the petitioner’s family, nor was the video of the post-mortem shared, “despite its request”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/deceased-farmers-kin-moves-hc-for-sit-probe/article33806105.ece

Varavara Rao. Arsenal Consulting, which was roped in by the American Bar Association to examine a clone of the hard disk of Mr. Wilson’s computer, stated that a hacker controlled his computer for 22 months to plant documents, which led to an investigation that supposedly unravelled a Communist Party of India (Maoist) conspiracy to eliminate Prime Minister Narendra Modi “in another Rajiv Gandhi type incident”. A copy of the report is with The Hindu . The report is part of the writ filed by Mr. Wilson in the Bombay High Court. It explains how a hacker exploited the IP addresses provided by one ‘Host Sailor’ and used proxy servers to plant a “trojan horse NetWire”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jailed-activist-rona-wilsons-computer-was-compromised/article33805933.ece

He flagged off the BJP’s second “Parivartan Yatra” and accused the Trinamool Congress government of “autocratic behaviour”. “Those who win in the name of Maa Maati Maanush [mother, land and people – Trinamool’s slogan], indulge in autocratic behaviour, corruption and extortion,” he told party workers at Kalaikunda. The BJP president again raised the issue of the non-implementation of Central schemes like the Ayushman Bharat and the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, and accused the Mamata Banerjee government of coming in the way of development.

The total death toll stands at 34. “...The tunnel is still approachable till about 120 metres. More slush and water coming from inside the tunnel,” the ITBP had tweeted on Wednesday morning. Armed with cutting and drilling equipment, the team could move barely 20 metres ahead in the entire day and was yet to reach the T-point junction where the workers were earlier suspected to be trapped. “NTPC officials have said that there is another tunnel about 12 metres underneath where the workers may be located. We may have to create an access route by drilling, which will consume more time,” said an official deployed at the project site for the past four days. A total of 170 persons, including the trapped workers, are still untraced. “After the mishap, 206 people were said to be missing from different places. Two of them informed the authorities on Tuesday that they were safe. Search teams have so far recovered 34 bodies. Therefore, the total number of missing persons is now 170,” said the police officer posted in Chamoli. Among the missing persons, 70 are from different parts of Uttarakhand, 66 from Uttar Pradesh, 13 from Jharkhand, 11 from Nepal, nine each from Bihar and Himachal Pradesh, six each from Punjab and West Bengal, four from Madhya Pradesh, three from Assam, two each from Delhi and Odisha, and one each from Haryana and J&K.

11 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Furnace oil from Titanium factory spills into sea||An emergency clean-up was launched along the coast on Wednesday to mitigate the fallout of a furnace oil leak into the sea from the Kerala government undertaking Travancore Titanium Products Ltd. (TTP) at Kochuveli near the State capital. TTP officials put the spillage, caused by a rupture in a pipeline carrying the furnace oil, at roughly 5,000 litres. After the alarm was raised in the morning, the district administration declared the coastal stretches along Shanghumughom, Vettucaud, and Veli off-limits to the public and tourists for two days. Fishing banned Fishing activities along these regions also stand banned as a precautionary measure, District Collector Navjot Khosa said. Local residents, largely comprising the fishing community, have expressed outrage over the oil leak, blaming the TTP for negligence. They alleged that the oil leak would have a prolonged impact on marine resources, and consequently, their livelihood. The leakage occurred around 7 a.m., but it had gone unnoticed at the time. The oil spilled out into a drain that opens out into the nearby beach, contaminating the beach and coastal waters. The leak was promptly plugged once the alarm was raised around 8 a.m., TTP officials said. Probe ordered Dr. Khosa, who visited TTP and the affected coastal stretch, said the situation was under control. She has ordered an investigation by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB). The PCB study will also cover the possible fallout of the oil leak. On its part, the TTP too has ordered an internal investigation. A preliminary survey has revealed that the oil spill is largely confined to near-shore waters and the beach. As a troubleshooting measure, the topsoil along the affected stretch of coast would be removed, the collector said. The Indian Coast Guard is closely monitoring the situation using a ship and a Dornier aircraft. The leak was reportedly discovered by fishers in the densely populated neighbourhood on Wednesday morning. The fishing community has demanded urgent measures to clean up the beach and the coastal waters. They fear that the oil leak will have a prolonged impact on fishing activities unless prompt measures are initiated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/furnace-oil-from-titanium-factory-spills-into-sea/article33805866.ece
11 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘India, China agree to return to pre-April 2020 positions’||China and India have agreed to return to the pre-April 2020 positions in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), according to the latest disengagement plan being implemented on the ground, The Hindu has learned. A senior official said the agreement effectively means that China will vacate the Finger area on the north bank of Pangong Tso (lake) and India will have to climb down from the advantageous position it has taken on the southern side of the lake. Depsang and Charding Ninglung Nallah (CNN) junction in Demchok sector are not part of the current disengagement plan and will be discussed in the next meeting. The official said efforts to implement the consensus reached after the ninth round of the Corps Commander level talks on January 24 have picked up in the past two days. “The ground commanders are meeting twice a day and we are hopeful of achieving a pre-April 2020 status in all sectors,” the official said. The official said reduction of troops will be visible on the ground in the next two or three days. “After the Corps Commanders meeting, the disengagement plan was approved by the government. There will be simultaneous withdrawal on both the banks of Pangong Tso. In the north bank, India will move back to DS Post where the troops had earlier started their patrols. But a little caution is required and whether China matches words with actions is to be seen,” the official said. Dismantling camps Not only troops but mechanised armoured elements and temporary structures, such as tents and camps, will also be removed. Explaining the details, the official said, “If the troops have to move from point A to B, then preparations have to be made at point B where the troops will recede. We are synchronising the plan with the Chinese troops. The Southern bank, where Indian troops are in a dominant position since August 2020, is a big pressure point for the Chinese.” India and China have been engaged in a face-off in various pockets in eastern Ladakh since April last year after China stopped Indian patrols in the Finger area of Pangong Tso. The troops have not been able to patrol beyond Finger 4 since the last week of April 2020 after China had ingressed about 8 km. Earlier, the troops could patrol up to Finger 8. The other areas where the buildup continues are the Depsang plains, Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and the south bank of Pangong.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-agree-to-return-to-pre-april-2020-positions/article33805884.ece
11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre has great respect for farmers: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the government had great respect for farmers due to which it had been holding talks with them on the three farm laws. “Even now I say, if they have specific clauses that they have a problem with and a way can be found, the laws can be amended,” Mr. Modi said in his reply in the Lok Sabha to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address. Mr. Modi went on about the nature of the three laws which, he said, were not “coercive” or seeking to deny access to resources, but a way of providing alternatives to farmers in terms of market access. “Ever since the laws were cleared, not one single ‘mandi’ has shut down, we have allocated funds for ‘mandi’ modernisation, minimum support prices (MSP) have been hiked and record government procurement done,” he asserted. The Opposition was questioning the need for the laws since “nobody had asked for the reforms”. “That is a very feudal attitude of doing things only after citizens become supplicants. Citizens should not supplicants, they must be empowered. My government is a forward looking progressive one. Passing the triple ‘talaq’ law wasn’t asked for but we did it for the benefit of our sisters, anti-dowry laws as well, no one demanded the Kisan Samman Nidhi, or free gas connections, or toilets. The government must have a progressive attitude,” he said. “The status quo mentality will destroy the country. Agriculture is the basis of much of our economy and culture, our festivals are tied to agricultural cycles. We cannot neglect the sector and must do something now. As our population rises, land fragmentation will increase. We must, therefore, reform the sector and ensure that our farmers have the options to sell and grow their crops. Our ‘annadata’ [food providers] should be prosperous and its our responsibility to give them the opportunity to be so,” he stated. Defends private sector Responding to criticism by the Opposition that the reforms and government’s policies will only benefit crony capitalists, he said that the private sector was an important part of the economy and Opposition leaders should not abuse them without basis. “Do you want to hand over the country to bureaucrats, an IAS to run a pharma company? India has made great strides in mobile manufacturing, we have the cheapest data rates in the world, the pharma industry supplying COVID-19 vaccines and other medicines to the world is also largely private. We must learn to trust our youth, wealth creators are also important,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-has-great-respect-for-farmers-pm/article33805879.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Himalayas host to complex processes’||On February 7, a flash flood hurtled down in Chamoli, Uttarakhand killing many and destroying two hydropower projects. The trigger for the floods is believed to be either a glacial lake being breached or a broken mountain peak falling on a glacier. Scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun were among the first teams of experts to leave for an examination of the causes of the disaster. Kalachand Sain , Director, WIHG, says it was large rock falling on a hanging glacier that precipitated the avalanche and flood. He also highlighted the challenges of accessing the glacier because of which it could be months before the exact cause that triggered the rockfall could be determined.  The Wadia Institute has sent a team of scientists to explore the causes of the flash flood. What have they found so far? A team of five immediately left for the spot. They have made some measurements of the topography near the locations but access is difficult. They also undertook an aerial survey. What we know so far is almost entirely based on an analysis of satellite imagery, with some ground observations. Ground-based measurements are critical to supplement this but the prevailing conditions aren’t conducive. These are glaciers at an elevation of 5,000-6,000 metres. Himachal Pradesh has 10,000 glaciers, Uttarakhand has 1,000 glaciers — and all are in extremely inhospitable locations. Normally, access to these regions is only possible in the summer, and it’s not easy even then. That’s why our knowledge of glaciers is limited and this is inadequate. That makes satellite analysis or aerial surveys critical but they have their limitations. What does your preliminary analysis suggest? We are about 90% certain that this was caused by a combination of a large piece of rock, possibly from a mountain peak, breaking off. This was probably part of the Raunthi/Mrigudhani mountain. It fell on a hanging glacier, probably perched off a cliff. The impact from the falling rock broke it [the glacier] and this mass of rock and ice debris avalanched over a nearly 40 degree slope for two kilometres before falling onto the Raunthi Gadhera stream floor. There was thus a huge mass of rock, ice and other debris that stayed that way for a while. It looks like it stayed that way for three days and the ice and snow started to melt from the heat. It was a clear sky. Eventually, the pressure created by the volume of water and other debris forced its way down the valley and led to the flooding and deluge. This was different from a situation like Kedarnath in 2013. There, multiple cloudbursts in June led to a torrent of snow and water that resulted in a flash flood. (This resulted in widespread destruction in Uttarakhand and the loss of nearly 5,700 lives, along with damaged hydropower tunnels as well as destruction of livestock and property.) What made the mountain peak break? This is still to be determined. What is likely is that this is a result of decades of freezing and thawing that would have led to weaknesses and cracks forking in those mountain structures. It was not a sudden event, and this underlines the reasons of why we need to keep monitoring the Himalayas. They are fragile and host to several complex processes that need to be monitored. Global warming contributes to the weakening of the glaciers and we need several organisations and specialists working on these aspects to monitor, make models and thereby make predictive forecasts that can warn of such occurrences in the future. We need some ground-based measurements and we have already made a scientific  plan to be able to access these mountains in the summer. We will have to investigate if there was some tectonic activity, or a blast from somewhere higher up that triggered fault-lines. We don’t know yet and it will take some time to establish that. But imagine a heap of rice. If the base is not strong and grains accumulate, there will at some point be single rice grain, that when added to the heap, will cause it to crumble. So we have to determine structural weaknesses too. Do such accidents show that it’s foolhardy to construct hydropower projects in Uttarakhand beyond a certain elevation? Ideally, before projects are conceived, there are expert assessments done and these are expected to be followed.  Normally, access to these regions is only possible in the summer, and it’s not easy even then||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/himalayas-host-to-complex-processes/article33805891.ece

The NCRB does not maintain this data on the basis of religion, race, caste or gender,” the Minister stated. In another reply, the Minister stated that in the year 2019, as many as 96 persons were arrested for sedition (Section 194A IPC) but only two were convicted and 29 persons were acquitted. Of the 93 cases of sedition, the chargesheet was filed in 40 cases the same year. When asked about the steps taken to strengthen the sedition law in the country, the Minister stated, “Amendment of laws is an ongoing process.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/22-uapa-cases-from-2016-to-2019-ended-in-conviction/article33805896.ece
11 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Govt. speaks Mann Ki Baat but won’t hear Kisan ki Baat’||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday took up the discussion on the Budget with Congress leader Kapil Sibal leading the attack from the Opposition. He hit out at the government saying they want to speak only their “Mann ki Baat” and not listen to “Kisan ki Baat”. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim in the House on Monday that the MSP will remain untouched, Mr. Sibal asked, “You claim that the new laws will ensure that the farmers will get more than the MSP. Then what is the problem, why don’t you put this in the law?” The agricultural reforms that the Modi government has brought in have already been tested in America and Europe, which resulted into corporatisation of farming killing the small farmers, he said. “In 2020, American farmers were saddled with bankruptcy of more than Rs. 425 billion. This is corporatisation of farming and the result of corporatisation. In fact, the rate of suicide in rural America is about 45% higher than that in urban America. Small farm lands have disappeared,” he said. And unlike the U.S., in India 40-60% are involved in agriculture and therefore the government should have had consultations before bringing in the laws. “The problem is you are not listening to ‘Mann ki Baat’ of farmers. You always talk about your ‘Mann ki Baat’. What are farmers asking? Farmers are asking for MSP law...,” Mr. Sibal said. When corporations ask for tax relief and exemptions, the government gives them. “But when farmers ask for MSP, you are not ready to give. Poor farmers are asking minimum, you give maximum to corporates...,” he said. He also slammed the government for what it called “perpetuating a rigged economic system” and data jugglery. He said the Budget was bereft of any thought for the poor and the unemployed. Mr. Sibal said, “There are four-five big boys who own almost all assets in this country, and one very big boy is everywhere. No; I will not name anybody. He is everywhere — ports, airports, city gas distribution centres, railways, everywhere.” He added, “After all you have to give airports to the person in whose airplanes you flew. This despite the reservations of the NITI Aayog.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-speaks-its-mann-ki-baat-but-does-not-listen-to-farmers/article33805878.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Hyderabad to get its 17th Mayor today||The newly-elected body of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will meet for the first time on Thursday to elect the 17th Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the city. In all probability, the TRS with 56 corporators and 32 ex-officio members will have its say in the 193-member body though the BJP which has 47 corporators and two ex-officio members has also announced the decision to throw its hat in the ring. The MIM with 44 corporators and 10 ex-officio members will take a stand on Thursday morning, a party leader said. The TRS has firmed up its candidates for the election of Mayor, a post reserved for women from general category, and Deputy Mayor but the BJP will announce its candidate after a webinar meeting with Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy and State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar who are in New Delhi in the morning. The meeting will be presided by Hyderabad Collector Swetha Mohanty at the GHMC headquarters while the election observer appointed by State Election Commissioner (SEC) Sandeep Kumar Sultania will also be present. After the swearing-in of the members at 11 a.m., the election is scheduled to start at 12.30 p.m. by show of hands. A quorum of 97 members which is 50% of the Council is required for the election but this is assured since TRS and BJP with sizeable strength will be in fray. In this context, the stand of MIM has assumed significance. Whether the party will stay neutral to remain equidistant from TRS and BJP if it decided not to contest is being observed closely. However, there is no reason for MIM to abstain from the meeting, its leader said. The meeting is expected to generate heat as it will be the first time since the delimitation of wards in GHMC took place in 2009 and the number went up from 100 to 150. On all occasions in the past, the Mayor was elected unanimously. The Congress and MIM rotated the post between themselves in 2009-14 and the TRS with 99 corporators faced no opposition in 2016. The GHMC had no elected body in 2014 -16. State Election Commissioner C. Parthasarathi reviewed the arrangements at GHMC office with Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar, Ms. Mohanty and senior police officers on Wednesday. The election will be followed by subsequent sittings of the body to pass the Rs. 5,600 crore budget of the corporation which was due for approval by February 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hyderabad-to-get-its-17th-mayor-today/article33806246.ece
11 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘States, Centre responsible for fuel prices’||Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Wednesday it was wrong to campaign that fuel prices are at an all-time high as petrol and diesel prices are governed by an international price mechanism. K.C. Venugopal of the Congress said petrol price was about Rs. 100 a litre in his village, and asked why the prices were at an all-time high when the international crude price was not so. Responding to this, Mr. Pradhan said, “Today, the price of crude oil is $61 a barrel. He belongs to Kerala where a lot of people stay in Gulf area. Before coming to the House, he should at least check with some of his close friends from that area what the price is... States are responsible; the Union government is also responsible for this tax issue. He has asked me how many times we have raised the price and the excise duty. The States too have raised the VAT. So, both the States and the Central government are raising taxes according to their developmental needs.” “Sometimes, the Government of India has reduced the excise duty. In the last three years, we have done so. In the last 300 days, the increase in the price was for 60 days. For around seven days in respect of petrol and for 21 days in respect of diesel, we have decreased the price. Almost for 250 days, we have neither increased nor decreased the price. So, it is a misnomer to campaign that prices are all-time high.” Asked by Vishambhar Prasad Nishad of the Samajwadi Party why the petrol price was high in Ram’s India when it was low in Sita’s Nepal, the Minister said India could not be compared to countries where petrol was not for the consumption of the masses. “Do we compare ourselves with big economies or such small economy. Let me give you an example of kerosene that is priced at Rs. 32 in India but there [Nepal, Bangladesh] it is priced at Rs. 57-59. Kerosene is an item of mass consumption in those countries,” he said. He said to give relief to the consumers, the Centre reduced the excise duty on both petrol and diesel by Rs. 2 a litre with effect from October 4, 2017. It reduced the excise duty on both by Rs. 1.5 a litre with effect from October 5, 2018 and the public sector oil marketing companies also reduced Rs. 1 a litre to bring down overall prices.  Sometimes, the Government of India has reduced the excise duty...

11 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Kerala unit of NCP on the verge of split||With a faction led by Pala MLA Mani C. Kappan, MLA, slated to join the United Democratic Front (UDF), the State unit of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) appears to be on the verge of a split ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. According to NCP sources, Mr. Kappan is expected to announce his decision after a meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Thursday. Besides Mr. Kappan, NCP State president T.P. Peethambaran has been called to New Delhi for discussions. The meeting comes amidst reports that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had expressed the Left Democratic Front’s unwillingness to allot the Pala seat to the NCP and instead suggested Mr .Kappan to contest from Kuttanad. When pressed about reports that Mr. Kappan would defect to the UDF by presspersons in the capital, Mr. Vijayan said coalition partners should proffer some of their seats to accommodate new allies [like Kerala Congress (M)]. “The CPI(M) is willing to take that step. The past seat-sharing agreement has become redundant with the LDF’s expansion.” The Chief Minister saw no reason why the NCP should quit the LDF. Mr. Peethambaran had not dwelt on any such possibility. He had discussed the Pala issue with NCP general secretary Praful Patel. The LDF has not discussed seat-sharing so far.  The Left coalition, by forcing Mr. Kappan to contest from any Assembly segment outside Pala, appears to be conceding to the KC(M)’s claim of dominance in the seat despite its crushing defeat in the recent byelection. “This was precisely why they went back on an earlier offer of a Rajya Sabha seat, as the elevation of Mr. Kappan as MP would create another power centre in Pala,” said a party leader. Mr. Kappan currently enjoys the support of a few leaders in the party State committee, besides the district committees of Kottayam and Alappuzha. The UDF has welcomed Mr. Kappan to its fold and intends to field him as its candidate in Pala. Notwithstanding an offer from the Kerala Congress led by P.J. Joseph, Mr. Kappan is likely to contest the election as UDF Independent. Interacting with journalists in Thrissur, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the UDF is ready to receive Mr. Kappan. Saseendran faction The rival NCP faction backing Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran, meanwhile, is unyielding towards the demand for a coalition change. They also sought to dispel the rumours regarding a CPI(M) takeover of the Elathur Assembly seat, currently held by Mr. Saseendran.

11 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Finally, it is a festival of films in Kerala||Braving odds, the 25th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) began here on Wednesday. Recipient of the Lifetime Achievement award this year, legendary French filmmaker Jean Luc Godard who greeted the Kerala audience from his home, was the toast of the inaugural function held at the Nishagandhi auditorium. “I am sorry for speaking in the tongue of the dominators (English). Thank you very much Kerala. Thank you to the Kerala festival for screening good and sensible films. It is great that five of my films are being screened there,” he said, with a lit cigar in his hand. Inaugurating the festival through videoconferencing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the IFFK had stood apart from many other festivals due to its strong political and progressive standpoint. “In these 25 years, the IFFK has, through the quality of the films and people’s participation, raised Kerala’s stature in the international arena,” he said. Lauding Godard for using cinema as a political tool, Mr. Vijayan recollected the filmmaker’s part in raising voice against the Vietnam war, the attacks on Palestine and in lending support to the May 1968 protests in Paris. Receiving the honour on Godard’s behalf, filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan said that the filmmaker was a genius who even at the age of 91 was still expanding his boundaries and exploring new ways to express himself on film. “That we are honouring Godard at the 25th edition of the IFFK is an honour for the festival, more than it is for him,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan. Culture Minister A.K. Balan, who presided, reiterated that the capital city would always remain the host city of the festival. Festival complex Work on the proposed Chitranjali film city in the capital would be inaugurated this week. The IFFK festival complex project could not take off due to lack of enough space on the Chitranjali campus, but the government was looking for alternative spaces, he said. Kerala State Chalachitra Academy chairman Kamal said that the IFFK had over the years had a huge influence on the State’s cinema culture and the cultural awareness of an entire generation. Its greatest contribution had been the array of new filmmakers in Malayalam cinema who grew up watching films at the festival. Thiruvananthapuram Mayor Arya Rajendran released Godard - Pala Yathrakal , the book by G.P. Ramachandran on Jean-Luc Godard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finally-it-is-festival-of-films-in-kerala/article33805864.ece
11 February 2021||Bengaluru,||‘School closure led to loss in foundational abilities’||How badly were students, especially those in lower classes, impacted by the sudden and extended closure of schools from March last year as COVID-19 took its toll on society? A field study by Azim Premji University paints a grim picture. Children not only missed out on the regular curricular learning they would have acquired had schools remained open, but also “forgot” what they had learned the previous year. According to the study, on an average 92% of the students from classes 2 to 6 have lost at least one specific foundational ability in languages that they might have acquired in the previous year. The corresponding figure for mathematics is 82%. As many as 16,067 primary schoolchildren in 1,137 government schools between classes 2 and 6 across five States were surveyed for the study, titled ‘Loss of learning during the pandemic’. Two thousand teachers and 400 members of the Azim Premji Foundation conducted the comparative field study. Foundational abilities are those that form the basis for further learning. The researchers noted that a grasp of concepts in language and mathematics during primary school years forms the basis of a student’s further learning in all subjects. Some examples of foundational abilities include reading a paragraph with comprehension and addition and subtraction. In mathematics, foundational abilities include identifying single- and two-digit numbers, performing arithmetic operations, using basic arithmetic operations to solve problems, and reading and drawing inferences from data, among others. Anurag Behar, Vice-Chancellor of the university, in a press release said, “When schools reopen, teachers have to be given time to cover this deficit and be provided with other support. A carefully synchronised set of measures across States will be required.” Some of the suggestions included eliminating vacations, extending the academic year well into 2021 and perhaps beyond depending on when schools open and reconfiguring the syllabus. The report pointed out that the extent and nature of learning loss was serious enough to warrant action at all levels. It suggested supplemental support in the form of bridge courses, extended school hours, community-based engagements, and appropriate curricular materials that will help students pick up foundational abilities once they return to school. It also said that teachers should be given enough time to compensate for the learning loss and must not rush to promote students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/school-closure-led-to-loss-in-foundational-abilities/article33805869.ece
11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||MPs squabble over Budget proposals||The Opposition targeted the Narendra Modi government in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday while debating the Budget proposals for 2021-22, with Congress leader Shashi Tharoor accusing the government of ‘deceiving’ the people about allocations to the health and defence sectors. Initiating the discussion, Mr. Tharoor said that soon there would be a time when banks would have to offer fuel loans because of the high taxes and charged the government with showing no sensitivity. “The aam aadmi has been let down totally in the last seven years ... and the Budget has betrayed his most fundamental aspirations,” he said. Using cricketing analogy, the Congress leader said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman neither played defensive nor hit the ball. Mr. Tharoor said the Budget had reduced expenditure on defence and healthcare, and “delivered a blow to the economic system”. However, BJP member Meenakshi Lekhi strongly defended the Budget and complimented the Modi government for steering the country out of the “fragile five” economies. After saving lives during the pandemic, Ms. Lekhi said the focus was now on promoting livelihood and asserted that the allocations for most of the sectors had been doubled including health and sanitation. Saugato Roy of the Trinamool Congress described it as a cruel government, referred to Ms. Sitharaman as “the great dismantler” who is dismantling the edifice of public sector undertakings (PSUs). Some Opposition members raised the issue of disinvestment of profit-making PSUs. DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran demanded a White Paper on the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus package and a forensic audit on the expenditure of Rs. 35,000 crore on vaccines.

11 February 2021||BENGALURU,||An 84-year-old on a mission to conserve rare mango varieties||Age is no barrier for 84-year-old Beluru Subbanna Heggade (B.V. Subba Rao) who has collected more than 100 appe midi varieties of mango, which were on the verge of extinction. He has preserved these mangoes, used for pickling as whole fruit, by growing them on his premises in Belur of Sagar taluk in Shivamogga district. He has travelled to every nook and corner of Western Ghats over the last 12 years and visited more than 100 villages to source appe midi mango varieties. “I would visit villages almost on a daily basis along with my wife, searching for any appe midi variety,” he recalled in a chat with The Hindu . “Since I cannot climb trees, I would plead with someone for help. My wife would then make pickle out of them. If they were good, we would go back and get the scion from the tree for grafting.” Space constraint He said it used to take multiple visits to get a single variety. Mr. Heggade does not have a big space to grow these varieties. All he has is one acre of areca plantation, from which he makes a living, and a house. “I have developed a park around my house where appe midi trees are grown. Due to space constraint, my wife has grafted four to five different varieties on each tree so that we can accommodate more plants in a small space,” he said. “I have grown up eating appe midis, which are very popular in Malnad region of Karnataka. But it is sad that we are losing most of the appe midi mango varieties. This prompted me to take up this conservation exercise,” explained Mr. Heggade. Premium varieties His collection includes some 10 rare and premium varieties such as Dombesara Jeerige, Genasinakudi jeerege, Cheene thota jeerege, Baagi jeerige, Barige jeerige . “They have a distinct taste and aroma. Also, they have a shelf life ranging from three to five years,” he pointed out. He does not do it for commercial purpose, he gives away scions free of cost to whoever shows interest in growing them. “I want others to continue this exercise,” said Mr. Heggade. The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research honoured Mr. Heggade for his conservation efforts at its ongoing national horticultural fair in Hessarghatta on Wednesday. Dr. K.V. Ravishankar, Principal scientist at the IIHR’s Division of Biotechnology and Basic Sciences, who identified Mr. Heggade’s work, along with Institute Director Dr. M. R. Dinesh, says the Institute has taken about 30 appe midi varieties from him. In all, the Institute now has about 200 appe midi varieties of mango. Of them, four to five varieties have premium characteristics and are ideal for exporting, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-84-year-old-on-a-mission-to-conserve-rare-mango-varieties/article33805858.ece
11 February 2021||New Delhi,||Nod for webinars not enforceable: academics||An Education Ministry notification that requires public-funded institutions to seek permission from the External Affairs Ministry before organising virtual academic seminars is “unenforceable”, leading academics have said. An Education Ministry official defended the order as a “simplified permission system” but there is little clarity about the subjects bracketed under “internal matters” that will require the MEA’s prior approval before holding meetings on virtual platforms such as Zoom. The order says: “Ministry or Department, PSUs, Central Educational Institutions, Public Funded Universities or an organisation owned and controlled by the Government of India or State Government or Union Territory should take approval of its Administrative Secretary for the (virtual) event as well as for the list of participants”. It also mentions that permission of the MEA will be required if the topic of discussion deals with “security of State, Border, North East states, J&K or any other issues which are clearly/purely related to India’s internal matters”. In response to a question from The Hindu seeking a definition of “internal matters”, an official of the Ministry of Education said it meant “matters pertaining to internal security”. “The notification appears to be aimed mainly at public-funded institutions like prominent government-run think tanks and leading universities. Therefore, it is unfair, as private think tanks and private universities will be able to engage with the international academic world freely. Such an order will ultimately hit young scholars and researchers who are at an early stage of their careers,” said Alka Acharya, Professor of Chinese Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nod-for-webinars-not-enforceable-academics/article33805928.ece

Accordingly, all asymptomatic, vulnerable persons in community clusters – elderly, pregnant women, those with co-morbidities – will be individually tested using RT-PCR for COVID-19. All asymptomatic travellers from other States or other countries, who are on quarantine and all asymptomatic contacts of lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 will also be tested using RT-PCR. Symptomatic contacts of travellers in the last 14 days, symptomatic health workers and frontline workers will also be tested using RT-PCR. As before, all cases of Influenza-like Illnesses and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection will be tested using Rapid Antigen Assay. If they test negative despite their symptoms, they will be tested using RT-PCR on the same day, as early as possible during their symptomatic period. Patients with no symptoms from containment zones will also be tested using antigen assay. The State will continue to monitor the elderly in care homes in the States by testing all elderly inmates, even if they are asymptomatic, every month using RT-PCR. In hospitals, all emergency and elective surgeries will be preceded by a TrueNat/CBNAAT test for COVID on the patient.   People who are symptomatic and who test negative in rapid antigen assay should be re-tested using RT-PCR. However, even if if they test negative again in PCR test, they should undergo seven days home isolation from the start of their symptoms, the GO issued by the Health Department says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-to-introduce-new-covid-19-testing-strategy/article33806296.ece

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Tigress Avni killing: SC notice to forest officials||The Supreme Court on Wednesday prima facie said “celebrations” after the killing of tigress Avni in November 2018 “clearly violated” the law. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to Vikas Kharge, Principal Secretary, Department of Revenue and Forests, Mumbai, and other Maharashtra Forest Department officials on a contempt petition filed by activist and petitioner-in-person Sangeeta Dogra. “They should be no celebrations or rewards... On this, we issue notice,” Chief Justice Bobde orally observed. The court also decided to examine the claim that the tigress was really a man-eater. Ms. Dogra had submitted that human nails, hair and teeth were not found inside the animal during the autopsy. The court asked Ms. Dogra to establish her claim. It also asked for the autopsy report. “We want to see a clear finding that human hair, nails, teeth do not disintegrate within six months,” Chief Justice Bobde said. Avni, which is claimed to have killed 13 villagers, was reported to have been shot dead near Borati village in Yavatmal by a team of forest officials and civilian hunter Asgar Ali. The incident triggered an outrage among wildlife activists, who alleged that no efforts were made to tranquillise Avni and called it “murder in cold blood.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tigress-avni-killing-sc-issues-notice-to-maharashtra-officials/article33805894.ece

It is part of the writ petition filed by Mr. Wilson in the Bombay High Court that explains how a hacker exploited the IP addresses provided by one ‘Host Sailor’ and used proxy servers to plant a “trojan horse NetWire”. This initially subjected Mr. Wilson to surveillance, and later on, remotely through the malware, delivered various files, including the incriminating correspondence with the other accused. The same were stored in a folder which was set to a “hidden mode”, and over a period of 22 months, from time-to-time, various letters and material came to be planted on Mr. Wilson’s system without his knowledge, mentions the plea seeking the quashing of the FIR and chargesheet against him. The report further states that the folders and documents were never opened by Mr. Wilson or anyone else and their existence was unknown to him. The hacker also synchronised these documents in such a way that they would get planted in any external memory device connected to the laptop. The report demonstrates that Mr. Wilson’s computer was compromised through a mail sent to his email account, which carried an attachment in the form of a document (“another victory.rar”). Since it appeared to be innocuous, Mr. Wilson tried opening it but did not succeed in opening it. But because he had clicked on the attachment, it helped the attacker install the malware in his laptop. It is stated in the report that the attachment was enveloped in a decoy file, namely “another victory.rar”, and clicking the same resulted in a chain of events that led to the installation of the malware on his device. The attacker retained access to Mr. Wilson’s computer for over 22 months, starting June 13, 2016, and used a remote access facility for planting the incriminating letters, while conducting surveillance on his activities without Mr. Wilson getting a hint of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rona-wilsons-computer-was-compromised/article33805854.ece

While aerial monitoring, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), would be done, on the ground, verification at each step would also be done to ensure that the Chinese fully honour the understanding. On the south bank, both sides had deployed tanks and armoured vehicles in close proximity, within few hundred metres, after tensions went up end of August. During the ninth round of talks held on January 24, both sides were discussing a broad disengagement plan that had been worked out but held up over some specific issues. The talks took place after a long delay with the previous round held on November 6 last. While China had insisted on a focus on the south bank (where India in late August moved to occupy strategic heights in response to the PLA’s transgressions in May north of the lake), India had stressed the need for a comprehensive disengagement plan covering all friction points in eastern Ladakh. The focus of the Corps Commander talks has been on the north and south banks, which has seen tensions with warning shots also fired in the south last year, the first firing incidents along the border since 1975. As part of the first phase of disengagement last June, both sides had pulled back troops by equal distance from Patrolling Points (PP) 14 in Galwan valley and PP15 in Gogra-Hot Springs. It was during the disengagement at Galwan that violent clashes occurred. Ingress by troops Since the stand-off began in early May, China has moved a large number of troops and equipment close to the LAC in addition to the ingress by its troops inside Indian territory at various places in eastern Ladakh. On the north bank, Chinese troops made ingress from Finger 8 up to Finger 4, blocking Indian patrols. India holds till Finger 4 but claims till Finger 8 as per alignment of the LAC. Apart from Pangong lake, another major area of concern for India is the strategic Depsang Plains, where Chinese troops have been blocking Indian Army patrols from going up to the Patrolling Points (PP) 10 to 13 beyond the Y-junction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/both-sides-disengaging-from-pangong-lake-area/article33805871.ece

In a long reply, Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the Bill aimed to make the ports world class and give the port authorities power to make their own decisions. He denied the Opposition’s charge that it would lead to privatisation. CPI (M) MP Elamaram Kareem had demanded a division opposing the Bill. Deputy Chairman Harivansh, who was in the chair, agreed, calling for a voting despite protests from BJP benches, including by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal. The Opposition lost the vote despite support from the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India. “Would a patriot oppose this Bill? This Bill is not for privatisation of ports. The Bill has nothing to do with privatisation. Former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and former Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari had also specified that there will not be privatisation of ports. The Bill is not to sell ports,” the Minister said. Congress MP Shaktisinh Gohil, while opposing the Bill, said this was being done to “help a particular friend.” “The Bill has weaknesses and lacuna that benefit a certain friend. Has this Bill been brought in to help a friend? Airports have been named after that friend, now the intention seems to hand over the 12 sea ports to a particular friend,” Mr. Gohil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/despite-opposition-show-of-unity-rs-passes-ports-bill/article33805881.ece

The news portal released a statement, confirming that the searches at the NewsClick’s office and the residential premises of its senior representatives were still under way. “During the raid, NewsClick has cooperated with the officials and will continue to do so. If the ED and the government are truthful and follow the course of law, no wrong-doing will be found and this unfortunate event will be closed. Newsclick has nothing to hide,” it said. A senior ED official on Tuesday said the probe was based on an FIR registered by the Delhi Police a few months ago and that the company running the platform had allegedly received funds from a U.S.-based firm, which had been liquidated. On Wednesday, the ED also started recording statements of the persons concerned. It enquired about certain transactions, which raised suspicion about diversion of funds. The NewsClick report said: “It has become a routine practice with the present government to deploy government-controlled agencies to deal with all those who disagree with and criticise the government. In the past, the Income-Tax Department, the ED, various Central investigative agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation and National Investigation Agency, have been selectively used in this manner against a range of people — from journalists to political leaders, to even farmers’ leaders.” The ongoing searches appeared to be on the same lines, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-continues-searches-on-newsclick-premises/article33805897.ece

11 February 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Lahaul-Spiti residents want hydro projects scrapped||In the wake of the Uttarakhand avalanche, there is increased anxiety among the people in the Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh who have been up in arms against the hydropower projects proposed in this tribal region. Among the projects proposed in Lahul-Spiti are Tandi (104 Mega Watt), Rashil (102 MW), Bardang (126 MW), Miyar (90 MW) and Jispa (300 MW). People from at least two Panchayats — Tandi and Goshal — have been strongly opposing the Tandi project. “Our apprehension surrounding the ill-effects of big hydro-projects on environment has only been strengthened after the recent tragedy in Uttarakhand. Locals here are opposing hydro projects on the Chandra-Bhaga River basin. Our Panchayat has also passed a resolution against the Tandi hydro-project,” Virender Kumar, vice-pradhan (head) of Tandi, told The Hindu . Mr. Kumar said locals had been voicing their concerns for a long time. “We are against all hydro power projects in Lahaul, and in particular at Tandi. The ecology here is fragile,” he said. adding, “We are not against the government, we want to ensure that our ecology is not disturbed.” He said they were planning to stage protests in the near future. “Since our region is snowbound, it’s difficult to stage protests at present. But hopefully by April, we will chalk out a plan, if the need arises.” An association of locals opposing the proposed project – ‘Tandi Dam Sangarsh Samiti’ — recently submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. The memorandum says the existence of about a dozen of villages falling in Tandi and Goshal panchayat was at risk. The construction of the dam would impact the tribal rights. The project would bring more losses than benefits, it said. “We have rejected the proposal and asked the government scrap the project respecting the sentiments of the local people,” said Goshal village head Susheela. Vikram Katoch, vice-president of ‘Save Lahaul-Spiti Society’, an NGO, said there were around 56 mini, micro and mega hydro projects in Lahaul-Spiti. “The entire region is fragile and disturbing it will only have catastrophic results.

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ram Sethu not an ancient monument, former V-C tells SC||Senior academic and former Vice-Chancellor of Alagappa Univeristy A. Ramasamy has moved the Supreme Court, saying the Ram Setu or Adam’s Bridge does not meet the requirements of an “ancient monument” under the law, and the top court has no power to declare it a “national monument”. Ram Setu is a chain of limestone shoals between the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. According to the epic Ramayana, the bridge was built by the ‘Vanara army’ to rescue Sita, who was kidnapped by Ravana. Dr. A. Ramasamy, president of the Dravidian Historical Research Centre, quoted a 130-year-old German study, which had concluded that the “Adam’s Bridge is not man-made”. “Dr. Johnnes Walther, a professor of Jena University in Germany, undertook the research on the Adam’s Bridge in 1891,” Dr. Ramasamy, represented by advocates M. Munusamy and A. Lakshminarayanan, said. He vouched for the veracity of the study, saying at that time, there was “no compulsion or political pressure” concerning the bridge. The German study described the narrative of Ramayana as a “pious fairy tale”. He argued that several eminent persons have categorically stated that “Ramayana is a myth”. “National poet Bharati has also declared that there is no truth in the Ramayana story,” the application said. The academic approached the Supreme Court to implead himself in a petition filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy for a direction to the Centre to declare Ram Setu a national heritage monument. In his application, Mr. Ramasamy highlighted that the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 defines an ancient monument as “any structure, erection or monument or any tumulus or place of interment or any cave, rock sculpture, inscription or monolith of historical, archaeological or artistic interest.” Again, the structure should have been in existence for not less than a century. “Only a permanent structure could be declared an ancient monument. Adam’s Bridge is not a permanent structure...sand dunes are formed due to the streaming relationship of the Indian Ocean and the influence of the monsoon on the superficial sediments of the sea, plus negative beach pushing. The whole phenomenon depends on change in sea level ... In short, Adam’s Bridge is a constantly changing structure which is repeatedly constructed and destroyed by natural process. Sand dunes appear and disappear like bubbles... It would not [be] possible to declare the bubbles a national monument,” he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ram-setu-not-an-ancient-monument-former-v-c-tells-sc/article33806021.ece

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey said he needed more time to go through the submissions made by both parties.

11 February 2021||B. Tilak Chandar,TAMIL NADU||HC orders CBI probe into elephant poaching incidents||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into a series of elephant poaching incidents reported in the State. Most of the incidents took place in a decade prior to 2015 and allegedly involved influential persons. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and N. Sathish Kumar observed that the crimes indicated that the network involved was cutting across boundaries. This was not a mere case of poaching, but a demand was created by customers and the names would tumble out after the investigation. The court took note of the report submitted by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which carried out an extensive study in this regard. Statements of the accused in the case revealed that the customers included influential people and an extract from the diary of one of the accused revealed contact numbers and bank transactions. The judges observed that the greed of man could be seen in the transactions. Poaching was done not for livelihood, but for international trade and sadistic pleasure in creating art in fellow living beings. The amount of ivory recovered in the cases were too large, the judges said. Pointing to one case, they said as per the report, 300 kg of ivory was recovered and eight male elephants had been killed. Though the State submitted that arrests were made in these cases, the judges said they were at the bottom of the chain and middlemen and kingpins were untouched. Though the report was made available in 2019, the authorities concerned remained ignorant. Forests were protected by forest guards and watchers. How the incidents escaped their eyes was a mystery and raised serious concern, the judges said. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau could also assist in the investigation. The court said it would monitor the case and sought a report from the CBI in three months. In a related case pertaining to electrocution of elephants in Megamalai Wildlife Division, the judges said it had to be ascertained if the deaths were due to the powerlines or any individuals were involved. The court directed Tangedco, Forest and Revenue Departments to act in unison in the issue. The court observed that though a report was submitted in the case, there was only slow progress. The court directed the authorities to conduct a meeting and file a report. The report should be comprehensive and the steps initiated must be for the whole of Tamil Nadu and not just Megamalai, the judges said. The case was adjourned till June 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-elephant-poaching/article33806160.ece
11 February 2021||BODI,TAMIL NADU||Two workers killed in road accident||Two estate workers died in a road accident and another person suffered multiple injuries when the motor cycle on which they were riding reportedly rammed the parapet at the hairpin bend on the Bodimettu ghat section on Tuesday. Police said that Marimuthu (35), Kaliappan (55) and Palaniswami (60) of Dombuseri village near here worked in a private cardamom estate in Kerala near Bodimettu. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the public transport had been suspended. Hence, the trio were going on a two-wheeler daily from their homes. On Tuesday, when they were returning, it is said that the vehicle banged on the parapet wall, in which all the three were thrown off and Kaliappan, who suffered head injuries, died on the spot. In a serious condition, when passersby informed ‘108’ emergency ambulance service, Palaniswami, who was referred to Kanavilakku Government Hospital, died on the way, while Marimuthu is undergoing treatment at the GH here. Kurangani police have registered a case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-estate-workers-killed/article33806159.ece
11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||North Chennai coastal areas hit by seawater intrusion, says study||The coastline north of Chennai near Tiruvallur district continues to be affected by seawater intrusion and it has now extended nearly 18 km inland from the coast, reveals a study by Anna University. The study, conducted in the Ponneri, Panchetti and Minjur coastal belt that forms part of the Araniar-Kosasthalaiyar belt, called it one of the worst-hit areas in the world in terms of seawater intrusion. Seawater intrusion had extended from 4 km inland, found near Athipet during 1969, to nearly 18 km inland up to Vannipakkam in 2019, according to the study done by the Department of Geology, Centre for Climate Change and Disaster Management, Anna University, along with the Institute of Geological Sciences, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany. “We noticed that the seawater ingress was more in the lower aquifer than the upper aquifer. This indicated overexploitation of groundwater and it had resulted in salinity in the coastal aquifer,” said Indu S. Nair, who authored the paper along with K. Brindha. Groundwater salinity increased by four times over the past decade. For instance, areas such as Kattur, Mouthampedu and Senganimedu have total dissolved solids, which denote salinity in water, of 8,000 mg/litre against the maximum permissible limit of 2,000 mg/l. To assess factors contributing to groundwater salinity in coastal aquifers, the study adopted field investigation with a hydro-chemical modelling technique. Some of the indicators, such as electrical conductivity, sodium and chloride and isotopes in the groundwater, were studied to assess the extent of mixing of freshwater with seawater. Groundwater samples were collected from 50 wells once in two months. It was found that concentration of sodium and chloride, which are indicators of seawater intrusion, had gone up by 10 times. For instance, chloride concentration had gone up to 7,000 mg/l in some areas closer to the sea compared with that of 1988. The permissible level is 200 mg/l, said L. Elango, professor, Department of Geology, Anna University, and one of the authors of the paper published recently in Hydrological Sciences Journal . Dubious distinction Low sodium-chloride ratio was another indicator of the extent of salt water intrusion in the region. The highest chloride and bromide ratio, which is used to determine groundwater quality, was found near Minjur that indicated extensive seawater intrusion, he added. Groundwater in the northern parts of the study area, such as Ponneri, was better than those in the south, like Minjur. After 2015, groundwater quality improved slightly here. The study suggested steps such as construction of more check dams to recharge the water table.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/north-chennai-coastal-areas-hit-by-seawater-intrusion-says-study/article33806028.ece
11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation plans to develop Miyawaki forests in all 15 zones||Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash inaugurated a Miyawaki forest located near the Secretariat on Wednesday. Mr. Prakash said the civic body, which successfully raised a similar forest at Kotturpuram, would develop such lung spaces in all the 15 zones. The Corporation had handed over 3,000 sq ft of barren land to the Inner Wheel Club of Madras for raising the Miyawaki forest. The Inner Wheel Miyawaki Park, work on which was started in September 2020, has 837 trees of 30 indigenous varieties. Inner Wheel Club’s district chairman Usha Saraogi and president Shobha Gupta were present. Mr. Prakash unveiled boards highlighting the concept of Miyawaki forest and planted a few saplings. Miyawaki forests are developed based on a Japanese method of restoration of degraded land, planting species of trees, plants and shrubs, regenerating all layers of original forests in a particular area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-plans-to-develop-miyawaki-forests-in-all-15-zones/article33806041.ece
11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Engineers in uniform roped in to crack cybercrime cases||Cybercrime investigations are set to scale new heights in Tamil Nadu with the State police identifying as many as 185 young sub-inspectors, mostly graduates in Electronics and Communications Engineering, and hundreds of graduate police constables for deployment in cybercrime police stations in all cities/districts. The sub-inspectors, currently serving in districts across the State, volunteered to join the core team that was trained in advanced investigation skills in cyber offences as part of an initiative carried out in association with IIT-M and SSN College. They would be posted to the 46 cybercrime police stations notified by the State government on Monday. According to police sources, this is the first time in the country that cybercrime police stations were being notified with sufficient manpower and infrastructure in all cities/districts of a State. The latest cyber forensic tools would be procured from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). The institution would also provide training to the sub-inspectors and personnel in other ranks in the effective use of the gadgets. The cybercrime police stations would be located in all Commissionerates and district oolice offices, with staff functioning round the clock. While Commissioners/Superintendents of Police would refer complaints to these police stations, a State-level CyberCrime Wing, headed by an officer in the rank of Additional Director-General of Police, would facilitate policy decisions and coordination with other agencies. “We are now evolving to have a more specialised cybercrime infrastructure. We have identified hundreds of police constables, a majority of whom are science graduates, who would be trained by the Department of Criminology, University of Madras, in the latest trends in cybercrime environment. Training programmes would be organised at regular intervals since capacity-building is a continuous process,” a senior police official told The Hindu on Tuesday. In the case of cybercrime, the victims were often lured with attractive offers, and ended up sharing their credentials with an unknown caller not knowing that they were walking into a trap, the official said. “The nature of the offence is such that awareness alone is the key to protecting oneself. People should be aware of the dos and don’ts and guard themselves against cyber fraudsters, hackers, stalkers, etc… There cannot be physical policing like in conventional security systems in the cyber world,” he said. In spite of awareness campaigns, at least 50% of cybercrime complaints in the State pertained to voluntary disclosure, as in OTP fraud, where the suspects claim to be calling from a bank, offer loans, cash subsidies or other services and manage to gather the ATM card credentials of gullible people. “After entering the card details, the suspects call the victims to get the OTP, saying it is required for transferring the loan amount, cash prize or COVID-19 grant from the Union government. Once the OTP is shared, the money in the account is siphoned off,” the official said, adding that the fight against cybercrime involved more human elements than technical aspects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/engineers-in-uniform-roped-in-to-crack-cybercrime-cases/article33806148.ece

11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK-AMMK unification may not fructify now||With the camp of Chief Minister and co-coordinator of the ruling AIADMK Edappadi K Palaniswami hardening its stand towards former interim general secretary of the party V.K. Sasikala and her nephew-cum-general secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) T.T.V. Dhinakaran, the calls made by her and the AMMK leader for unification may not fructify for the time being. On Wednesday morning, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, who is regarded as the de facto spokesperson of the Cabinet, alluded to the reception given to Ms. Sasikala on her return from Bengaluru a few days ago and described the event as “passing clouds”. He sought to equate her and Mr. Dhinakaran with the principal Opposition party, DMK. Later in the day, Mr. Palaniswami declared that one family, meaning that of Ms. Sasikala, would not be allowed to dominate the party. As for Ms. Sasikala’s journey from Bengaluru to Chennai, which lasted nearly 23 hours, a senior leader in the Chief Minister’s camp observed that a mere display of strength does not lead to any electoral success. He recalled how Janaki Ramachandran, who became Chief Minister soon after the death of AIADMK founder and her husband M.G. Ramachandran in December 1987, got a massive rally organised in Madurai in February 1988 to mark her launch into politics. At that time, the train that she took for the temple city — Pandiyan Express — reached the destination seven hours behind schedule as her supporters held it up at almost every station, beginning from Chengalpattu, to give her a reception. This was then considered similar to what M.G. Ramachandran himself had in 1972, when the same train took nine hours more to reach Madurai, with his followers according him a welcome. By recounting this episode, the veteran leader of Mr. Palaniswami’s camp conveyed the message that Janaki Ramachandran, despite receiving a rousing reception initially, did not get elected to the Assembly in 1989 even from Andipatti, which was bagged by her husband five years earlier while remaining at a New York hospital. Notwithstanding such a strong language, there are leaders in both camps who believe that a compromise could happen “suddenly”. When the groups led by Jayalalithaa and Janaki Ramachandran, which bitterly fought each other in the run up to the 1989 Assembly election, could come together immediately after the election, why cannot these groups unite, they wondered. These leaders observe that the two camps should not forget that the division in the AIADMK vote paved the way for the DMK’s return to power in 1989 after a gap of 13 years. However, critics of the Sasikala group said there are dissimilarities. Primarily, Janaki Ramachandran did not suffer from any adverse public perception and at the time of unification, she quit politics gracefully. But the same could not be said of Ms. Sasikala. Her appointment as interim general secretary of the AIADMK in late December 2016 was followed by reports of disenchantment among several sections of society. She had also declared the other day that she would play an active role in politics. This is why chances of rapprochement appear remote, the critics added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-ammk-unification-may-not-fructify-now/article33806019.ece
11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC sets aside fresh notices served on DMK MLAs||The Madras High Court on Wednesday set aside fresh show cause notices issued by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly’s Committee of Privileges to DMK president M.K. Stalin, 18 other legislators from his party and the expelled MLA Ku.Ka. Selvam in September 2020 for having displayed Gutkha sachets in the House in July 2017. In her orders, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that the Assembly should not only commence its proceedings with the Speaker reciting a couplet from Tirukkural every day but, “the legislators should also follow the Tirukkural in their day-to-day life both inside and outside the Assembly.” The original notices issued in 2017 was quashed by the first Division Bench of the High Court in August 2020 after observing that they suffer from a foundational error of assuming that the display of Gutkha sachets, to attract the attention of the House to their availability in bunk shops despite a ban, was per se prohibited under the law. The Bench, however, granted liberty to the Committee of Privileges to deliberate on the issue and proceed further if it was still of the opinion that a breach of privilege had been committed. On the strength of such liberty, the Committee expanded the scope of reference made to it by the Speaker and issued fresh notices, Justice Sathyanarayana said. Prohibited items Disapproving such a course adopted by the Committee, the judge pointed out that the July 2017 notices were issued to the legislators for bringing “prohibited items” into the House. However, the September 2020 notices had improved the charge and accused the 19 legislators of displaying the sachets without the permission of the Speaker. Pointing out that the Division Bench itself had pointed out that the Assembly had not codified its privileges till date, in spite of the need to do so, the judge said: “When there are no clearly laid out rules on what constitutes breach of privilege and what punishment it entails, it could not be stated that the petitioners ought to have obtained permission from the first respondent.” The judge held that the fresh notices suffer from procedural irregularities too since the Speaker had referred the issue to the Committee of Privileges at the instance of a request made by the Fisheries Minister. When a reference had been made at the instance of a legislator, the 19 MLAs ought to have been given an opportunity in the House to explain their stand, she added. “Rule 223 of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Rules has not been followed and no opportunity was afforded to the petitioners,” the judge said and stated that though the Speaker enjoys suo motu power of reference, the latter had refused to accept notices issued to him by the court in the present batch of petitions and explain whether he had exercised his suo motu power or not. Though the Secretary to Assembly had accepted court notices, he did not file any counter affidavit. The counter affidavit had been filed only by the Committee of Privileges which again was chaired by Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman and comprised of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam who had been accused of harbouring political grudge against the petitioners. After recording the submission of senior counsel R. Shunmugasundaram and N.R. Elango and advocate Amit Anand Tiwari that Mr. Jayaraman had filed a defamation suit against Mr. Stalin and that DMK had filed cases to unseat Mr. Panneerselvam, the judge observed: “The contention of the petitioners in this regard cannot be brushed aside lightly.” She referred to Rule 228 which categorically states that a member of the Committee who had a personal or direct interest, of such a character that it might prejudicially affect the consideration of the matter of privilege to be considered by the Committee, should not sit on the Committee when the matter was under consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-sets-aside-fresh-notices-served-on-dmk-mlas/article33806053.ece

J. Lakshmi Narayanan, State general secretary of the Public Health Department Officials’ Association, said the implementation of a Supreme Court order on retrospective promotions for 1,651 integrated health inspectors was pending with the Finance Department for seven years. “Similarly, the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine had sought the nod for 1,002 health inspector grade-1 posts and 2,715 health inspector grade-2 posts and this too is pending with the department,” he said. He said there was a need for at least 14,000 health inspectors to take public health schemes to the people. But there were only around 2,000 health inspectors as of now, he said. “For COVID-19 management, the State recruited 1,650 trained workers on outsourcing basis. Their contracts are ending this month. If their services are terminated, field-level work will be hit hard,” he added. The body launched an indefinite fast but stopped with a day’s fast after the Health Secretary said that their demands would be looked into.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-dept-staff-demand-creation-of-more-posts/article33806049.ece

Stalin on Wednesday said that once voted to power, his party would set up an ‘Anita Academy’ in each and every district to train students for various competitive examinations. He was speaking at a function held at Anita Academy in his Kolathur constituency, which was opened in memory of a girl from Ariyalur who could not join a medical college because of the introduction of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). Mr. Stalin said the academy was opened to ensure that women became independent through education. He said the women trained by the academy were working in major organisations, earning a good salary. “Getting a job alone is not important. It has instilled self-confidence in them and trained them in various vocations. I am happy that it has become a mini-college,” he said. Unemployment claim He alleged that unemployment had become rampant in Tamil Nadu. Though lakhs of youths had registered themselves at employment exchanges, the AIADMK government remained unconcerned. He said a change would come about in Tamil Nadu in three months, with every district having institutions on the lines of ‘Anita Academy’. Earlier, he gave away assistance to students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-promises-anita-academy-in-all-districts/article33806023.ece
11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination for health staff to come to a close on Feb. 22||Vaccination against COVID-19 for healthcare workers will come to a close on February 22, after which they will be moved to the general public category and will be relegated to the age-appropriate group in it. The COVID-19 vaccination drive was launched in the State on January 16 with two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. In 23 days, around 1.7 lakh healthcare workers, the first among the priority group, received the first dose of the vaccines across the State. This was against 5.5 lakh healthcare workers who were already registered on the Co-WIN portal, according to the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. Issuing instructions to Deputy Directors of Health Services (DDHS), Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T.S. Selvavinayagam, in a circular dated February 9, said as per instructions of the government, vaccination for health workers was going to be closed on February 20. All Deputy Directors were directed to conduct the mop-up for unvaccinated healthcare workers on February 21 and 22. “It is also emphasised that after the due date on February 22, unvaccinated healthcare workers will move to the general public group and relegated to the age appropriate category in the group. The above fact is to be informed to all healthcare workers appropriately,” he said in the circular. All DDHS have been instructed to make arrangements for immunisation of unvaccinated health staff, registered/unregistered in the Co-WIN portal in their respective districts, as per a prescribed schedule. As per the schedule, they will be inoculated as per the alphabetical order of their names, from Thursday to February 20, at all government medical college hospitals, government hospitals, upgraded primary health centres and urban primary health centres in their districts. This will be followed by a two-day mop-up campaign. They can get inoculated at the approved sites. An official said many were refusing to take the vaccines. “Decline in cases is a reason. Many also feel that the vaccines were not tested adequately,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-for-health-staff-to-come-to-a-close-on-feb-22/article33806024.ece

According to a petition, when Kuppusamy was riding his motorcycle near BDO office in Vandavasi on November 13, 2017, a lorry driver applied sudden brake and the motorcycle hit the lorry. As a result, Kuppusamy sustained injuries and later died in a hospital. The driver of the lorry was responsible for the accident, alleged his family in the petition. They named Venkateshwara Road Construction Pvt Ltd and its insurer New India Assurance Co. Ltd. as respondents and sought damages. Based on the medical records, FIR and other evidence, the tribunal ruled that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the driver of the lorry and the insurer had to pay compensation to the kin of the victim. However, it ruled that since Kuppusamy was riding the motorcycle without a valid insurance policy in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act, 10% of the compensation should be deducted from about Rs. 16.95 lakh awarded to the family. It directed the insurance firm to pay Rs. 15.25 lakh, of which Rs. 14.85 lakh will go to the mother of the victim and remaining to his brother.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tribunal-cuts-damages-as-accident-victim-did-not-have-vehicle-insurance/article33806472.ece

11 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Petrol price breaches Rs. 90 mark at some places||Petrol prices on Wednesday breached the Rs. 90 mark in most parts of Chennai and other parts of the State. In a few bunks in Chennai, petrol price was Rs. 89.96/litre. This price difference is due to transportation costs varying from one location to another. The other places where the price went beyond Rs. 90 are: Sankagiri (Rs. 90.27), Madurai (Rs. 90.39), Erode (Rs. 90.52), and Tiruchy (Rs. 90.32). J. Selvam, Madurai district president, Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association, said that with prices crossing Rs. 90 a litre, many motorists were getting angry with dealers. “They think we are taking all the money. Even if a few drops spill accidentally, it leads to unnecessary problems. We are telling the boys to be very careful while dispensing fuel and not to lose temper,” he said. “I fill up for Rs. 500 a week, but now that amount is not enough. I get lesser fuel for the same price. I have lost a lot of business due to the pandemic and thereby my income too has reduced. Switching over to public transport would not be a possibility for me since I carry a lot of tools for work,” said K. Moorthi, a plumber. Rajya Sabha member P. Wilson made a special mention in the House on Wednesday seeking a waiver on tax collected by the Centre. Oil industry sources said the Centre had not increased taxes despite imposing a new cess in the Budget. It had only reduced allocation for excise duty. It is up to the State government to reduce VAT rates, the source said. Alagiri’s appeal Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri requested the Central government to reduce petrol and diesel prices in line with the international prices and roll back the increase in excise duty on fuel as people are already facing enormous financial challenges. Mr. Alagiri said excise duty on petrol in 2014 was Rs. 24 per litre but in 2021, it has risen to Rs. 60 per litre. “This is an increase of 142% and this has led to the retail price being raised by 22%. Due to this, excise duty, which was 20% in 2014, is now 200%,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/petrol-price-crosses-rs-90-a-litre-in-state/article33806047.ece

CMRL officials said this was in anticipation of a higher footfall when the Washermenpet-Wimco Nagar stretch is commissioned on Sunday. “We expect the patronage to go up marginally.

This figure may rise to 60,000-65,000 after the extension becomes operational. It is important to ensure that there is physical distancing inside the trains. So, we want to run trains every five minutes [during peak hours],” an official said. Officials said that while they expect a small section of people to use the Metro to travel from north Chennai to the rest of the city, a larger number of people may take the Metro from central and south Chennai to go to the northern areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/frequency-of-metro-trains-to-be-increased/article33806031.ece

11 February 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore wetlands record a drop in migratory birds||Wetlands in Coimbatore district registered a 65% decline in the number of migratory birds in the last five years, according to surveys conducted by the Coimbatore Nature Society (CNS) for the Asian Waterbird Census. CNS recorded 2,592 migratory birds of 35 species in the wetlands of Coimbatore district in 2017. This year, 18 birders of CNS recorded just 978 migratory birds of 31 species in 28 wetlands in the district between January 15 and 17. In 2020, birders of CNS had sighted 1,380 migratory birds of 39 species in 26 wetlands in the district. Need for attention “The reason for the decline in the number of wetland migratory birds needs to be studied — whether the cause is the fall in migration or disturbances in wetlands,” said CNS president Selvaraj P.R. A. Pavendhan, a senior member of CNS, said the gradual decline in the number wetland migratory birds in a five-year period was a cause for concern. According to Prakash G., another senior member of CNS, higher water levels in waterbodies and the degradation of shorelines could be reasons for the decline in numbers. “Due to high water levels, small islands or flatbeds in tanks have been submerged. They act as undisturbed resting places and habitats for a lot of birds, including ducks. Birds like pelicans and storks may not be able to catch fish when the water level is high, as fish remain in the deeper portions,” Mr. Prakash added. Meanwhile, this year’s survey results showed an increase in the number of resident birds. The number of resident birds in waterbodies increased from 4,487 of 92 species in 2017 to 6,091 birds of 103 species this year. In total, 7,069 birds of 134 species, both migratory and resident, were recorded this year. Of the total number of species, 45 were water birds and 89 were others. Most populous birds found in this year’s census were the little cormorant (508), cattle egret (498) and barn swallow (405). Among the migrants, barn swallow (405), blue-tailed bee eater (105) and small pratincole (100) were high in numbers. Topping the list Ukkulam, with 67 bird species, topped the list of wetlands for diversity of species, while the Singanallur tank stood first with the highest number of bird counts — 486. Important sightings recorded this year included that of the northern shoveler, northern pintail, temminck’s stint, small pratincole, and the whiskered tern.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-wetlands-record-a-drop-in-migratory-birds/article33806158.ece

The 3,000 to 4,000 rice mills in the State will be processing more paddy this year because of the higher crop. However, most of these mills are small or medium-scale running with less than 112 KW sanctioned demand. These have a capacity to process maximum tonne an hour. Less than 10% of the mills have High Tension (HT) electricity connection. However, mills in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are large-scale with capacity to process 10 tonnes of paddy an hour. These run on HT connections and operate throughout the year. According to K.S. Jagadeesan, honorary president of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners Association, the mills here have been asking the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) permission for sanctioned demand up to 150 KW. They need more electricity as they will be processing more paddy this year. The mills had sought the additional supply at the old rate up to 112 KW and for the additional load at HT rate. However, the Tangedco issued an order recently asking the mills to pay Rs. 350 a KW as fixed charges from 0-150 KW. The mills, whether they are in operation or not, will have to shell out Rs. 45,000 a month approximately towards fixed charges, says Mr. Jagadeesan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rice-mill-owners-seek-reduction-in-electricity-fixed-charges/article33806061.ece

Palaniswami, who claimed to be a farmer, had betrayed the interests of farmers by supporting the Centre’s three farm laws, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam women’s wing secretary and MP M.K. Kanimozhi said while campaigning at Thippampatti, near Pollachi, on Wednesday. The Chief Minister had mortgaged the State’s interests, rights, Tamil pride and self-esteem with the Central Government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to such an extent that he would not speak against the farm laws, she said. Stating there was no development in the State in the last 10 years of AIADMK rule, she said “There has been no investment in the State, youth are without jobs and in such circumstances, people from other States are taking away jobs that belong to Tamils”. Free power Earlier in the day, she told weavers in Malaiyandipattinam that when the DMK returned to power, it would enhance the free power units and build better houses for them. She also said the DMK would look into their demands for pension for weavers over 60 years of age. Later, speaking in Udumalpet, Ms. Kanimozhi said Mr. Palaniswami should not claim to be a farmer, as he had not understood the farmers’ pain. Though not a farmer, DMK president M.K. Stalin understood their pain. Mr. Palaniswami was only keen on retaining power. This was the reason why the AIADMK government had not sincerely probed the circumstances that led to the death of their leader Jayalalithaa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-betrayed-farmers-by-supporting-farm-laws-kanimozhi/article33806075.ece

Chintala told journalists after delivering the inaugural address at the 80th Annual Conference of Indian Society of Agricultural Economics at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University here on Wednesday. The Government, in its 2021-22 Budget, had enhanced capital expenditure by 34.5% to Rs. 5.54 lakh crore, given thrust to monetise assets to achieve the National Infrastructure Pipeline goals and provisioned Rs. 20,000 crore for the Development Financial Institution.

However, they refused and insisted that they be permitted to squat on the roadside without hindrance to the public. Even after 5 p.m., as they refused to disperse, they slept on the roadside throughout the night, Mr. Bagat Singh said and added that they were determined to continue the stir for the second day. However, late in the evening, the officials promised to consider their plea, following which they temporarily called off the demonstration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/differently-abled-persons-squat-throughout-night/article33806163.ece

11 February 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||‘Will never allow a family to take over AIADMK’||Close on the heels of V.K. Sasikala’s return to Tamil Nadu, AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, without naming her, indicated that the party was not ready for any compromise with her family. At a rally in Krishnagiri on Wednesday, he called Ms. Sasikala’s nephew and AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran and “others” as “conspirators scheming to take over the AIADMK”. The AIADMK was a cadre-based party, he said, and “we will never allow a ‘family’ to take over the party and rule the State.” Mr. Palaniswami, who had fallen out with Ms. Sasikala, the former interim general secretary of the party, after she was jailed in a corruption case, said there were some conspirators scheming to take control of the AIADMK. “In 2017, when I took charge as the Chief Minister, the AIADMK was functioning well until some conspirators schemed to lure away 18 MLAs. You know who they are. But the AIADMK remained united. They kept silent for four years, roamed around and now they are back,” he said. “You know, whom I am talking about — T.T.V. Dhinakaran,” he said. Lauds ex-Minister Interestingly, he lauded former Minister and AIADMK deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy, who hails from the region. Mr. Munusamy was the first to trigger a revolt against Ms. Sasikala’s family and then against Mr. Palaniswami himself in support of former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. Later, Mr. Palaniswami accused DMK leader M.K. Stalin of running a “defamatory campaign” against the AIADMK. “But the coming election will put an end to the dynastic politics of the DMK once and for all,” he said.

11 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||ATM trickster arrested at Tirumangalam||A trickster who used to swap ATM cards and withdraw money from the accounts of gullible people in the guise of helping them to operate ATMs in several districts was arrested in Tirumangalam. The police identified the accused as K. Thambiraj (44) of Bodi in Theni district. Interrogation revealed that Thambiraj was involved in 23 cases in which he pretended to be helping people take cash from the ATMs. “He has operated in various places and has been leading a luxurious life with a big house and a car,” said Tirumangalam Deputy Superintendent of Police S.S. Vinothini. The police said his long run came to an end after he made a similar attempt with a head constable, K. Chellapandi, in Tirumangalam on Sunday morning. Thambiraj waiting at the ATM of a nationalised bank on Virudhunagar Road volunteered to help Mr. Chellapandi when the machine did not accept his card. “Within a fraction of a second, he pulled my card and inserted it into the ATM machine. After I punched in my PIN, he returned me the card,” said Mr. Chellapandi. However, later he realised that the man had given him a different ATM card and he had swapped it in a jiff that the head constable did not notice it. On Wednesday, when he was found roaming in a suspicious manner, the police picked him up and he was identified by the victim. During interrogation, it was found that he was in possession of Rs. 1.50 lakh which he had withdrawn using ATM cards of four different persons in the last few days. The police have also seized 52 debit cards from him. The man has also used the debit cards to buy jewellery. “After duping a few people in one place, he would move to some other district,” Ms. Vinothini added. She said further interrogation by police from different districts could solve more such cheating cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/atm-trickster-arrested-at-tirumangalam/article33806381.ece
11 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Nayak period inscription found||Researchers of the Centre for Historical Research, functioning at Mannar Thirumalai Naicker College, discovered an inscription belonging to the Nayak period at Vadivelkarai near here. B. Athmanathan, research coordinator of the centre, and Udhayakumar, research scholar at Government Arts College, Melur, found the inscription based on the information provided by Alagumalaikannan, an alumnus of Mannar Thirumalai Naicker College. The Centre for Historical Research was functioning under the guidance of college secretary M. Vijayaraghavan, said Mr. Athmanathan. The inscription, which dated back to around 1558 Common Era, was about a charter issued during that period, said Mr. Athmanathan. The initial lines of the inscription were in Sanskrit which had information about the owner of the inscription. “However, the characters were unclear and hence the owner of the inscription cannot be identified,” he said. The charter was issued in the name of a Siva temple. A devadasi of the temple, Sokki Thummisi, donated land located on the outskirts of Thattankulam to one Manickam. This charter was written by Vinotha Brahmathirajan. When the inscription was made, Sadasivaraya was the ruler of Vijayanagar and Visvanatha Nayak ruled Madurai, said Mr. Athmanathan. The inscription was deciphered by S. Rajagopal, former senior epigraphist of Archaeological Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nayak-period-inscription-found/article33806384.ece
11 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Don’t mislead people, Minister tells Kanimozhi||Under the Smart City Project, Madurai was witnessing a transformation: new bridges were coming up; roads were widened; paver blocks were laid on Masi streets; underground drainage work was going on in new wards; and many other projects were in the pipeline, but DMK MP Kanimozhi was misleading the people on the development of the city, said Minister for Cooperation Sellur K. Raju. Speaking to reporters after distributing free bicycles to 2,000 students from 15 schools here on Wednesday, he said after nearly four decades, Madurai was getting a facelift through different projects. Even recently, the media had highlighted the inconvenience caused to vehicle users on many stretches due to development works. “We have also told the contractors to expedite the works and minimise the hardships faced by the people,” he said. Opposition party leaders were welcome to criticise the government, but they could not say that nothing was happening when the governments had invested about Rs. 1,000 crore under the Smart City initiative. “Already, the people had got a bad image of the DMK. If such misleading statements are made, the party will turn out to be a laughing stock among the informed sections of society,” Mr. Raju said. Refusing to be drawn to queries on V.K. Sasikala and T.T.V. Dhinakaran, the Minister said the government had kept the promises made by late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. Unable to stomach AIADMK’s popularity among the masses, Ms. Kanimozhi, who was in the city for the last two days, had made false allegations that the party had done nothing to improve the standards of living of the common man here. Admitting that the Smart City projects had caused some difficulties for the people, he said a few projects in Periyar bus stand area would get over in about a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dont-mislead-people-minister-tells-kanimozhi/article33806386.ece

On January 9, tension had prevailed in Tiruppalai as BJP cadres had erected flags and loudspeakers near a masjid as part of Pongal celebrations. Though the flags and the loudspeakers were removed by police, drum-beating at the event could not be stopped. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar granted anticipatory bail to A. Abuthahir, M. Diwan Mohammed, S. Mohammed Pilal and A. Harun. The judge took note of the fact that no one was injured in the incident and only a notice of appearance had been issued by the police. He also took note of the fact that the four men had been previously involved only in staging protests in support of jallikattu and against the new farm laws. The State and the BJP opposed the grant of anticipatory bail to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/advance-bail-for-four-in-bjp-office-attack-case/article33806390.ece

This was false, the petitioner said. Hearing the public interest litigation petition, a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi directed the government to consider the representation sent by advocate I. Mohammed Razvi of Madurai. He said no such title was conferred on Periyar. He blamed the DMK for the misinformation and said that this had to be rectified. During the course of the hearing, the State submitted that there was a committee already in place to look into such issues. The court directed the authorities concerned to look into the representation sent by the advocate and pass appropriate orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-wrong-information-on-periyar/article33806388.ece

11 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC orders CBI probe into elephant poaching incidents||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into a series of elephant poaching incidents reported in the State. Most of the incidents took place for over a decade prior to 2015 and allegedly involved influential persons from across the country. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and N. Sathish Kumar observed that the crimes indicated that the network involved cut across boundaries. This was not a mere case of poaching, but a demand was created by unknown customers and these names would tumble out after the investigation. The court took note of the report submitted by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which had carried out an extensive study in the case. Statements by the accused in the case revealed that the customers included influential people and an extract from the diary of one of the accused revealed contact numbers and bank transactions. Expressing shock over the details, the judges observed that the greed of man could be seen in the transactions. The poaching was done not for livelihood, but for international trade and sadistic pleasure in creating art out of fellow living beings. The amount of ivory recovered in the cases were too large, the judges said. Pointing to one case, the judges said that as per the report, 300 kg of ivory was recovered and eight male elephants had been killed. Though the State submitted that arrests were made in these cases, the judges said they were at the bottom of the chain and the middlemen and kingpins were left untouched. Though the report was made available in 2019, the authorities concerned took a furtive look and remained ignorant, the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cbi-probe-ordered-into-elephant-poaching/article33806051.ece
11 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||CM seeks President’s intervention in recalling Lt. Governor||Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday once again sought the intervention of President Ram Nath Kovind in recalling Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi who, he said, “has been functioning as a typical autocrat in violation of constitutional provisions and the rule of law.” In a five-page memorandum submitted to the President on Wednesday, the Chief Minister said the happenings in Puducherry were “nothing but a brutal murder of democracy” and “being the custodian of the Constitution, we humbly request [you] to kindly intervene into the issue to save democracy, federal structure and people of Puducherry by removing Ms. Bedi”. The Lt. Governor was taking “unilateral” decisions on administrative, financial and policy matters, in violation of business rules and Constitutional principles, he alleged. “Ms. Bedi is running a Tughlaq Darbar in an undemocratic (manner) and in violation of the rule of law. For instance, when a file related to the closure of government press was received, me as Chief Minister and the Minister in-charge decided to maintain status quo, but the Lt. Governor unilaterally decided and issued orders to close the press. But when I wrote to the Union Home Ministry, explaining the situation, Ms. Bedi then withdrew the order, creating unnecessary chaos in the administration,” the memorandum said. Citing several instances of her “interference” which led to stalling of schemes, the Chief Minister said the Cabinet took a decision to provide 10% horizontal reservation within the State quota to government school students in medical admissions. The Lt. Governor reserved the Cabinet decision for the consideration of the Union Government, he said. In Tamil Nadu too, a decision to provide 7.5 % reservation to government school students in medical admissions was delayed by the Tamil Nadu Governor. But when the Madras High Court expressed displeasure on the delaying act, the Governor immediately gave his assent, he claimed. “Ms. Bedi, while keeping the proposal of the Government of Puducherry pending, pressed the officials to complete the MBBS admission procedure immediately and thereby betrayed the poor backward government school students,” he charged in the memorandum. Cabinet decisions Many Cabinet decisions such as the implementation of the Universal Health Scheme, distribution of mobile tablets to assist students in e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic time, distribution of free rice, grant of enhanced pension to fishermen, transfer of SEZ land for industrial development, construction of a flood protection wall in Yanam, VRS for textile mill employees and re-delegation of power to Ministers were delayed or modified in violation of the Rules of Business, he alleged. “Even during the French regime, we were not ill-treated like this. They respected the people and never treated us as slaves,” he said. Urging the President to recall her, the Chief Minister said such a decision would uphold the dignity of the post of the Lt Governor. Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao, Minister for Social Welfare M. Kandasamy and Member of Parliament V. Vaithilingam were present with the Chief Minister. Later in the day, the Chief Minister and the Social Welfare Minister met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Zubin Irani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-seeks-presidents-intervention-in-recalling-lt-governor/article33806478.ece
11 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||New thrust on ease of doing business for industries in U.T.||The Union Territory government has given a new thrust to improving the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) to provide a hassle-free environment for industries to set up shop and grow unhindered, according to the Industries Department. E. Vallavan, Industries Secretary, said the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) had in 2014 notified the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) to ease regulation and licensing procedures and bring in a conductive environment for doing business across the country. During 2020, DPIIT had notified 301 reforms for implementation by 20 stakeholder departments. The government adopted 258 reforms and action is being taken to achieve the remaining 43 by the end of March, he said. However, the implementation of 258 reforms is awaiting approval of the DPIIT, he added. Steps are being taken to submit the renewed/modified evidence to clear the clarifications raised by the DPIIT. Migrating factories’ licence process and issuing all licences through DSTE online are among the reforms that have been undertaken. The validity of licences has also been extended. Further, to ease the process, an auto renewal system on payment of fees has been set up. Centralised inspection Besides, to avoid hardships faced by entrepreneurs in inspections made by different departments on different days, systems have been developed to perform a centralised inspection and share the report with line departments online. Steps have been taken to allow self certification/third-party certification instead of departmental inspections. Mr. Vallavan said the ranking of the Union Territory at the national level was expected to improve in relation to previous years, attract more investments/industries and create more employment. Earlier, after a review at the Raj Nivas, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi said the departments that are yet to complete the reform points should indicate the reasons thereof and the timelines by which the reform points would be implemented. Third-party auditors would be appointed by the Secretary (Industries) to assess the quality of implementation of reform points under Ease of Doing Business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-thrust-on-ease-of-doing-business-for-industries-in-ut/article33806473.ece

AICC secretary Sanjay Dutt, while launching the programme along with PCC president A. V Subramanian at the party office, said the country was going through a difficult situation where all democratic institutions and principles were being demolished by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government. The campaign, ‘Join Congress Social Media’, planned to recruit 5 lakh social media warriors to fight against the policies of the Union Government. After scrutiny of the recruited persons, 50,000 people will be made office-bearers, he said. The only way to fight the “authoritarian” attitude of the Centre was to unite the people and bring them on a common platform, he said. The awareness campaign would be held for a month followed by screening, interviews and training programmes. After the launch of the nation-wide programme in New Delhi recently, the party had received several responses from the Union Territory, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aicc-launches-campaign-to-recruit-social-media-warriors/article33806480.ece

Narayanasamy and other Ministers that she was holding up files and obstructing governance were untrue. In response to the Chief Minister’s remark at a press conference the other day that the file for relaying roads damaged by Cyclone Nivar was yet to be approved by the Lt. Governor, Ms. Bedi said there “was no such matter pending before me”. Accusing the Chief Minister of spreading misinformation and misleading people repeatedly, Ms. Bedi said that in this case, tenders had been called for and relaying works were on. In an apparent reference to Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy’s recent demand for increased powers for the Cabinet through an amendment to the Union Territory Act and Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao’s remarks that it was pointless to get elected without the power to execute responsibilities, Ms. Bedi said that the discomfiture “among certain class of people could be due to the digital transformations that had broken through monopolies and made the administration direct, transparent and accountable”. Ms. Bedi said every time the power and responsibility of the Lt. Governor under the Union Territory Act, General Financial Rules or Business Rules was challenged, the position of the Lt. Governor had been reinforced be it by the Supreme Court, Madras High Court or the Government of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/charges-of-delaying-files-untrue-says-lg/article33806482.ece

No one could create a split in the party.” Mr. Palaniswami, who interacted with party functionaries at Omalur and reviewed the preparations for the Assembly election, told journalists that the AIADMK and the AMMK were different entities.

Dhinakaran, he said Mr. Dhinakaran was the one who tried to topple the AIADMK government and split it by poaching 18 MLAs. “Then, he started his own party, the AMMK. That is why he is being criticised,” he said.

11 February 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||E.V. Ramasamy called DMK corrupt: H. Raja||Senior BJP leader H. Raja on Wednesday said the DMK had no right to talk about corruption and claimed that Dravidar Kazhagam founder E.V. Ramasamy (Periyar) had dubbed the DMK a corrupt party. Mr. Raja, who was in Salem to interact with members of the weaving community, at a media interaction claimed that in 1964 “E. V. Ramasamy gave an interview that the DMK had turned into a corrupt party. He said those who were riding bicycles are travelling in luxury cars now.” Citing the pending appeal in the 2G spectrum allocation case against the acquittal of former Telecom Minister A. Raja and DMK women’s wing leader Kanimozhi, both Lok Sabha members, the BJP leader claimed two Lok Sabha seats would fall vacant in Tamil Nadu on March 15. According to him, the people were aware that the DMK should not return to power as some of its functionaries had faced land grabbing charges earlier. Backing the Salem-Chennai green expressway project, he contended that land was being acquired after offering “proper compensation”. He said while the erstwhile UPA regime had waived farm loans to the tune of about Rs. 62,000 crore in a decade, the BJP-led Centre is now paying Rs. 6,000 per annum to nine crore farmers. So far, Rs. 95,000 crore has been disbursed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ev-ramasamy-called-dmk-corrupt-h-raja/article33806185.ece

11 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Builders prefer M-sand||Acute shortage of sand and a steep rise in price has forced builders and engineers to depend substantially on manufactured sand (M-sand) in Tiruchi. Until recently, sand was the only option for plastering and concrete mixing. There were days when a load of two units of sand sourced from the Cauvery or Kollidam beds was available for Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 as it was available in plenty in the upper and lower reaches of the Cauvery in Tiruchi about 20 years ago. It shot up gradually over the period up to Rs. 30,000 per load (2 units). Though there is still a demand for river sand irrespective of the high rate, builders find it extremely difficult to source it as the Public Works Department had closed down most of sand reaches in Tiruchi and Karur districts due to stiff opposition from farmers and litigation against sand-quarrying. Sourcing sand through bullock cart is the only option available to the builders. If they want to mobilise sand, they will have to wait for days together. Acute shortage of river sand, concern over exploitation of rivers for sand mining, litigation against sand quarrying and steep hike in prices have led the builders to shift their attention to M-sand and plastering sand (P-sand). Some builders, who began to use M-sand as a temporary measure, now prefer it. “There are individual house constructors, who still prefer river sand. But, it is a tough task to source sand. We do not have options but to convince our customers to use manufactured sand,” says A. Selvakumar, a building contractor in Srirangam. Builders say that there is no problem in sourcing M-sand. It is cheaper. A load (four units) of M-sand is available for Rs. 15,000 in Tiruchi. The rate of P-sand hovers around Rs. 16,000 for a load. P. Dharmar, a supplier of construction materials in Thiruvanaikoil, said that since the rate of river sand was more than double to that of M-sand, buyers invariably preferred M-sand. Many builders and engineers had switched over to M-sand. It had become an organised trade. It was available in plenty in Karur, Perambalur and Pudukottai districts, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/builders-prefer-m-sand/article33806146.ece
11 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Residents reiterate plea for service roads||Members of Federation for Retrieval of Tiruchi Palpannai to Thuvakudi Service Road staged a protest outside the Tiruverumbur taluk office on Wednesday demanding construction of service lanes along the city stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur National Highway at the earliest. They said that absence of service lanes had caused several accidents and assailed what they described as inadequate action by the government departments to carry out construction work. The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court had, in October, 2019, directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take expeditious steps to build service lanes along the 14-km city stretch of the highway between Thuvakudi and Palpannai in Tiruchi. The Bench said that it hoped and trusted that the service road would be formed within six months. However, over a year later, land acquisition process for the project was still under way, they said. S. Saktivel, an organiser of the federation, an umbrella organisation of residents’ associations formed to fight for the cause, said that only 5% of the work has so far been completed. ‘It has taken them five months to issue a notice to acquire the land. Only one team is conducting a land survey and issuing notices. Had they appointed many teams across the several villages, work could have been carried out quickly,’ he said. Stiff opposition from local traders has been an impediment, he added. ‘The road benefit residents of several localities. However, selfish motive of traders had stalled the project for years,’ he added. The residents alleged accidents had become frequent due to the absence of service lanes. ‘Accidents take place every other day, often leading to deaths, or severe, irreversible injuries,’ they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-reiterate-plea-for-service-roads/article33806527.ece

The protesters said Mr. Kalyanaraman, through his repeated derogatory remarks against Islam and Prophet Mohammed, was inciting communal hatred with the objective of triggering a clash between the Hindus and the Muslims.

With mock dressings for ‘injuries’ they had suffered in road accidents due to the potholes and trenches, the CPI (M) cadres raised slogans demanding the immediate repairing of all roads in the city. After the monsoon and the unseasonal rains in January, most of the roads in the city are in an unmotorable condition to cause accidents every day. Apart from the roads being maintained by the Corporation, the busy roads under the control of Department of State Highways are in the worst shape. Though a couple of thousands of vehicles are using the Tiruchendur highway being maintained by the State Highways, no step has been taken to repair the road after the rains.  “Both the Corporation and the Department of State Highways are in no mood to repair the damaged roads even after several accidents involving ordinary people travelling on bikes.

Palaniswami on Wednesday expressed optimism that his party would win the 2021 Assembly election, for the third consecutive term. Addressing a gathering near Sacred Heart College in Tirupathur on the second day of his campaign in Ranipet, Vellore and Tirupathur districts, he recalled that when he took over in February 2017, DMK president M.K. Stalin had said the government would collapse in a few months. “But we are completing four years, and will enter the fifth year. Next time too, we will come to power. This is because of the schemes we have implemented,” he said. The Chief Minister pointed out that his government had trifurcated Vellore and formed Tirupathur as a separate district (besides Ranipet). “Now people do not have to travel 70 km [to the Collectorate] and submit petitions. We are implementing a lot of welfare measures, but Mr. Stalin is not aware of them.” According to him, the DMK was enacting a drama on the release of the seven life convicts in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. When the DMK was in power in 2000, it did not take any action for their release, he said. “The AIADMK has always been fighting for their release.” Infrastructure works Outlining some schemes at Tirupathur, he said the road connecting Vaniyambadi Kootu Road and Uthankarai, near Salem, would be made into a four-lane road. “The work will start soon on the Rs. 299 crore project.

In a press release, its State deputy secretary P.S.Masilamani expressed resentment over the circular issued on February 9 to cooperative institutions stating that the crop loans re-structured in view of the crop loss suffered by the farmers due to drought would not be considered for the waiver under the present scheme. The government re-structured crop in 2017 overlooking the demand for waiver of crop loan; it was unfair to exclude those outstanding loans from the ambit of the present waiver scheme though the crop loss suffered by the farmers in 2017 was compensated to some extent by the government. It should prevail upon the Union government to get the overdue crop loans in the scheduled commercial banks waived. Meanwhile, the Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association urged the government to appreciate those farmers who had repaid the dues. It urged the government to withdraw the appeal petition filed in the Apex Court refusing to extend the crop loan waiver scheme benefit to medium and large farmers who have taken such loans in the year 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-extend-crop-loan-waiver-scheme/article33806150.ece

It wanted the Commission to disallow parties from making “unimplementable” promises. NCP representative G.P. Sarathy preferred a return to ballot papers, while Trinamool Congress’s A. Kalaivanan sought updating of the electoral rolls. The Commission will hold meetings with Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan and senior officials on Thursday, before leaving for Puducherry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-parties-divided-over-postal-ballots/article33806014.ece
11 February 2021||belagavi,KARNATAKA||MLA urges Yediyurappa to allocate funds for Belagavi Ring Road project||Abhay Patil, MLA, has appealed to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to allocate funds for the pending Ring Road project for Belagavi city. The 69-kilometre ring road was approved under the Bharatmala-6 Project in 2017. As per the scheme, the Centre and the State have to bear the costs equally. In a meeting with industrialists and engineers on Wednesday, Mr. Patil announced that he was hopeful of the project getting substantial funding in the State Budget likely to be presented in March. Technical associations had requested the State government to speed up the project. It was first envisaged and a Detailed Project Report was prepared in 2017. As many as nine realignments were studied which would connect it with the Pune- Bengaluru national highway and ease the traffic load in the city. The project has been divided into three separate packages for ease of execution. The MLA said he had requested the CM and the Chief Secretary to include Rs. 190 crore as the share of the land acquisition cost. This is likely to be accepted, he said. A consent letter is being sent to NHAI from the State towards this, he said. Once this happens, the process of land acquisition process will begin. The tenders would be opened. It could be a public-private participation model or another suitable model, he said. “Of the 69 km, around 11 km will be on forest land. In the first phase we are targeting 58 km in the first 24 months. Efforts will be made to obtain forest approvals simultaneously. However, even if one part of the project is delayed, it would reduce the traffic in the city as the other two parts would be completed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mla-urges-yediyurappa-to-allocate-funds-for-belagavi-ring-road-project/article33806202.ece

11 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC: Delay in getting FSL reports has hit criminal justice system||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday said the criminal justice system in the State had been severely crippled owing to gross delay in getting forensic reports while expressing “shock” over the pendency of around 35,000 samples related to nearly 7,000 criminal cases for testing before the Forensic Sciences Laboratories (FSLs). The court directed the State government and the director of FSL to come out with measures to swiftly fill up all the vacancies, set up all testing units in every FLS, fix timeline for completing forensic analysis, and provide FSLs with modern infrastructure and equipment. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the directions on a petition, initiated suo motu .The petition was initiated based on an order passed by a judge who had pointed out that both the victims of crime as well as the accused were being deprived of the right to speedy justice, including for grant of bail and the trial, owing to gross delay in submission of reports by FSLs. The Division Bench, referring to the data of samples pending for tests with the FLSs submitted before the single judge, has noted that 35,738 articles involved in 6,994 criminal cases are pending for sample analysis before the State FSL in Bengaluru and five Regional Forensic Science Laboratories (RFSLs) in Mysuru, Mangaluru, Davangere, Belagavi, and Kalaburagi. Noticing from the data that there are 6,868 articles in 1,119 cases related to narcotics drugs, and 9,958 questioned documents pending for analysis before the FSLs as on November 30, 2020, the court expressed concern over pendency of samples for test in serious offences such as murder and those under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. As many 774 cases under the NDPC Act, 130 casesunder POCSO Act, 95 cases of rape, 700 cases of unnatural death, and 471 cases of murder are among the 4,532 cases pending for trial on account of the non-receipt of reports from FSLs, the court noted. The court also viewed seriously the fact that FSLs are taking 12 to 18 months to complete DNA test, and test narcotics and questioned documents while noticing the absence of a guideline on timeline for completionand monitoring of tests once samples reach the FLSs. Besides, the court noted that only two of the 13 testing sections are available in the RFSLs. Data on vacancies From the data, the court noted that FSLs lack sufficient human resources owing to vacancies as all three posts (100%) of joint director are vacant; five out of the 10 posts (50%) of deputy director; 18 of the 46 posts (40%) of assistant director; 35 out of the 88 posts (40%) of senior scientific officer; and 138 of the 186 posts (75%) of scientific officer are vacant. Facts of pending samples and vacancies in FSLs disclose “sorry state of affairs”, and failure of the government to provide necessary infrastructure would have direct bearing on the criminal justice system, the court observed while directing the government to take a call on setting up more RFSLs or mobile FSL units for conducting elementary tests such on blood samples and stains, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-delay-in-getting-fsl-reports-has-hit-criminal-justice-system/article33805996.ece
11 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Threat of second wave of COVID-19 still exists: Experts||Although there has been a marked slowdown in the new COVID-19 cases reported daily, experts say it is too early to heave a sigh of relief. The threat of a second wave still persists and the next four weeks are crucial, they say. While a second wave was expected in January, Karnataka has so far not seen a new outbreak. But, this does not mean that there will not be another surge in cases. Especially with cinema halls now permitted to function with 100% seating capacity and swimming pools and educational institutions opened, there are possibilities of the State witnessing super spreader events if COVID-19 protocol is not followed, experts say. However, the intensity of a second wave may not be the same as the initial outbreak, they said. M.K. Sudharshan, chairman, State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said, “While cinema halls, swimming pools and educational institutions have been opened, movement of students from Kerala, where the situation has gone out of control, is also a concern. We will have to wait and watch for the next four weeks. The TAC will review the situation by the end of this month.”  “We have noticed that the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of 6.8% is reported in RT-PCR tests done in four nursing institutions and two engineering institutions in Mangaluru since December 25. This is very high as compared to the State average TPR of less than 1%. It is pertinent here to note that the majority of the students testing positive are from Kerala,” he said. The TAC chairman said the State will now do genome sequencing of the samples of students from Kerala to check for a new variant. “We want to ensure that Kerala’s spill over in Karnataka does not trigger cluster outbreaks. From now, a RT-PCR negative test report that is not older than 72 hours is compulsory for students coming from Kerala. People should not become complacent and continue to follow COVID-19 precautions,” he said. TAC member Giridhara R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health, said Kerala has been seeing multiple outbreaks in the schools that opened up. “The recommendations of the TAC are always cautiously optimistic. The implementation of these recommendations has not been uniform. However, due to the combined approach of the technical advice and great implementation, Karnataka has delayed the onset of a second wave. If everything is opened up without any caution, we may have the second wave in the next three-four weeks,” he said.. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said that even if there is a second wave, it may not be as severe as the initial outbreak. “Although there was a fear of a surge in cases during gram panchayat elections, bypolls and several large protest gatherings, it did not happen. But, it does not mean the crisis is over. Hopefully if we continue to maintain the low prevalence rate for the next three to four months, we can have a sigh of relief. By then a sizeable chunk of the population will also be vaccinated,” Dr. Manjunath added.

The status report submitted by Harsh Gupta, who is the Special Officer and Competent Authority in IMA cases, also said that the first stage verifications of around 45,000 claimants has been completed, and the remaining claimants would be verified within a month. The status report was submitted before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum during the hearing of PIL petitions though which the HC is monitoring the progress made in the investigation of criminal cases against IMA and the process initiated to protect the interest of the investors. “As per the verification, the net principal payable to the claimants is Rs. 2,646 crore, which is marginally less than the claim amount of Rs. 2,695.13 crore. Further, net payable to the claimants is likely to be about Rs. 1,372 crore after adjusting the payouts received by the depositors from the IMA group,” the report stated. Forensic auditors have been asked to confirm the verification and their report is likely to be received in a week’s time, the report stated. The Special Court’s permission has also been sought for settlement of claims in the order of priority, which is in ascending order of eligible claim amounts that enables completely settling 11,492 smaller depositors’ accounts by paying amounts less than or equal to Rs. 50,000 with a total amount of Rs. 32 crore, it has been stated in the report.

11 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fee dilemma: Minister asks for suggestions||A day after private schools threatened to stage a protest against the government’s decision to reduce tuition fee, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Wednesday invited school managements to come up with suggestions if they had any. The department had issued an order urging private schools to collect only 70% of the tuition fee. The Minister said the decision was taken after consultation with all the stakeholders. “We had given enough time to the school managements and parents to come to a conclusion over fee issues. But they failed to arrive at any decision, following which the department convened a meeting and submitted recommendations to the government,” he said. Letter to Minister The Alliance for #RightToLearn, a group of 40 unaided private Central board and international schools, has written to Mr. Kumar urging him to withdraw the order on fee. It said that the schools had already offered financial aid to parents of students. “With 2,747 students not being in a position to pay even 70% of the tuition fee, over Rs. 16.34 crore in tuition fee has been waived off collectively across the schools, which is an average of over 7% for each school. We have over Rs. 48 crore in outstanding fee,” a release from the alliance stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fee-dilemma-minister-asks-for-suggestions/article33806003.ece
11 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RTC employees stage protest, services remain unaffected||Road Transport Corporation employees staged a protest on Wednesday with a list of demands including timely payment of salaries, reduction in work hours and restarting operations for the entire fleet of BMTC buses. They also want BMTC to drop its plan to lease electric buses from private operators. Due to poor fare revenue after COVID-19, Road Transport Corporations (RTCs) have been relying on the State government for the salaries of over 1.3 lakh employees, who are yet to get full salaries for the months of December and January. Later in the day, union leaders from the Joint Forum of Road Transport Corporation Employees’ associations, met the chairperson and MD of BMTC. H.D. Revappa, a union leader said, “During the interaction, we were assured that pending salaries will be credited in a week. We were also told that our demand to reduce work hours from 12 to eight will also be looked into.” To reduce its financial burden, BMTC had recently introduced a general shift where bus crew had to work for 12 hours with a break of three to four hours in between. Many female conductors had appealed to the State government seeking a return to pre-COVID-19 work hours. BMTC chairman N.S. Nandiesha Reddy told The Hindu that a decision has already been taken to reduce work hours for female employees to eight hours. “I had a meeting with them in this regard. There are 1,500 women conductors working in the corporation, and in their interest we will introduce eight-hour shifts for them,” he said. He said that since the pandemic, the State government has paid salaries for nine months and pending salaries of the staff would be paid when transport corporations received the funds.  ‘Merge corporations’ Meanwhile, the KSRTC Staff and Workers Federation, in a letter addressed to the Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi, demanded that the State government merge all four RTCs into one, allocate Rs. 1,000 crore in the budget to RTCs, pay staff their salaries and exempt them from paying toll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmtc-offers-to-reduce-work-hours-for-female-conductors/article33805988.ece

11 February 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Kore: Late seer had voluntarily donated land to KLE Society||Reacting to the ongoing controversy surrounding the issue of donation of Moorusavir Mutt land to the KLE Society, chairman of KLE Society and former Rajya Sabha member Prabhakar Kore on Wednesday has clarified that late seer of the mutt Gangadhara Rajayogindra Swami had voluntarily donated the mutt land to the society. Addressing presspersons along with directors of the society and Mahanthesh Kavatagimath, MLC, and Shankrananna Munavalli in Hubballi on Wednesday, Mr. Kore categorically stated that KLE Society belonged to society and, through donations from mutts and individuals it had been able to set up educational institutions across the State. Mr. Kore said that there was nothing illegal in the land donation by the late seer and that the seer had got the donation of 23.15 acres of land registered before the Charity Commissioner, Belagavi, in 2003 itself. Mr. Kore clarified that the land donation was in no way related to the Arbitration Agreement reached between the present seer Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami and Rudramuni Swami of Tipatur. “The donation was made by the seer before the Charity Commissioner and subsequently in 2009, we got the same registered before the Sub-Registrar to which the present seer signed. In no way the donation violates the arbitration agreement between the two seers,” he said. Elaborating on the discussions preceding the land donation, Mr. Kore said that the society had in fact asked the seer to establish a medical college in Hubballi utilising the mutt’s land. “However the seer, in turn told us to establish the college and he would donate the mutt’s land, which at that point of time was in the possession of Asundi family (family of farmers). We convinced the Asundi family to hand over the possession of the land to the mutt. After much convincing, they handed over 23.15 acres out of the total 38 acres. Later the seer donated the land to KLE Society in 2003. However because of technicalities involved in getting various permissions from government the project got delayed,” he said. To a query, he said that Sri Dingaleshwara Swami of Balehosur Mutt was misleading the public on the issue and the society had not done anything illegal. Mr. Kore said he had not seen the face of the seer and sought to know in what way the seer was related to the issue. He clarified that a high-level committee of the Moorusavir Mutt was in no way related to the land donation. Clarifying that there was no question of giving back the land, Mr. Kore said that they had already begun work on building the medical college and they would get it ready within one-and-a-half years and dedicate it to the service of residents of the region. Mr. Kavatagimath condemned the tone and tenor of the speech of Dingaleshwara Swami on the issue and said it was unbecoming of a seer to speak in such language. “I would appeal to him to stop making such baseless allegations. And it is not right to claim the post of successor when the present seer was still willing to function as head of the mutt. It is for the society to decide on the issue,” he said. To a query, Shankranna Munavalli, who is also a member of the high-level committee of Moorusavir Mutt, said that soon he would take up the issue with other members and make the stand clear. It might be recalled that former Minister Basavraj Horatti too has urged for a meeting of the committee in the wake of the row.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kore-late-seer-had-voluntarily-donated-land-to-kle-society/article33806199.ece

11 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Creating board for arecanut is not a priority, says Centre||The Union government has said that creating a separate board for arecanut is not a priority for it. At the same time it has said that arecanut production in Karnataka, which contributes about 75% to the domestic production, witnessed a growth of 95% during the last five years. In a written reply to unstarred questions by the Member of Parliament K.C. Ramamurthy in the Rajya Sabha on February 5, the Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar said that the total production in the State touched 8.5 lakh tonnes in 2019-20 from 4.36 lakh tonnes in 2015-16, thus posting a growth of 94.95 %. The Minister said that the area and production of arecanut has been revised from 2018-19 onwards in Karnataka, based on the complete enumeration using GPS-enabled mobile app for estimation of area under different crops. When the member wanted to know the constraints faced by the Ministry in constituting an Arecanut Board on the lines of Coffee Board, Rubber Board, Tea Board, and Tobacco Board the Minister replied: “There are already a number of agencies such as Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development (DASD), Central Plantation Crop Research Institute (CPCRI), Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Co-operative Ltd.(CAMPCO), which are working to promote arecanut and protect interests of arecanut farmers. Hence creation of a separate board for arecanut does not become a priority”. The Minister said that total arecanut production in the country witnessed a growth of 55% in the last five years. It increased from 7.13 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 11.07 lakh tonnes in 2019-20, registering a growth of 55.25 %. Mr. Tomar said that Karnataka, Assam, Kerala, Tripura, Meghalaya, and West Bengal are the major producers of arecanut in the country. “India is not a leader in arecanut export in the world. Most of the arecanut produced in the country is consumed domestically and India’s share of export in global market is less than 5%,” he said. According to the reply, Kerala and Meghalaya saw a decline in arecanut production during the period between 2015-16 and 2019-20. The production came down from 1.02 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 63,000 tonnes in 2019-20 in Kerala. In Meghalaya, the production dipped to 24,010 tonnes in 2019-20 as against 26,200 tonnes in 2015-16. The Minister said that the Union government had given approval for procurement of arecanut under the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) in Karnataka, during January 2017. It gave special package for crop affected by fruit-rot disease in Karnataka in 2007-08, and Yellow Leaf Disease in Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts in 2009-10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/creating-board-for-arecanut-is-not-a-priority-says-centre/article33806401.ece

The drive to collect donations for the mandir will continue till February 27, he added. Speaking at the mutt in Udupi on Tuesday after accepting donations by the people of Udupi, the seer said that the aim is not only building Ram Mandir but also developing the country as a Rama Rajya. He said that not only Hindus but people from other religions have contributed their share to the trust. The drive to collect the funds had been launched on January 15. He has so far travelled Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka to raise the funds and the response has been good. Now the excavation work at the site in Ayodhya for building the temple was on, the seer said. Referring to caste-based reservation system in the country, the swami said that the reservation system should help economically-weaker sections and it should not have been based on caste. The government should change its policy on the same. Farm laws Referring to the ongoing protests against the new farm laws, he said that the farmer groups should participate in the talks whenever invited by the government.

With this, the prices of white arecanut witnessed a 25% increase in just over a month. Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO), Mangaluru offered Rs. 475 to Rs. 500 a kg for the old stocks which are called ‘chol’. The cooperative quoted Rs. 375 to Rs. 415 a kg for ‘hosa adike’ (new stocks) of arecanut being harvested since past three months. When compared to the prices during the first week in January, the prices of old stocks jumped by 25% (by Rs. 100 per kg) and that of new stocks went up by 24% (by Rs. 80 a kg) on Wednesday. The prices of old stocks stood at Rs. 400 a kg and new stocks fetched Rs. 335 a kg on January 2, 2021, sources in the CAMPCO told The Hindu . Vice-president of CAMPCO Khandige Shankaranarayana Bhat termed the prevailing prices as all-time high in the annals of arecanut market. But incidentally not many farmers have maintained old stocks with them, he said. Likely reasons Mr. Bhat attributed the upward trend in prices to shortage in production and negligible imports since the lockdown last year. Since imports are minimal, the consumer market in north India is entirely dependent on domestic supply which is not up to the tune of the demand. There is no glut of imported arecanut in the market. Kole roga (fruit rot disease) which hit arecanut plantations on a vast scale in the 2018 and 2019 rainy season resulted in crop loss thus creating scarcity now in the supply of old stocks. Mr. Bhat said that the unprecedented hike has posed a threat on maintaining the quality of arecanut. Explaining it, he said that the newly harvested arecanut will have to be dried up to 50 days or 60 days and only then should be sold to maintain the quality. But since the new stocks are now fetching a price which farmers earlier never got, there is a threat of farmers drying it up for only one month and releasing the same to the market. If such produce is released to the market there is the danger of non-availability of quality arecanut in the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/white-arecanut-prices-touch-rs-500-a-kg-in-coastal-belt/article33806400.ece
11 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||NH project: Land losers seek fair compensation||The losers of the land in Mangaluru and Moodbidri taluks for the proposed four-laning of the Mangaluru- Moodbidri National Highway (NH) 169 have demanded payment of compensation as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act. Talking to reporters here on Wednesday, Mariyanna Thomas, a former councillor and member of Rashtriya Heddari 169 (13) Mangaluru- Moodidri Raste Agalikarana Bhoomalakara Horata Samiti, said the land losers from Mangaluru and Moodbidri have been waiting for just compensation since the start of acquisition process in 2015. “We want compensation as per the RFCTLARR Act. We cannot accept any other form of calculation,” she said. Residents of Addoru, Padavu, Badagulipady, Badaga Yedapadavu, Kandavara, Kudupu, Mooduperar, and Mooluru, Tenkulipady villages of Mangaluru taluk and of Badagamijar, Belvai, Marpady, Padumarnad, Puttige, Tenkamijar, and Todar villages of Moodbidri taluk will lose land. Following the final notification for acquisition, the Special Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO) carried out the survey of lands and properties and passed the final award. This was sent to the Project Director of NHAI, Mangaluru, who returned it to the SLAO on December 23, 2020, asking him to fix the compensation as per the guidelines of Central Valuation Committee (CVC) . The DC on December 29, 2020, wrote to the Regional Officer of the NHAI in Bengaluru to pay compensation as per the RFCTLARR Act. The Regional Officer of NHAI wrote to the Additional Chief Secretary, PWD, asking the latter to direct the DC to fix the compensation as per the CVC guidelines. Ms. Thomas said the SLAO is the competent authority and had has to pass compensation award as per the RFCTLARR Act. When the RFCTLARR is in force there was no question of fixing compensation as per CVC guidelines that do not take market value of properties into consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nh-project-land-losers-seek-fair-compensation/article33806405.ece

11 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Saying ‘no’ to plastic||Despite ban on the use of plastic bags below 50 microns, there has been rampant use of the banned plastic in markets, and other places, flouting the rules and thereby increasing the generation of plastic waste here. In this connection, the Mysuru City Corporation, as a part of ongoing Swachh Survekshan-2021, conducted an awareness drive on saying no to plastic bags and encouraging use of cloth at the Devaraja Market area here on Wednesday. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, humorist Krishne Gowda, MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde, MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj and others were present. On the occasion, Ms. Sindhuri and Mr. Gowda gave away cloth bags to the shoppers in a symbolic way to send a message to the public on their responsibility in joining the fight against plastic and using cloth and other eco-friendly bags while going on shopping instead of depending on plastic bags. Mysuru produces around 90 tonnes of plastic waste daily. In her speech, Ms. Sindhuri called upon the public to switch over to alternatives to plastic, completely discarding all kinds of plastic bags. “Try to make it a habit to carry cloth bags to the markets. This will largely help in addressing the plastic menace although plastic has become a part of our life. If every household shuns plastic, the dangers of using plastic can be effectively addressed. We need a voluntary resolve to avoid plastic and join hands in the campaign.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/saying-no-to-plastic/article33806429.ece
11 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Conflict with leopards on the rise in State||The recent instances of leopards entering human territory and creating panic among locals in different parts of the State underline an increase in human-animal conflict owing to urban sprawl and unchecked decimation of wildlife habitats. Two leopards being spotted in Bengaluru (one at an apartment complex at Begur and another at Kengeri) and eventually trapped, a leopard sauntering into a medical college staff quarters in Chamarajanagar, and a big cat chasing its prey only to get trapped inside a toilet in Mangaluru — these are just some of the incidents reported in the past few days. But experts concur that leopards always lived in these places before and it is the human intrusion into their territories that is the root of the problem. Leopards are being sighted more frequently as they are being forced to come out in search of prey, say experts. Sanjay Gubbi, senior scientist, Nature Conservation Foundation, said the proliferation of CCTV cameras and social media has brought them into the spotlight more often. He listed development activities in leopard habitats such as quarrying, mining, proliferation of industries, and infrastructure projects as the key drivers destroying habitats and adding to conflict situations. The medical college quarters in Chamarajanagar that was in the news recently when a leopard walked into the building was built on a buffer forest zone, which is a leopard habitat. Survey findings Mr. Gubbi and a team of other wildlife biologists conducted a study, according to which 357 leopards were in conflict situations in the State between 2009 and 2016 and were translocated. A majority — 79% — of these conflicts were reported from Mysuru, Udupi, Hassan, Tumakuru, Ramanagaram, Ballari, Koppal, and Mandya districts. Six years later, cases of conflict are being reported from these very areas with regularity. In Mysuru, leopards have been spotted in industrial areas, captured, and translocated, while their presence on the outskirts of the city and in villages are well-documented. “We are constantly inundated with calls to capture a leopard because it was sighted somewhere in a village or killed a domestic animal. People panic when it is sighted even in Chamundi Hills, which is a natural forest and leopard territory,” said Prashanth Kumar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Mysuru Territorial Division. The authorities are forced to capture and translocate leopards to mollify local sentiments even though it has not proved to be a good solution. More than 40 leopards have been captured and translocated in Mysuru district in the past three years alone. But once a leopard is translocated, the same space is occupied by another leopard, said Mr. Kumar. Being highly adaptable, leopards have learnt to live in human habitations without causing harm and survive on smaller preys such as dogs and pigs. Hence, to minimise conflict in urban areas, Mr. Kumar advocated efficient waste management to reduce the proliferation of stray animals as they act as a lure for leopards. Mr. Gubbi called for better education of the public about leopard behaviour and the need to accept the presence of wildlife while making efforts to restrict conflict situations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conflict-with-leopards-on-the-rise-in-state/article33806001.ece
11 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||End to parking woes in Mysuru’s CBD soon||The 10-year-old multilevel parking project on the premises of Town Hall here is expected to be completed soon, making way for the hassle-free parking of vehicles in the central business district (CBD), ending the parking problems faced by the motorists in the vicinity. A project of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), it had remained unfinished and the motorists could not park their vehicles in the absence of facilities with certain works remaining. Despite spending a large sum of money on it, the facility could not be thrown open for public use when the CBD was faced with a severe parking crisis with a steep rise in vehicles. This is the city’s first State-funded parking project which was launched with much fanfare, claiming to accommodate a large number of four-wheelers and two-wheelers. The project was taken up to ease the parking problem on the city’s commercial hubs - D. Devaraj Urs Road, Sayyaji Rao Road and Ashoka Road - which have limited parking space, especially for four-wheelers. It was taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 18.28 crore in 2011-12. When Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar inspected the parking facility a couple of days ago on knowing its non-utilisation, the MCC engineers apprised him about the problems faced by the facility, especially waterlogging in the underground level of parking space. The project was designed to accommodate 600 cars, and 1,000 two-wheelers and an amphitheatre on the roof-top to facilitate open-air cultural events in the core heritage zone (CHZ). The Minister told the MCC officials to take necessary measures for finishing the project.  The MCC would require funds for this and the issue is expected to be taken up with the Department of Urban Development. The engineers also told the Minister that the completion of the project may also ease traffic congestion in the surrounding roads which get choked with four-wheelers occupying space and not much space was available for the free movement of vehicles. The Minister told the MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde, who was present, that the city and its roads would look impressive with a centralised vehicle parking facility. Lack of suport In fact, the MCC wanted to bring in the ‘pay and park’ scheme on D. Devaraja Urs Road to ease the parking crisis but it remained a non-starter as it got no support from the elected representatives. Even the projects of building multi-level parking lots saw no headway. The MCC had proposed multilevel parking infrastructure at Gaadi Chowk off D. Devaraj Urs Road and at the plot in front of KSRTC mofussil bus stand, on the advice of the Urban Development Department. The MCC, however, did not make any progress in its plan. The city traffic police have now proposed a four-hour parking rule on Urs Road, which appears to be imminent as a consensus has been reached among shop-keepers and other stakeholders over the proposal for easing parking woes, particularly during peak hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/end-to-parking-woes-in-mysurus-cbd-soon/article33806424.ece

11 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Leopard population||A recent report by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change indicated that Karnataka harbours the second-highest number of leopards (1,783) in the country, afterMadhya Pradesh (3,421). The figures were based on sampling in forested habitats in tiger range areas of the country. They did not include coffee and tea plantations, scrub jungles, and other landscapes known to support leopards.  But another study by wildlife scientist Sanjay Gubbi and his team covering landscapes outside the protected areas pegged the leopard population at around 2,500. Mr. Gubbi said habitat destruction was also leading to erosion of wild prey and hence, leopards were surviving on livestock, increasing instances of conflict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/leopard-population/article33806002.ece

Seven High Court judges would retire this year, which could further impact the pendency of cases. Around two lakh cases are currently pending in the High Court. While one judge will retire on February 13, four in May, one in September and two others in December. This will bring down the number of High Court judges to 29. Currently, there are 37 judges against the sanctioned strength of 47. Recommended Though the collegium of the Supreme Court had recommended four, including two Principal Sessions Judges, in August last year, the proposal has not yet been cleared by the Central government, judicial sources indicated. It was on August 14 last year that the names of Principal Sessions Judges Kauser Edappagath of Ernakulam and K. Babu of Thiruvananthapuram were recommended along with that of lawyers Ziyad Rahman and Murali Purushothaman. A judge of the apex court had recently flagged the delay in the appointment of judges to various High Courts despite the Supreme Court collegium clearing the names, pointed out sources. The delay in the appointments would also affect the seniority of the judges from the subordinate judiciary, for whom the elevation to higher judiciary comes at the fag end of their career, sources said. Names cleared Meanwhile, the collegium of the Kerala High Court is understood to have cleared the names of four lawyers, T.K. Aravindkumar Babu, Basanth Balaji, K.A. Sanjitha and Shobha Annamma Eapen, to be appointed as judges. SC collegium The proposal will be forwarded to the Supreme Court collegium for consideration.

Mr. Keezhattoor expressed his political stance on Facebook. He said there was an attempt by some persons to accuse him as belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress. Mr. Keezhattoor said they also tried to belittle the agitation. The struggle was for protecting the fields and hills for tomorrow. Being born in a party village, the CPI(M) questioned his political stance when he went ahead with the protest against land acquisition. “However, now it is time for me to clear the air and tell the people my political stance that I am a communist and want to live as a communist and die as a communist,” he said. He stood with left-wing politics and, hence, a decision was made to work with the Communist Party of India, Mr. Keezhattoor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vayalkilikal-leader-suresh-keezhattoor-joins-cpi/article33806292.ece
11 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Govt. medical college teachers withdraw strike for two weeks||Teachers at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, have temporarily withdrawn their strike for two weeks after a State-level meeting with the Health Minister. They declared a strike over two weeks ago, demanding payment of arrears and allowances after salary revision, and classes had been suspended from January 29 onwards at government medical colleges across the State. Now that the strike has been withdrawn, classes will resume and additional hours will be taken to make up for lost time. Examinations for final-year students is scheduled for April, which is worrying since the strike hit academics, and gynaecology and paediatric departments are still not open for inpatient services, said Abdul Zalam M.K., president of the Parent-Teacher Association of the medical college and parent of a final-year student. Inpatient medical services have resumed at the hospital from February 4 onwards, said Dr. Peter Vazhayil, Superintendent of the hospital. “But paediatric and gynaecology departments cannot be opened up for inpatient facilities till the Aluva District Hospital starts functioning. The MCH is the only hospital where a C-section can be done on a COVID positive patient. Other surgeries for COVID patients are also still being done at the hospital,” he said. Outpatient services at the hospital are available from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Work on the 100-bed facility at the Aluva District Hospital will be completed by February 15, said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. It is likely to be fully operational about a week after work is complete. The hospital will have gynaecology and pediatric departments for COVID positive pregnant women and children. Since the hospital only began inpatient services recently, there are very few patients for the nearly hundred final-year students to learn, said a final year student who asked not to be identified. “We are now getting only around a month of clinical exposure, before the study leave for the exams,” the student said. It would take a while for patients to overcome their hesitation to return to a facility that has been running exclusively as a COVID care centre, Dr. Vazhayil said. The space crunch at the medical college makes it difficult to resume all non-COVID services and run critical care services for COVID simultaneously, said Dr. V. Satheesh, Principal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-medical-college-teachers-withdraw-strike-for-two-weeks/article33806308.ece

Except for the GHSS, Panangad, where some five students were tested positive, the situation in the district remains under control, as per the assessment made by the Education Department. “We have not yet come across instances of cluster spread in Ernakulam. The GHSS in Panangad was asked to close down for two days after less than five students were tested positive,” said Honey G. Alexander, Deputy Director of Education. “A meeting of principals and headmasters/headmistresses were held to review the situation and take necessary follow-up action. The online meeting evolved measures to contain the pandemic spread by complying with the COVID-19 protocol,” she said. Teams formed A team of heads of institutions and Education Department officials has been formed in each school. The monitoring committee will keep a vigil over the functioning of each school and the movement of teachers and students. They will create awareness on the pandemic protocol among teachers and students. Principals said that they will also interact with parents and advise them to strictly maintain the protocol while venturing out of their homes. There have been schools in which either a few students or teachers were tested positive after classes for Class 10 and 12 students resumed. The school authorities seek the view of the Health Department once they come across such cases. The school is closed for two or three days as per the directions given by the health authorities. Students and teachers will be told to remain in quarantine and monitor their health condition. Students or teachers from homes with COVID-19 patients should not go to school until directed by the health authorities. The Education Department has asked managements to disinfect school premises, classrooms, stationary, water tanks, toilets, labs and library as part of safety measures. Teachers have been told to avoid crowding, especially during interval sessions. They should also ask students to comply with physical distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/schools-in-district-step-up-vigil-against-pandemic-spread/article33806316.ece

The scheme was introduced for Kudumbashree Mission members to make computers affordable and to create a level-playing field as online classes were extended in the wake of the pandemic spread. Kudumbashree members, who join the scheme, will have to pay Rs. 500 a month and can buy the computer of their choice after making three instalments (Rs. 1,500). The scheme is spread over a total of 30 months. While subscribers to the Vidyashree scheme can buy the laptop of their choice with the stipulated amount, those who join the scheme as a way to make savings can withdraw the money from the 13th month of the launch of the scheme. It was estimated that of the 43 lakh schoolchildren in the State, around 2.65 lakh did not have enough facilities to access online classes and the majority of these children belonged to families of Kudumbashree members. The micro credit scheme for making laptops available to children evolved out of that need, said a Kudumbashree circular. Though launched initially in June 2020, the scheme was stalled after the invitation by the Information Technology Department for competitive bids from laptop suppliers saw just one response. The department had to call for another round of bids in which four laptop suppliers responded. The IT department did not choose the lowest bidder for the scheme. Instead, the subscribers can buy the laptop of their choice from any of the four suppliers - Acer, HP, Lenovo, and Coconics. The interest on the micro credits scheme will be jointly borne by the State government and KSFE. An official of the Kudumbashree Mission said that the first of the laptops under the Vidyashree chitty was expected to be given away later this month as the formalities are now nearing completion. Laptops will be given through respective KSFE branches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-144-lakh-join-vidyashree-chitty/article33806304.ece
11 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Set up campus police unit: HC||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to establish campus police units in all educational institutions to prevent drug abuses on campuses. The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice A.M. Shaffique directed the State government to convene a meeting of all key officials of the Home, Excise, Health, Law, Education and Social Justice Departments and representatives of the State Mental Health Authority to chalk out programmes to reduce the incidence of substance abuse among teenagers and youth. The court issued the directive while disposing of a suo motu case initiated on the basis of a letter from former IPS officer N. Ramachandran highlighting the rampant drug abuse in colleges and schools. The letter expressed concern over the increasing rate of crime committed by the youth under the influence of drugs. The court ordered the formation of the unit as it found that the law enforcement agencies were not conducting regular checks inside educational institutions. The court ordered the government to take measures to make it easier for the police and the excise to enforce the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 in educational institutions. Guidelines The court directed that authorities of universities, colleges and schools be provided with guidelines as a charter of duties and responsibilities to make the campuses drug-free. The order directed the State Police Chief (SPC) to seek the services of the Student Police Cadets, National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and similar forums to create awareness of the legal repercussions of the usage and trafficking of drugs and the health and career hazards it could cause. The court directed the SPC to establish counselling and rehabilitation mechanisms to save the students who were addicted to drugs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/set-up-campus-police-unit-hc/article33806358.ece
11 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kerala proves a haven for desperate migrants||Kerala has emerged the preferred destination of migrant workers, mostly young men, from Thuamul Rampur, the development block with the highest incidence of poverty and largest Scheduled Tribe population in Kalahandi district of Odisha, a recent study has found. The study on labour migration from Thuamul Rampur was commissioned by Gram Vikas, a NGO engaged in rural development in Odisha, and the Kochi-based Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development. The survey in this regard was conducted between December 2019 and January 2020 with a sample size of 440 households spread over 22 villages with 20 households from each village. Overall, about 6% of the population of Thuamul Rampur earned a living as migrant workers, found the study, which was published in November. Over four-fifths of the seasonal migrants from nearly 26% of households went to Kerala and worked in hotels/restaurants or in the construction sector, earning an average monthly wage of Rs. 12,000. Similarly, two-thirds of the 95% of the current migrants outside Odisha reported Kerala as their current destination with high wages being the major attraction. Nearly 60% of the workers from tribal communities and over three-fourths of the workers from Other Disadvantaged Communities reported Kerala as their current destination. Tamil Nadu was the next prime destination for all categories of workers after Kerala. Goa and Telangana were other important destinations for workers from tribal communities. About 30% of all the workers from Thuamul Rampur had gone to Thrissur with slightly over one-fifth of the workers from tribal communities and 35% of the workers from Other Disadvantaged Communities choosing the district. The study finds that all the workers who had gone to Kerala had chosen one of the four districts - Thrissur, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta, or Kannur. Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Khordha (Bhubaneswar) were the other major destinations for workers from Thuamul Rampur. A moderate estimate reveals that Thuamul Rampur receives about Rs. 60 crore annually as wages to workers who have migrated. The estimated monthly remittances to Thuamul Rampur from its migrants were about Rs. 2.3 crore even as the majority of them preferred to stay back if they were assured of at least a minimum monthly income of Rs. 10,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-proves-a-haven-for-desperate-migrants/article33806303.ece

These are among a set of recommendations submitted by the city-based Centre for Socio-Economic and Environmental Studies (CSES) to Mayor M. Anilkumar and the corporation council here on Tuesday. The city corporation must also revamp its website, publish performance reports, create means of information dissemination, manage waste more efficiently and strengthen institutions like schools and hospitals under its watch. In the submission ‘Towards Making Governance People Centric in Kochi’, CSES said that to make Kochi a better city, the corporation need to work on service delivery, inclusiveness, and development and maintenance of public spaces. The research centre said its recommendations were partially based on the insights developed during its work with the programme, Kerala Local Government Service Delivery Project, and the recent Fourth Administrative Reforms Commission. The centre welcomed the e-governance push by the new corporation council by integration of the corporation system with the IKM software. Service delivery The corporation must develop a service delivery policy to ensure accountability and transparency in governance. The policy should cover not only direct services but also services from institutions managed by the corporation. Development of a service standard, constant monitoring of service delivery and publication of service performance are essential to achieving the goals of a better administered city. While recommending online service delivery, the research institute also called for a total revamp of the corporation website. The improved website should have features to facilitate citizens’ access to services offered by the corporation, contact details of councillors, office functionaries and community workers as well as information on institutions under the corporation. While the corporation must also work on improving road infrastructure and managing waste efficiently, there is a need to focus on creating adequate public spaces, which appeal to different age groups. A CSES survey of the public spaces and parks in the city showed that many of the spaces were in bad condition. Surveys should be conducted to create future public spaces and a system must be evolved to maintain public spaces with the cooperation of local communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/create-inclusive-women-friendly-city/article33806311.ece

On February 5, the fish genetics bureau centre supplied a hundred F2 generation Thor hainnensis variety of ornamental shrimps for further rearing to a cluster of farmers who have set up a rearing unit on Agatti island. They will rear the shrimps for another two months before selling them to ornamental fish keepers or sellers. The bureau has supplied plastic tubs, aeration devices and other accessories needed for shrimp rearing along with the F2 generation of ornamental shrimps. The materials for the unit have been supplied for free under the Tribal Sub Plan with financial support from the Union Department of Biotechnology, according to a scientist at the NBFGR. Director Kuldeep Lal told The Hindu that the bureau had taken up the assignment for germ plasm conservation and livelihood promotion of the islanders. Ornamental shrimp rearing would be a source of additional income for them and a considerable economic activity as it grows, he added. Diversified options The islanders’ means of livelihood are limited to tuna, copra, and tourism. Diversified livelihood opportunities are a way forward, Dr. Lal added. A survey in different Lakshadweep islands has revealed hidden biodiversity and new shrimp species.  Thor hainanensis and Ancylocaris brevicarpalis are high-value marine ornamental shrimps native to Lakshadweep. They are much in demand in the international aquarium trade but at present the demand is met with wild collections only, said a communication from the ICAR-NBFGR. The bureau has developed the ornamental shrimp brood stock/parents in captivity and standardised the technology for captive production. The NBFGR team has given hands-on training for a month to the islanders and extended the rearing technology to 40 women. The communication added that it was the first-of-its-kind programme in the country on marine ornamental shrimp conservation and livelihood promotion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/islanders-pin-hopes-on-aquarium-shrimps/article33806314.ece

The man identified as Sharafudheen, a resident of Palakkad, was arrested from Paderu by a special investigation squad of the Ernakulam Rural police after a persistent probe running into months. He is suspected to be the main agent behind the seizure of 140 kg of ganja by the Rural police in two separate incidents on November 26. In one incident, a police team chased down and arrested three accused who were trying to flee in two cars at Angamaly and seized from them 105 kg of ganja found in 50 tightly sealed packs. Information received from them on interrogation led to the seizure of another 35 kg of ganja found hidden in 17 similarly sealed packets in a rented house at Avoli in Ernakulam rural limits. The seizures were the biggest in recent memory by the Rural police. “He seems to be the main guy who sourced it from Andhra Pradesh and smuggled it outside, including to Kerala, through sub-dealers. He might be connected to other incidents of ganja seizure in the past. But that can be probed only after we secure his custody for further interrogation,” said a senior officer associated with the probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/arrest-of-lynchpin-may-unlock-mystery-behind-ganja-seizures/article33806310.ece

Studies have shown that COVID-19 poses very low risk to the physical health of children as compared to adults. However, children remain asymptomatic and can carry significant viral load. They can potentially spread the pandemic among the general population, according to a paper published by the IAP on the guidelines for school reopening in October last. “Schools act as the nodal points for spread of the virus. We have to continue practising the SMS till the pandemic situation is resolved,” said M. Narayanan, president of the IAP, Kerala.  The guidelines by IAP said that those with body temperature beyond 99.4 F (37.3 degree Celsius) or those who report a history of fever or ‘feeling feverish’ in the previous 24 hours should be denied entry in schools and referred for medical care. The government authorities should be informed, if a student/staff/visitor turns positive for SARS-CoV-2.

11 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fleeing poverty, they come to Kerala||Given a choice, Narendra Majhi, 30, (name changed) would have preferred to stay back home and mourn his two-year-old daughter who died just over a week ago. But faced with a life of abject poverty in his native village of Thuamul Rampur block of the extremely backward district of Kalahandi district in Odisha after being forced to return from Kerala during the lockdown, he could hardly afford that luxury. So, there he was on a bus to Kochi arranged jointly by the Kochi-based Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) and Gram Vikas, an NGO working towards rural development in Odisha, to facilitate safe migration from one of the most backward districts in the country, and thus protect its desperate residents from the exploitation of middlemen who make money by exploiting the distress migration situation. This was the second such bus to Kochi from Kalahandi in as many months and all other 49 occupants who reached here on Wednesday had similar heart-rending stories to share. “There were people who sold their smart phones, their only assets, to raise the Rs. 5,000 towards their travel and food expenses for the two-day journey. Thuamul Rampur could hardly provide livelihood for all those who were forced out of their migrant jobs and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme didn’t have the same attraction,” said Jobin Chacko, junior manager of Gram Vikas, from Kalahandi. The largely agrarian district doesn’t have any alternative livelihoods to offer and remittances from migrants has propped up its economy over the years. But the disrupted train service and the largely non-existent unreserved class in existing services meant that they were stuck in the morass of poverty and joblessness. In Kerala, Kochi and Thrissur remained their preferred destinations and the hotel industry their favoured sector. “The idea has been to link up potential employers and the jobless who are in desperate need of each other and help shift the latter from the unpredictable informal job market to the formal one with accruing benefits. The employers were willing to recruit credible migrants with genuine identities who could be traced back in the event something goes amiss,” said Benoy Peter, executive director, CMID. Gram Vikas set up four resource centres in Kalahandi while the CMID created a virtual centre complete with a helpline in Kochi. Prachodan Development Services, another NGO in Thrissur in partnership with ESAF Small Finance Bank, helped migrants and potential employers find each other. While all 50 aboard the bus had been assured credible employment, high levels of attrition remain a major concern. “The attrition is not surprising thanks to their largely herd mentality to be among their own community and their proclivity to work for their past employers in whom they have greater confidence. It will take the formation of a critical mass in new jobs and spread of word of mouth before they have the same level of trust in their new employers,” said Liby Johnson, executive director, Gram Vikas. But things seem to be improving with Shibin Jose, director of the Kochi-based KLR Facility Management, which supplies manpower for housekeeping in malls and hotels across the State, confident of increasingly being able to convince migrants with emoluments such as provident fund and ESI coverage. “We are training them for housekeeping works in hotels that come with an attractive package of stable income, food, and accommodation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youths-flee-in-droves-grinding-poverty-in-odisha-district/article33806302.ece

11 February 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Steps on to hike test numbers||The Health Department has taken steps to increase the number of tests in the district and ensure those in home care are following the COVID-19 protocol. As per its officials, the reluctance of new patients in revealing their contact history is a major reason for the current spread. At present, each patient has an average three persons in their contact list and the department has now opted for intensive tracing. A total of 13 facilities here have been warned for not doing proper contact tracing after conducting the tests at private laboratories. More regulations were introduced in all private study centres. “The department will conduct RT-PCR test for 70% of the swabs collected and if those in home care cannot follow the protocol, they will be shifted to first-line treatment centres,” said an official. All primary contacts and residents living in areas declared as clusters will have to undergo the tests. The tests will be conducted in homes for destitute and elderly persons every two months. Antigen tests will be limited to fever patients and for conducting repeated tests for positive cases. The district administration has decided to make announcements in all crowded places to spread awareness. Commercial exhibitions and trade fairs will not be given permission while the ongoing events will be monitored to ensure protocol compliance. The timing of tourism spots including parks will be till 6 p.m. and the functioning of Closed Cluster Groups (CCG) will be strengthened. As part of enforcing the protocol at public events, an online meeting of persons from political and cultural fields will be held. Measures will be put in place to control the crowd in shopping centres at all taluks. The District Collector has instructed all officials concerned to take strict action against those violating the norms while notices will be issued to six sectoral magistrates who failed to appear for duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-on-to-hike-test-numbers/article33806334.ece
11 February 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Police stop protesters bound for capital||A group of persons, who were on their way to Thiruvananthapuram to participate in a protest against NRI businessman B. Ravi Pillai, were taken into custody by the Kollam East police here on Wednesday. The bus from Oachira with nearly 60 protesters was stopped at Chinnakkada around 8 a.m. and the protesters were released in the evening. According to the police, action was taken as a preventive measure as another group had staged a protest in front of Mr. Pillai's home in Kollam last month. Reportedly, the protest was organised by a collective, all of them expatriates working with NSH Corporation, who alleged that they were terminated from service without any benefit and the company was owned by Mr. Pillai. “Around 500 persons from 12 States were fired from the company without any reason. We had conducted a press meeting in Thiruvananthapuram and the Secretariat march was announced earlier. We were taken into custody as part of a malicious plan,” said a protester. Meanwhile, RP Group representatives said that NSH Corporation was a company owned by a Saudi citizen and at present Mr. Pillai had no connection with it. “Mr. Pillai had served as the managing director of the company till 2014 and after that, he was not associated with the company. Some persons are deliberately trying to tarnish the image of RP Group and its chairman Mr. Pillai. When they staged a protest in Kollam on January 30, we had asked for documents proving they were employees of RP Group and none of the protesters could provide that so far. The Kollam city police and the Crime Branch are investigating the case,” said Anantha Krishnan, administration manager of RP Group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-stop-protesters-bound-for-capital/article33806350.ece

11 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||New budget proposal offers hope for Light Metro project||A proposal in the recent Union Budget for Metro Neo for tier-2 cities has given a glimmer of hope to revive the Light Metro rail project for Kozhikode. The Rs. 2,775-crore Light Metro proposed for the city has been put on the back burner for various reasons, including the State government’s failure to secure the mandatory clearance from the Public Investment Board of the Centre. A detailed project report (DPR) was submitted by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) as per the new metro policy in December 2017. In February 2018, the DMRC closed its office in Kozhikode and pulled out of the project. Now, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has stated that either Metro Lite or Metro Neo will be considered for several Indian cities. Towards the end of last year, the State government gave approval for Light Metro projects in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. The Metro Neo, a unique concept, is a state-of-the-art, energy-efficient and environment-friendly mass rapid transit system for cities. For Kozhikode, the project could be executed with the same alignment as that envisaged for the Light Metro. The Light Metro project proposes a fully elevated track covering a distance of 13.33 km from Meenchanda to Kozhikode Medical College, with 14 stations at Medical College, Chevayur, Thondayad, Kottooli, New Bus Stand, KSRTC station, Mananchira, Palayam, Railway Station, Pushpa Junction, Kallayi, Panniyankara, Vattakinnar, and Meenchanda. The State government had conducted a survey for the construction of metro stations. The land required for the project was 10.05 hectares, including 1.5 hectares in private possession. A few years ago, a rail overbridge was constructed at Payyanakkal at a cost of Rs. 40 crore in connection with the Light Metro project. The alignment of the ROB was modified to suit the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-budget-proposal-offers-hope-for-light-metro-project/article33806291.ece
11 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||A singer and chronicler of music||M.S. Nazim, who passed away in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday at the age of 67 after a prolonged illness, was a popular singer on stage and television as well as the producer of some noted documentaries on music. He may have to his credit only one film song, but he began his career at a time when getting a break in cinema was extremely difficult, even for the most gifted of singers. It was for the 1990 film Anantha Vruthantham that he sang. He did justice to the song, Nirayum thaarangale...  Nazim had made his mark singing old film songs on stage, especially those originally rendered by A.M. Rajah and P.B. Sreenivas. Old is Gold He was part of playback singer K.P. Udayabhanu’s Thiruvananthapuram-based music troupe Old is Gold, which played a significant role in bringing back the glorious tradition of Malayalam film music. Nazim was in much demand on the troupe’s shows for Rajah’s songs. Playback singer G. Venugopal also used to sing in those shows along with Nazim. “He used to enjoy singing at shows and he was also a good organiser,” Venugopal told The Hindu.  “Till he fell ill, you could meet him often during cultural programmes in Thiruvananthapuram. It was tragic that he could not sing for the last 15 years after he had a stroke.” Not many people know that Nazim conceived and produced the first series based on Malayalam film music. Aayiram Ganangal Than Ananda Lahari was aired on Doordarshan in the 1990s and it ran into about 50 episodes. The show featured most of the singers and music directors of Malayalam cinema from its early days, including Sarojini Menon and T.K. Govinda Rao, who sang for Nirmala , the 1948 film with which the tradition of playback singing began in the language. Music critic Ravi Menon had written the script for the series. Nazim’s idea “It was Nazim who suggested the idea about producing a series about Malayalam film music and I thought there was huge potential for it,” Ravi said. “We had gone to Chennai to record interviews with so many singers and musicians. The series proved extremely popular.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-singer-and-chronicler-of-music/article33806357.ece

Skywalk project Meanwhile, the Calicut Medical College Alumni Association has sought contributions from members to construct the proposed skywalk connecting the new block of the medical college hospital with the Institute for Maternal and Child Health block, NMCH, and superspecialty buildings. The cost of construction is around Rs. 2 crore. T.P. Rajagopal, president, Alumni Association, claimed that the organisation was finding it difficult to collect funds during the pandemic situation. At a recent meeting, the association decided to raise as much funds as possible, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-facilities-at-mch-beach-hospital-to-be-opened/article33806288.ece
11 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Settler farmers find their hands tied||Some farmers in Koorachund, Kanthalad, and Chakkittapara villages of Kozhikode have accused village officials of bypassing the District Collector’s order to receive land tax from them. O.D. Thomas Ottaplakkal, chairman of an action committee of settler farmers, said on Wednesday that they had bought the land from the erstwhile royal families of Kizhakedath, Mallisseri, Purakkod, and Narikkot since 1940 and had title deeds and documents to prove their ownership. They had constructed houses on the land, had been cultivating there, and paying tax till 2002. However, Forest officials thereafter demarcated their property and installed stones claiming that the land had been encroached upon. The farmers forcibly removed the stones in 2004. The issue was raised in the Assembly, and the government ordered a joint verification by Revenue and Forest departments in 2005. It took a decade for the completion of verification, Mr. Thomas claimed. During meetings in 2013, 2016, and 2018, the government had directed the District Collector and the Divisional Forest Officer to examine the documents for the land purchased before January 1, 1977, and permit the farmers to pay tax. The Collector issued an order too. Though tax collection was opened on January 12, 2019, village officials did not toe the line, he alleged. Farmers claimed they could not sell or pledge the land for taking bank loans because of the confusion over ownership. Moreover, Forest officials were not allowing them to replant rubber trees or cut trees either.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/settler-farmers-find-their-hands-tied/article33806294.ece
11 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||A step on the stage towards normalcy||When the curtain goes up on the play “Nothing” at the Gender Park Complex here on Thursday night, it will be another step forward for Kerala towards normalcy. The English drama, directed by the U.K.-based Shakespearean research scholar Lakshmi Krishnakumar, is one of the first major theatre productions being staged in the State after COVID-19 struck Kerala. The play is being presented on the opening day of the second International Conference on Gender Equality, organised by the State’s Department of Women and Child Development. The premier of “Nothing”  could also give another ray of hope for performing artistes, who have been among the worst hit by the pandemic. “I am glad to associate with a project that gives some relief in these tough times,” Lakshmi, who has her roots in Kottayam, told The Hindu . “I was delighted when I was assigned to do this play.” The play, a collaboration with the Delhi-based SaMaPa, features a talented cast, including a very known face for the Malayali – film actor and designer Kukku Parameswaran. Mumbai-based Errol Rodrigues, Pooja Mohanraj, and Abhimanyu Nair are the other members of the cast. Lakshmi, who is pursuing her PhD from LMU, Munich, said the play was about the conversations between a man and his wife. “It focuses on their life in the present day and when they were younger; the word nothing when uttered between two people who share a certain familiarity, closeness or intimacy takes many meanings,” she said. “Because of the COVID-19 restrictions, I could only do a play with a small number of cast and crew. Nothing seemed perfect for the occasion.” Kukkoo nodded in agreement. “I was fascinated when I read the script,” she said. “The play is very much relevant; it is a wake-up call for today’s woman.” While this is the first performance on the stage for Kukkoo after the lockdown, Rodrigues has already acted in three plays in Mumbai. “People were a bit apprehensive early on, but now they are more confident to come out to watch performances,” he said. “This is the first time I am going to perform in Kerala; I have heard about the high regard people here have for art.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-step-on-the-stage-towards-normalcy/article33806283.ece

Delivering the keynote address at the international symposium on spices organised by the Indian Society for Spices, she said though the country produced 60,000 metric tonnes of pepper, it also imported over 24,000 metric tonnes, as value-added products are given thrust. D. Sathiyan, Secretary, Spices Board, also stressed the scope of value-addition for improving spices export. According to him, value-added spice products contribute 51% of the total spice export from the country. The Centre and the Spices Board are now focusing more on promoting higher-end value-addition and popularising the health benefits of spices, Mr. Sathiyan said, adding that a mission was on to promote Indian brands abroad by coordinating with Indian Brand Equity Foundation. Indian spice sector has immense scope for development, as there are 52 scheduled spices in the country. Only a few of these spices are being promoted and exported, and the export of spices could witness considerable growth on shifting focus to all spices, said the official.

A press release said here on Tuesday that the Gender Park, under the Department of Women and Child Development, is organising the second edition of ICGE in association with UN Women. Speakers and participants from across the world will take part in the event on the Gender Park campus in Kozhikode. Climate change The department has decided to bring ‘Sustainability’ as the core theme of the event, at a time when climate change is disrupting economies and lives across continents. India, especially Kerala, has seen the worst changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and greenhouse gas emissions, which recorded the highest levels in history. The Department of Women and Child Development has taken massive steps to ensure that the conference fully adheres to sustainability as its core theme. The event will be evaluated and verified as the First Carbon Neutral Event in Kerala to enhance awareness and capacity-building activities in line with State Action Plans for Climate Change (SAPCC), said Dr. P.T.M. Sunish, CEO, Gender Park. The mandates of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement on implementation of climate actions by governments through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) are also taken into serious consideration. For the purpose, the Gender Park has taken on board Vydyuthi Energy Services (VES), a Kerala-based energy and carbon consulting start-up, which recently was recognised by the UN Women for becoming one of the first start-ups from Kerala supporting gender equality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/meet-on-gender-equality-from-today/article33806280.ece

Rajna Hyder, an applicant from Kozhikode, told the media on Wednesday that the notification to apply for HSA posts was issued on December 30. K-TET for Category 3 was conducted on January 17. However, the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) closed the applications on February 3 much before the K-TET results were out. “This deprived us of a chance to apply for HSA posts. This is applicable only to graduates in Mathematics and Natural Sciences,” she said. ‘Rank list valid till june’ V.V. Fahida, another applicant, pointed out that there was no need for the PSC to rush through the notification and close the applications, as the current rank list for HSA posts in Mathematics and Natural Sciences was valid till June 2021. Though the rank list for some other subjects such as Malayalam had expired in 2020, the PSC had not issued a similar notification in those subjects, she added. Ms. Hyder said K-TET exams are generally held thrice a year in January, June, and November. Last year, it was deferred more than once in view of the pandemic and finally held in January this year. She added that since the Education Department delayed the release of answer key and results of K-TET, the candidates could not apply for HSA posts before the last date. Ms. Fahida said the K-TET certificate was earlier valid only for seven years. Life-time validity for the certificate came into being only in October last year. So, most job aspirants would apply for the test only after the PSC issues notification for the posts. The commission calls for applications for HSA posts only once in seven or eight years. “Most of us will be past the age bar by the time the PSC issues notification for HSA posts next time. We urge the commission to either issue the notification again or come up with extra notification,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/k-tet-applicants-seek-re-notification-of-hsa-posts/article33806293.ece

Gomathy, who was on a hunger strike demanding justice for the Walayar parents here, was forcibly shifted to the hospital after her condition worsened on Wednesday. The police arrested the mother of the Walayar girls when she tried to prevent them from shifting Ms. Gomathy to the hospital. A few others were also arrested. Ms. Gomathy, however, refused to take treatment at the District Hospital. She returned to the agitation pandhal and resumed her fast. Hunger strike Ms. Gomathy has been on a hunger strike since February 5 near the stadium bus-stand here. The protesters were demanding action against M.J. Sojan, Crime Branch SP who was the police officer who investigated the sensational Walayar case. The case, involving the death of two minor sisters in mysterious circumstances on different occasions at their house at Attappallam, near Walayar, in 2017, got national attention when a POCSO court here exonerated all the accused following the failure of the prosecution in proving their guilt. The Walayar Action Forum has been leading an agitation demanding a reinvestigation and punitive action against the investigating officer. The Police arrested 15 protesters, including former special prosecutor Jalaja Madhavan and Dalit Human Rights Movement leader Saleena Prakkanam, along with the mother of the Walayar girls. They were released on bail at South Police Station. They later took out a march to the agitation venue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gomathy-walayar-mother-held/article33806354.ece
11 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Steps for prompt reporting of vacancies to PSC||The Cabinet has come up with several steps, including setting up of a two-member committee headed by the Chief Secretary, to ensure that vacancies in government departments and institutions are reported promptly to the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC). On the rank list, the PSC includes candidates up to five times the vacancies reported and 80% do not get appointments. The government can only ensure posting to those in the rank list by reporting vacancies promptly to the PSC, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday after the Cabinet meeting. Stern steps would be taken against appointing authorities if vacancies were not reported to the PSC, Mr. Vijayan said listing out the measures decided by the Cabinet. Promotions Directive would be issued to department heads to report vacancies to the PSC after giving temporary promotion in case of cases pending in courts on seniority and the court had given interim ruling staying regular promotion. Pointing out that there were instances of denial of promotion due to lack of qualified candidates, the Chief Minister said the head of the department would be asked to revert such posts to the existing cadre on a temporary basis and report the vacancies to the PSC. Once a qualified candidate was available, the de-cadre process would be amended. The Cabinet also asked the Chief Secretary, the Additional Chief Secretary, Finance, and the Additional Chief Secretary, Administrative Reforms, to execute the measures on a priority basis in 10 days. During the tenure of the Left Democratic Front government, 44,000 posts, including 27,000 permanent posts, were created. The government had given 1,57, 911 postings through the PSC till January 31, 2021. The PSC had published 4,012 rank lists compared to the 3,113 rank lists during the previous United Democratic Front regime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-for-prompt-reporting-of-vacancies-to-psc/article33806374.ece
11 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Of manufactured narratives||Perhaps there was never a time when history was contested in daily political debates as is being done now. Multiple narratives of the same incident spread in mutually exclusive online bubbles and long-forgotten chapters from the past are revived as the lines between myth and history blur and falsification of history becomes common. In The Names of the Flowers , debut directorial of Bahman Tavoosi, being screened in the International Competition category at the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), the questions are surrounding a particular witness to a historical event. In the higher ranges of Bolivia, the region where Ernesto Che Guevara was gunned down amid a guerilla war, the government is planning to organise events to mark the 50th anniversary of that event. A bowl of soup Julia, an elderly teacher, has been for long a fascination for tourists to the remote village as the person who has met and talked to the revolutionary leader as he lay dying in the school building where she used to teach. She is said to have given him a bowl of soup and he is believed to have recited a poem on flowers to her in return. But, as the day of the celebration nears, a few other women also come forward making a claim to the same story. The invitation the government had extended to the teacher to share her story at the event is withdrawn and she is asked not to step into the school again. As it often happens with such events, without a clear recorded history, it is one person’s word against another’s, making it hard for those who genuinely want to ascertain the truth. The village itself still seems to be in the shadow of that event from the past century, with it coming up in the government radar occasionally owing to that reason. The present political context of Bolivia also comes through as snatches of radio broadcast of a national leader speaking about the country’s fight against economic policies forced upon it by the International Monetary Fund and others, all of which would lead to an unsuccessful coup attempt in Bolivia two years after the events in the film. Much of the film moves in an unhurried pace, sometimes as still images of soup bowls, vases, and the wrinkles on the old woman’s time-worn face. Some images do repeat, like that of her walking to the school, accompanied by her son clutching her photograph from younger days. We really are not told by her as to whether her story is true or whether she is making it up, although one can somewhat read from her face the feelings of still being caught in that historic moment that she lived half-a-century ago. But then, in this age, there could be another story, which would seem equally plausible.

11 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KU to bridge industry-academia divide||The University of Kerala has set its sights on bridging the industry-academia divide by deciding to appoint adjunct faculty comprising industrialists and other experts in various disciplines. The endeavour is aimed at nurturing industrial collaboration for research pursuits. An academic-industrial meet will also be organised this year to identify various research areas under the university’s study departments with the support of industrial and academic experts. The announcements find place in the university’s budget for the 2021-22 fiscal that was presented by Syndicate finance committee convener K.H. Babujan at a meeting of the Senate on Wednesday. The Rs. 1.67-crore deficit budget estimated a revenue of Rs. 705.43 crore and an expenditure of Rs. 707.1 crore. ‘Navodhana Veedhi’ The university’s plan of developing the Karyavattom campus as a model one, replete with adequate infrastructural facilities including hostels and theatre classrooms in each of the study departments, found prime importance with an allocation of Rs. 2 crore. As part of the project, a ‘Navodhana Veedhi’ (renaissance road) will be developed as tribute to the social reformation movement in the State and its leaders. The road from the campus entrance to the Centre for Performing and Visual Arts and that from the campus post office to the researchers’ hostel will be developed to a width of 15 metres and include provisions for footpaths of either side. The budget has also earmarked Rs. 25 lakh to boost the university’s efforts to go paper-less in various spheres of administration. While the agenda of syndicate and senate meetings will be made online, syndicate members, statutory officers and joint registrars will be provided tablets to migrate to the existing file system to a purely internet-based one. A biosafety laboratory will come up under the Department of biochemistry to boost research on communicable diseases. While the project is estimated to cost Rs. 2.5 crore, the budget has earmarked Rs. 40 lakh. The university’s research section will be upgraded as a research directorate at a cost of Rs. 30 lakh to streamline research activities including submission of theses. While the government has sanctioned a grant of Rs. 26 crore in the State budget, the allocation will be utilised for various endeavours including establishing a neurobiology laboratory, model biodiversity park, translational research facility in plant cell culture technology, modular thin film fab laboratory and artificial intelligence hub. Upgraded The Central Laboratory for Instrumentation and Facilitation (CLIF) will also be upgraded to a national testing centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-to-nurture-ties-with-industry/article33806351.ece
11 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Need to check COVID spread: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has stressed on the importance of keeping COVID-19 transmission down in the State till the general public can be covered by vaccination against the disease. Addressing mediapersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Vijayan said that Kerala had adopted the strategy of keeping disease transmission in the community at the lowest levels so that hospitalisations and deaths can be reduced. Seroprevalence He said that the results of the latest round of seroprevalence study done in the State by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) justifies the success of the containment strategy adopted by the State. ICMR’s seroprevalence study done in December shows that disease prevalence in the State at 11.6% was just half of the sero prevalence (21%) at the national level. While this points to the effective containment strategy of the State, the public was being misled to believe that Kerala’s COVID strategy had failed, Mr. Vijayan said. Right track He said that the ICMR survey had proved that Kerala was on the right track as far as COVID strategy was concerned but on the other side, the survey also pointed to the fact that Kerala still had a huge population susceptible to COVID. This meant that the vigil against COVID had to remain high. The COVID situation in the State continued to be serious.  Disease transmission So it was important that disease transmission in the community was contained well. If the State was now reporting more cases, it was because the State had the system and facility to track and report all cases, the Chief Minister claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/need-to-keep-covid-19-transmission-downcm/article33806342.ece

The meeting decided to reconstitute the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC) as a society to promote skill development and innovation. The Cabinet also recommended to the Governor to promulgate an Ordinance making the registration of migrant workers mandatory.

The commission directed that all programmes in which children participate should conform to the conditions laid down in The Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, and the The Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Rules’s Clause 2C. A division bench of commission members Fr. Philip Parakkat and K. Nazeer was on Wednesday disposing of a complaint related to a popular television show in which children play a prominent role. The commission said that its direction was applicable to all similar audio-visual programmes, shows, and cultural presentations in which children take part. As per child labour laws, prior permission of the District Magistrate should be sought for all such programmes. The application along with the number of children taking part in a programme and parents’ consent should be submitted to the District Magistrate. Children who are acting should not be made to work more than five hours a day or more than three hours at a stretch. Adequate precautions should be taken for children’s safety and care. They should be given nutritious food and facilities arranged for their physical and mental recreation. They should be provided clean and hygienic accommodation. Their education should also be ensured as also adherence to child rights laws. At least 20% of the money earned by children should be deposited in a nationalised bank. The anonymous complaint alleged that a child in the aforementioned TV show was being used for making money without her permission. The child, the complaint said, was spending time on location for recordings that went on for hours. The commission also said that the managing director of the channel on which the programme is telecast argued that the child was not a child artiste, and there was no contract between his channel and the child or the parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-directive-on-children-taking-part-in-programmes/article33806513.ece
11 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CM allays fears on regularisation||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday sought to frustrate the efforts of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to put the government in the dock by ‘fanning’ youth anger at back-door appointments, non-reporting of vacancies to the PSC and off-hand regularisation of temporary employees. Mr. Vijayan said regularisation of contract employees with more than 10 years of service would not whittle down PSC rankers’ employment possibilities as made out by the Opposition. The government had regularised provisional workers on compassionate grounds. It did not appoint a single one of the beneficiaries. There was no political consideration in play. The regularisation had occurred in institutions whose postings were outside the PSC’s purview. Disinformation Some forces had used disinformation to incite PSC rankers to violence. Not every person on the PSC rank list would land a job. “If there are 20 openings, the PSC will publish a ranklist of 100 persons. It does not entail that all will land a job,” he said. The Left Democratic Front government had appointed 1,57,911 persons via the PSC. It has extended the date of expiry of PSC rank lists by six months. Mr. Vijayan warned youth against falling prey to machinations of those looking to wring political dividends out of their grievances. “You are the government’s highest priority,” he said. The controversy continued to dog the government for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. The State witnessed a slew of violent street protests. BJP and Youth Congress workers attempted to breach the Secretariat. PSC rankers blockade M.G. Road and scuffled with police officers. Opposition leaders assailed the government for ‘outsourcing appointments to CPI(M) agents and apportioning jobs to party leaders’ relatives.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-allays-fears-on-regularisation/article33806363.ece

K. Shylaja here on Wednesday. The doctors, who had threatened to go on indefinite strike from Thursday, boycotting all hospital services, however said that they will resume their indefinite strike after a fortnight if the promises made during the talks with the Health Minister were not followed through by the government. Promise of Minister A statement issued by KGMCTA said that the Health Minister has promised to strongly recommend to the government that Medical College faculty be paid the revised payscale, with allowances and arrears, with effect from July 1, 2017. It said that the committee which has been asked to study the pay revision issue of doctors is expected to submit the report in two weeks. KGMCTA said that the Principal Secretary (Health) has promised that these decisions will not be affected by the election code of conduct, which is expected to be announced in the State soon. The arrears on basic pay with effect from January 1, 2016 will be given to doctors. The government has also agreed to resolve the anomalies which have crept in in the pay revision of doctors at the entry cadre. KGMCTA has demanded that the GO on this be issued immediately, as this does not come within the purview of the committee which is looking into the payment of salary arrears to doctors. KGMCTA leaders said that the faculty will take extra classes and make up for the study hours that the medical students lost, while the faculty went on agitation.  Committee that has been asked to study the pay revision issue is expected to submit the report in two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/doctors-suspend-stir-over-pay-revision/article33806347.ece

The multi-grade learning centres were set up in the mid-90s to ensure universal primary education under the District Primary Education Programme across the State. These came up in areas such as tribal settlements or coastal areas that had no travel facilities to speak of for transporting children to schools. These schools would have a few students and follow the curriculum for Classes 1 to 4. The only teacher or rather volunteer in a multi-grade learning centre would be paid an honorarium. Over time, some of the learning centres closed down, while in others the volunteers were attached to other learning centres. After the Right to Education was implemented, the multi-grade learning centres that had by then become a Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan project were wound up by the Union government as the Act called for setting up of full-fledged schools or transporting students to such schools.Today, around 60-odd learning centres are active, though their number is more.

11 February 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||3 lakh illegal jobs, says Chennithala||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said the government move for back-door appointments is total injustice to the eligible candidates who are agitating in front of the Secretariat. He was interacting with media persons here on Wednesday. The file recommending confirmation of 2,600 temporary workers would be considered in the next Cabinet meeting, Mr. Chennithala said.  Police rank list “The government considers the agitating youths as its enemies. The youth, who lost their patience, are agitating in front of the Secretariat. Look at the police rank list. It was frozen first following the University College stabbing case. Then COVID-19 stopped the appointments further,” Mr. Chennithala said. He alleged that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had made three-lakh illegal appointments so far. On the church row, Mr. Ramesh said the UDF was ready to find an amicable solution to the Jacobite-Orthodox spat. He said discussions would be held with both sides. Mr. Ramesh said the UDF was not aiming at any political gain from the Sabarimala issue. It was the LDF which cheated the devotees. The government should clear its stand.  Why U-turn? Why did CPI(M) Polit Bureau member M.A. Baby make a U-turn in his stand, he asked. The allegation of the NSS that the UDF had not done anything on the Sabarimala issue was due to misunderstanding, Mr. Chennithala said. “We tried to present a Bill in Parliament, but permission was denied,” he added. The Congress had done everything possible in the Assembly and Parliament. Sabarimala would be an important issue in the coming election, the Leader of the Opposition said. To the challenge posed by Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel to contest from Thavanur, Mr. Chennithala said that he was ready to contest from anywhere in the State. “Earlier, they challenged me to contest from Ponnani,” Mr. Chennithala added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/3-lakh-illegal-jobs-says-chennithala/article33806517.ece

11 February 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccination drive progressing at a snail’s pace in Chittoor||Though the response to the vaccination drive from the frontline workers was overwhelming in the initial days, things are not the same anymore. According to medical and health department officials, out of 1.5 lakh frontline workers, only 30,000 have been vaccinated so far and reports are that they have gradually stopped coming to the session centres. Chittoor district have so far witnessed 87,157 COVID cases, including 847 casualties, till February 10. During the last two months, the district has registered an average of 20 daily cases, as against 900+ in the peak months. The first phase of the jab for health workers commenced in the third week of January, amidst wide speculation that the vaccine would lead to side effects. However, the assurance and campaign of the authorities were successful in convincing people to get the shot. “The jab was given to over 90% of the medical officers in the government sector, but it was below 40% among the paramedical staff. Coming to the private sector, a majority of the doctors chose to stay away from the jab. They are hoping that a vaccine with more than 90% efficacy would hit the market in June. In private sector, some paramedical staff had even left their jobs, hoping to rejoin in the middle of the year. There is a strong apprehension among the paramedical staff that the presently released jab would have side effects after a couple of years and that when they go for another vaccine with 100% efficacy, it would be of no avail later,” a medical officer at a government hospital in Satyavedu said. Despite reluctance of some workers, the first phase had still seen a better turnout of targeted persons than the second phase, where, about 3,500 of police personnel, including home guards in Chittoor police district, took the jab. “The police would get the jab from the fourth week of February, after the panchayat election duties get over. As the district is getting a very few cases daily, there is not much seriousness among our staff. So, we are not in a hurry. We can wait even till the end of the year to favour a vaccine with more than 90% effectiveness,” said a senior police officer in Chittoor. District Medical and Health Officer M. Penchalaiah said that the drive would be intensified among the frontline workers. “So far, we have reached 33% of the target,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccination-drive-at-a-snails-pace-in-chittoor/article33806443.ece

11 February 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP-backed candidates won 82% seats in first phase: Sajjala||Adviser to Government of AP (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has claimed the YSRCP-backed candidates have bagged 82% seats in the first phase of panchayat elections and exuded the confidence that the same streak will continue in the remaining phases as the results are a reflection of the welfare schemes being implemented by the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government. Addressing a press conference at the YSR Central Party Office here on Wednesday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy slammed the TDP leaders for distorting the facts through a section of media to confuse the public and try to influence them even as the overwhelming results in favour of the YSRCP were in open. “It's quixotic on part of TDP to go into celebrations with the tiny number of seats it gained and its funny to see its friendly media trying hard to mislead with hyperbolic expressions and distortions. Even in the constituencies where senior leaders of TDP were present, the YSRCP-supported candidates swept the polls,” he remarked. He also countered the TDP’s remarks on YSRCP and said it was the other way round going by the yawning gap between the number of seats and the near sweep in Tekkali and other such constituencies speaking of the slump for TDP. “We also wish to bring to notice the biased nature of the State Election Commissioner, who indeed went overboard in the name of constitutional powers by harassing the officers by threatening to enter remarks in their service records, court cases, and acted more as a politician,’’ said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy. Challenge to Naidu Meanwhile, speaking at a separate press conference, Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana reiterated that the YSRCP-backed candidates swept the first phase of panchayat elections winning 82% of the seats. “I challenge Mr. Naidu to list out how TDP has secured 38% seats. The YSRCP supporters had won 2,637 out of 3,244 panchayats in the first phase elections, followed by TDP with 508 and independents 99 seats. People have reduced TDP to less than 15%,’’ said Mr. Satyanarayana. While hitting out at Mr. 4Naidu for distorting the facts, Mr. Satyanarayana said that people trusted Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s government that took public welfare to the next level by implementing various welfare schemes benefiting the downtrodden. Break-up Giving the district-wise breakup, he said in Srikakulam of the total 321 sarpanch posts , YSRCP supporters bagged 264, TDP got 53 and others won four. In Visakhapatnam, of 344, 269 went to YSRCP, 55 to TDP and 20 to others. In East Godavari, of 362 posts, 311 were secured by YSRCP, 44 TDP, and others seven. In West Godavari, of 239 sarpanch posts , 170 were bagged by YSRCP, 34 by TDP and 35 by others. In Krishna, out of 225 sarpanch posts, 185 were bagged by YSRCP, 37 by TDP and three by others. In Guntur, of the 337 seats, 264 won by YSRCP, 62 by TDP and 11 by others. In Prakasam, of 227 seats, 186 won by YSRCP, 35 by TDP and six by others. In Nellore, of 164 total, 133 were bagged by YSRCP, 28 by TDP and three by others. In Kadapa, of the total 206 seats, 179 were won by YSRCP, 23 by TDP and four by others.

11 February 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan makes the captain’s speech, literally||After spending close to 10 years in the sweltering cauldron of politics and 20 months as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy remains a sportsman in his heart. Having been the captain of Nagarjuna House in Hyderabad Public School and a cricketer during his schooling days, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy seemed to have carried on the temperament into politics as well. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy began his speech at a meeting held with secretaries of various departments at Secretariat on Wednesday that a captain in a cricket team was not alone enough to win matches, emphasising that teamwork was important and later thanking all his team members for the achievements over the last 20 months, a day after the party supporters swept the gram panchayat elections. After narrating the string of reforms launched during the last 20 months, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that it was time to consolidate on the good work done during the last two years and compared to the present period as ‘middle overs’. “Now after having done all the hard work, it is time for us to consolidate on the good start of our team. Everyone knows in cricket, a team loses focus if it relaxes in the middle overs and so I urge you to keep on working, introspect and coordinate for better results,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Welfare schemes Earlier, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the revolutionary policies and welfare measures launched by the State government had caught the attention of everyone in the country. Be it the enactment of Disha Act, the institution of volunteers, ward and village secretariats, the reverse tendering of infrastructure projects and the review of PPAs in power projects, all these policy decisions have caught the imagination of the people across the country, he said. “We have also launched DBT scheme to ensure that the cash benefits reach the beneficiary directly. We have taken up a massive programme to give house sites for 30.92 lakh beneficiaries across the State and probably, ours is only State to utilise the Prime Minister Awas Yojana to its fullness,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The Chief Minister ended his speech by congratulating Chief Secretary Adityanath Das on coming up with the idea to have a meeting of secretaries and asked the officers to give their feedback on the implementation of the schemes to ensure good governance. “It is a fact that we are still in financial problems. I remember Finance Secretary S.S. Rawat telling me that we have pending bill arrears of Rs. 60,000 crore, out of which Rs. 21,000 crore solely belong to electricity bills, but we are persisting and hope to come out of the crisis,” rounded off Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-makes-the-captains-speech-literally/article33806454.ece

11 February 2021||NELLORE/ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Panchayat polls: YSRCP puts up good show in Kavali and Ongole divisions||The ruling YSR Congress Party continued its winning streak as candidates backed by it won a majority of sarpanch and ward member seats in the first phase of the panchayat elections in Kavali division in Nellore district and Ongole division in Prakasam district. All is not lost for Telugu Desam Party, which had performed poorly in the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, as it came back into the reckoning. Aspirants supported by it won about 30% of sarpanch and ward member seats in the elections held on a non-party basis. The contestants backed by the YSRCP were successful in 98 Sarpanch and 616 ward member seats in Nellore district, while the candidates sponsored by the TDP bagged the sarpanch post in 40 villages and also won 400 ward member seats. In Prakasam district too, the YSRCP continued its winning ways as the candidates bagged the sarpanch post in 140 villages. The TDP-backed candidates clinched the sarpanch post in 52 places and also bagged about 30% of 1,415 ward member seats. State Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said the results showed that people fully reposed faith in the YSRCP. The TDP could not win a majority of Sarpanch seats even in the villages coming under the Assembly constituencies won by it in 2019, he said. The candidates backed by the ruling party had won 24 of the 28 Sarpanch seats coming under Ongole Assembly seat, he added. The “improved” performance of the TDP in the elections should be seen as a beginning of the downfall of the YSRCP, which had won all the 10 Assembly seats in Nellore district 2019, said TDP Nellore district Unit General Secretary Ch.Venkateswarlu Reddy. Buoyed by the TDP's better performance, the party would work for the return of the TDP to power in the State in 2024, said TDP Ongole Lok Sabha unit President N.Balaji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/good-show-by-ysrcp-in-south-coastal-districts/article33806445.ece

Starting from February 18, leaders cutting across party-lines would launch a series of agitations till the Centre took back its disinvestment decision, Communist Party of India(Marxist) Prakasam district president Punati Anjaneyulu. “It’s a do-or-die struggle now.” Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was achieved after a long-drawn struggle. Some legislators, including those from CPI(M), had submitted their resignations for the cause, he recalled. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should lead an all-party delegation to New Delhi to press for allotment of a captive mine to VSP to bring it back in the black, demanded CPI district secretary M.L. Narayana. Writing letter to the Centre would not suffice, he said. Pradesh Congress State vice-president Sripathy Prakasam, who was at the forefront of the ‘Visakha Ukku Andhrulu Hakku’ movement in his student days, said the need of the hour was a movement with the same intensity to exert pressure on the Centre. Communist Party of India(ML) New Democracy district secretary Ch.Venkateswarulu, who had taken part in the movement while studying in the Jawahar Bharati Degree College, Kavali, said the ‘LPG policies’ of the Narendra Modi government were responsible for the losses of the VSP. The VSP should be brought under Steel Authority of India Limited(SAIL) fold, felt Poura Samajam district president G.Narasimha Rao. It was unfortunate that the BJP-led NDA government was bent upon pushing public sector units as also the agriculture sector into the hands of big corporate firms, observed All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee(AISCC) Prakasam district convenor Ch.Ranga Rao and called for a strident struggle in the larger national interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/what-we-need-is-a-movement-to-stop-sale-of-vsp-cpim/article33806444.ece

However, to its surprise, it found that the figure quoted by the lowest bidder was 178% higher than its actual estimates. The bidder explained that all the items listed by TTD in its tender schedule would have to be imported and the cost would be dependent on foreign exchange rates. The bidder also added that the Euro had climbed to Rs. 88 at the time of submission of tenders as against Rs. 78 prevalent at the time of offering the quotation. This apart, GST on custom duties also pushed up the cost, the bidder said.

11 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kanaka Durga temple manages to tide over COVID crisis||Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam, also known as Kanaka Durga temple, here is not immune to ‘COVID-19 impact.’ But, the temple administration, apparently, managed to escape from it. The temple administration has managed to deposit Rs. 4 crore as a fixed deposit despite steep fall in revenues. According to information, Kanaka Durga temple revenues plummeted to mere Rs. 45.90 crore (from April to December 2020) compared to Rs. 122.88 crore during the corresponding period in 2019 financial year. The temple witnessed the ‘worst phase’ of the pandemic in June last. The temple received just Rs. 64 lakh, which was the lowest income of any month in 2020. It was not even one tenth of last financial year's corresponding month income of Rs. 10.70 crore. When contacted, Kanaka Durga temple Executive Officer (EO) M.V. Suresh Babu says that the drop in the number of pilgrims has had a consequent effect on the revenue of the temple which has seen a substantial drop in the offerings by devotees in Hundi, a cash chest of the temple, where devotees drop money. Though there is a slight increase in visits by devotees as compared to June, monthly revenues of the temple have not improved significantly. It was double digit revenue all through the financial year, 2019. In comparison, the revenues were single digit during all the months except October, 2020. The surge in income was solely due to Dasara festivities, he feels. Prudent measures Mr. Suresh Babu says that the temple management adopted ‘prudent fiscal measures’ to tide over the crisis. For instance, expenditure on firecrackers during the Dasara festival was avoided. The temple managed to pay the salaries to the tune of Rs. 2.80 crore and management fee of Rs. 1 crore. Also, cleared all the dues such as common good fund (CGF) to the Endowments Department. "The temple has Rs. 140 crore as FDRs (fixed deposit receipts) and Rs. 365 crore of Annadanam fund,” he says. With social distancing being enforced strictly, devotees are allowed darshan to avoid crowding. The devotee footfall used to be 20,000 to 25,000 per day. Now, it has come down to about 10,000 per day on normal days. The devotee rush used to be more than 1.25 lakh during Bhavani deeksha. The rush was not even 50,000 this season. “Despite the odds, we are able to take up developmental works. The government has recently sanctioned Rs. 70 crore for various works,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kanaka-durga-temple-manages-to-tide-over-covid-crisis/article33805951.ece
11 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Doctors stage relay fast against ‘mixopathy’||Members of Indian Medical Association (IMA) staged a relay strike in protest against the Union government's decision to allow Ayurvedic practitioners to perform medical surgeries, here on Wednesday. The doctors criticised the proposal to integrate all systems of medicine such as AYUSH and modern medicine, which is termed as ‘mixopathy’. They demanded that the government withdraw the notification that could allow Ayurveda graduates to perform 58 kinds of surgeries. IMA State general secretary G. Nanda Gopal said the government should explain the rationale behind allowing Ayurvedic doctors to perform surgeries. The government should take back its orders to save the lives of people. “How can the Ayurvedic doctors, who don't know the nuances and basics of medical equipment, perform surgeries?” he asked. ENT doctors took part in the relay strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/doctors-stage-relay-fast-against-mixopathy/article33806540.ece

Sunitha, said the department was working on an action plan to impart training to safai karamcharis through prominent skill development organisations and make them employable. Stating that education to all sections was the top priority of the government, she said the DBRC should ensure that the benefits of programmes such as Nadu-Nedu, Amma Vodi and Jagananna Vidya Deevena reached the rag-pickers’ families.

11 February 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Steel plant issue should be treated as a special case given public sentiments’||Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan has appealed to the Centre to reconsider the proposed strategic sale of its stake in the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and insisted that the issue should be dealt as a special case in respect to sentiments of the people. He said the YSRCP should convince the Centre to drop the proposal by leveraging its strength in the Parliament. “Why the YSRC kept quiet when it knew that the South Korean steel giant Posco and the RINL have reportedly entered signed an MoU in 2019,” he asked while addressing the media, along with party leader Nadendla Manohar in New Delhi on Wednesday. Mr. Kalyan said he had explained to the Home Minister Amit Shah how the VSP was special when compared to other industries and the serious consequences of selling it off to private companies. He also informed Mr. Shah, Union Ministers of State V. Muraleedharan (external affairs) and G. Kishan Reddy and some BJP MPs about the law and order situation in the State, vis-a-vis the recent attacks on temples, the State’s precarious financial position and the loss inflicted by Cyclone Nivar among a host of other issues. ‘Shoestring budget’ “I have laid emphasis on the need to retain the VSP in the public sector in view of the massive financial implications of privatisation and the devastating blow it would be dealing to the thousands of employees and lakhs of workers dependent on the plant for their livelihood,” he said.. Referring to the statements by some YSRCP leaders, the JSP chief wondered how the State would be able to buy the VSP when it (A.P. government) was struggling with shoestring budgets year after year due to the adverse impact of bifurcation. He said that Mr. Shah wanted to have detailed discussions on the strategy which the BJP-JSP combine should adopt for the future elections and that the issues pertaining to law and order would be accorded a priority. Asked to comment on the political party which is contemplated to be launched by Y.S. Sharmila, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said everyone has the right to form a party and that he would speak about it in detail only after the picture becomes clear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/steel-plant-issue-should-be-treated-as-a-special-case-given-public-sentiments/article33806451.ece

11 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||DCI plans expansion to meet future needs||The Dredging Corporation of India is all set to expand and strengthen its fleet of dredgers to meet the future demands of ports in India. At present, DCI owns 10 dredgers of different sizes and capacities. It is equipped to handle 60 million cubic metres of sand per year, while the requirement for ports that need annual dredging is close to 105 million cubic metres. “This is likely to grow to 160 million cubic metres in the next 10 years and to meet the demand, we need to expand our fleet and enhance the capacity of the existing fleet,” said K. Rama Mohan Rao, Chairman of Visakhapatnam Port Trust, who is also the chairman of DCI. He was speaking to reporters after inaugurating the annual beach nourishment programme, near INS Kursura Submarine Museum, here on Wednesday. “As part of the expansion, DCI is negotiating with Kochi Shipyard for building a 7,700 to 12,000-cubic metre dredger. This will add to our existing fleet of 10 and the new one is estimated to cost around Rs. 600-700 crore,” the DCI chairman told reporters. ‘Jumboisation’ Efforts are on to enhance the capacity of 5,500-cubic metre dredgers to 7000-cubic metre dredgers. “This process is called ‘jumboisation’. Here, the dredgers will be cut into two parts and the length is increased by adding an entire section, to enhance capacity,” he explained. Each jumboisation project is likely to cost DCI around Rs. 200 crore. Beach nourishment Every year, VPT takes up the beach nourishment programme as part of its corporate social responsibility. As part of the beach nourishment project, 2.10 lakh cubic metres of sand is dredged from the sand trap area and pumped into the beach area from RK Beach to Kursura Museum. The beach faces an erosion of the same amount of sand during the monsoon every year and this is pumped back to restore the balance. This year, VPT has again engaged DCI to take up the project at a cost of Rs. 15 crore, said Mr. Rama Mohan Rao. Erosion has been a major issue in this part of the beach and VPT has been running the beach nourishment programme for the last few years. “If we do not do it, the roads will be damaged and the surrounding areas may get affected in due course,” Mr. Rama Mohan Rao said. DCI Managing Director Rajesh Tripathi and other senior officials from VPT and DCI were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dci-planning-expansion/article33806196.ece
11 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Former TDP MLA launches fast against strategic sale of steel plant||Former TDP MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao launched indefinite fast at his party office in Gajuwaka from Wednesday protesting against the Union government’s decision to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). Speaking to The Hindu , he said that he would continue the fast till the government revoked the decision. The plant was set up after 32 people had sacrificed their lives and 19,000 families from over 68 villages had given their land for setting up of the plant, he said. He also reminded the government that the plant never made operating losses and the losses had piled up due to the high interest that it was paying on debts. Despite several attempts, the successive governments had never made to allocate captive mines to the VSP, due to which it had been incurring losses, as the production cost had gone up, said Mr. Srinivasa Rao. Initially, TDP leaders had planned to organise a relay hunger strike, but according to Mr. Srinivasa Rao, permission was not accorded. “That is why I decided to launch indefinite fast at my party office,” he said. He also said that other TDP leaders will support him by taking up relay fast along with him. Coming down heavily on YSRCP MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, “What does the MP mean by saying you should be prepared for everything. It clearly shows that the YSRCP has tacit understanding with the BJP-led Union government. He has to make his stand clear.” Later in the day, TDP MLA Ganta Srinivasa Rao, who had tendered his resignation recently, visited the site of the fast and addressed the gathering. He said he would launch a non-political JAC to take up the issue of the VSP. Other leaders were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/former-tdp-mla-launches-fast-against-strategic-sale-of-steel-plant/article33806571.ece

Sreerama Murty. At a seminar on ‘Review of the Budget-2021’, organised by the Public Relations Society of India (PRSI), Visakhapatnam chapter, here on Wednesday, Prof. Sreerama Murty said the idea of setting up a bad bank to resolve the mounting problem of non-performing assets (NPAs) was the need of the hour.

The deceased was identified as Paddam Nagamani (Chinni) of Nandipadu village in Aswaraopeta mandal. She had received the vaccine at a designated centre along with 95 other anganwadi workers and ANMs in Aswaraopeta on January 21. Sources in the health department said her death was not related to vaccination and attributed it to suspected “underlying and undiagnosed” health conditions citing “critical thrombocytopenia”. District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO) Bhaskar Naik, in a statement issued here on Wednesday night, said Nagamani died due to underlying health conditions. He asserted that the COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective. According to Nagamani’s family members, she developed fever the day after taking the jab. She suffered from recurrent fever for little over a week following which she was taken to the PHC at Vinayakapuram on February 6. The medical staff conducted a malaria test on her, which returned negative, sources said. As her condition did not improve despite medication, she was referred to the Government Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam, where she underwent treatment for high fever, blood pressure and low platelet count. She was subsequently referred to the district headquarters hospital in Khammam on Tuesday. The tribal woman died while being wheeled into the hospital on Tuesday night, sources added. She is survived by her husband and two children. Her relatives maintained that she had no pre-existing health conditions and sought assistance from the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/anganwadi-worker-dies-three-weeks-after-taking-virus-vaccine/article33806497.ece

Christened as ‘Praja Chaitanya Padayatra’, the mass contact programme is mainly aimed at galvanising public opinion to bring into spotlight the imminent submergence threat posed by the Polavaram project, under construction in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, to the Telangana’s famous temple town, said CPI (M) town secretary G Swamy. “If the Polavaram project is constructed as per the existing design envisaging the height of the dam at 150 feet, almost half of the temple town of Bhadrachalam is bound to face submergence threat from Godavari backwaters of the project, he said quoting some “experts’ contention.” Former Bhadrachalam MP Dr Midiam Babu Rao will flag off the padayatra in the presence of veteran CPI (M) leader and former MLA Kunja Bojji, the party State committee member B Ravi Kumar and others at AMC colony on Thursday. The padayatra will prominently highlight the “utter neglect” of the temple town by both the State and Central governments, Mr Swamy said deploring that the TRS government failed to fulfil its promise to release Rs. 100 crore for the development of the temple town till date.. Lack of an elected body for Bhadrachalam major gram panchayat is taking a toll on the development of the temple town, he lamented, blaming the government for the present ambiguity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpi-m-to-launch-five-day-padayatra/article33806271.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao declared that he would not seek votes in the next Assembly elections (in 2023) if the promised lift irrigation schemes are not completed in the next one-and-a-half years. Before addressing a ‘Thanksgiving meet’ here, Mr. Rao broke the coconut for Nellikal Lift Irrigation Scheme, though he had promised to do it “a day after the TRS government is re-elected” in 2018. The scheme will irrigate about 4,200 acres in and around Nellikal village. Laying the foundation stone following the local Banjara tradition, he also unveiled the inauguration plaques arranged serially at the same place, for works in various mandals in Nagarjunasagar, Huzurnagar, Miryalaguda and Devarakonda. The 12 schemes and works related to them are at Nellikal, AKBR-Angadipet, Bothalapalem-Wadapally, Dunnapothulagandi- Balnepally- Champlathanda, Keshavapuram-Kondrapole, Pogilla, Kambalapally, Amba Bhavani-Vizag colony, Peggagattu, LLC-HLC for D8&D9 canals, Janpahad branch canal and Mukthyal branch canal. However, neither the inaugural stone nor the plaques featured any information about the project, except for the names. According to officials, about 78,500 acres of unirrigable lands would get water once the schemes are completed and the total proposed outlay is Rs. 2,134.20 crore. Post-lunch, arriving for the ‘Dhanyavada Sabha’ at around 4.20 p.m., the Chief Minister was at the podium addressing an estimated one lakh people till about 5.30 p.m. While there were ‘good announcements’ initially — rewards and new sanctions for all villages in Nalgonda, the later part of his speech included scheme-wise comparison of welfare and governance during past Congress regimes vis-à-vis Telangana Rashtra Samithi, and followed by appeals to people for contemplation.  Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said sarpanches and many villages in Nalgonda district have registered good performance in various programmes such as Haritha Haram, Palle Pragathi and Pattana Pragathi. And as incentive, all the 844 gram panchayats in Nalgonda will be extended Rs. 20 lakh each. Similarly, mandal headquarters will get Rs. 30 lakh each for developmental works. He also decided to allocate funds to the eight municipalities in the district, and Nalgonda municipality will get the maximum Rs. 10 crore. Miryalaguda, another large municipality, will get Rs. 5 crore and the rest of the six municipalities will get Rs. 1 crore each. Mr. Rao said the reward amounts will be taken out from the ‘Chief Minister’s Special Fund’, and a total of Rs. 186 crore has been designated for the purpose. Long-pending irrigation projects – Srisailam Left Bank Canal tunnel project, the Udayasamudram Lift Irrigation Scheme and the Dindi Scheme – will be completed by making required allocations in the budget, Mr. Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/wont-seek-votes-if-li-schemes-are-not-completed-cm/article33806263.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Taste for tipple keeping many away from COVID vaccination||Many who missed their turn during the COVID-19 vaccination drive had fears and misconceptions about the vaccine as reason to stay away from the jab. But an unlikely reason has come to the notice of the State Health department. Some people are not taking the vaccine since they believe that they have to keep away from alcohol for two weeks to a month after taking the jab. Health department officials have termed it as a misconception. “Don’t take alcohol on the day of vaccination. You can lead your normal lifestyle, continue with eating and drinking habits on other days. We are not promoting alcohol. But it has come to the notice of the Health department that some are not taking the vaccine because of this misconception. We are clarifying that there is no relation between alcohol consumption and vaccination,” said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao addressing media at State Health Campus, Koti, on Wednesday afternoon. In an attempt to encourage more people take the jab, the senior official said that he too ‘celebrated’ a couple of days after taking the vaccine. “I underwent vaccination day before yesterday. Out of happiness, I celebrated yesterday night. Take vaccine and celebrate after a gap of 24 hours,” said Dr Rao, who took Covaxin on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/taste-for-tipple-making-many-steer-clear-of-jab/article33806231.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||International conspiracy to destabilise India: ex-DGP||Former Director General of Police K. Aravinda Rao on Wednesday sketched out a vast international conspiracy involving academicians, historians, NGOs and global powers to destabilise India. Delivering the Durgabai Deshmukh Memorial Lecture on ‘India’s Security — Threats, Internal and External’, the former top cop said that the Left liberals have a worldwide appeal while the conservative forces have a small pool. “Sometime back in many universities of the country, there was a clear attempt to divide people into the so-called SC, ST, BC and minorities in one group and the rest into another group. Similar experiments were carried out in other countries triggering civil wars,” said Mr. Rao. “Because India is a vast country, they are unable to create civil wars but they are a source of continuous nuisance. They are following the philosophy of Chairman Mao who spoke about bleeding a giant with a thousand gnats,” said Mr. Rao, as he linked the farmers’ protest near Delhi, Shaheenbagh protest, agitations against nuclear projects and copper projects to backing by the Left liberals. “We have to think why celebrities like Rihanna or climate activists like Greta Thunberg are talking about the farmers’ agitation. The celebrities are internationalising everything in the country. Many NGOs are active in India and back agitations raising issues like human rights and social justice. Why should they do that?” asked Mr. Rao addressing a large gathering of academicians and students at the MV hall of Durgabai Deshmukh academic campus in the city. In his nearly one-hour lecture on Wednesday, Mr. Aravinda Rao spoke on how historians were defaming Indian heritage and culture and being paid for it.

The Commission has projected double digit growth for the State’s GSDP and revenue receipts for the five-year period 2021-22 to 2025-26 while the tax to GSDP ratio is likely to range between 7.5% to 8.3% during the period. According to the assessed own revenue receipts projected in the report, the State’s GSDP is expected to grow from 10.28 lakh crore during 2021-22 to Rs. 16.25 lakh crore by 2025-26 registering over 10% growth each year. The own revenue receipts are projected to grow from Rs. 91,053 crore in 2021-22 to Rs. 1,55,574 crore by 2025-26. Own tax receipts are projected to grow from Rs. 78,653 crore to Rs. 1,35,123 crore during the period. Revenue expenditure during the period is expected to be between Rs. 91,053 crore and Rs. 1,18,959 crore, according to the Finance panel’s projections. The report said the interest payments could constitute 1.3% of the GSDP and the outstanding debt and liabilities as percentage of the GSDP stood at 22.9%. This, according to an official who participated in the meetings convened by the XV Finance Commission, could be a matter of concern. The indicative debt path of the State government as percentage of the GSDP is pegged little over 29% by the Commission. Interest payment, the Commission’s report said, would be Rs. 15,931 crore during 2021-22 and this would progressively increase to Rs. 22,488 crore by the end of 2025-26. The State continues to be a revenue surplus State with pre-devolution surplus pegged at Rs. 2,155 crore for 2021-22 and this is expected to reach Rs. 40,801 crore by 2025-26. The revenue surplus post devolution is likely to start at Rs. 15,999 crore in 2021-22 and reach Rs. 63,347 crore by 2025-26. The State is expected to receive GST compensation of an estimated Rs. 1,570 crore during the fiscal 2021-22 and this is expected to reach Rs. 4,186 crore by the end of 2025-26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/finance-panel-projects-healthy-growth/article33806259.ece

In a memorandum presented to the CEO, Mr. Sanjay requested faster progress in the Manoharabad-Kothapalli line where Rs. 325 crore was sanctioned -- yet the progress was slow in the last two years. A new line connecting Karimnagar to Hasanparthi via Huzurabad did not get any allotments this year although survey work has been completed. He sought the work to be sanctioned when the supplementary budget is presented. The bypass line between Kazipet-Peddapalli route needs to be taken up on a priority basis in view of congestion on the regular routes, he said. Road over Bridges (RoBs) are urgently required to solve the traffic issues at Teegalaguttapalli level crossing and the level crossing between Kothapalli to Gangadara or at the Ramadugu gate.

As part of scaling up its production to 70 million tonnes during 2021-22, the company management has already put in motion plans to commence production in four opencast mines as also from the new panel in the Adriyala Longwall project. Further, it is planning to take up mining in the Naini coal block in Odisha at least in the second half of the next fiscal. According to the company officials, public hearing as part of the process for getting environmental clearance for Naini was held recently. The company has also stepped up its efforts to get clearances for mining in Venkatapur, Rompedu, KTK extension, Goleti, MVK and GDK-10 opencast mines. Work on getting necessary clearances for the New Patrapada coal block, also in Odisha, has also been stepped up. The Stage-I in-principle approval for the project was given in April last year and with the Stage-II approval given recently, the coal company is allowed to take up a detailed survey and investigation as part of prospecting and exploration for coal reserves by drilling 16 boreholes with four-inch diameter each in an area of about 4.79 square km. In the approval given for investigation, the Forest Department has made it clear that the prospecting exercise in the forest area under consideration is only for resource assessment and mapping and it would not confer any right to divert the land for mining purpose since the clearance is given only for prospecting. The user agency, SCCL, has also been told to plant 20 tall trees per borehole area, preferably in the degraded forest area, to maintain the green cover, to take up proper plugging of borehole after the exploration activity, not resorting to any tree felling as part of exploration, not to lay new road to transport prospecting tools and machinery and use only existing path and not to cause any harm to the wildlife in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sccl-to-take-up-coal-prospecting-in-tadicherla-block-ii-area/article33806267.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Jab for 50-plus, those with co-morbidities next month||People in Telangana who are aged above 50 years and those below 50 years with co-morbidities would receive COVID-19 vaccine next month. “Vaccination for people above 50 years, and those below 50 years with co-morbidities will begin from March first or second week,” said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao. The vaccination drive was launched on January 16. The first priority was given to healthcare workers (HCWs) from government and private sector. Each person will be given two doses of the vaccine with a gap of 28 days. After the drive for HCWs ended on February 5, immunisation for frontline workers (FLWs) began. As part of it, employees from Police, Municipality, Panchayat Raj and Revenue departments are being given the jab and it will continue till February 12. The second dose for the HCWs will begin on February 13. In case of HCWs and FLWs, data of beneficiaries was uploaded in the COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) software. According to ‘COVID-19 Vaccines Operation Guidelines’, general population can self-register on Co-WIN by providing basic demographic details such as name, details of co-morbidities and date of birth. Eleven photo identity cards such as Aadhaar card, MNREGA card and PAN card are listed for ID proof for the registration process. However, Dr Srinivasa Rao said another version of Co-WIN will be introduced for the general population to self-register. It had not been launched till Wednesday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vaccine-for-the-50-plus-those-with-co-morbidities-in-march/article33806234.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Senior police officers lead by example||Senior officers of the police department took COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday as part of the immunisation drive for frontline workers (FLWs). Health department officials said this send across a message to the officers’ subordinates that the vaccine is safe. Among seven senior officers who took the vaccine at State Health Campus, Koti, were Ravi Gupta, principal secretary, State Home department, and Sandeep Shandilya, ADGP (Railways and Road Safety). Their subordinates took the jab too. The number of beneficiaries among FLWs who are turning up to take the vaccine is low, clearly indicating hesitancy to take the vaccine. From January 16, when the vaccination drive was launched, till February 10, a total of 2,57,940 beneficiaries were vaccinated. Of them, 1,93,485 were healthcare workers (HCWs) in the government and private sector, and the remaining 64,455 are FLWs from Police, Municipality, Panchayat Raj, and Revenue departments. The targeted number of HCWs were around 3,31,124 and a little over 58% of them took the jabs. The drive for FLWs was launched on February 6. Till February 10, the Health department targeted vaccination of 1,75,095 FLWs, but only 64,455 took the jab, which comes to 37% of the target. Speaking to media personnel on the occasion, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said they have observed some hesitancy among FLWs to take the coronavirus jab. “Please take the vaccine when your turn comes. It protects you when you get exposed to the virus,” he said. Dr Srinivasa Rao said senior police officers were given Covisheild, and added that he took Covaxin and was doing fine. 35% of target met Health staff administered COVID-19 vaccine to 14,457 FLWs on Wednesday. One case of severe Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) and three minor AEFI cases were reported. While the target on Wednesday was 41,850 beneficiaries, only 35% took the jab. The drive for the FLWs would end on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/senior-police-officers-lead-by-example/article33806236.ece
11 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS to have a smooth sailing in Mayor election||With requisite numbers on its side, the ruling TRS will have a smooth sailing in the Mayor and Deputy Mayor election of the GHMC to be held on Thursday. Unconfirmed sources revealed that the TRS has finalised two names, Vijaya Lakshmi and Mothe Sri Latha, elected from Tarnaka division. However, even senior ministers in the government have not been informed about the final selection till late in the night. TRS chief and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, as is his wont, is ensuring the surprise element to his choice. Officials reveal that in case of an election, the winning candidate needs just one vote more than the opponent. The quorum for conducting the elections is 97 members. Apart from the 149 corporators (one elected corporator of the BJP passed away recently), GHMC has 45 ex-officio members taking the total strength to 194. As of now, TRS has 56 elected members, BJP has 47 and AIMIM 44 while Congress has two members. TRS also has 31 ex-officio members thus giving it a clear edge over all other parties. So it would be easy for the party to sail through is the argument of TRS leaders. BJP to contest The BJP has decided to put up its candidate ensuring an election. “The idea is just to expose the TRS-MIM understanding as we don’t have the strength,” a senior leader said. Elected corporators of the party will meet at a temple in Basheerbagh in the morning and later will have a breakfast meeting at a restaurant nearby and proceed to the GHMC office. BJP MLC N. Ramchander Rao is leading the party candidates as Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy and BJP president Bandi Sanjay are attending the Parliament sessions. The TRS also apparently toyed with the idea of postponing the elections. But as per the GHMC Act, it can be done only if the elected body is dissolved, which is unlikely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-to-have-a-smooth-sailing-in-mayor-election/article33806247.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||National Centre for Additive Manufacturing in city?||Hyderabad is in the race to host the National Centre for Additive Manufacturing (NCAM) that the Central government has proposed to accelerate digital revolution of industrial production. Additive manufacturing or AM, better known as 3D printing, is revolutionising product design and on-location manufacturing globally, according to a discussion paper on the upcoming National Strategy for Additive Manufacturing. Inviting comments on the strategy, the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said AM is enabling radical product design and re-design, which further accelerate development of new material properties. It is also contributing to transformation of business capabilities through production of more sustainable designs realised at lower cost. The NCAM will be one of its kind facility in the country. While many States are in contention, Telangana is hopeful of bagging the facility given the ecosystem in Hyderabad as well as the presence of T-Works, IT and Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said. The Emerging Technologies Wing of the IT Department had recently organised a virtual stakeholder consultation workshop to fine tune the State’s strategy with regard to AM. A release on Wednesday said the consultation identified initiatives to drive the adoption of AM in industry and match global standards. “NCAM will nurture domestic AM industry, reduce import dependency of domestic market and position India as a global hub for Additive Manufacturing development and deployment. The centre will serve national objectives like self-reliance,” Mr. Ranjan said. The stakeholders meeting stressed on setting up a world-class state of the art facility for industrial use with necessary infrastructure and resources to enable research and development and innovation, product design and development, skilling and capacity building programmes. The consultation workshop emphasised on the significance of establishing a global innovation and research hub for AM as also building a world-class skilled workforce on designing and developing AM products. After the roundtable, Mr.Ranjan had tweeted: “Received very valuable inputs to conceptualise and formulate a proposal on setting up National Centre for Additive Manufacturing.” The discussion paper said the Union Ministry is in the process of evolving a strategy to promote all the verticals of the AM sector, including machines, materials, software and designs to leverage the untapped business opportunities in this emerging technology will unfold in the near future. The plan is to establish a National Centre on AM for harnessing AM transformation and driving capabilities by continuously engaging all key stakeholders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/national-centre-for-additive-manufacturing-in-city/article33806255.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCB to become a ‘Varied Board’||The one-year extended term of the eight elected members of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) has come to an end, and now all eyes are on the Defence Ministry, which is expected to announce the formation of a ‘Varied Board’ on Wednesday. The Ministry had earlier extended the tenure of the elected members twice for six months each and with the election notification not issued, a Varied Board consisting of president Brigadier Abhijit Chandra, who is also Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Sub Area Commander; Chief Executive Officer B. Ajith Reddy; and a nominated civilian member will take charge. Senior officials said the Varied Board will have powers equivalent to that of the full board and will continue to administer day-to-day affairs of the Secunderabad Cantonment till elections are held for the eight civilian wards. The other seven members are drawn from the local military authority and one representative from the State government — district revenue officer. Elections to the civilian wards are held on non-political party basis and one among them is elected as the vice-president. Generally, the elected members move closer to the ruling party in the State and Centre. With the BJP in power at the Centre and many seasoned politicians from the Cantonment joining the party in recent times, there is a lot of speculation and lobbying for the single-nominated civilian member in the Varied Board. Meeting heavyweights Interested candidates have been meeting top leaders like Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Union Minister of State for Home and Secunderabad MP G. Kishan Reddy, national OBC morcha president K. Laxman, general secretary M. Srinivas. vice president Vivek Venkatswamy and others. Former SCB vice president J. Pratap and former Minister G. Vijayarama Rao , both recent entrants into BJP, are considered among top contenders. Mr. Pratap, who has been a member of the Varied Board earlier and has the distinction of being elected four times as a member, has a former political base in the Cantonment. Mr. Rao has been one of the senior leaders of TRS and could well be in contention for the Cantonment Assembly constituency ticket from the party. Political grapevine is abuzz that the BJP wants to choose a leader who will help strengthen it at the grassroots so as to give a firmer base in the next Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scb-to-become-a-varied-board/article33806239.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao if he is claiming rights over Telangana with an unfinished and “corruption-ridden” Kaleshwaram project then what about Congress that built Nagarjunasagar, Srisailam and all other irrigation projects?

They requested the court to call for the records of the special court and quash the same. The petitioners contended that hearing the cases registered under money laundering Act by the ED prior to the cases registered by CBI would cause irreparable damage to their interests. The petitioners told the court that initially CBI had falsely booked them under different sections of Indian Penal Code. Based on these cases, the ED authorities invoked the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and booked cases. They stated that earlier the CBI court had permitted simultaneous hearing of the cases booked by both the CBI and the ED authorities. However, on this January 11 the CBI court permitted to take up hearing of the cases booked by the ED preceding the hearing of CBI cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jagati-publications-moves-hc-seeking-cbi-court-order-suspension/article33806269.ece

The victims were identified as Pasula Saraswathi, school assistant from Rangasaipet, Veerla Sridhar (38), a fertilizer shop owner from Hanmakonda, and his employee Bhairi Rakesh (28). Another occupant of the car, Vijay Bhaskar, sales manager at Sridhar’s store, managed to swim out, while others died on the spot. Mamnoor Assistant Commissioner of Police A. Naresh Kumar said the accident took place around 9.50 a.m. when Sridhar, who was behind the wheel, took a sharp right turn to avoid hitting an oncoming bike on the canal road. “It was already overspeeding and there is a left curve on the stretch, and suddenly a two-wheeler was speeding from the opposite direction and to avoid ramming the bike, he took a right turn and the car plunged into the SRSP canal,” he said. The car jumped the side railings of the canal bridge and fell in the water. According to him, the victim Sridhar and Vijay Bhaskar went to Tigarajpalli to collect money and promote their business. Rakesh joined them at Tigrajapallu and as the two shops which they targeted were closed, the trio started for Parvathagiri. Saraswathi, who works at Government School, Gunturpalli, was waiting for a vehicle at Tigarajpalli to reach her school. She saw Sridhar's car approaching, sought lift till Gunturpalli and boarded, Mr. Kumar said and added that the accident took place nearly half a kilometre after she got into the ill-fated car.

Though locals and passers-by tried to help the victims by throwing ropes, it was in vain. While bodies of Sridar and Saraswathi were retrieved, efforts were on to fish out Rakesh’s body which was swept away and spotted 5 km from the spot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/three-killed-as-car-plunges-into-srsp-canal/article33806258.ece

11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Portal glitches send chit fund operators into a tizzy||All State government departments are competing with each other to adopt information technology (IT) to come closer to people. But, the Stamps and Registration department seems to be having different thoughts. At least that is the impression people are getting when they are trying to reach the T Chits portal of the department. The portal is not working for the past 10 days. Those attempting to check the portal are greeted with the message saying “we are doing maintenance activities”. Such technical glitches are not uncommon. Normally, websites or portals having public or specific group interface are restored quickly. On February 1, when the glitch was reported, a message was displayed saying “will be back soon, check after 15 minutes”. Now, the message says “it is taking longer than expected and check after some time”. Thousands of registered chit fund operators who had to upload all their documents to the portal are in chaos. “We can understand if it is for a couple of hours or day. Taking such long period for maintenance works of a web portal is strange,” says one of them. Chit fund operators cannot carry on their crucial documentation process without the web portal. From beginning a new chit group to secure release of a fixed deposit amount, all operations are routed through the web portal. To secure permission to start a new chit group, be it of one lakh or one crore rupees, one has to apply online to secure the Previous Sanction Order (PSO). Different forms too are required to be uploaded. A sum equal to the chit amount had to be made as fixed deposit. Once the chit group attains maturity, the operator would get back the fixed deposit amount. “With the portal not working for 10 days, all our works related to fixed deposits, starting new groups are hanging in thin air,” say the chit operators. In fact, they are facing pressure from the chit subscribers for return of their matured chit amounts. For now, they are keeping their fingers crossed and praying silently for the portal to come back into action mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/portal-glitches-send-chit-fund-operators-into-a-tizzy/article33806225.ece

As many as 38 two-wheelers worth Rs. 30 lakh were seized from their possession. Police identified the accused as Md Rizwan (19), a resident of Yakutpura, Md Yaseen (19), a resident of Bhavaninagar, Mir Hamza (19), a resident of Yakutpura, and Mohd Wajeed (24), a resident of Maulali. Three others Syed Ahmed Mehdi (21), M.A. Aziz (20) and Numan are absconding. Police said that Rizwan shared with the other accused rental scooter service VOGO’s method of functioning. The accused then allegedly conspired to commit thefts of these scooters from Metro stations. They managed to steal 38 such vehicles from both Hyderabad and Rachakonda police commissionerates. Since the two-wheelers require a one-time password to start, they allegedly towed the vehicles from where they were parked, removed the GPS, which was fitted on to the vehicles, and replaced them with a manual locking system. They also fabricated the registration documents to sell them off to unsuspecting buyers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/automobile-theft-gang-busted-38-bikes-seized/article33806252.ece

He said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, announced that the State government would be closing down all the IKP and PACs centers which procure agriculture produce of farmers at MSP. He claimed that Mr. Rao cited the new farm laws as the reason for closing down the procurement centres from this Rabi season onwards. He sought to know as to what transpired in the meeting between PM Modi and the Chief Minister. The Congress MP said that the BJP government at the Centre is insincere and non-committal on MSP and procurement of agriculture produce although the President mentioned about them in his address. He said that the budgetary allocations for schemes through which the government was supposed to implement MSP have been reduced year-on-year. Quoting figures, he said Rs. 3,000 crore were allocated for Price Support Scheme in the year 2019-20 and it was reduced to Rs. 2,000 crore in 2020-21 and further reduced to Rs. 1,500 crore in 2021-22.

AvadhaniSIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Oustee says land shown by MRO at Vemulaghat is not his||In an interesting twist, a farmer who was shown his land by the mandal Tahsildar claimed that it was not his land while officials insist that it is his. The incident took place at Vemulaghat village in Toguta mandal of Siddipet district on Wednesday. According to sources, one Gandla Tirupathi, son of Srisailam, approached the High Court regarding his land of 23 guntas in the village in 2019, which had directed the officials not to touch his land. Alleging that his land was completely damaged by the officials, Mr. Tirupathi again approached the court. The High Court directed the officials to show Gandla Tirupathi (son of Srisailam) his land and restore it to him The orders were issued on February 5 by Justice M.S. Ramchandra Rao in contempt case number 809 of 2019. Though name of another Gandla Tirupathi, son of Nagaiah was mentioned, it was informed that he has no land. “In this contempt case, on 13-12-2019, this court passed an interim order restraining the respondents from dispossessing the petitioners from their lands and also from changing the physical features of their lands until further orders,” read the court order.

When the original owner came, he was forcibly silenced by the officials,” said Mr. Tirupathi. “We have conducted panchanama and shown the land to Mr. Tirupathi as per court directions. He is stating that it is not his land. But we have performed our duty,” Tahsildar G.

11 February 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||‘Ours is a farmer-friendly govt.’||Finance Minister T. Harish Rao said that they were taking several welfare measures for farmers as TRS government was a farmer-friendly government. Rythu Vedikas Addressing a gathering after inaugurating Rythu Vedikas at Chidruppa, Kandi, Pothireddypally and Sadashivapet on Wednesday along with Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy, Zilla Parishad Chairperson P. Manjushree and others, Mr. Rao said that water problem across the State was addressed after formation of Telangana State. “During the Telugu Desam Party tenure, power bills were collected but there was no power. Though Congress promised free power, it has failed to provide quality power. It was only TRS government which has been offering quality power round-the-clock for the farm sector. We are also ensuring Rs. 5 lakh to a family in case of a farmer’s death,” he said. The Minister also informed that Rs. 700 crore was given to farmers in Sangareddy district alone under Rythu Bandhu in the present season. Informing that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has been considering extending farm equipment on subsidy, the Finance Minister said that about two crore acres were being cultivated every year in Telangana after formation of a separate state. He also urged farmers to go for alternative crops like fruits, vegetables and flowers. He said that about Rs. 200 crore worth road works were taken up in Sangareddy alone after formation of Telangana. Mr. Harish Rao promised to release Rs. 20 lakh for roads and Rs. 10 lakh for drainage at Chidruppa village in Kandi mandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ours-is-a-farmer-friendly-govt/article33806501.ece

11 February 2021||LUCKNOW,||Reinstate LGBT member of U.P. Home Guards: HC||Treating a person’s sexual orientation as an offence would be interference in the individual’s right of privacy, the Allahabad High Court noted as it directed the Uttar Pradesh Home Guards to reinstate a staff member belonging to the LGBT community whose appointment was cancelled after a video revealing the person’s sexual orientation was widely shared. The court directed the Commandant General of Home Guards, Headquarters, Lucknow, U.P., to take the aggrieved petitioner back in service with immediate effect. The petitioner shall be entitled to all admissible dues and the honorarium shall be paid regularly as and when the same was due, the court noted. Viral video Referring to the order dated June 11, 2019, through which the petitioner’s appointment was cancelled, the court said it was done on account of “some video of the petitioner which was made viral by someone.” The assertion in paragraph No. 8 of the counter affidavit showed the perception of the officer, District Commandment of Home Guards, Bulandshar, who had passed the order of cancellation, the court said. “From the reading of the order itself, it is found to be vindictive in nature,” Justice Sunita Agarwal noted in an order dated February 2, while quashing the order of cancellation of the appointment of the petitioner. The sexual orientation of the petitioner had been stated to be “indulgence in untoward activity”, which was completely in violation of the observations of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India reported in (2018) 10 SCC 1, the court said. The Supreme Court in the said case held that the sexual orientation of the person was an individual choice and any act of treating it as an offence would be interference in the right of the privacy of the person concerned, Justice Agarwal noted. Any display of affection among the members of the LGBT community towards their partners in public, so long as it did not amount to indecency or had the potentiality to disturb public order, could not be bogged down by majority perception, the court further said referring to the Supreme Court case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/reinstate-lgbt-member-of-up-home-guards-hc/article33806136.ece
11 February 2021||Mumbai,||Shahid Azmi murder case: 11 years on, only three of 107 witnesses examined||It has been 11 years since advocate Shahid Azmi was killed for representing clients he believed were falsely implicated in terror crimes. However, only three of 107 witnesses have been examined and cross-examined in the murder trial. On February 11, 2010, Azmi was home around 8 p.m. when his office boy told him that some clients were waiting for him at his office. Upon reaching his office, he saw two men waiting inside his cabin and two others waiting in the outside area. Azmi called the other two in and they shot him. The office boy ran and called his mother. She, along with others, took Azmi to a hospital where he was declared “brought dead”. The accused — Devendera Jagptap, Pintu Dagale, Vinod Vichare and Hasmukh Solanki — were arrested the same day. While Mr. Jagtap and Mr. Solanki are in jail, the others are out on bail. Azmi was representing many accused in the 7/11 train blasts case, Malegaon 2006 bomb blasts case, the Aurangabad arms haul case, and the Ghatkopar blasts case. His brother, advocate Khalid Azmi, said, “Shahid received many death threats on calls, and he had also written to Kurla police station and the then Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court judge about it. He also tried to meet the then Commissioner of Police and seek protection. But my brother was unheard.” Public Prosecutor Vaibhav Bagade told The Hindu , “The trial started in December 2018 before Judge U.M. Padwad. The complainant, an eyewitness and two panch witnesses have been examined and we are awaiting cross-examination. The trial had to be stalled because of COVID-19, the next date is February 15.” Mr. Khalid Azmi said there had been a delay in conducting the trial because the accused kept filing bail applications. The accused have been charged under Sections 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault) of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 3 (licence for acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition), 25 (punishment for certain offences) and 27 (punishment for using arms, etc.) of the Arms Act. On Thursday, the Fourth Advocate Shahid Azmi Memorial Lecture titled, ‘Justice in Indian Judiciary’, will be organised by the Innocence Network, which provides pro bono legal and investigative services to individuals seeking to prove their innocence of crimes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/shahid-azmi-murder-case-11-years-on-only-three-of-107-witnesses-examined/article33806326.ece

11 February 2021||New Delhi,||Healthcare workers await second jab and a return to normal life||From booking flight tickets to meet parents on the other side of the country to making plans to attend Church with the whole family, healthcare workers who are expected to be the first ones to get the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine have started making plans to get back to ‘normal’ life.      The Hindu spoke to three healthcare workers who were the first ones to be inoculated in Delhi on January 16, the day the COVID-19 vaccination drive was rolled out nationwide.     All three said they did not suffer any reaction to the vaccine, not even “mild fever”, and they would get their family members vaccinated as soon as possible.     Biji Tomy, 48, a nurse from Kalady in Kerala, who was the first to get the vaccine at Lok Nayak Hospital, said she desperately wanted to meet her parents.     “I have not seen my pappa and mommy in about two years. I cannot wait any longer, so I have booked a flight ticket to Kochi on February 16. The last time I went home was in May 2019,” said the mother of two children.     She had volunteered to get the first dose of the vaccine on the first day when many were still skeptical about the jab. ‘A little anxious’ “Even though I volunteered, I was a little anxious when I was waiting to take the vaccine, but there were no issues. Now, also people are saying we don’t know whether the second dose will create any reactions. I am a little anxious but I hope this will also go smoothly,” Ms. Tomy added.     The second dose of the vaccine will be administered from February 13, according to the Central government, but the Delhi government is yet to make any announcement about it. Ms. Tomy said she was yet to get any message from the government on when she will get her second dose of the vaccine.                 Anita Ryder, 43, who is part of the support staff at Aakash Healthcare, was the first one to be inoculated at the hospital. “Before the pandemic, I used to go to Church every Sunday with my three children, husband, and mother-in-law. Once we all get the vaccine, I am really looking forward to restarting this. This was our family time."     Ms. Ryder, who lives in Noida, said there are COVID restrictions at her Church right now and there is no Mass on Sundays.     ‘Will continue to wear mask’ Vikas Dogra, who was the first to get vaccinated at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said he has not made any plans after getting the vaccine. “After getting the vaccine and mandatory period of caution after it, I am safe, but I could still be spreading the virus. So, it doesn't make a difference. I will still maintain caution and wear a mask,” said Dr. Dogra.     He, however, said that he wants to get his 63-year-old mother vaccinated as soon as possible.     “I was the nodal officer for COVID-19 at the hospital. In the beginning, I stayed at the hospital and did not go home for more than five months. During the peak of the pandemic, people were asking, ‘Why this much time is being taken to develop a vaccine?’ But now that the vaccine is out, many are not taking it and saying that ‘it was developed too soon’. More people will have to take the vaccine for things to get back to normal,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/healthcare-workers-await-second-jab-and-a-return-to-normal-life/article33806130.ece

The by-election to five seats of the municipal corporations is to be held on February 28. AAP leader and party in-charge of municipal corporations, Durgesh Pathak, held a march in support of Shalimar Bagh candidate Sunita Mishra on Wednesday. “People are completely fed up with the corruption of BJP-ruled civic bodies and they have made up their mind to vote against BJP in the upcoming election and elect AAP,” Mr. Pathak said. Model of governance “Kejriwal government has done remarkable work in sectors like education, healthcare, electricity, transport and others. In these years, it has established a new model of governance and discussion on this model is happening across the world. On the other hand, in Delhi we have the model of the BJP-ruled corporations. The BJP has been ruling the corporations for the last 15 years and their model is rampant corruption and full of lies,” the AAP leader said. The party also alleged that “rattled” by farmers’ protest, the BJP has taken a u-turn and has decided that the zilla Panchayat election in Uttar Pradesh will not happen under party symbols. “We all know that in the zilla Panchayat election, the farmers are the key voters and that is why the BJP is rattled,” said AAP MP Sanjay Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/development-or-corruption-delhiites-will-make-choice-in-civic-bypolls-aap/article33806131.ece

Steps such as seeking the opinion of experts from IIT to know the causes of pollution in Delhi are “commendable”, he said. But, at the same time, steps such as dense carpeting of PWD roads are also required. “These roads have broken at different locations.

11 February 2021||Pune,||Ajit Pawar quells rumours about second Maharashtra Deputy CM||Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday quashed speculation about Maharashtra getting another Deputy Chief Minister. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said any such major decision could only be taken by the three heads of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition, comprising Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress. Mr. Pawar, speaking in Nashik, remarked, “This MVA government is functioning perfectly well in accordance with the Common Minimum Programme as agreed on by the three parties. If any change is to be made, then it will be done with due consultation among Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Until then, if anyone is deliberately indulging in such speculation, then they ought to stop it immediately.” Trigger for rumours Rumours about the Congress demanding the post of a second Deputy Chief Minister were triggered after Nana Patole resigned as the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly and was anointed the new Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee chief. At the time of the formation of the MVA, with Sena president Mr. Thackeray staking claim to the Chief Ministership, and Ajit Pawar getting the Deputy’s post, that of the Speaker was given to the Congress as ‘compensation’. Accordingly, with the Speaker’s berth now empty, it was speculated that if the NCP or the Sena staked their claims to the post, then the Congress would demand a separate Deputy Chief Ministerial post. Mr. Pawar also took potshots at the Centre’s failure to break the stalemate in the ongoing farmers’ agitation. He said, “Even after 14 rounds, nothing is coming of the parleys… it would have been better had Prime Minister Modi shown the same empathy to the agitating farmers that he showed the other day while giving a teary-eyed farewell to senior Congressman Ghulam Nabi Azad on the end of his Rajya Sabha tenure.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ajit-pawar-quells-rumours-about-second-maharashtra-deputy-cm/article33806327.ece
11 February 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra records 3,451 new COVID-19 cases||Maharashtra reported 3,451 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, taking its active case tally to 35,633 and total case tally to 20,52,253.

11 February 2021||Pune,||Khadse land grab case: Pune lawyer issues notice to ED||While it is the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which knocks doors and issues notices over financial misdemeanours, noted Pune-based lawyer-activist Asim Sarode has slapped a notice on the ED. According to Mr. Sarode, the ED had requested him to hand over documents in the alleged land grab case involving former Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse soon after the former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader changed his political colours to join Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party. However, Mr. Sarode, who had taken photocopies of the case documents, claims that the ED had sent an ‘unauthorised’ person to collect them and that the agency had not paid him. “I received a phone call in December last year from a certain Mr. Rajesh Kumar, Assistant Director [MBZO-II], ED office, Mumbai, in which the latter said he wanted the case documents pertaining to Mr. Khadse’s alleged land grab handed over without delay. Accordingly, it was agreed that the ED would bear the costs of photocopying the 1,350 documents, which altogether came to Rs. 1,440,” said Mr. Sarode. However, on January 5, a certain person, who, while admitting that he was not an officer from the ED, nevertheless said that he was ‘authorised’ by the agency to collect the case documents turned up at the lawyer’s office. “He did not have any assignment letter with him. When I demanded that he show his identity card, he called up Mr. Kumar. After taking what seemed to be some instructions from the ED Assistant Director, he left abruptly giving an absurd excuse that there were media people in my office… This casual approach of collection of documents on part of a top investigative agency was not appropriate behaviour,” Mr. Sarode said, adding that he had accordingly sent a notice to the ED demanding the payment of the photocopies. In 2019, Mr. Sarode, on behalf of anti-corruption activist Anjali Damania had filed an intervention application challenging the ‘clean chit’ given by the Maharashtra anti-corruption bureau to Mr. Khadse concerning a prime plot of land belonging to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation in Pune’s Bhosari area that he had allegedly acquired by abusing his position as revenue minister in the BJP-led government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/khadse-land-grab-case-pune-lawyer-issues-notice-to-ed/article33806329.ece
11 February 2021||Saharanpur,||Beneath 56-inch chest, PM has a small heart, says Priyanka||Launching a direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra said on Wednesday, “Beneath the 56-inch chest, the Prime Minister has a small heart that beats for his billionaire friends.” Speaking at a kisan mahapanchayat in Saharanpur,  Ms. Vadra said if voted to power, her party would repeal the laws. Questioning the intention of the government, she said the PM was spending Rs. 20,000 crore on the redevelopment of the Parliament House and had money to buy two planes worth Rs. 16,000 crore, but he didn’t fulfil his promise of paying the pending Rs. 15,000 crore of sugarcane farmers. She added the PM had visited several countries, but he had no time to visit the borders of the city where he lives in, where thousands of farmers were protesting against farm laws for 78 days. ‘Insulted the farmers’ Ms. Vadra also criticised the PM and BJP leaders for insulting the farmers by calling them ‘ andolan jeevi and anti-national’. Ms. Vadra launched the party’s ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ campaign at the mahapanchayat held in Chilkana Sultanpur in Nakud tehsil of Saharanpur. The area has a significant Muslim population and the role  of local Congress heavyweight Imran Masood in organising the party’s show of strength was palpable, both in posters and on the ground. Earlier, Ms. Vadra landed at the Jolly Grant airport in Dehradun and visited the shrine of Mata Shakumbari Devi and the khanqah of Hazrat Raipuri before addressing the farmers. The panchayat was held despite the district administration's orders that section 144 of CrPc was in place in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/beneath-56-inch-chest-pm-has-a-small-heart-says-priyanka/article33806137.ece
11 February 2021||Srinagar,||BJP wins 6 DDC posts in J&K, PAGD gets 3||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday won two more district chairmen’s posts to push its tally to six, while the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD or Gupkar alliance) that won two more districts is now heading in three districts in the first ever polls of the District Developments Councils (DDC) posts in J&K. BJP’s Keshav Dutt Sharma from Samba and Saraf Singh Nag from Reasi won the top post of chairmanship from these districts. With this, the BJP has swept the Hindu belt in the Jammu region, by winning the top posts of the district councils in Jammu, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda, besides Samba and Reasi. However, the BJP has no numerical strength in upcoming chairman posts polls in Poonch, Rajouri and Ramban, where independent candidates and the Gupkar alliance hold the key. Meanwhile, the Gupkar alliance had managed to win 110 sub-district segments, but has failed to win the top posts in most districts after Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference exited from the alliance. Out of seven districts of the Valley, where the results have been announced so far, the Gupkar alliance has managed to win the chairman posts only in three districts so far. The top council positions of two districts were won on Wednesday in south Kashmir’s Pulwama and central Kashmir’s Ganderbal. PDP’s Waheed-ur-Rehman Para, who won a seat from Pulwama district, could not cast his vote because he remains in jail since November last. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Twitter congratulated the DDC members for showing ‘exemplary character and courage’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-wins-6-ddc-posts-in-jk-pagd-gets-3/article33806138.ece
11 February 2021||Yangon,||Thousands defy Myanmar protest ban||Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Myanmar’s biggest city for a fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, defying a ban on protests as the military moved to tighten its grip on the country. Crowds swarmed through Yangon demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, facing down police a day after officers dispersed crowds elsewhere with tear gas and rubber bullets, and ramped up their harassment of the ousted leader’s party. The sudden escalation of force against the demonstrations sweeping the country since last week’s coup prompted a fresh chorus of international condemnation after officers fired live rounds at one rally in the capital Naypyidaw. Two people were critically wounded in the incident — including one woman who was shot in the head. Images depicting her in the moments after she was shot were by Wednesday appearing on a huge protest banner and had been widely shared online alongside expressions of grief and fury. “They can shoot a young woman but they can’t steal the hope and resolve of a determined people,” United Nations Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said on Wednesday. Massive crowds returned to the streets of Yangon on Wednesday, where the day before they had faced off against a phalanx of riot police standing alongside water cannon trucks near Ms. Suu Kyi’s residence.  More detained More politicians from Ms. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) were detained on Tuesday, along with 30 others — including a journalist from local broadcaster DVB — at a protest in Mandalay, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group said. Their arrests came as police fired tear gas at protesters in the city who were waving red NLD flags. State media claimed that the crowd had used “obscene language” and thrown objects at police, injuring four officers, in its first direct mention of the protests since they began on the weekend. “Therefore, the police members dispersed in accordance with the methods and laws,” the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported, without mentioning other police confrontations elsewhere in the country. But elsewhere the discipline of security forces appeared to be breaking down, with four officers defecting from their lines in the eastern town of Loikaw to join the anti-coup protests, according to local media reports. The military justified last week’s power grab by claiming widespread voter fraud in the November polls, which saw a landslide for Ms. Suu Kyi’s party.  The UN Human Rights Council has said it would hold a special session on Friday to discuss the crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-defy-myanmar-protest-ban/article33805845.ece
11 February 2021||COLOMBO,||‘China had no role in Sri Lanka’s decision on ECT’||Sri Lanka faced no pressure from China with regard to the East Container Terminal (ECT) project, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has said .  “China did not pressure us in anyway. They will not interfere in Sri Lanka’s internal affairs. Not only that, China will not interfere in Indo-Lanka relations. These are basic facts,” he told the local Tamil daily Virakesari in an interview published on Wednesday. His remarks come amid reports — both in local and foreign media — that linked Colombo’s sudden decision to renege on a 2019 agreement with India and Japan, to jointly develop the terminal at the Colombo Port, to Chinese interests in the island nation. India’s Adani Group was to invest in the ECT. Adjoining the ECT, China holds 85% stakes in the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), which is under a 35-year ‘Build Operate and Transfer’ agreement with the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA). “The Indian High Commissioner expressed displeasure that we [Sri Lanka] had not conveyed the decision to them properly. He told me that India is not happy with our decision,” Mr. Gunawardena said. A day after Sri Lanka pulled out of the tripartite agreement — amid prolonged agitations by port workers’ trade unions opposing a foreign role — Indian Envoy Gopal Baglay held three separate meetings with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Mr. Gunawardena, The Hindu reported on February 2. “I explained our [Sri Lanka’s] point of view to the High Commissioner, and appealed to India to view this keeping in mind the long-term relationship between the two countries,” Mr. Gunawardena said, expressing confidence that India would take a “broad view” of the matter, and “rightly understand” Colombo’s position. “This would not in any way damage the strong ties we have with India,” he added. Following Sri Lanka’s February 1 Cabinet decision — India and Japan reportedly knew of the change only then — both countries expressed disappointment at Colombo’s “unilateral decision”. Colombo had given a very different signal when External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar visited in January. It was further validated by President Rajapaksa’s statement on January 13 telling port workers that the Adani Group would invest in the ECT, with the SLPA holding 51% stakes. The Sri Lankan side has now said the West Container Terminal would be offered as an alternative, with 85% stakes for India and Japan. Neither country has commented on the offer that, sources said, was yet to be made directly. Amid the apparent diplomatic strain, Prime Minister Rajapaksa told local presspersons that India is Sri Lanka’s “closest friend”. “We can resolve any issue through discussion,” he said. The Cabinet’s clearing of the revised ECT deal, dropping India and Japan, was not the first blow to New Delhi at the beginning of this year. Two weeks prior to that, Sri Lanka approved a Chinese energy project in three small islands off the Jaffna peninsula in the north, about 50 km off the Tamil Nadu coast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-had-no-role-in-sri-lankas-decision-on-ect/article33805852.ece
11 February 2021||Washington,||India is an important partner in the Indo-Pacific region, says U.S.||Describing India as one of the most important partners of the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific region, the Joe Biden administration on Tuesday said it welcomes India’s emergence as a leading global power. “India is one of the most important partners in the Indo-Pacific region for us. We welcome India’s emergence as a leading global power and its role as a net security provider in the region,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference. Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke with his Indian counterpart, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, for the second time in less than a fortnight, Mr. Price added. During the call, the two leaders reaffirmed the strength of the U.S.-India partnership and discussed issues of mutual concern, including the situation in Myanmar. Mr. Blinken expressed concern over the military coup and the importance of the democratic process in Myanmar. Regional developments They also discussed regional developments, including the value of U.S.-India cooperation across the Indo-Pacific. “Both sides look forward to expanded regional cooperation, including through the Quad, and to address the challenges related to COVID-19 and climate change,” he said. Responding to a question, Mr. Price said the U.S.-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership is both broad as well as multifaceted. “We’ll continue to engage at the highest levels of our government to deepen cooperation on many fronts, and we are confident that the strong and upward trajectory of our partnership will, in fact, continue,” he said. “We welcome India joining the Security Council in the last month of this year for a two-year term,” Mr. Price added. The U.S., he said, also remains India’s largest and most important trading partner, with the total bilateral trade increasing to $146 billion in 2019. U.S. companies are a large source of India’s foreign direct investment, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-is-an-important-partner-in-the-indo-pacific-region-says-us/article33805853.ece
11 February 2021||Jakarta,||‘Pilots reported multiple issues with Indonesia jet’||Indonesian pilots had reported multiple problems with an ageing jet’s throttle system before it plunged into the sea after take-off in January, killing 62 passengers and crew, investigators said on Wednesday. The malfunction in the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500’s engine control system was highlighted in a preliminary report on the January 9 crash, but investigators said it was too early to pinpoint an exact cause. The 26-year-old plane — previously flown by U.S.-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines — plunged around 3,000 metres into waters off Jakarta minutes after take-off. Divers are still attempting to locate the cockpit voice recorder, which could provide vital clues to what the crew was saying when the flight from Jakarta to Pontianak in Borneo went down. On Wednesday, investigators said they were probing the autothrottle system — and possible human error.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pilots-reported-multiple-issues-with-indonesia-jet/article33805847.ece
11 February 2021||Riyadh,||Saudi authorities release women’s rights activist||Saudi authorities on Wednesday released prominent women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul after nearly three years in detention, her family said, as the kingdom faces renewed U.S. pressure over its human rights record. “Loujain is at home!!!!!!!” her sister Lina al-Hathloul wrote on Twitter. Ms. Hathloul, 31, was arrested in May 2018 with about a dozen other women activists weeks before the historic lifting of a decades-long ban on female drivers, a reform they had long campaigned for, sparking a torrent of international criticism. In late December, a Saudi court handed Ms. Hathloul a prison term of five years and eight months for terrorism-related crimes, but her family said a partially suspended sentence paved the way for her early release. Her release comes after U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to intensify scrutiny of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s human rights record.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/saudi-authorities-release-womens-rights-activist/article33805920.ece
11 February 2021||Washington,||Trump’s trial begins with footage of siege||Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial began on Tuesday with harrowing video footage of his supporters’ assault on Congress, but Republican Senators made clear how difficult it will be to win a conviction. Senators voted 56-44 in favour of the constitutionality of the historic trial, rejecting a bid by Mr. Trump’s lawyers to throw it out on grounds that a former President cannot be tried by lawmakers. The vote, held before the main part of the trial was to get under way on Wednesday, saw six Republicans join all 50 Democrats in the evenly-divided Senate. Despite this modest show of bipartisanship, the result highlighted the nearly impossible task of getting the two-thirds majority — requiring 17 Republicans to join the Democrats — that would be needed to convict Mr. Trump of inciting insurrection. Earlier, both sides presented their opening cases, with Democrats arguing that Mr. Trump broke his oath in a naked bid to retain power after losing the November election to Joe Biden. “If Congress were to just stand completely aside in the face of such an extraordinary crime against the Republic, it would invite future Presidents to use their power without any fear of accountability,” Democratic impeachment manager Joe Neguse said. Video from the January 6 mayhem played back inside the Senate packed the biggest punch. Senators watched footage of Mr. Trump’s speech and the crowd’s siege on the Capitol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trumps-trial-begins-with-footage-of-siege/article33805849.ece
11 February 2021||DUBAI,||Houthis target Saudi airport, plane catches fire||Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted the Abha International Airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, causing a civilian plane on the tarmac to catch fire, the kingdom’s state television reported. Firefighters brought the blaze under control, Saudi state-owned Al-Ekhbariya TV said, without offering word on possible casualties from the assault. The Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack soon afterward, with military spokesperson Yehia Sareai saying the group used four bomb-laden drones to target Abha airport. “This comes in response to the continued aerial bombardment and the brutal siege on our country,” Mr. Sareai said, noting that the Houthis consider the airport a military and not a civilian target. Col. Turki al-Maliki, the spokesperson for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen, said the forces intercepted two bomb-laden drones launched by the Houthis toward the kingdom. He condemned the assault as a “deliberate attempt to target civilians in the southern region” of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/houthis-target-saudi-airport-plane-catches-fire/article33805850.ece

In a January 2 call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Mr. Trump argued that the official could change the certified results of the presidential election, an assertion the Secretary of State firmly rejected. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat elected to the job in November, did not specifically mention Mr. Trump in the letters announcing her investigation. The letters, sent to Mr. Raffensperger, Governor Brian Kemp, the Lieutenant Governor and the Attorney General, instruct the four Republican officials to preserve all records related to the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/probe-opened-into-trumps-election-bid/article33805921.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Disinformation is a cybersecurity threat||Cybersecurity focuses on protecting and defending computer systems, networks, and our digital lives from disruption. Nefarious actors use attacks to compromise confidentiality, the integrity and the availability of IT systems for their benefit. Disinformation is, similarly, an attack and compromise of our cognitive being. Nation-state actors, ideological believers, violent extremists, and economically motivated enterprises manipulate the information ecosystem to create social discord, increase polarisation, and in some cases, influence the outcome of an election. There is a lot of similarity in the strategies, tactics and actions between cybersecurity and disinformation attacks. Cyberattacks are aimed at computer infrastructure while disinformation exploits our inherent cognitive biases and logical fallacies. Cybersecurity attacks are executed using malware, viruses, trojans, botnets, and social engineering. Disinformation attacks use manipulated, miscontextualised, misappropriated information, deep fakes, and cheap fakes. Nefarious actors use both attacks in concert to create more havoc. Historically, the industry has treated these attacks independently, deployed different countermeasures, and even have separate teams working in silos to protect and defend against these attacks. The lack of coordination between teams leaves a huge gap that is exploited by malicious actors. Cognitive hacking Cognitive hacking is a threat from disinformation and computational propaganda. This attack exploits psychological vulnerabilities, perpetuates biases, and eventually compromises logical and critical thinking, giving rise to cognitive dissonance. A cognitive hacking attack attempts to change the target audience’s thoughts and actions, galvanise societies and disrupt harmony using disinformation. It exploits cognitive biases and shapes people by perpetuating their prejudices. The goal is to manipulate the way people perceive reality. The storming of the U.S. Capitol by right-wing groups on January 6, 2021, is a prime example of the effects of cognitive hacking. The implications of cognitive hacking are more devastating than cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The damage wrought by disinformation is challenging to repair. Revolutions throughout history have used cognitive hacking techniques to a significant effect to overthrow governments and change society. It is a key tactic to achieve major goals with limited means. For example, QAnon spread false information claiming that the U.S. 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, and conspiracy theorists (in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Cyprus and Belgium) burned down 5G towers because they believed it caused the novel coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 disinformation campaigns have prevented people from wearing masks, using potentially dangerous alternative cures, and not getting vaccinated, making it even more challenging to contain the virus. Spreading disinformation Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is a well-coordinated cybersecurity attack achieved by flooding IT networks with superfluous requests to connect and overload the system to prevent legitimate requests being fulfilled. Similarly, a well-coordinated disinformation campaign fills broadcast and social channels with so much false information and noise, thus taking out the system’s oxygen and drowning the truth. The advertisement-centric business modes and attention economy incentivise malicious actors to run a sophisticated disinformation campaign and fill the information channels with noise to drown the truth with unprecedented speed and scale. Disinformation is used for social engineering threats on a mass scale. Like phishing attacks, to compromise IT systems for data extraction, disinformation campaigns play on emotions, giving cybercriminals another feasible method for scams. A report (https://bit.ly/3q9Tg3B) released by Neustar International Security Council (NISC) found 48% of cybersecurity professionals regard disinformation as threats, and of the remainder, 49% say that threat is very significant; 91% of the cybersecurity professionals surveyed called for stricter measures on the Internet. Deep fakes add a whole new level of danger to disinformation campaigns. A few quality and highly targeted disinformation campaigns using deepfakes could widen the divides between peoples in democracies even more and cause unimaginable levels of chaos, with increased levels of violence, damage to property and lives. Lessons from cybersecurity Cybersecurity experts have successfully understood and managed the threats posed by viruses, malware, and hackers. IT and Internet systems builders did not think of security till the first set of malicious actors began exploiting security vulnerabilities. The industry learned quickly and invested profoundly in security best practices, making cybersecurity a first design principle. It developed rigorous security frameworks, guidelines, standards, and best practices such as defense-in-depth, threat modelling, secure development lifecycle, and red-team-blue-team (self-attack to find vulnerabilities to fix them) to build cybersecurity resilience. ISACs (Information sharing and analysis centers) and global knowledge base of security bugs, vulnerabilities, threats, adversarial tactics, and techniques are published to improve the security posture of IT systems. We can learn from decades of experience in the cybersecurity domain to defend, protect and respond, and find effective and practical solutions to counter and intervene in computational propaganda and infodemics. We can develop disinformation defence systems by studying strategy and tactics to understand the identities of malicious actors, their activities, and behaviours from the cybersecurity domain to mitigate disinformation threats. By treating disinformation as a cybersecurity threat we can find effective countermeasures to cognitive hacking. Defense-in-depth is an information assurance strategy that provides multiple, redundant defensive measures if a security control fails. For example, security firewalls are the first line of defence to fend off threats from external systems. Antivirus systems defend against attacks that got through the firewalls. Regular patching helps eliminate any vulnerabilities from the systems. Smart identity protections and education are essential so that users do not fall victim to social engineering attempts. We need a defense-in-depth strategy for disinformation. The defense-in-depth model identifies disinformation actors and removes them. Authenticity and provenance solutions can intervene before disinformation gets posted. If the disinformation still gets by, detection solutions using humans and artificial intelligence, internal and external fact-checking can label or remove the content. Today, the response to disinformation is in silos of each platform with little or no coordination. There is no consistent taxonomy, definitions, policy, norms, and response for disinformation campaigns and actors. This inconsistency enables perpetrators to push the boundaries and move around on platforms to achieve their nefarious goals. A mechanism like ISACs to share the identity, content, context, actions, and behaviours of actors and disinformation across platforms is needed. Information sharing will help disinformation countermeasures to scale better and respond quickly. Education is key A critical component of cybersecurity is education. Technology industry, civil society and the government should coordinate to make users aware of cyber threat vectors such as phishing, viruses, and malware. The industry with public-private partnerships must also invest in media literacy efforts to reach out to discerning public. Intervention with media education can make a big difference in understanding context, motivations, and challenging disinformation to reduce damage. The freedom of speech and the freedom of expression are protected rights in most democracies. Balancing the rights of speech with the dangers of disinformation is a challenge for policymakers and regulators. There are laws and regulations for cybersecurity criminals. More than 1,000 entities have signed the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, for stability and security in the information space. Similarly, 52 countries and international bodies have signed the Christchurch Call to Action to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The disinformation infodemic requires a concerted and coordinated effort by governments, businesses, non-governmental organisations, and other entities to create standards and implement defences. Taking advantage of the frameworks, norms, and tactics that we have already created for cybersecurity is the optimum way to meet this threat. We must protect our society against these threats or face the real possibility of societal breakdown, business interruption, and violence in the streets.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Taking the long view with China||In late January, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said that while both India and China remained committed to a multipolar world, they should recognise that a “multipolar Asia” was one of its essential constituents. As it moves to becoming the third largest economy in the world, India needs to have a clear-eyed world view and strategy as it makes hard choices. It needs to reject the developing country regional mindset that has hobbled national aims and foreign policy. The Year End Review of the Ministry of Defence pertinently refers to the “sanctity of our claims in Eastern Ladakh” instead of the term “border” used since 1954, opening space for a settlement. We are now confidently moving out of the predicament that Jawaharlal Nehru placed us in Kashmir, fully integrating it into the Indian Union and consolidating our claim line. The External Affairs Ministry is also now more forthright. We have a “special and privileged strategic partnership” with Russia, which provides more than three-quarter of India’s military equipment, and a “comprehensive global strategic partnership” with the U.S. despite the United States Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific, 2018, wishing that India sees the U.S. as its preferred partner on security issues. India’s relationship with the U.S.-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), where the others are military allies, has rightly been cautious, as U.S. President Joe Biden sees China as a ‘strategic competitor’ rather than a ‘strategic rival’. Realism dictates that India does not need to compromise on its strategic autonomy. Diplomatic challenge The foreign policy challenge for India is really two sides of the China conundrum: defining engagement with its neighbour which is consolidating an expanding Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) while remaining involved with the strategic, security and technological concerns of the U.S. located across the vast Pacific Ocean. The U.S. ‘Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments involving the People’s Republic of China’ cautions that U.S. aircraft carriers, symbols of the country’s military hegemony, may not enjoy unquestioned dominance for much longer. Former President Barack Obama’s military pivot to Asia failed to overawe China in the South China Sea and the costs of former President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs were borne by American consumers and companies. In the financial sphere, there is the real possibility of the Chinese renminbi becoming a global reserve currency or e-yuan becoming the digital payments currency. China is the world’s largest trading economy. It could soon become the world’s largest economy — the Fortune Global 500 list of the world’s largest companies by revenue for the first time contains more companies based in China, including Hong Kong, than in the U.S. The BRI countries are using the renminbi in financial transactions with China, and can be expected to use it in transactions with each other. Even the European Union, smarting under Mr. Trump’s sanctions, created its own cross-border clearing mechanism for trade. China has stitched together an investment agreement with the EU and with most of Asia. Relative attractiveness will determine when the dollar goes the way of the sterling and the guilder. China, facing technological sanctions from the U.S., may well put in the hard work to make this happen soon. Policy elements Some form of the EU’s China policy of seeing the emerging superpower as a partner, competitor, and economic rival depending on the policy area in question is going to be the global norm. The EU’s reaching out to China despite misgivings of the U.S. means the West has given up on containing the rise of China. This broad perspective is also reflected in India’s participation in both the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, led by Beijing and Moscow and designed to resist the spread of Western interests, and in the U.S.-led Quad, with its anti-China stance. Within the United Nations, India’s interests have greater congruence with China’s interests rather than the U.S.’s and the EU’s; sharing the COVID-19 vaccine with other countries distinguishes India, and China, from the rest. The congruence between India and the U.S. lies in the U.S.’s declared strategic objective of promoting an integrated economic development model in the Indo-Pacific as a credible alternative to the BRI, but with a caveat. China opening new opportunities for countries in the Eurasian landmass means that ASEAN will not easily move out of the BRI infrastructure, digital, finance and trade linkages; Sri Lanka is a recent example. The China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has increased its membership to 100 countries. China is now the second-biggest financial contributor to the UN and has published more high-impact research papers than the U.S. did in 23 out of 30 “hot” research fields and enhancing its ‘soft power’ nearly to levels achieved by the U.S. earlier. Instead of an alternate development model, India should move the Quad towards supplementing the infrastructure push of the BRI in line with other strategic concerns in the region. For example, developing their scientific, technological capacity and digital economy, based on India’s digital stack and financial resources of other Quad members, will resonate with Asia and Africa. Policy evolution Another area where India can play a ‘bridging role’ is global governance whose principles, institutions and structures now have to accommodate other views for issue-based understandings. President Xi Jinping’s “community with shared future for mankind”, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “climate justice” and asking how long India will be excluded from the UN Security Council, challenge the frame of the liberal order without providing specific alternatives. With respect to digital data, the defining issue of the 21st century, India has recently expressed that there must be reciprocity in data sharing, and this is the kind of ‘big idea’ for sharing prosperity that will gain traction with other countries.   India’s recent policies are gaining influence at the expense of China and the West, and both know this trend will accelerate. The steps to a $5 trillion economy, shift to indigenous capital military equipment, and a new Science, Technology and Innovation Policy underline impact, capacity and interests. ASEAN remains keen India re-join its trade pact to balance China. It is being recognised that India’s software development prowess could shape a sustainable post-industrial state different to the U.S. and China model. As in the historical past, Asia is big enough for both Asian giants to have complementary roles, share prosperity and be independent of each other and of the West.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The portrait of a peacemaker and scholar||This year’s Padma Awards had some surprises. Among the awardees are two prominent Islamic scholars, viz. , Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Maulana Kalbe Sadiq (posthumously), who have been awarded the Padma Vibhushan and the Padma Bhushan, India’s second and third highest civilian honour/awards, respectively. The nonagenarian scholar, Wahiduddin Khan had earlier been conferred the Padma Bhushan in 2000, and the Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavana Award in 2009. To the extent perception shapes reality, the semiotics of these awards is unmistakable — few would have expected Islamic scholars to be honoured this way. Therefore, it can rightly be surmised that the conferment is as much a recognition of the services of these scholars as the signalling of what the government considers of value in national life. India’s template for a good Muslim is the same as its template for a good Hindu, Sikh or Christian, etc. Neither is it any different from the Islamic or the universal model of a good person — that he should be a good citizen who enriches society by service, charity, peace and amity. It is from this vantage that Wahiduddin Khan dives into the vast resources of Islamic traditions to bring to the surface its universal human values. The axiom of Islam as a religion whose very name means peace — particularly that which pervades following the submission to the divine will, by subscribing to the universal morality, to make the world an ever better place — could be borne out only if it reflected in the individual and collective behaviour of Muslims. A religion is only as peaceful as the narratives it spawns and the characters it shapes. Ideology of peace Maulana Wahiduddin Khan is among the very few traditional scholars who undertook to weave a narrative of peace for Muslims. He runs the Centre for Peace and Spirituality at New Delhi with the aim of presenting Islam as a complete ideology of peace. He has authored books such as The Prophet of Peace , The Age of Peace, and Islam and World Peace . In his system of thought, the defining moment in Muhammad’s prophetic career was the Treaty of Hudaybiyya  (CE 628). To put an end to the incessant warfare with his Meccan adversaries, the Prophet entered into a treaty with them which, much to the indignation of his followers, had the appearance of abject capitulation. But he was determined to buy peace irrespective of the cost. The cessation of hostilities brought quick dividends as the resumption of social interaction between the erstwhile foes created avenues for an exchange of ideas in an atmosphere which conduced reflection on Muhammad’s message. Soon, many of his prominent adversaries were to come to his side and a couple of years later, Mecca was won over in what the Koran calls Fatah Mubin (the manifest victory). The hermeneutical pivot in Maulana Wahiduddin Khan’s interpretation of Islam is verse 41:34 of the Koran which says, “Good and evil are not equal. Repel evil with what is best, and you will see that the one you had mutual enmity with will turn as if he were a close friend”. Political narratives This understanding of Islam flies in the face of the supremacist theology which is at the root of Islamism or Islam as a political ideology. Wahiduddin Khan broke away from Abul A’la Maududi’s theo-fascistic interpretation of Islam as a totalitarian ideology which sought to instil in the Muslim psyche a sense of entitlement for the domination of the world. He made a thorough critique of it, and demonstrated its fallacy, in a tract, The Political Interpretation of Islam . Muslim political narratives, predicated as they are on a sense of entitlement born of an imperial past, have been brimming with grievances and resentments. Words of counsel Wahiduddin Khan rightly identified the victimhood syndrome to be at the root of the politics of confrontation and violence. The psychosis of suspecting an anti-Muslim conspiracy in things as diverse as the American foreign policy and the Indian security concerns could have a deleterious impact on both the Muslim community and the world at large. In his book, Indian Muslims: The Need for a Positive Outlook , he addressed this problem and argued against the penchant for wallowing in victimhood and regaling in confrontation. He counselled his fellow Muslims to focus on moral uplift and socio-economic development, and on seeking the goodwill of their compatriots. Thus, on all the contentious issues which have shaped the Muslim identity since the mid-1980s, Wahiduddin Khan, swimming against the current of popular opinion, pleaded for sanity, and advised Muslims to eschew the frightening militancy in their discourse. In face of egregious slander, he reaffirmed the state’s jurisdiction to legislate for social reforms in matters pertaining to the Muslim Personal Law. He opposed Khomeini’s fatwa against Salman Rushdie. The said fatwa has since been as good as withdrawn, vindicating the Maulana’s position that it was neither good in religion nor in politics, and a mix of the two was an abomination. He courted vicious calumny when he counselled Muslims to relinquish their claim on the Babri Masjid. Everyone understood that the matter had transcended the technical rights and wrongs of the ordinary situation. But only he had the well-cogitated conviction to tell Muslims to let go of the mosque lest a ferocious maelstrom engulfed them. The Muslim leadership had stretched its stridency to a pitch from where it was impossible to climb down. It could not get off the tiger it was riding, and the rest is history. Endeavours that must win In today’s plural, multicultural and secular world, the Islam which can co-exist with other religions is the one propagated by the likes of Maulana Wahiduddin Khan. Its lineage can be traced to the reinterpretation of the Koran done by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. These two scholars tried to update the interpretational tradition of Islam to make it relevant for the contemporary world. They demonstrated that an underlying unity of essence bound Islam with all other religions, and that their different forms were due to their culture-specific idioms. Maulana Wahiduddin Khan’s endeavours are met with the same cynicism and hostility as his aforementioned predecessors. In due time, he will be similarly vindicated. One can only hope that this happens before it is too late. Najmul Hoda is an IPS officer.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Duverger’s curse||One of the first major opinion polls conducted in the backdrop of the upcoming West Bengal Assembly elections exhibited a dismal 12% vote share for the pre-poll alliance of the Left parties and Congress. While there is no reason to have blind faith in opinion poll results, there is little doubt that the Left-Congress alliance will become a distant third in the elections. The top two spots would be claimed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in no particular order. Duverger’s Law Duverger’s Law, theorised by French sociologist Maurice Duverger, states that single-ballot plurality-rule elections (such as first-past-the-post) structured within single-member districts tend to favour a two-party system. In the first-past-the-post system, the candidate winning the highest vote share in a constituency becomes the winner. And the electorates often choose candidates who are most likely to win. This mentality of the voters certainly affects the prospect of the third party/alliance. The electorates often care about the overall winnability of the political parties to form the government as well. For example, it is widely believed that many ‘floating’ Left voters of West Bengal voted for the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Stanford politicial scientist Gary W. Cox modernised Duverger’s Law and made it more operational in his 2002 book titled Making Votes Count . Duverger’s Law is criticised by some experts as the first-past-the-post system of voting has no tendency to produce two-party politics outside the U.S. In fact, India is often regarded as an exception to this law at the national level, but not at the district level. In the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections, the combined vote share of the Left and Congress was 32%; in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it shrunk to a mere 12%. And if the opinion poll is any sort of indication, Duverger’s Law might affect the poll prospect of the third force in West Bengal. Will the alliance’s vote share increase, or will it shrink further? While analysing voter behaviour with respect to the previous election, voters can be classified into three groups: Stickers, Switchers, and the Undecided. The last two groups constitute the ‘swing’ voters. While Stickers vote for the same party as in the previous election, the voting pattern of the swing voters can be explained by Game Theory models. Let’s illustrate a situation like West Bengal using a set-up where three major parties/alliances – A, B, C – and ‘Others’ combining the remaining are contesting the election. Let’s suppose the vote shares of each of the top two parties are around the 40% mark. C is poised to get 12% support, and the remaining vote share is attributed to the Others. For each party/alliance, a part of their support comes from swing voters who are open to voting for any other party as well. Although the swing voters might care for the ‘winnability’ of the parties in terms of forming a government, for which more than 50% of the seats are needed, the ‘vote to seat conversion’ is a complicated non-linear mechanism in our electoral system – more so due to the multiparty set-up. Therefore, ‘winnability’ is often a perception, and not quite backed by simple calculations or numbers. Let’s suppose the voters believe that neither of the top two parties can form a government of their own even if all the swing votes are pooled in their bag, and it is believed that A and B will not form the government together. If both the top parties are eager to resist the other, in the possibility of a hung assembly, an equilibrium maybe obtained if all the swing voters switch to C, provided it is believed to be open to allying with both A and B, if needed, to form a government. This might do wonders for the electoral prospects of C. For example, in 2018, despite winning only 37 seats in the Assembly, H.D. Kumaraswamy could become the Karnataka Chief Minister through an alliance with the Congress, which had 80 seats. Disadvantage: C However, in the possibility of a hung assembly, if the electorate believes that the Left-Congress alliance would be reluctant to ally with the TMC or the BJP, the 2018 Karnataka moment is very unlikely to occur for the Left-Congress alliance in 2021 Bengal. The alliance will not get the swing votes of other parties, and a part of its own swing voters might even go to the TMC and/or the BJP. Duverger’s Law would work to shrink the vote share of the alliance further in this case. So, public perception really matters. Also, if it’s believed that the total swing votes are substantial to take the TMC and/or the BJP beyond the halfway mark, the Left-Congress alliance’s swing voters might be influenced by the ‘bandwagon’, and the alliance’s own vote share might shrink further.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Denying women the right over their bodies||Recently, Argentina’s Congress legalised abortions up to the 14th week of pregnancy. The Indian Parliament too will consider an amendment to our abortion laws this Budget Session but unlike the Argentina law which is touted as being historic, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (MTP Bill), will not translate into greater autonomy for women over their own bodies. History of the law The MTP Act of 1971 was framed in the context of reducing the maternal mortality ratio due to unsafe abortions. It allows an unwanted pregnancy to be terminated up to 20 weeks of pregnancy and requires a second doctor’s approval if the pregnancy is beyond 12 weeks. Further, it only allows termination when there is a grave risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or if the pregnancy results from a sex crime such as rape or intercourse with a mentally challenged woman. Therefore, the law is framed not to respect a woman’s right over her own body but makes it easier for the state to stake its control over her body through legal and medical debates. Suppose a woman has had voluntary sex and she decides, for personal reasons, to end her pregnancy. If she is 24 weeks pregnant, then this would be a criminal offence. So, she moves the court under the condition that the pregnancy was affecting her mental health. However, here the court can refuse her despite the woman’s choice to end it. In one such case, a State government had argued that there were no grounds for an abortion since the pregnancy was the outcome of a voluntary act and she was “very much aware of the consequence” and the court agreed. In such circumstances, women usually resort to unsafe methods of abortion. Unsafe abortions are the third largest cause of maternal deaths in India. The amendment too continues this legacy of hetero-patriarchal population control, which does not give women control over their own bodies. The proposed amendment still requires one doctor to sign off on termination of pregnancies up to 20 weeks old, and two doctors for pregnancies between 20 and 24 weeks old. Thus, it is not based on any request or isn’t at the pregnant person’s will but on a doctor’s opinion. Personal beliefs The Bill also mandates the government to set up a medical board in every State and UT. Medical boards can rely on the facts of the case but personal beliefs could impact the medical board’s opinion, which is one of the biggest challenges in having a third-party opinion on a decision which is very personal. For instance, the Madhya Pradesh High Court denied permission for terminating a 26-week-old pregnancy to a 13-year-old rape survivor with the psychiatrist on the medical board arguing against the mental and emotional trauma that the survivor would go through. The psychiatrist stated that while the survivor was “feeling anxiety at times”, she was “not suffering from delusion and hallucination”. While the current Bill provides that safe abortions can be performed at any stage of the pregnancy in case of foetal “abnormalities,” it fails to consider any other reason such as personal choice, a sudden change in circumstances due to separation from or death of a partner, and domestic violence. Last, the proposed amendment uses the word “women” throughout, denying access to safe abortion to transgender, intersex and gender diverse persons. Abortion rights are central to a woman’s autonomy to determine her life’s course. Neither the state nor doctors have any right to deny a woman a safe abortion. Doing so means that women are not being treated properly as adults who are responsible for their own choices. T.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Media as target||Ordinarily, searches and seizures are the legitimate starting point of an investigation, done on the basis of prior information. But the ED’s raids in the office of independent digital news platform NewsClick, and in the residence of its promoter and editor-in-chief, have invited justified condemnation from organisations representing the media. There is every likelihood that this operation is linked to the platform’s in-depth coverage of ongoing protests as well as the various struggles of the people and the grassroot organisations that represent them. Ostensibly arising from an FIR registered by the Delhi police some months ago, the ED is said to be investigating alleged money-laundering to the tune of Rs. 30 crore. Not much is known about the nature of the police case, but the agency is empowered by the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act to investigate if the proceeds of crime related to a ‘predicate offence’ have been laundered. Whether such a primary offence has been established or not, and if so, whether NewsClick is in any way linked to it, is unclear. However, in the light of the manner in which the central agency is wont to enter the scene to investigate both real and imaginary allegations against anyone vocally critical of the government, it is difficult to brush aside the suspicion that the website is being targeted for its coverage of the farmers’ agitation as well as last year’s country-wide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The present regime’s record is quite dismal when it comes to the obvious use of central agencies such as the CBI, ED, IT and even the NIA, to rein in dissenting voices. It is unfortunate that specialised agencies are allowing themselves to be used as force multipliers in political battles against sections of the Opposition. Amidst claims that there are varying kinds of conspiracies against the government and India, it is no surprise that relentless journalistic focus on protests, which are basically steps taken in pursuit of redress for public grievances, is inviting repressive action. Laws that are serious in nature and ought not to be invoked lightly are being used with abandon against those seen to have invited the establishment’s wrath. This may explain the frequency with which the offence of sedition is being invoked for speeches and writings, while allegations of anti-national activity peddled by those groomed to build such narratives lead to action under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In other instances, cases of promoting social enmity or outraging religious sentiments are also slapped selectively to ‘discipline’ comedians and script-writers. The Supreme Court’s intervention has protected prominent journalists from arrest for defamation for tweets that turned out to be incorrect. It no more behoves a responsible and responsive government to dismiss criticism of its treatment of dissenters, including journalists who do not agree with it, as motivated or inspired by foreign elements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/media-as-target/article33805827.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Origin and spread||By concluding that a virus leak from a laboratory in China’s Wuhan, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged, is “extremely unlikely” and did not require further study, a 17-member WHO team and its Chinese counterparts have put to rest conspiracy theories that emerged early during the pandemic. While many scientists had dismissed the lab-origin theory, in mid-February 2020, a group of 27 prominent scientists from outside China “strongly condemned conspiracy theories” in a letter published in The Lancet . The group said scientists who had analysed virus genome sequence data shared by China and multiple countries could “overwhelmingly conclude” that SARS-CoV-2, like emerging pathogens, had originated in wildlife. Even a year since the letter and after nearly half-a-million genome submissions to a public database, scientists have not found any sign of direct human influence. The WHO team’s investigation now strongly suggests virus origin to a natural reservoir in bats, but unlikely to have been in Wuhan, which is miles from any natural bat habitat. The virus jumping directly from bats to humans is highly unlikely and initial investigation too suggests the role of an intermediary host species. The team has not been able to confirm the intermediary host. While early data suggest that the virus could have been circulating in Wuhan for weeks before it was identified in the Chinese city, it asserts that there is no evidence of large outbreaks in Wuhan prior to December 2019. Chinese media reported in early 2020 based on unpublished government data of a Hubei resident infected with the novel virus in mid-November. Also, in a report in The New England Journal of Medicine , scientists from the China CDC found evidence of human-to-human transmission as early as mid-December 2019, which again suggests virus circulation weeks before it was identified in Wuhan. China officially confirmed human-to-human transmission only in mid-January. While the possibility of transmission via frozen food, a theory embraced by Chinese officials, has not been ruled out, the possibility of such a route appears unlikely as instances of live viruses on packaging have been “rare and isolated”. The WHO visit is just the beginning of a long endeavour to uncover the origin of the virus. It will succeed only when scientific investigation is allowed to follow its course without being politicised. As in the case of the SARS outbreak in the 2000s, China again failed to be truly transparent during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. It can partially undo the damage done by now being more open and cooperative so that future outbreaks of related coronaviruses can be identified and contained early, if not prevented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/origin-and-spread/article33805830.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Bengal Council||When the Bengal Legislative Council reassembled this afternoon, 2 hours were devoted to the discussion of a resolution commending stoppage of export of rice from India except for surplus remaining after the country's demands had been met. To this there was an amendment substituting “Bengal” for “India”. But attention was confined almost exclusively to the main resolution and the amendment was eventually defeated without division. Mr. Kerr pointed out with regard to the main resolution that the matter was really one for the Government of India and quoted the Central Government’s pronouncement on the subject in December last, which he submitted was in accord with the mover's intention. He added that the Government had no objection to accepting the resolution, but they were not prepared to accept the amendment. Before they could ask for reimposition of provincial prohibition of export they must be able to show that the removal of control last year had disastrous results or that such were likely to follow if control were again imposed now. Mr. Kerr added that the record of discussion would be submitted to the Government for consideration. The debate was, however, continued with fewer than 15 speakers taking part. Interest in the matter seemed to be dying and the House thinned out considerably. After interval to allow the Muhammeden members time for prayers the House divided and the resolution was carried 63 votes to 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bengal-council/article33805835.ece

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exporters send an SOS after Budget jolt||India’s exporters have red-flagged proposals in the Budget that aim to disallow IGST refunds for exports and empower customs officials to confiscate goods for making a ‘wrongful claim’, warning that these changes would severely hurt exports and could impact India’s image as a reliable global supplier. Asserting that exporters were flush with orders and in a position to deliver high growth provided working conditions were easier, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said the proposals had come on the back of other ‘missteps’ that were taking the system towards ‘Inspector Raj’. More than 2,000 exporters had recently been served notices by the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) for what exporters contend are ‘revenue-neutral’ issues. About 5,000 exporters continued to be tagged as ‘risky’, which was leading to delays in their shipments and tax refunds, said the FIEO’s top officials. “As per a new sub-section inserted in Section 113 of the Customs Act, the government has provided for confiscation of goods for wrongful claim of remission or refund,” said FIEO Director General Ajai Sahai. “Now, for a number of products, the drawback rate is 1%, and the remission rate is 2% — even if you say it was unintended, for a benefit of 3%, the entire 100% of the goods will be confiscated,” he added. ‘Disproportionate cost’ “Now how do you interpret the wrongful claim. If I have put zero wrongly or claimed 1.5% instead of 1%, it becomes a wrongful claim,” he said, adding that this would give huge powers to officials at the field level who would interpret the law. “You are imposing a cost that is hugely disproportionate… The bigger question is by confiscation of goods, you are not only harming the exporter but also the country as a reliable supplier. If the goods don’t reach on time, it is not just the exporters who lose face,” Mr. Sahai said. He also questioned the ‘sudden’ withdrawal of IGST refunds and said almost two-thirds of all exporters by value would be affected. FIEO had written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman flagging the Budget proposals’ adverse effects, and plan to also discuss their concerns with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday. “Let exporters do their job. Give them enough time to perform,” said FIEO president Sharad Saraf. “Today, 80% of the time is going on the compliance… MSMEs are the worst sufferers because they cannot afford to employ multiple company secretaries or auditors. With all humility, I appeal to the government to have faith, trust and confidence in us.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exporters-send-an-sos-after-budget-jolt/article33805821.ece
11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jungo TV bets on free content||American media and entertainment firm Jungo TV, which plans to bring video streaming application Jungo+ to India this month, is looking to leverage ad-supported, free, niche content to compete in the market that already has about 40 players. The company has also set a road map to export Indian content, albeit with slight modification, to its users the world over, its CEO George Chung told The Hindu . “It is a very crowded market. But one of the things that the research has showed us is that pricing of the content makes a big difference. In our case, the content is completely ad-supported, so it’s free for users. With this, we believe we can reach a larger audience,” Mr Chung said. He added that the company would also focus on a ‘passion-centric’ audience. “We are extremely targeted.” Jungo + already has an audience of about 25 million in India for its channel on combat sports, which is mixed martial arts. Likewise, for K-pop, there is an audience of over 35 million people and for eSports, about 30 million. “We also have the first international LGBT channel which sees an audience of 10-15 million people alone. When we look at those audiences and put them together, those numbers can add up to over 100 million people, but they’re divided into very deep verticals,” he said. To a query, Mr. Chung said to grow the audience for Indian content globally, the service would target the about 30 million Indian diaspora, with the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and West Asia being the major markets. “We see tremendous opportunity in serving those markets or other underserved countries where quality Indian content is either not available or isn’t available for free. “For example, in the U.S., if you want high-quality Indian content, you have to pay anywhere between $10 and $30 a month, maybe.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/jungo-tv-bets-on-free-content/article33805823.ece

11 February 2021||New Delhi,||SEBI fines NSE, former MDs in co-location case||In the high-profile, co-location case, markets regulator SEBI on Wednesday imposed a penalty of Rs. 1 crore on the NSE for failing to provide a level-playing field for trading members subscribing to its tick-by-tick (TBT) data feed system. In addition, the regulator levied a fine of Rs. 25 lakh each on NSE’s former managing directors and chief executive officers Chitra Ramakrishna and Ravi Narain. Alleged lapses in high-frequency trading offered through NSE’s co-location facility came under the scanner of the watchdog after a complaint was filed in 2015. The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) co-location facility allows stock brokers to co-locate their servers and systems within the exchange premises, which helps reduce latency for connectivity to the exchange’s trading systems. In its 96-page order, SEBI said unequal access was apparent at different stages of the technology process and that NSE failed to ensure a level-playing field for trading members subscribing to its TBT data feed system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-fines-nse-former-mds-in-co-location-case/article33805919.ece

11 February 2021||Chennai,||India would do well to opt for sporting tracks||The first Test is history and India will need to regroup for the second. Actually, India would be better off with a sporting pitch with consistent bounce and carry rather than the abrasive surface that was offered to them in the first Test. Too much hinged on the toss. It was on sporting tracks that India exceeded expectations in Australia. In Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah India has two potent pacemen who can exploit bounce and seam movement. R. Ashwin too is a bigger threat when the track possesses bounce. If the pitch is not abrasive in nature, there is less chance of the SG ball going soft and losing its sting. And India’s stroke-makers would be able to play their shots. India has to get out of this spinner-friendly pitches mindset for home Tests since they now have a capable pace attack and batsmen who can blossom on sporting wickets. Toss factor The moment India lost the toss in the first Test, the host was up against it. England’s strategy was to bat big and its skipper Joe Root, a complete batsman with exemplary footwork and ability to pick length, ensured that with an iridescent 218 in his 100th Test. India could have done better with its bowling strategy. The middle-and-leg line for the spinners with a leg-side cordon worked in Australia because the pitches Down Under had bounce. It wasn’t easy for batsmen to keep the ball down. The same line here is fodder for the English batsmen. There is little in terms of bounce and the English batsmen, led by Root, are prolific with the sweep shot. The line of attack in the Indian conditions for off-spinners should be two stumps outside off, if the bowler wants to spin the ball in, or the off-stump, if the bowler decides to bowl one that holds its line or drifts away. The slip and the short-leg are critical positions here. Not the leg-slip. Issue of no balls And this tendency of the spinners to deliver no balls has to be arrested. India sent down 20 no-balls in the first innings here and seven in the second. Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem not just lacked control, he also was the worst offender with no balls; unpardonable for spinners. While the left-handed Washington Sundar batted beautifully in the first innings — he lends depth to the side at the crucial No. 7 slot — the manner he was overlooked with the ball in the second innings was surprising. With his height and flat, fastish trajectory, he could have been a handful to the England batting. But then, Washington sent down just one over at the fag end of the innings. Need to play Kuldeep India should play Kuldeep Yadav for Nadeem in the second Test because the Chinaman bowler’s variation is the delivery that leaves the right-hander and the Englishmen have struggled against wrist spinners in the past. It would be an attacking option too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-would-do-well-to-go-in-for-sporting-tracks/article33805914.ece

Naomi Osaka also charged through but fellow Major winners Stan Wawrinka, Bianca Andreescu and Petra Kvitova were all second-round casualties. Earlier, Djokovic was given a stern examination by American Frances Tiafoe and dropped his first set of the tournament before recovering to win 6-3, 6-7(3), 7-6(2), 6-3. The 2014 champion Wawrinka blew three match points in the fifth-set tiebreaker of his four-hour epic with Marton Fucsovics, who won 7-5, 6-1, 4-6, 2-6, 7-6(9).

11 February 2021||Bengaluru,||High jumper Pavana makes a mark in style||When she was an active international athlete, jumper Sahana Kumari had no choice but to take her young daughter Pavana along to her training sessions. Sahana’s husband, former international sprinter, B.G. Nagaraj, was busy on the track too, leaving no one at home to take care of the child. Having watched her mother put in the hard yards for all those years, it comes as no surprise that Pavana would be bitten by the high jump bug. Cut to the recent Junior Nationals at Guwahati, a 15-year-old Pavana broke the National girls’ under-16 record with a 1.73m jump. Family of achievers The family now boasts of two reigning National record holders, with Sahana setting a mark (1.92m) in the 2012 senior inter-State championships at Hyderabad. “Pavana would tag along with me to practice daily. It was natural for her to get interested in track and field,” Sahana told The Hindu on Wednesday, hours after Pavana was named the Best Athlete in the girls’ u-16 section of the National championship. The journey Pavana, a keen sprinter until a couple of years ago, moved to high jump on a whim. “In an inter-school meet in Bengaluru, Pavana did not do well in her pet 100m event. She was very upset, and asked the coach if she could enter the high jump event. Pavana had never attempted high jump before that, but she managed to win the gold. That is where her high jump journey began,” Sahana said. She has high hopes for Pavana, who trains at the JSW Inspire Institute of Sport in Vidyanagar (Bellary). “I have competed in the Olympics and Asian Games. I want Pavana to win medals at the Olympics and Asian Games,” Sahana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/high-jumper-pavana-makes-a-mark-in-style/article33805959.ece

Ashwin moved up in the bowlers’ chart. Kohli, who had had scores of 11 and 72 in the opening Test against England, has 852 points and down one spot in the latest chart issued on Wednesday. Veteran spinner Ashwin and pacer Bumrah have moved a place up each to be seventh and eighth respectively. Root has reached 883 rating points. It is his highest position since September2017 after a fabulous run in the subcontinent saw him accumulate 684 runs in three Tests, two of which were in Sri Lanka. Ahead of Kohli for the first time since November 2017, Root is now 36 points behind top-ranked Kane Williamson and trails Steve Smith by only eight points. Pant at 13th spot Rishabh Pant’s knock of 91 in the first innings has helped him become the first full-time wicketkeeper from India to reach 700 rating points as he retained the 13th position among batsmen.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Jamshedpur picks up full points against CFC||A late Enes Sipovic own goal helped Jamshedpur FC edge past Chennaiyin FC 1-0 in a 2020-21 Indian Super League match in Bambolim on Wednesday. Chennaiyin had produced better attacks in the final third but was undone by one moment of lapse in concentration in the final minute of regulation time. Farukh Choudhary’s long pass across from the left-wing was controlled well by David Grande, who moved into the box after dribbling past a defender. The Jamshedpur forward then took a shot from a narrow-angle, and the ball found the back of the net after Sipovic’s unintentional touch. CFC’s wastefulness up front continued as Thoi Singh messed up the best chance of the encounter, deciding to make a pass towards fellow substitute Jakub Sylvestr in the middle instead of firing it on target himself from a comfortable position. Chennaiyin dominated the early exchanges and Lallianzuala Chhangte’s shot in the fourth minute forced T.P. Rehenesh to make a full-stretch dive to his left to push the ball away. Rahim Ali also had two good chances from inside the box as well to find the opener for the Marina Machans.  This win takes Jamshedpur (21 points) into the sixth spot, while Chennaiyin (17) stays eighth after 17 games, hampering its playoffs prospects even further.

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Teams making fewer mistakes will win: Baptista||Atletico Madrid may be sitting on top of the table with 51 points from 20 matches, ahead of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Sevilla, but LaLiga ambassador Julio Baptista said that a lot can change and teams making fewer mistakes would stand a better chance of lifting the trophy. In an online media interaction, the former Brazil player and LaLiga star, Baptista conceded that it was a “complicated situation” owing to teams losing players to COVID, and that teams with more players would be able to fight better to reach the top of the table. He also said the pandemic’s economic impact had crippled club revenues leading to a “big deficit” which in turn came in the way of clubs “signing up more experienced players”. The Messi question When queried about Lionel Messi’s intention to move out of Barcelona, Baptista said that it was up to the player and that it would be interesting to see “whether he goes elsewhere”, to a big club like Manchester City, to win more trophies. When asked to compare Messi with Neymar, Baptista observed that Messi had a much better perspective of the game on field, while Neymar was more dangerous close to the goal. On Neymar parting ways with Messi at Barcelona, despite being good friends with him, and moving to PSG, Baptista said that it was not about more money, but to face a different challenge, become a better player and possibly win the World Cup. Brazil’s prospects Looking at Brazil’s World Cup prospects, Baptista said that players need to understand that “football is quick, and you have to play quick a lot”. He said that Brazil chief coach Tite had done “very satisfactory work till now”. He said that it was more important to develop the game and “achieve a lot of good work”, as in the presence of many highly competitive teams, it was “not easy to win the World Cup”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/teams-making-fewer-mistakes-will-win-baptista/article33806086.ece
11 February 2021||KOLKATA,||Strong regional affiliations helped Osasuna remain the people’s club: president||Notable football clubs the world over are forsaking their entity to large corporations or to rich owners while looking for survival. But there are a few exceptions like CA Osasuna in the LaLiga, which have been able to remain a member-run club for over a century and stave off corporate takeovers. Osasuna president Luis Sabalza told a forum of international media that his club draws its strength from the sentiments of the people of Navarre region, who have been unflinching in their loyalty to the existence of the club. “We are proud of being a member-run club. But it is really difficult staying that way as football has become business these days. “But we are different in trying to retain the essence of traditional football. We always look to survive in the way we started,” Sabalza said. “We have been through very bad times and have not been as stable as we are today. Undoubtedly our club has been well rooted to the emotions of the area that we represent and that gives some stability to the club. As a result all the children of Navarre come to our academy and they have the true desire to represent Osasuna. They help the club during its bad times because they treat the club as something of their own.” “That is why we have never looked to become a ‘public limited’ company as all our members want to remain connected to their roots,” he concluded.  They have been unflinching in their loyalty||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/strong-regional-affiliations-helped-osasuna-remain-the-peoples-club-president/article33806274.ece
11 February 2021||Mumbai,||Wasim Jaffer refutes allegations of communal bias||Two days after resigning as the head coach of Uttarakhand Ranji Trophy team, citing interference in selection by the State association administrators, former India batsman Wasim Jaffer has refuted the Cricket Association of Uttarakhand’s (CAU’s) allegations of him being communally biased. “I am deeply saddened to have been accused of being communally or religiously biased after being involved in cricket for all these years,” Jaffer said while addressing the media on Wednesday. Explained in email “These are serious allegations. I will have to put forward my side. I have explained all the reasons of my resignation in the email sent to the association and I stand by it, but it’s very sad that I have to speak about these issues. “You all know me, have seen me for a long time, so you all know how I am.” CAU has reportedly accused Jaffer of inviting Maulavis at the training, changing slogan of the team from “ Ram Bhakt Hanuman Ki Jai ” (Hail Hanuman, devotee of Ram)” to “Go Uttarakhand” and elevating Iqbal Abdulla, a professional from Mumbai who was signed a guest player, as the captain instead of a local. Jaffer said Abdulla took his and the team manager’s permission and invited a Maulavi “twice or thrice during the camp in Dehra Dun to facilitate mass prayers on Fridays” and no one had an issue with it. On changing the slogan, he refuted the allegation. He said he heard the boys using “ Rani Mata Sachche Darbar Ki Jai ”, related to Sikh community” during practice matches. “When we reached Baroda for the tournament, I said we are not playing as a community, we are playing for Uttarakhand so we have to coin a slogan for Uttarakhand. “Something like ‘Come on, Uttarakhand or Go Uttarakhand’. If I had to be communal, I would have told them to chant Allah-ho-Akbar. Because we were representing Uttarakhand, we had to be together despite following various faiths.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jaffer-refutes-allegations-of-bias/article33806084.ece
11 February 2021||MUMBAI,||Shreyas Iyer back from injury, to lead Mumbai||Having recovered from a shoulder injury he suffered during India’s recent tour to Australia, Shreyas Iyer will mark his return as the captain of Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy starting next week. Shreyas, who missed the domestic T20 tournament, was appointed the captain by the selection committee headed by Salil Ankola, which for the first time, formally interacted with newly-appointed coach Ramesh Powar on Wednesday before finalising the 22-member squad. Interestingly, young opener Prithvi Shaw, who has lost his place in the national team, has been elevated as the vice-. Mumbai, led by Suryakumar Yadav, finished at the bottom of its group in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last month. The selectors have dropped middle-order batsman Siddhesh Lad after a medicore outing in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy, while left-handed opener Akhil Herwadkar has been recalled to the side after three years as a back-up opener. Atif Attarwala has been preferred as the left-arm pacer in place of Arjun Tendulkar, who made his Mumbai debut during the forgettable T20 campaign.  The squad: Shreyas Iyer (Capt.), Prithvi Shaw (Vice-capt.), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Akhil Herwadkar, Suryakumar Yadav, Sarfaraz Khan, Chinmay Sutar, Aditya Tare (w.k.), Hardik Tamore (wk), Shivam Dube, Akash Parkar, Atif Attarwala, Shams Mulani, Atharva Ankolekar, Sairaj Patil, Sujit Nayak, Tanush Kotian, Prashant Solanki, Dhawal Kulkarni, Tushar Deshpande, Siddharth Raut and Mohit Awasthi .

11 February 2021||Islamabad,||Pakistan hopes to carry on Test form||Pakistan aims to capitalise on its 2-0 victory in the Test series against South Africa when it takes on the Proteas in the three-match Twenty20 series that begins on Thursday. “The result of Test series will have an impact on the Twenty20 series,” Pakistan bowling coach Waqar Younis told reporters during a virtual press conference in Lahore on Wednesday. Waqar was the bowling coach when a second-string Sri Lanka routed Pakistan 3-0 at Lahore in 2019. This time around, Waqar is not underestimating the second-string South Africa without its T20 regulars — captain Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Rassie van der Dussen, Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi. Fast bowler Hasan Ali is part of Pakistan’s Twenty20 squad with Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf to give Pakistan a formidable pace attack. Hafeez unavailable Pakistan had to leave out Mohammad Hafeez after he couldn’t join the team’s bio-secure bubble in Lahore by the February 3 deadline. Hafeez scored 415 runs in T20 internationals last year, but was busy playing in a T10 League in the United Arab Emirates.  The squads (from):   Pakistan: Babar Azam, Haider Ali, Khushdil Shah, Hussain Talat, Danish Aziz, Asif Ali, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Zafar Gohar, Faheem Ashraf, Aamer Yamin, Amad Butt, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Hasan Ali, Usman Qadir, Zahid Mehmood.   South Africa: Heinrich Klaasen, Nandre Burger, Okuhle Cele, Junior Dala, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, George Linde, Janneman Malan, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Lutho Sipamla, Jon-Jon Smuts, Pite van Biljon, Glenton Stuurman, Jacques Snyman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pakistan-hopes-to-carry-on-test-form/article33806054.ece
11 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Is there more to Sindhu’s visit to Jwala’s academy?||World champion P.V. Sindhu trained at the recently-started Jwala Gutta Academy of Excellence in Moinabad near here on Wednesday morning triggering off speculation about plans for her future training programme.  Sindhu was actually visiting the latter’s academy for the first time. “As Sindhu was away in the UK training for three months before flying straight to the two Thailand events in January, she couldn’t attend the inauguration of Jwala’s academy,” an official involved in the programme on Wednesday told The Hindu .  “Sindhu got a feel of the training facilities and also trained from 10.30 a.m. to 12.00 noon and was really appreciative of the world class facilities,” he said even while insisting there was no talk at all about the 2016 Rio Olympics silver medallist moving over to this place. “In fact, Sindhu went to the extent of stating that it is always better for players to train at different international standard venues in view of the extensive travelling they have to do for BWF events in different conditions,” the official said. And all that Jwala tweeted was, “Once a sweet girl, always a sweet girl” about Sindhu’s visit.  Significantly, it was also pointed out that the academy has blowers that ensure the ‘drift’ factor, which has often been the bane of Indian shuttlers in some major events across the world. However, neither Sindhu nor her family members were keen to comment on her future plans. Right now, Sindhu is part of the 2021 Olympic probables camp designated at the SAI-Gopi Chand Academy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/is-there-more-to-sindhus-visit-to-jwalas-academy/article33806219.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Adheres to His duties||Each avatara of Vishnu has a special significance. As Rama, He demonstrated the importance of adherence to dharma. As Krishna, He taught us about dharma. The Vamana avatara too had its own special characteristics, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. In this avatara, He killed no one. As Narasimha, He killed Hiranyakasipu. As Rama, He slayed many. As Krishna, He killed Kamsa, Putana and many others. Of course, those He killed had committed unforgivable sins. But there are two ways to deal with those who err. One way is to kill them. The other is to check their pride, which is usually responsible for many evil deeds. In the Vamana avatara, He did not kill Mahabali. He merely humbled Bali. Bali had usurped the kingdom belonging to the celestials. To take possession of something which is not ours is wrong. Moreover, Indra had approached Bhagavan for help. And Indra was only asking for restoration of what was his. So the Lord came as Vamana to help Indra. Upanayana was performed for Vamana and Srimad Bhagavatam gives us a list of those who attended and the gifts they brought. In the Vamana avatara, He adhered to svadharma. Soon after upanayana, a Brahmachari must do samita daana, which is mandatory. Vamana showed that this rule must be adhered to by doing this daana Himself. Again for doing homa, He followed all the rules. He cleaned the place, and then placed darbha grass in the four corners. A Brahmachari must do prescribed rites only in land belonging to him. So Vamana told Bali that all He needed was land measured with three strides of His, so that He could do the required rites there. Although He came to Earth to help Indra regain his kingdom, He also showed the proper way in which a Brahmachari must do his duties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/adheres-to-his-duties/article33805904.ece

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Faces, places||An alcoholic, abusive father Ganapathy and his son, Velu, are on their way to the neighbouring village to bring back the wife-mother, who has fled the home. A scuffle breaks out between Ganapathy and his in-laws, forcing Velu to tear up a wad of cash to get back at his father. They trudge their way back in the midst of scorching heat. Vinothraj admits that the film came from a place of anger. Mined out of what happened to his younger sister, whose alcoholic husband shut the doors on her, making her walk back over 13 kilometres to her village with a toddler in arms, Vinothraj calls such incidents “an everyday occurrence” in his village. “She knew that I was making her story. I was conscious not to hurt anybody involved because I knew my sister and her husband would end up together again. She has seen the film and she really liked it. When I showed the rough cut to the old women in our village, they reacted in a way that gave me the most satisfaction. I am not sure if folks at Rotterdam got the film, but those grannies did,” says the filmmaker. Edited excerpts: What are your earliest memories of cinema? I remember visiting film shoots in Madurai in the 2000s — from Ghilli to Paruthiveeran . At that age, what fascinated me the most was the jimmy-jib camera that was carrying the cinematographer. I would say the shooting atmosphere was what drew me into cinema. You get to see a lot of images around Madurai that tell you a certain story. Its vastness can be divided into three: the barren landscape that you see in Koozhangal , the main city, and the part that leads to the Western Ghats. Now when I look back, I think these images kindled an interest to try and pursue cinematography, which I couldn’t afford to. You seem to have learned the craft of cinema by watching films when you worked in a DVD shop in Chennai. Is that a fair assumption?  Yes. I used to watch random films; sometimes by suggestion. That is how I discovered filmmakers like Majid Majidi, Abbas Kiarostami and Nuri Bilge Ceylan [of Three Monkeys ]. Apart from watching films, I began sharing my resume with filmmakers who dropped by the shop. Later, I worked in A Sargunam’s [of Vaagai Sooda Vaa ] production venture, Manjapai , which was a lesson on the other side of cinema. Was Koozhangal supposed to be your début work?  No. I was trying to make another film, which had three landscapes. I like to tell stories through landscapes, but I couldn’t convince producers. I made a short, Subway , to convince people that I had talent. Four years back, my sister had to face a similar experience like in Koozhangal . I finished the first draft in nine days. The filmmaking standard is world-class for someone who never went to a film school...  Maybe because I approach everything with emotion. What truly was transformative was when I worked in a theatre group called Manal Magudi in Kovilpatti. It is a post-modern troupe and Muruga Boopathy is the director. There was one particular play that they staged across the country. It had no dialogues and everything was communicated through action. I was fascinated by the way they used the space and their body movements. My knowledge on the film language came from there, I believe. At what point did Nayanthara and Vignesh Shivan step in to present the film?  We were initially associated with Learn and Teach, a production company. But the pandemic kept delaying the project. Seventy percent of the film was done and we were looking for a co-producer. That is how we approached NFDC Film Bazaar by showing a rough cut. We couldn’t get the desired support. And that is where we met filmmaker Ram sir. I told my assistant that Karuppusamy [a deity] has come in the form of Ram and that we have to make use of him. The moment he saw the trailer, Ram sir got involved and gave us hope. He believed in the project more than anybody. When can we expect Koozhangal in theatres?  Now that the film had its world première at the Rotterdam Film Festival, it has to travel across Europe. We are trying to see if we can monetise from the festivals. All things said, it should arrive sometime in July/August. When I met Soori [actor], one of the well-wishers of this film, he told me that we should book a special show for grannies and women of our village, excluding men. I concur. After all, this film was made for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/faces-places/article33805767.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Flight of passage||Actor Suriya’s role as Maara in Soorarai Pottru is said to be based on the journey of retired Army Captain GR Gopinath who established the low cost Deccan Airways in the late 1990s. Though Gopinath is from Karnataka, the film has Maara belonging to Usilampatti, about 40 kilomtres West of Madurai. But not many perhaps are aware that decades ago from a nondescript village called Kottaiyur, about 100 kilometres North of Madurai, was born a man with similar dreams. KV AL RM Alagappa Chettiar (AC), with a fascination for flying obtained his pilot training and certificate in 1933 from Croydon, London, and launched Jupiter Airways in early 1947 with a fleet of eight aircraft. He was considered a pioneer in India’s aviation history because when the Second World War ended in 1945 and the Government announced the sale of surplus Dakotas and the Douglas DCs, AC was among the first buyers of the workhorses because he envisioned the rising popularity of air transport. A grandson remembers  New York-based Ramanathan Vairavan shares many interesting nuggets of information about his grandfather’s multiple businesses in his book A Beautiful Mind.  He chronicles the determination and achievements of the philanthropist industrialist despite several challenges and the ill-health that snuffed out his life at 48. In his book Vairavan writes, the aircraft were overhauled and refurbished at the Hindustan Aircraft Factory, Bangalore, to make them suitable for passengers’ safety and comfort. Like Gopinath, it was AC’s desire to offer passenger services at a low cost. Before Independence there were eight companies operating on 22 routes while 15 more — including Jupiter Airways — were waiting for the nod to fly civilians. But the time coincided with the tragedy of Partition and AC was the first to offer his aircraft to the Government on charter for evacuating families from Pakistan. The evacuation sorties ended in November 1947 and it was soon followed by the invasion of the Kashmir valley. The Indian Army was in need of aircraft to fly its troops and armour and once again AC was in the forefront ferrying the men in uniform, material, resources and refugees. During the mission one of the planes crashed. The insurance company refused to pay up because it was insured only for civilian duties. But far from being dejected by the loss incurred, AC immediately arranged for an alternative flight to complete the mission. After several months when Jupiter Airways got its licence to fly on passenger routes, the first flight rolled out on June 17, 1948, from Meenambakkam, Madras, making it among the first cities in the country to get an airport. The flying time to Delhi via Vizagapatnam and Nagpur was apparently eight hours and the pilots were paid Rs. 40 for every hour of flying. Due to the inability to get clearance for new routes and damages to two aircraft, AC sold his airlines in 1953 when Indian Airlines was nationalised. Inspiring life Over a telephone interview, Vairavan says his grandfather’s life story is worthy of a movie and Soorarai Pottru motivated him to approach few Kollywood producers. “AC’s short-lived but legendary life will make an inspiring film,” he says. Vairavan, who was eight when his grandfather passed away in 1957, says, based on his mother Umayal Ramanathan’s valuable insights and inputs it took him seven years of travel and archival research before the book could be compiled and published in 2015. “His peers were all gone and I felt a strong desire to document AC’s life to understand and appreciate a man well ahead of his times,” he adds. While AC’s rise in every sector was phenomenal, he did not hesitate to sell off his well established businesses in textiles, hotels, chemical, pharmaceuticals, rubber, tin, entertainment, transport, stock exchange, real estate and the private airline — in order to realise his dream of promoting education in his birth place, Karaikudi. The Alagappa group of educational institutions (consisting of schools, engineering and technology colleges besides a host of other professional and vocational colleges) in Karaikudi and Chennai take academic facilities to the doorstep of people.  He surpassed every milestone that he desired to achieve, says Vairavan, who keenly continues in the legacy of his grandfather and has announced the launch of Alagappa College of Nursing this summer and plans to establish a medical college in Karaikudi soon.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Young ’uns on the way||There is something about the pull of the homeland that can make any story a universal one. Turtles, for instance, don’t understand political, linguistic or other human boundaries, yet the story of how an Olive Ridley turtle gives birth is something Chennai division’s Forest Department officials know verbatim. For, a turtle may travel all over the world through the years, but when “that time” comes, it will return to the exact spot where it was born. In January 2021, about a decade after they grew, the Olive Ridleys born along Chennai’s coastline came back to their “ thai mann” (mother-soil or motherland), to dig nests in the sand and lay eggs. So when the first of these buried nests in Besant Nagar was discovered around January 10, patrollers on the beach cared enough to handle it gently. On the same day, the eggs were collected and safely transported to a locked, walled hatchery, safe from predators. They were then buried back just as deep as they were found, as deep as their mother had kept them. This process will be repeated with every fresh nest found throughout the season; each new rehabilated nest will be marked with a broad stick, on which details like the discovery date, depth, and the number of eggs will be specified. Why? Because threats to these eggs are many — stray dogs, crows and even poachers have contributed to reduced populations of this species, categorised as vulnerable across the globe by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). If all goes well, the first of this year’s hatchlings should be crawling back to sea sometime towards the end of this month, hope the Forest Department employees manning the protected hatchery on Besant Nagar beach. The nesting season has been a busy one since January this year, and is likely to go on till April. The month of February, however, is considered the peak of the season, and with over 100 Olive Ridley nests having been found already, all four hatcheries along this stretch of the coast are hoping to soon fill up with eggs — cool, cosy, and ready to hatch. According to the office of Forest Range Officer, Clement Edison, “Last year, we had completed 300 nests and 32,000 eggs. Hopefully, this year, we are expecting the numbers to be more, by around 20%.” It is a reasonable hope, considering that over 100 nests have been discovered and rehabilitated already: 50 nests with 5,745 eggs in Besant Nagar, 19 nests with 2,041 eggs in Neelankarai and 33 nests with 3,599 eggs in Pulicat. And the season is just getting started. “We have a total of four hatcheries, including one in Kovalam,” says the officer, “There have been no nests in Kovalam yet, but we are hopeful.” Treasure hunt How these nests are discovered is an interesting story, one that is retold and demonstrated time and again this time of year. The first sign is a mother turtle’s track in the sand — criss-cross tracks caused by the shifting of the sand by its forelimbs. The width of the tracks is an indication of the size of the paddle-like forelimbs, and thus of the turtle itself. But it is not often that this track can be followed to a mother in the very act of nesting; the mother turtle is usually done with her task within 20 minutes, and the tracks are not spotted till much later. Patrolling teams have a lot of ground to cover — especially this year, when public volunteers could not be allowed due to COVID-19 safety measures. The patrolling has been done mainly by the Forest Department, with select, seasoned volunteers from the city’s Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN) joining in only since the past four days, for a three-hour daily shift. The patrollers, in teams of three, hope to spot the turtle tracks, and then circle the whole area around the tracks to search... they search not for the creature or its eggs, but for unusually soft and loose sand. The sand in usual spots, where there is no egg, will be tight and packed — hard enough for adults to walk or children to frolic on. The area with eggs underneath will be soft, because the sand would have been dug and repacked. These areas, if poked lightly with a stick, act almost as miniature sink-holes. The eggs hatch within 44 to 46 days of getting laid, depending on humidity, temperature and other factors. It could also depend on the depth at which the eggs are laid. Nearer to the surface is warmer, so it will hatch faster. If it is deeper, it may not hatch for another day. Most of the hatchlings in Chennai division turn out to be female, almost 97% to 99%. According to Edison’s office, it is only at far higher temperature conditions that males can be born. Generally, hatching and the release of hatchlings into the sea only happens in the evening, after sunset, when the temperature is more suitable for the newborns. And that is a sight to behold… scores of little creatures smaller than a fist, bursting with urgency, making their steady, frantic way to the cool ocean under the calm Chennai moon, as their human caretakers cheer them on.  This land is their land The coast of Odisha is considered to be one of the largest Olive Ridley nesting sites not only in India, but in the world. But the turtles have also been found to nest in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and parts of the Konkan coast. Some other countries with Olive Ridley nesting sites are:  Mexico Costa Rica Brazil Kenya Australia||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/young-uns-on-the-way/article33805789.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Dump your physical and emotional baggage here||Marie Kondo may be trending on social media but here is a little secret. Did you know, there is a percentage that de-clutters their homes, then stashes away their excesses — memorabilia, collectibles or just about any object they are attached to — in storage facilities? “People are attached to material things that they do not want to dispose,” says Ameya Davda who started Space Valet in Mumbai in 2017, along with his cousin Devak Davda. This sentiment was what the Davda’s business hinged on before the pandemic set in. When lockdown began and offices shut, working professionals headed back to their hometowns to work from home. Many realised it would be economical to give up their rented accommodations for the duration they were away. But what about their furniture, appliances and other household goods? “This is where the self storage facilities come in handy. It is a $50 billion industry in the US and is picking up in India now. A number of such storage facilities have opened during the lockdown,” says Ameya who has four units (two each in Bhiwandi and Sewri) in Mumbai. The largest, at 25,000 square feet, came up in the middle of the pandemic, in response to market demands. Stownest Storage, started in December 2018 in Bengaluru, also saw an unprecedented increase in demand during the lockdown: It went from 100 clients in a month to 800. The founders — Sudhindra Subbarao, Amit Kumar, Srinivasa Murthy and Ramesh Chincholi — had a goal of opening in two cities by the end of 2020. Fuelled by demand they launched their services in Hyderabad in August and in Chennai by November. “We started getting calls from all over India and quickly needed to replicate our workforce and vendors,” says Sudhindra, adding that Pune is their latest market. To facilitate faster service they started an estimation system online along with bookings through the app/website. Across the country This industry was growing at a predictable pattern — this included luggage from people relocating abroad for six months, families renovating houses, students and professionals migrating within the country — till the pandemic hit, says Sudhindra. Bengaluru houses their biggest store house at 1.5 lakh square feet. In Hyderabad it is 35,000 square feet and 12,000 square feet in Chennai. “We will be adding 15,000 square feet in Chennai every 75 days,” adds Sudhindra. Four hundred to 500 enquiries pour in everyday. These are from companies (who need a place to keep their office equipment as they are giving up their physical space) as well as working professionals. “Even though the vaccine has come, and a few people are back at work, most are still working from home because companies want their employees to be safe. Plus some offices are opting for smaller offices to reduce their costs. So our unit is still at 85% occupancy and we expect it to remain this way till December,” says Ameya. After the pandemic too he is confident about business in Mumbai as the city has space issues and people live in houses as small as 400 square feet but have lots of belongings that they need to store somewhere. The monthly rent starts at Rs. 1,700 and can go up depending on the client’s requirements. “The idea is that clients pay only 10% to 15% of what they would as home rent,” explains Ameya. A huge saving  Sure enough, this works as a competitive saving option. Aarka Banerjee, a legal professional with a multi-national audit firm in Hyderabad, says, thanks to these storage services, he would have saved almost Rs. 2.7 lakh on rent, by the time he goes back in June, when his office is tentatively scheduled to reopen physically. In early September, he left his rented accommodation in Kondapur (Hyderabad) and moved back to his family home in Kolkata. “I was paying Rs. 30,000 as rent for a two BHK. Now I just pay Rs. 3,000 per month to the storage unit,” says Aarka. There was also the option of carting his belongings back with him. With prices inflated because of the pandemic, that would have cost him around Rs. 45,000 both ways. It helps that personnel from Seacon Traders, where his worldly possessions are currently housed, call every month with updates about his belongings. “It was safe even during the heavy rains in October,” says Aarka. Most storage services also offer insurance to their clients, the amount is usually included in the rent. Some people store expensive items such as art, while some keep things that are of emotional value like old photographs or artefacts belonging to their parents. Drones, Dussehra idols, a replica of a football ground with players on it are some of the unusual things that clients store, says Sudhindra. Ameya adds that one of his US-based clients, a middle-aged gentleman, keeps his collection of action figures at Space Valet. “While we accommodate most things we do not allow cash, jewellery and perishable items,” says Neha Sharma, assistant manager at Self Storage, with units in Gurugram and Noida. Given the popularity of this segment, quite a few people have also started fly-by-night versions of this service. These include people renting out a room in their house as a storage space. “If only it were that simple,” says Neha adding that at their warehouses everything is stored on top of pallets to protect from moisture. “In addition we do checks for fire hazard every fortnight and pest control every month. We have a duty manager who is present at the site 24/7.” She mentions that the items are neatly packed in three layers to maintain their original quality. “That’s why it was hardly a surprise when one of our clients, who lives abroad, landed in Delhi, came to our storage unit, took out one of his festive garments, got dressed and went straight for a wedding!” laughs Neha.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||When walls disappear||“When I put up the first mural, the wall disappeared, because I was looking at the image,” says Kabir Mokamel who is visiting Delhi. It was 2014 when Artlords, the organisation he had co-founded, made its first move into the streets of Kabul. Through a slow process of connecting with the community in the conflict-ridden capital, it began painting the blast walls to make a political point. After the US intervention in 2001, thick grey concrete walls came up to shield government buildings, embassies and private residences for the wealthy, turning the city into a fortress. Mokamel and his team’s first work showed the magnified eyes of co-founder, Rawail Singh’s daughter, with the words, “I can see you. Corruption cannot be hidden from God and from the eyes of the people”, written in Pashto and Dari scripts. Four years later, Singh would be killed along with 12 other Afghan Sikh activists. This time, another mural would go up, of the father and daughter. Artlords, a take-off on the druglords and warlords of Afghanistan, believes in artivism, a portmanteau that puts out social and political messaging through painting. Mokamel has been deeply influenced by the ‘masked’ British artist, Banksy. The difference is that there is nothing secretive about the group, and their work is not done covertly. Permission is sought from the owners of the walls — usually the government — with a brief about the mural. The artwork, created on a computer, is projected onto a wall, with numbers for colours. To date, they have done about 2,000 paintings, the smallest 3x5 metres, the largest 6x18 metres. “We talk to people on the street, we see what people think,” he says of the process of inviting passersby to come and paint. “Once there was a young girl, about 13 or 14, very disturbed; she was critical of what we were doing, so I asked her to come and paint. She said no, but I handed her a brush. She stood and painted for two or three hours,” he says, adding that the act helped calm her down. It is something Mokamel would like to take up in the future — art for mental health, for a country disturbed by over 40 years of turmoil. “It’s a bubble in the corridor of suicide bombing,” he says. A place for all He was lucky enough to have experienced the ‘old Kabul’, when it was “a very beautiful city, a cultured city, with very nice people”. At 17, he was conscripted into the army. After three-and- half years he fled to Pakistan, where many others went for refuge. In 1989, he moved to Germany and then Australia to study art and graphic design, working there as well. “While I was in Afghanistan, the war was taking place outside of me, but when I moved outside, the war moved inside me, so it was a horrible thing,” says Mokamel, referring to the turmoil that people in war-torn areas feel. In the time he spent abroad, he would return often to Kabul: the mountains calling him; his connection with them unbroken. He came back in 2010, because it was home and also because he felt there was “something that we can solve, something that we can make, a place to live together, but it takes some time not to be selfish.” He began to work in the media as a creative director, until the idea of Artlords came about with Omaid Sharifi, Rawail Singh, and Lima Ahmad. It was only in 2018 that this work turned full time for him. Some campaigns that have done well internationally are themes that appeal to all: a portrait of George Floyd, murdered on the streets by Minneapolis police, for instance. Some mark pieces of history, like the signing of the US-Taliban peace deal last year. Many are reactions to life in Afghanistan: a portrait of Tetsu Nakamura, the head of a Japanese aid agency killed by gunmen; that of law professor and activist Hamida Barmaki, also killed by militants with her husband and four children. There is a series that celebrates the Heroes of My City that depicted municipal workers, teachers and nurses. Each mural goes up with a message. Only one has ever been taken down, that of Barmaki, painted in front of the residence of a powerful warlord said to be held responsible for her death. “The American University took it down as it was on their wall.” Driven by angst Many of the artworks are borne of the anger at what Kabul has become, at losing close family and friends to suicide bombers or having them just disappear. When 27-year-old Farkhunda Malikzada was publicly lynched beside a mosque, wrongly accused of having burned the Koran, there was public outrage. The Artlords donated blood and poured the samples on the wall, rather than use red paint. “It was the blood of everyone who was spilled there,” says Mokamel. Of late though, he is looking at approaching the murals through a prism of positivity, beauty and poetry, taking the rough edges off activism. “Beauty inspires, not negativity,” says the 53-year-old, who hopes to create “a new visual language” that people across the world will resonate with. Something that appeals “not to the political mind, but to our emotional core”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-walls-disappear/article33805797.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||One for the record books||When K Gokulnath points his finger at her, 10-year-old Andrea Varghese walks to the corner where gymnastics mattresses have been piled. She picks one out and proceeds to contort her body in ways unimaginable. One among the students at Gokulnath Unique Talent Academy (GUTA), a flow arts school, who has yet to set a Guinness World Record, Andrea’s father Varghese Joseph informs us she is practising daily to change the status quo and set one of her own: the maximum times one can roll over backwards whilst staying contorted! GUTA is the brainchild of Gokulnath, who is an actor-performer-filmmaker-dance and stunt choreographer all rolled into one. Since March 2020, Gokul, his team of trainers at GUTA (which he operates in Arumbakkam and Virugambakkam) and their students have together set 16 Guinness World Records. “You could say this [records] is becoming a USP for us,” he smiles. His academy in Arumbakkam is on the first floor of a commercial building on Valluvar Street, a few paces down the road from Jai Nagar Park near CMBT bus terminus. The students include a four-year-old girl who Gokul points to and says, “She can give us 30 push-ups easily.” The world records the students have set range from ‘Most rotations of a hula hoop on one feet whilst in head stand position in one minute’ to ‘Most juggling catches on a balance board in one minute’. Developing interest The 36-year-old Gokul started GUTA in 2018, and for a while had aligned it with that of choreographer Kala’s dance studio in Anna Nagar. In February 2020, he moved to the space in Arumbakkam. Lockdown began soon after. “A student pitched the idea [of attempting world records] during lockdown. I found that there were several categories in flow arts that could be attempted and completed within a minute. These were also part of their lessons, and so doing this was helpful in retaining the students’ interest [during lockdown],” says Gokul, a prominent face in television who has appeared in shows such as Kalakka Povathu Yaaru and Maanada Mayilada to name a few.  With 16 records in the kitty, GUTA is planning to recruit parents as well in their pursuits. Last week, Gokul enlisted the help of parents in a bid to attempt to pass a hula hoop along a human chain of 100 people in under five minutes; an attempt which was unsuccessful. He, however, insists he will redo the attempt until he gets the desired result. Says Indu Sukumar, whose son Adhav attempted to set a record by climbing a fleet of 50 stairs whilst hula-hooping, “The children are more interested in such activities. My son is now into juggling as well. He is also preparing to give the (aforementioned) record attempt a second try.” For the children, flow arts has earned them recognition — among classmates and teachers in school. The ones with records to their name are afforded the long end of the rope when it comes to academics, if it helps with their practice. For Gokul, this is becoming a way of life. He says, “My next record will be with my wife. We will be making the largest origami heart for Valentine’s Day.” On February 4, however, the Guinness World Records certified Gokulnath and his partner as the new record holders in the aforementioned category, having made an origami heart that measures 3.82 metres x 3.35 metres.  Gokulnath can be contacted on 7338827800.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/one-for-the-record-books/article33805764.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||From the heart of Tamil Nadu||Ask any Tamil reader, and they will have a list of must-read gems to share with the non-Tamil speaking world. But very few of these titles have well-written and well-edited translated versions. Also, a lot of valuable books published long ago have gone out of print and face the danger of becoming extinct. This is where the Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation’s translation initiative comes in. With help from a select group of experts, including writers and those with decades of experience in translation, the initiative aims to give a leg-up to Tamil to English translations. “The project was launched in 2017 and so far, in the first phase, we have brought out six books,” says T S Saravanan, deputy director of the project. These include The Kural (Penguin Random House), CS Chellappa’s Vaadivaasal (1948, Oxford University Press), T Janakiraman’s Sembaruththi (1968, Ratna Books), Neela Padmanabhan’s Thalaimuraikal (1968, Harper Collins India) and Ki Rajanarayanan’s Karisal Kathaikal (1984, Harper Collins India). The idea is to take titles, shortlisted by an academic advisory committee constituted for the project, to a wide spectrum of readers. “Some of these include books that are not available and have to be reprinted. Vaadivaasal is one such,” he says. Writer S Ramakrishnan, who is part of the committee, recalls the long exchanges over email during lockdown to finalise titles. “It was a big challenge,” he says. “We wanted to take the best of Tamil literature and present it to those outside the State, to help them better understand Tamil culture, the people, and the language.” Ramakrishnan is glad that the Tamil Nadu Government has come forward to support such an initiative. “Several great Kannada and Malayalam writers have gone places because of their works being translated; there are so many good Tamil writers whose work needs to be promoted in a similar way,” he feels. Another important target audience, is students. Mini Krishnan, coordinating editor of the project and member of its execution team, hopes that by collaborating with publishers across India, the books may reach college students who would otherwise not have access to them. She explains that there are three kinds of readership for translations in English. “One: within the country, particularly in the large cities; two: in culture-study courses run for non-Indians outside the country, forming an exotic addition to the subject of Indology; and a third which meets the nostalgia of Indians who lost their mother tongues when they left their country but not memories of their culture and origin.” There are interesting books on the anvil: for 2021, the team plans to bring out three books every four months. Among them is Tamilnaatil Gandhi by A Ramasamy. “It speaks about events that occurred during Gandhi’s visits to Tamil Nadu,” says Ramakrishnan. He is thrilled that once it is out in English, the book will get a whole new readership.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||How to train your dragon||Ranjini Manian likens the mind to a puppy. “You just have to train it. It will listen to you,” says the founder-chair of Global Adjustments Foundation. A self-confessed frenetic person in the past, she says ever since she started meditation three decades ago, it has made her life a million times better. And so she advocates meditating everyday, at least for 10 minutes (beginners), within 45 minutes of waking up. This simple practice can help one go from having a mind full to being mindful, explains Ranjini. Her series of webinars titled The Champion Woman Life Leadership Programme aims to incorporate this while training people in life leadership skills. This free-of-cost programme was started five years ago by the Global Adjustments Foundation. “The goal is to help women and girls live out their potential. During my tenure with Global Adjustments, I worked with 450 multinationals and noticed that even with the companies offering a lot of facilities, there weren’t enough résumés from women. It was clear they needed to be told that they are tremendous. So, we built a programme for resilience, and for resilience you need to have mindfulness,” says Ranjini. Over the years, The Champion Woman Life Leadership Programme took her to schools, colleges, medical institutions, corporates and even to the Officers Training Academy, Chennai where she worked with lady cadets of the Afghanistan army. “The goal is to help people respond to situations than react,” says Ranjini. There is a difference between the two. Reaction is immediate, instantaneous. It is when your emotion translates to your lips and, inevitably, leads to regret. Responding, on the other hand, is taking a step back for 90 seconds to break the negative emotion and follow the strategy of mindful relationship building,” she explains. Looking back  A businesswoman — she founded Global Adjustments in 1995 — Ranjini says she managed to integrate work and family life. The capability of doing so successfully comes from training the mind. These webinars also help teach this vital art of work-life balance to women in the workforce. Even though the programme started out with women in focus, while training medical workers during the pandemic, Ranjini realised that regardless of the gender, their issues and concerns were the same. As a result, it started involving men as well. “The sessions cover eight topics, and start with emotional strengthening. The programmes are fixed depending on the interest of the institution. Some allocate two hours, some six and some even 12,” she says.  Global Adjustments Foundation organises an open session on YouTube titled Mindfull to Mindful. The 30-minute live session will be held on February 12 at 5 pm onwww.youtube.com/c/      championwoman.

If you are a cricket fan, like Anandakrishnan S, you attempt to focus on both. With the help of his cricket-crazy relatives, Anandakrishnan set up televisions at the wedding hall in Vadapalani to ensure everybody caught the India-England cricketing battle at Chepauk. A picture taken of guests watching the match has gone viral since; Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin also shared it. A member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Media and communications team, Moulin Parikh, shared the picture too. “I make it a point to watch any match played at Chepauk,” says Anandakrishnan, a 30-year-old finance manager and IIM Tiruchi alumni, “When my wedding date was fixed, the first thing I checked was the cricket calendar for the year.” Since the date could not be changed as it was auspicious, the family decided to live stream the match. “Every now and then, I would turn to the vaadhyar (priest officiating the ceremony) to check the score,” adds Anandakrishnan, whose wife, Krishnapriya, too, is a cricket fan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-right-match/article33805783.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Lord of the Ha Ha||The last time Craig Gallyot got on stage for a stand up act, people secretly feared the world ending. That, fortunately, had nothing to do with Craig; it was the year 2012. Nine years on, the former SS Music anchor and one of Chennai’s first celebrity VJs, is back to stand up comedy. A lot has changed. “When we started doing stand up comedy in Chennai, it was relatively new. It used to be part of a bigger event or a fashion show and people asked me if I was going to do mimicry,” laughs Craig. Now, Indians are travelling the world doing this genre of comedy, says Craig, pleased with the way things have evolved. “You can look at it as a legitimate career path with dedicated comedy clubs, OTT platforms, and international platforms,” he says, adding, “If I had told my mother I want to pursue this as a career, she would have said ‘good, when are you moving out?’” he laughs. Craig says he hosted a school cultural, in the recent past, where stand up comedy was a segment. “This was not the case during our culturals,” he adds. It is also exploding on the social media scene, opening up a platform for discussion. “Eighteen year-olds are discussing what freedom of speech means,” he says. So, in the current scenario, what is it like to make a comeback? “I am extremely nervous,” he confesses. “I don’t know what’s going to trigger whom. I am trying to keep it family friendly. If it does step on a few toes... well, you can’t please everyone, every time.” After SS Music, Craig did a few live shows, and started looking at marketing of television channels and radio stations. He is currently a consultant, and has recently revamped a Chennai-based channel from GEC to news. But his spontaneity as a comic is intact, he assures. “I love to make people laugh. That’s what got me into television in the first place. Looking at the sunny side of things beats cribbing about it,” says Craig.  Craig Gallyot will perform at Barracuda Brew on February 14, 7 pm onwards.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A hit dish||Amidst the intense yelling matches of Bigg Boss and the humdrum monotony of marathon soaps, it started off as a breath of fresh air just over a year ago, in late 2019. Ratings were ordinary to begin with, as viewers took time to discover what has arguably become the most popular reality show on Tamil television screens. We are referring to Cooku with Comali, the ingenious cooking competition on Star Vijay and Disney+ Hotstar that has proved to be a stress-buster during the pandemic, appealing to fans across countries. The show’s premise is simple: Each task pairs a contestant (usually a TV/ film actor, anchor or social media star) with a ‘comali’ (comedian), and the duo takes to the kitchen together and cooks a dish based on the judges’ instructions. However, various challenges are thrown their way, resulting in hilarious situations. “Most other cooking-based reality shows are quite serious, so we wanted to give this a comic spin. That was the idea when we started off; but we incorporated more and more changes going forward. For instance, setting up new cook-comalipairs every week makes it exciting for the audience to see how the dynamics between the two plays out,” says Parthiban, who is the director of the show, that is now in its second season. What has ultimately made CWC such a hit though, is the banter between the comedians. Be it Pugazh’s jovial flirting with other contestants like Pavithra and Darsha, or Sivaangi’s shenanigans with Ashwin, the repartee between the performers has captured people’s fancy.“We do absolutely zero preparation before we film an episode. Whatever I think in the moment, I blurt it out. What you see on screen is our real-life personalities,” grins Sivaangi Krishnakumar, who first shot to fame via Super Singer. But the focus of the show, which is overseen by judges/ celebrity chefs Damu and Venkatesh Bhat, is always the cooking, reiterates director Parthiban. “That’s why we choose the contestants, who appear on the show, based on their ability to cook too. Beyond all the comedy and madcap antics, you see some great dishes brought to life,” he says. The contestants might be the ones who spend all week reading up on recipes, but thecomalisdon’t practise at all, laughs Pugazh. “Just like the comedy, the food also won’t work out if we rehearse it,” he deadpans. One of the show’s most popular aspects is the charming bond Pugazh shares with Sivaangi, with the two developing a “TV siblings” moniker over time. “I’ve known Pugazh anna for just around two years now. People seem to really enjoy our friendship, and I’m obviously glad to know him,” smiles Sivaangi.   Cooku with Comaliairs every Saturday and Sunday from 6.30 pm to 8 pm on Star Vijay||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-hit-dish/article33805769.ece

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Faces, places||An alcoholic, abusive father Ganapathy and his son, Velu, are on their way to the neighbouring village to bring back the wife-mother, who has fled the home. A scuffle breaks out between Ganapathy and his in-laws, forcing Velu to tear up a wad of cash to get back at his father. They trudge their way back in the midst of scorching heat. Vinothraj admits that the film came from a place of anger. Mined out of what happened to his younger sister, whose alcoholic husband shut the doors on her, making her walk back over 13 kilometres to her village with a toddler in arms, Vinothraj calls such incidents “an everyday occurrence” in his village. “She knew that I was making her story. I was conscious not to hurt anybody involved because I knew my sister and her husband would end up together again. She has seen the film and she really liked it. When I showed the rough cut to the old women in our village, they reacted in a way that gave me the most satisfaction. I am not sure if folks at Rotterdam got the film, but those grannies did,” says the filmmaker. Edited excerpts: What are your earliest memories of cinema? I remember visiting film shoots in Madurai in the 2000s — from Ghilli to Paruthiveeran . At that age, what fascinated me the most was the jimmy-jib camera that was carrying the cinematographer. I would say the shooting atmosphere was what drew me into cinema. You get to see a lot of images around Madurai that tell you a certain story. Its vastness can be divided into three: the barren landscape that you see in Koozhangal , the main city, and the part that leads to the Western Ghats. Now when I look back, I think these images kindled an interest to try and pursue cinematography, which I couldn’t afford to. You seem to have learned the craft of cinema by watching films when you worked in a DVD shop in Chennai. Is that a fair assumption?  Yes. I used to watch random films; sometimes by suggestion. That is how I discovered filmmakers like Majid Majidi, Abbas Kiarostami and Nuri Bilge Ceylan [of Three Monkeys ]. Apart from watching films, I began sharing my resume with filmmakers who dropped by the shop. Later, I worked in A Sargunam’s [of Vaagai Sooda Vaa ] production venture, Manjapai , which was a lesson on the other side of cinema. Was Koozhangal supposed to be your début work?  No. I was trying to make another film, which had three landscapes. I like to tell stories through landscapes, but I couldn’t convince producers. I made a short, Subway , to convince people that I had talent. Four years back, my sister had to face a similar experience like in Koozhangal . I finished the first draft in nine days. The filmmaking standard is world-class for someone who never went to a film school...  Maybe because I approach everything with emotion. What truly was transformative was when I worked in a theatre group called Manal Magudi in Kovilpatti. It is a post-modern troupe and Muruga Boopathy is the director. There was one particular play that they staged across the country. It had no dialogues and everything was communicated through action. I was fascinated by the way they used the space and their body movements. My knowledge on the film language came from there, I believe. At what point did Nayanthara and Vignesh Shivan step in to present the film?  We were initially associated with Learn and Teach, a production company. But the pandemic kept delaying the project. Seventy percent of the film was done and we were looking for a co-producer. That is how we approached NFDC Film Bazaar by showing a rough cut. We couldn’t get the desired support. And that is where we met filmmaker Ram sir. I told my assistant that Karuppusamy [a deity] has come in the form of Ram and that we have to make use of him. The moment he saw the trailer, Ram sir got involved and gave us hope. He believed in the project more than anybody. When can we expect Koozhangal in theatres?  Now that the film had its world première at the Rotterdam Film Festival, it has to travel across Europe. We are trying to see if we can monetise from the festivals. All things said, it should arrive sometime in July/August. When I met Soori [actor], one of the well-wishers of this film, he told me that we should book a special show for grannies and women of our village, excluding men. I concur. After all, this film was made for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/faces-places/article33806094.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Dump your physical and emotional baggage here||Marie Kondo may be trending on social media but here is a little secret. Did you know, there is a percentage that de-clutters their homes, then stashes away their excesses — memorabilia, collectibles or just about any object they are attached to — in storage facilities? “People are attached to material things that they do not want to dispose of,” says Ameya Davda who started Space Valet in Mumbai in 2017, along with his cousin Devak Davda. This sentiment was what the Davda’s business hinged on before the pandemic set in. When lockdown began and offices shut, working professionals headed back to their hometowns to work from home. Many realised it would be economical to give up their rented accommodations for the duration they were away. But what about their furniture, appliances, and other household goods? “This is where the self storage facilities come in handy. It is a $50 billion industry in the U.S. and is picking up in India now. A number of such storage facilities have opened during the lockdown,” says Ameya who has four units (two each in Bhiwandi and Sewri) in Mumbai. The largest, at 25,000 square feet, came up in the middle of the pandemic, in response to market demands. Stownest Storage, started in December 2018 in Bengaluru, also saw an unprecedented increase in demand during the lockdown: it went from 100 clients in a month to 800. The founders — Sudhindra Subbarao, Amit Kumar, Srinivasa Murthy and Ramesh Chincholi — had a goal of opening in two cities by the end of 2020. Fuelled by demand they launched their services in Hyderabad in August and in Chennai by November. “We started getting calls from all over India and quickly needed to replicate our workforce and vendors,” says Sudhindra, adding that Pune is their latest market. To facilitate faster service they started an estimation system online along with bookings through the app/website. Across the country This industry was growing at a predictable pattern — this included luggage from people relocating abroad for six months, families renovating houses, students and professionals migrating within the country — till the pandemic hit, says Sudhindra. Bengaluru houses their biggest store house at 1.5 lakh square feet. In Hyderabad, it is 35,000 square feet and 12,000 square feet in Chennai. “We will be adding 15,000 square feet in Chennai every 75 days,” adds Sudhindra. Four hundred to 500 enquiries pour in every day. These are from companies (who need a place to keep their office equipment as they are giving up their physical space) as well as working professionals. “Even though the vaccine has come, and a few people are back at work, most are still working from home because companies want their employees to be safe. Plus some offices are opting for smaller offices to reduce their costs. So our unit is still at 85% occupancy and we expect it to remain this way till December,” says Ameya. After the pandemic too he is confident about business in Mumbai as the city has space issues and people live in houses as small as 400 square feet but have lots of belongings that they need to store somewhere. The monthly rent starts at Rs. 1,700 and can go up depending on the client’s requirements. “The idea is that clients pay only 10% to 15% of what they would as home rent,” explains Ameya. A huge saving  Sure enough, this works as a competitive saving option. Aarka Banerjee, a legal professional with a multi-national audit firm in Hyderabad, says, thanks to these storage services, he would have saved almost Rs. 2.7 lakh on rent, by the time he goes back in June, when his office is tentatively scheduled to reopen physically. In early September, he left his rented accommodation in Kondapur (Hyderabad) and moved back to his family home in Kolkata. “I was paying Rs. 30,000 as rent for a two BHK. Now I just pay Rs. 3,000 per month to the storage unit,” says Aarka. There was also the option of carting his belongings back with him. With prices inflated because of the pandemic, that would have cost him around Rs. 45,000 both ways. It helps that personnel from Seacon Traders, where his worldly possessions are currently housed, call every month with updates about his belongings. “It was safe even during the heavy rains in October,” says Aarka. Most storage services also offer insurance to their clients, the amount is usually included in the rent. Some people store expensive items such as art, while some keep things that are of emotional value like old photographs or artefacts belonging to their parents. Drones, Dussehra idols, a replica of a football ground with players on it are some of the unusual things that clients store, says Sudhindra. Ameya adds that one of his U.S.-based clients, a middle-aged gentleman, keeps his collection of action figures at Space Valet. “While we accommodate most things we do not allow cash, jewellery, and perishable items,” says Neha Sharma, assistant manager at Self Storage, with units in Gurugram and Noida. Given the popularity of this segment, quite a few people have also started fly-by-night versions of this service. These include people renting out a room in their house as a storage space. “If only it were that simple,” says Neha adding that at their warehouses everything is stored on top of pallets to protect from moisture. “In addition we do checks for fire hazard every fortnight and pest control every month. We have a duty manager who is present at the site 24/7.” She mentions that the items are neatly packed in three layers to maintain their original quality. “That’s why it was hardly a surprise when one of our clients, who lives abroad, landed in Delhi, came to our storage unit, took out one of his festive garments, got dressed and went straight for a wedding!” laughs Neha.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||When walls disappear||“When I put up the first mural, the wall disappeared, because I was looking at the image,” says Kabir Mokamel, who is visiting Delhi. It was 2014 when Artlords, the organisation he had co-founded, made its first move into the streets of Kabul. Through a slow process of connecting with the community in the conflict-ridden capital, it began painting the blast walls to make a political point. After the U.S. intervention in 2001, thick grey concrete walls came up to shield government buildings, embassies and private residences for the wealthy, turning the city into a fortress. Mokamel and his team’s first work showed the magnified eyes of co-founder, Rawail Singh’s daughter, with the words, “I can see you. Corruption cannot be hidden from God and from the eyes of the people”, written in Pashto and Dari scripts. Four years later, Singh would be killed along with 12 other Afghan Sikh activists. This time, another mural would go up, of the father and daughter. Messaging through painting Artlords, a take-off on the druglords and warlords of Afghanistan, believes in artivism, a portmanteau that puts out social and political messaging through painting. Mokamel has been deeply influenced by the ‘masked’ British artist, Banksy. The difference is that there is nothing secretive about the group, and their work is not done covertly. Permission is sought from the owners of the walls — usually the government — with a brief about the mural. The artwork, created on a computer, is projected onto a wall, with numbers for colours. To date, they have done about 2,000 paintings, the smallest 3x5 metres, the largest 6x18 metres. “We talk to people on the street, we see what people think,” he says of the process of inviting passers-by to come and paint. “Once there was a young girl, about 13 or 14, very disturbed; she was critical of what we were doing, so I asked her to come and paint. She said no, but I handed her a brush. She stood and painted for two or three hours,” he says, adding that the act helped calm her down. It is something Mokamel would like to take up in the future — art for mental health, for a country disturbed by over 40 years of turmoil. “It’s a bubble in the corridor of suicide bombing,” he says. A place for all He was lucky enough to have experienced the ‘old Kabul’, when it was “a very beautiful city, a cultured city, with very nice people”. At 17, he was conscripted into the army. After three-and- half years he fled to Pakistan, where many others went for refuge. In 1989, he moved to Germany and then Australia to study art and graphic design, working there as well. “While I was in Afghanistan, the war was taking place outside of me, but when I moved outside, the war moved inside me, so it was a horrible thing,” says Mokamel, referring to the turmoil that people in war-torn areas feel. In the time he spent abroad, he would return often to Kabul: the mountains calling him; his connection with them unbroken. He came back in 2010, because it was home and also because he felt there was “something that we can solve, something that we can make, a place to live together, but it takes some time not to be selfish.” He began to work in the media as a creative director, until the idea of Artlords came about with Omaid Sharifi, Rawail Singh, and Lima Ahmad. It was only in 2018 that this work turned full time for him. Some campaigns that have done well internationally are themes that appeal to all: a portrait of George Floyd, murdered on the streets by the Minneapolis police, for instance. Some mark pieces of history, like the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal last year. Many are reactions to life in Afghanistan: a portrait of Tetsu Nakamura, the head of a Japanese aid agency killed by gunmen; that of law professor and activist Hamida Barmaki, also killed by militants with her husband and four children. There is a series that celebrates the Heroes of My City that depicted municipal workers, teachers and nurses. Each mural goes up with a message. Only one has ever been taken down, that of Barmaki, painted in front of the residence of a powerful warlord said to be held responsible for her death. “The American University took it down as it was on their wall.” Driven by angst Many of the artworks are borne of the anger at what Kabul has become, at losing close family and friends to suicide bombers or having them just disappear. When 27-year-old Farkhunda Malikzada was publicly lynched beside a mosque, wrongly accused of having burned the Koran, there was public outrage. The Artlords donated blood and poured the samples on the wall, rather than use red paint. “It was the blood of everyone who was spilled there,” says Mokamel. Of late though, he is looking at approaching the murals through a prism of positivity, beauty and poetry, taking the rough edges off activism. “Beauty inspires, not negativity,” says the 53-year-old, who hopes to create “a new visual language” that people across the world will resonate with. Something that appeals “not to the political mind, but to our emotional core”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-walls-disappear/article33806089.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||From the heart of Tamil Nadu||Ask any Tamil reader, and they will have a list of must-read gems to share with the non-Tamil speaking world. But very few of these titles have well-written and well-edited translated versions. Also, a lot of valuable books published long ago have gone out of print and face the danger of becoming extinct. This is where the Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation’s translation initiative comes in. With help from a select group of experts, including writers and those with decades of experience in translation, the initiative aims to give a leg-up to Tamil to English translations. “The project was launched in 2017 and so far, in the first phase, we have brought out six books,” says T S Saravanan, deputy director of the project. These include The Kural (Penguin Random House), CS Chellappa’s Vaadivaasal (1948, Oxford University Press), T Janakiraman’s Sembaruththi (1968, Ratna Books), Neela Padmanabhan’s Thalaimuraikal (1968, Harper Collins India) and Ki Rajanarayanan’s Karisal Kathaikal (1984, Harper Collins India). The idea is to take titles, shortlisted by an academic advisory committee constituted for the project, to a wide spectrum of readers. “Some of these include books that are not available and have to be reprinted. Vaadivaasal is one such,” he says. Writer S Ramakrishnan, who is part of the committee, recalls the long exchanges over email during lockdown to finalise titles. “It was a big challenge,” he says. “We wanted to take the best of Tamil literature and present it to those outside the State, to help them better understand Tamil culture, the people, and the language.” Ramakrishnan is glad that the Tamil Nadu Government has come forward to support such an initiative. “Several great Kannada and Malayalam writers have gone places because of their works being translated; there are so many good Tamil writers whose work needs to be promoted in a similar way,” he feels. Another important target audience, is students. Mini Krishnan, coordinating editor of the project and member of its execution team, hopes that by collaborating with publishers across India, the books may reach college students who would otherwise not have access to them. She explains that there are three kinds of readership for translations in English. “One: within the country, particularly in the large cities; two: in culture-study courses run for non-Indians outside the country, forming an exotic addition to the subject of Indology; and a third which meets the nostalgia of Indians who lost their mother tongues when they left their country but not memories of their culture and origin.” There are interesting books on the anvil: for 2021, the team plans to bring out three books every four months.

11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||One for the record books||When K Gokulnath points his finger at her, 10-year-old Andrea Varghese walks to the corner where gymnastics mattresses have been piled. She picks one out and proceeds to contort her body in ways unimaginable. One among the students at Gokulnath Unique Talent Academy (GUTA), a flow arts school, who has yet to set a Guinness World Record, Andrea’s father Varghese Joseph informs us she is practising daily to change the status quo and set one of her own: the maximum times one can roll over backwards whilst staying contorted! GUTA is the brainchild of Gokulnath, who is an actor-performer-filmmaker-dance and stunt choreographer all rolled into one. Since March 2020, Gokul, his team of trainers at GUTA (which he operates in Arumbakkam and Virugambakkam) and their students have together set 16 Guinness World Records. “You could say this [records] is becoming a USP for us,” he smiles. His academy in Arumbakkam is on the first floor of a commercial building on Valluvar Street, a few paces down the road from Jai Nagar Park near CMBT bus terminus. The students include a four-year-old girl who Gokul points to and says, “She can give us 30 push-ups easily.” The world records the students have set range from ‘Most rotations of a hula hoop on one feet whilst in head stand position in one minute’ to ‘Most juggling catches on a balance board in one minute’. Developing interest The 36-year-old Gokul started GUTA in 2018, and for a while had aligned it with that of choreographer Kala’s dance studio in Anna Nagar. In February 2020, he moved to the space in Arumbakkam. Lockdown began soon after. “A student pitched the idea [of attempting world records] during lockdown. I found that there were several categories in flow arts that could be attempted and completed within a minute. These were also part of their lessons, and so doing this was helpful in retaining the students’ interest [during lockdown],” says Gokul, a prominent face in television who has appeared in shows such as Kalakka Povathu Yaaru and Maanada Mayilada to name a few.  With 16 records in the kitty, GUTA is planning to recruit parents as well in their pursuits. Last week, Gokul enlisted the help of parents in a bid to attempt to pass a hula hoop along a human chain of 100 people in under five minutes; an attempt which was unsuccessful. He, however, insists he will redo the attempt until he gets the desired result. Says Indu Sukumar, whose son Adhav attempted to set a record by climbing a fleet of 50 stairs whilst hula-hooping, “The children are more interested in such activities. My son is now into juggling as well. He is also preparing to give the (aforementioned) record attempt a second try.” For the children, flow arts has earned them recognition — among classmates and teachers in school. The ones with records to their name are afforded the long end of the rope when it comes to academics, if it helps with their practice. For Gokul, this is becoming a way of life. He says, “My next record will be with my wife. We will be making the largest origami heart for Valentine’s Day.” On February 4, however, the Guinness World Records certified Gokulnath and his partner as the new record holders in the aforementioned category, having made an origami heart that measures 3.82 metres x 3.35 metres.  Gokulnath can be contacted at 7338827800.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/one-for-the-record-books/article33806093.ece
11 February 2021||February 11 2021 00:00 IST,||How to train your dragon||Ranjini Manian likens the mind to a puppy. “You just have to train it. It will listen to you,” says the founder-chair of Global Adjustments Foundation. A self-confessed frenetic person in the past, she says ever since she started meditation three decades ago, it has made her life a million times better. And so she advocates meditating everyday, at least for 10 minutes (beginners), within 45 minutes of waking up. This simple practice can help one go from having a mind full to being mindful, explains Ranjini. Her series of webinars titled The Champion Woman Life Leadership Programme aims to incorporate this while training people in life leadership skills. This free-of-cost programme was started five years ago by the Global Adjustments Foundation. “The goal is to help women and girls live out their potential. During my tenure with Global Adjustments, I worked with 450 multinationals and noticed that even with the companies offering a lot of facilities, there weren’t enough résumés from women. It was clear they needed to be told that they are tremendous. So, we built a programme for resilience, and for resilience you need to have mindfulness,” says Ranjini. Over the years, The Champion Woman Life Leadership Programme took her to schools, colleges, medical institutions, corporates and even to the Officers Training Academy, Chennai where she worked with lady cadets of the Afghanistan army. “The goal is to help people respond to situations than react,” says Ranjini. There is a difference between the two. Reaction is immediate, instantaneous. It is when your emotion translates to your lips and, inevitably, leads to regret. Responding, on the other hand, is taking a step back for 90 seconds to break the negative emotion and follow the strategy of mindful relationship building,” she explains. Looking back  A businesswoman — she founded Global Adjustments in 1995 — Ranjini says she managed to integrate work and family life. The capability of doing so successfully comes from training the mind. These webinars also help teach this vital art of work-life balance to women in the workforce. Even though the programme started out with women in focus, while training medical workers during the pandemic, Ranjini realised that regardless of the gender, their issues and concerns were the same. As a result, it started involving men as well. “The sessions cover eight topics, and start with emotional strengthening. The programmes are fixed depending on the interest of the institution. Some allocate two hours, some six and some even 12,” she says.  Global Adjustments Foundation organises an open session on YouTube titled Mindfull to Mindful. The 30-minute live session will be held on February 12 at 5 pm onwww.youtube.com/c/      championwoman.

If you are a cricket fan, like Anandakrishnan S, you attempt to focus on both. With the help of his cricket-crazy relatives, Anandakrishnan set up televisions at the wedding hall in Vadapalani to ensure everybody caught the India-England cricketing battle at Chepauk. A picture taken of guests watching the match has gone viral since; Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin also shared it. A member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Media and communications team, Moulin Parikh, shared the picture too. “I make it a point to watch any match played at Chepauk,” says Anandakrishnan, a 30-year-old finance manager and IIM Tiruchi alumni, “When my wedding date was fixed, the first thing I checked was the cricket calendar for the year.” Since the date could not be changed as it was auspicious, the family decided to live stream the match. “Every now and then, I would turn to the vaadhyar (priest officiating the ceremony) to check the score,” adds Anandakrishnan, whose wife, Krishnapriya, too, is a cricket fan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-right-match/article33806098.ece
11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Will not leave protest site despite PM appeal’||Protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Wednesday said that despite appeals from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for older farmers to return to their respective villages, they were not ready to leave the protest site till the demands are met. Farmers from Delhi’s neighbouring States have been at the Capital’s borders for nearly three months now, demanding a repeal of the three agriculture laws brought in by the Centre. Several of the farmers at the protest site said that women and senior citizens would continue to protest at the borders to ensure that the agitation is not weakened. ‘Bid to reduce numbers’ Sukhwinder Singh, from Punjab’s Pola village said, “Why should the elders return? People have come here in large numbers and nobody will return till the laws are repealed. Appeals to sections of protesters to return only shows that the government wants the numbers to reduce at the borders but that is not going to happen.” Jarnail Singh, 60, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district said, “The elderly over here are the sons of those who have sacrificed a lot for the country. So how can these same people suddenly go back? We are ready to die here but will not return.” “Our family members and neighbours are taking care of the households and fields and even they do not want us to leave the protest and return,” said Mr. Jarnail, whose trolley is parked over seven kilometres away from the main stage at the Singhu border. Jaspal Singh, a 65-year-old farmer from Punjab’s Taran Tarn district said, “We cannot go home at this point. What will we do by returning? If the laws are implemented then anyway we will have nothing left. There are regular meetings taking place at the village level and all our schedules to visit the borders have been assigned. We will follow the same. Those governing the country should realise the pains of the governed.” Getting ready for summer Preparations to combat the summer heat, in terms of coolers and fans inside tents and trolleys would also begin soon, the farmers said, while reiterating their demands for a complete repeal of the three laws. Amardeep Singh, another farmer from Patiala said, “This is not a political movement but one which is completely driven by the farmers. People have voluntarily come here. In fact, women and children also at times tell us that they want to join. One thing which is certain is that we will win and people will not move till the laws are repealed. People have already begun making pukka structures. When required, fans and coolers will also be brought in. Like we have been saying since the beginning, we are prepared for the long haul.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/will-not-leave-protest-site-despite-pm-appeal/article33806119.ece

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Deep Sidhu quizzed on foreign links, funding||Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, allegedly involved in the Red Fort violence case, was questioned by a team of Delhi police and Intelligence Bureau officers for over eight hours at the Crime Branch office in Chanakyapuri on Wednesday.

We have got details of the IP address of the video uploader and it was a woman in the U.S. We are scanning his phone call records. He will be taken to Punjab and Haryana, if required, as his mobile phone is still missing,” he added.

11 February 2021||New Delhi,||Lawyer runs ‘heritage’ library to educate protesters at Tikri||As State lines continue to blur among them, a 35-year-old lawyer from Punjab’s Mansa juggles daily virtual court appearances and provide legal aid to those arrested for their alleged role in the Republic Day violence, at the Tikri border. Representing the first generation from a family of farmers to take up a different occupation, Jagtar Singh Sidhu, from a tent he set up 45 days ago, runs the “Shared Heritage Library” seeking to educate protesting Haryana and Punjab farmers about the common history of their past generations leading up to, and following, the two partitions of Punjab — first in 1947 and then in 1966. “I have been associated with the protest since July last year when it was limited to Punjab and have been here for the last 45 days. We have books on history, religion and literature in Hindi, Punjabi and English. Between 20 and 25 books are issued every day,” he said. “True Indianness lies in our diversity, so we should read diverse literature and culture to peacefully coexist. For me, it is as simple as that. This shared heritage is of India where a movement like this, which is bound to have international repercussions, is taking place right now,” said Mr. Sidhu, who is part of a team of 200 lawyers providing legal aid to those arrested in several cases related Republic Day violence. Mr. Sidhu’s library, he said, seeks to bring together not just literary glimpses of the undivided Punjab of yesteryear that lay between Peshawar and Delhi but that of diverse cultures culminating in “Indian-ness”. It would be wrong to view the farmers’ protests as isolated or limited to the States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as their trajectory would have larger, if not global, consequences, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lawyer-runs-heritage-library-to-educate-protesters-at-tikri/article33806121.ece

11 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Editors Guild expresses concern over raids on NewsClick office||The Editors Guild of India (EGI) on Wednesday expressed concern over the raids by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at the office of the news website NewsClick.in and the residences of its editor-in-chief and promoter, the editor and senior management. The EGI said that it is concerned that raids by government agencies are being used as coercive measures to suppress free and independent journalism. “The Guild demands that care be taken to not undermine the news operations of NewsClick and that its journalists and stakeholders are not harassed under the garb of such measures,” the EGI said. Critical reporting The EGI added that in the recent past the website has been at the front-line of reporting on the farmers agitation, the anti-CAA protests, and has been critical of various government policies and of a few powerful corporate houses. The Press Club of India also expressed concern and called the raid an “unsavoury attack on the media in a bid to intimidate and silence critical journalism”. “A series of attacks on prominent journalists of the country, and also on lesser-known hard working journalists who report from the ground in far-flung areas of the country, has regrettably become the hallmark of the government,” the PCI said. It asked the government to end “raid raj” and “false allegations raj” against the media and take visible steps to ensure democratic freedoms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/editors-guild-expresses-concern-over-raids-on-newsclick-office/article33806116.ece

Ravi for a “gag order” that prescribes stern penal and disciplinary action against government servants who post “seditious and subversive” content on social media. The Governor’s office in State capital Kohima had on January 16 informed Chief Secretary Jan-e-Alam about some government servants taking to social media to indulge in “seditious and subversive writings challenging the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country”. The official communiqué referred to a social media post by one H. Inao Jimomi Naga of Nagaland’s Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department and directed the State government to take “serious” cognisance of such misconduct and “initiate appropriate” legal and disciplinary action against “delinquent” government servants. A copy of the letter was marked to Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. Reacting to the directive, the NSF said Mr. Ravi was trying to “silence the voice of Naga people and suppress their rights”. In a statement on Tuesday evening, NSF president Ninoto Awomi and general secretary Liremo R. Kikon said the directive was another attempt by Mr. Ravi to undo the peace and understanding brought about by his predecessors. In singling an official, the Governor through the impugned directive “intends to create fear psychosis among the State government employees” and send a message that he “has his eyes and ears planted in Naga society to achieve his desired end of dividing the Naga people”, the NSF said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/naga-students-body-slams-governor-for-gag-order/article33806112.ece
