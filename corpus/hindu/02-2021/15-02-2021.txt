15 February 2021||CHENNAI,||PM hands over Arjun Mk-1A tank to Army||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday handed over the indigenous main battle tank Arjun Mk-1A to the Army in a function at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai. Chief of the Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane received the model of the tank, designed and developed by Chennai-based Combat Vehicles Research & Development Establishment (CVRDE), a unit of the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO). “A tank made in Tamil Nadu will be used in our northern borders to keep the nation safe. This showcases India's united spirit — Bharat’s Ekta Darshan,” Mr. Modi said. “We will continue working to make our armed forces one of the most modern forces in the world. At the same time, the focus on making India aatmanirbhar (self-reliant)  in the defence sector moves with full speed,” the Prime Minister said at the event attended by Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and other dignitaries. Mr. Modi was on a flying visit to Chennai where he inaugurated a slew of development projects across several sectors, before flying to Kerala. He had a 15-minute conversation with Mr. Palaniswami at the venue, according to sources. The AIADMK is an ally of the BJP, and the BJP national president J.P. Nadda, during his visit to the State last month, announced that the alliance would continue. Mr. Modi posed for photographs with the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister, with the three of them raising their hands together in a show of solidarity. The Prime Minister spoke at length of how India’s armed forces signified the country's ethos of courage. “They have shown, time and again, that they are fully capable of protecting our motherland. Time and again, they have shown India believes in peace. But, India will protect its sovereignty at all costs,” he said. The PM also recalled the martyrs, who lost their lives in a terrorist attack in Pulwama two years ago. Quoting Bharathi Quoting from Tamil poet Subramaniya Bharathi, Mr. Modi said India has undertaken a massive effort to become self-reliant in the defence sector. The state-of-the-art indigenous main battle tank has been indigenously designed, developed and manufactured by CVRDE, DRDO along with 15 academic institutions, eight labs and several MSMEs. With modern battle tank technologies, it is distinct from the contemporary main battle tanks and is a dependable warfighting machine. The Arjun MBT Mk-1A is a weapon platform with superior firepower, high mobility, excellent protection and crew comfort with 14 major upgrades on Arjun MBT Mk-1, according to the CVRDE.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-hands-over-arjun-mk-1a-tank-to-army/article33837727.ece
15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Senate acquits Trump of incitement||Former U.S. President Donald Trump was acquitted by the U.S. Senate in the impeachment trial of inciting an insurrection with regard to the January 6 attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters seeking to stop the certification of the Electoral College results. At the conclusion of proceedings that began last week, the Senate voted 57-43 on Saturday to acquit Mr. Trump, with seven Republican senators joining their Democratic colleagues to convict the former President. A majority of 67 votes would have been required for a conviction. Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial was shorter than his first in 2020 and relied in large measure on video footage of the former President’s incendiary remarks and the Capitol attack. The defence argued that he did not incite “what was already going to happen” on January 6 and that his comments were protected by his right to free speech by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Sad chapter: Biden “While the final vote did not lead to a conviction, the substance of the charge is not in dispute,” President Joe Biden said in a statement released late on Saturday. He has been mostly quiet about the trial. “This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile. That it must always be defended,” Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trump, who won just over 74 million votes in the elections — a record for any incumbent — and has repeatedly said he will continue to be politically active, hinted at the possibility again on Saturday. His massive support base has made the majority of Republican Senators wary of crossing the former President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/senate-acquits-trump-of-incitement/article33837729.ece

Nearly 154 persons are still missing, according to an update from the police. Rescue operations are on at the Tapovan hydropower station in Chamoli, which was ravaged by the flood caused by a glacier-linked landslip last Sunday.

Forty-one bodies were found in Chamoli, seven in Rudraprayag, and one each in Pauri Garhwal and Tehri Garhwal. Only 25 of the deceased have been identified so far. Efforts are on to divert the river’s course from the left bank to the right to aid in desilting operations. Nearly 325 engineers, officers, geologists and scientists are engaged in rescue operations. Officials are also monitoring the size of a lake that has been forming on the upper reaches of the Rishiganga as the natural course of the river has being obstructed by debris. The lake is estimated to be 350 metres long, with a dam height of 50 metres.

15 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm income mission off target||In the last year of its mission to double farmers income, the Centre admits that no actual assessment of farm income has been carried out since 2013. Ashok Dalwai, head of the committee on doubling farmers income, told The Hindu that only the implementation of strategies was being monitored, rather than actual outcomes. He cautioned that the impact of the pandemic could have a dampening effect on reaching the income target. In response to multiple pointed queries on the topic in Parliament this week, the government did not provide any details on what the base year for this goal is or what the targeted income to be achieved by the 2022 deadline was. Shiv Sena MP Krupal Balaji Tumane raised the issue in the Lok Sabha, asking what the base year was on the basis of which doubling would be calculated and if the government has fixed any income target for farmers for 2022. The Agriculture Ministry did not answer either question, instead responding with a brief on the Committee for Doubling Farmers Income, constituted in April 2016, and the strategies it recommended. In response to his request for State-wise, year-wise income data, and the annual growth percentage required to achieve the 2022 targets, the Ministry responded that the National Sample Survey Office’s last survey on agricultural households was conducted in 2013. “There has been no further assessment of the farmers income thereafter,” it said.  ‘Positive impact’ Asked whether the target can be achieved at the present annual growth rate, the government said it was “pursuing the target” adding that its “comprehensive interventions” were “having positive impact on growth of agriculture and income of farmers”. Another question in the Lok Sabha, from a group of Congress and Trinamool MPs, asking for specific details on the progress of the mission received similarly vague answers. They asked whether any annual surveys to measure farmers’ expenditure and incomes was being carried out and were pointed back to the same NSSO survey data, with the added detail that “the average monthly income per agricultural household from all sources was estimated to be Rs. 6,426.” Asked how the Centre intended to monitor progress without such surveys, they were told that the “government has constituted an ‘Empowered Body’ to review and monitor the progress”. Senior Agriculture Ministry official Ashok Dalwai chaired the committee responsible for framing strategies, as well as the body to monitor progress. “The only methodology for assessing income is the NSSO surveys. We have to rely on them for that. Instead, we are monitoring the implementation of our strategies. We have identified monitorable parameters,” Dr. Dalwai said. Seven strategies had been identified: improvement in crop and livestock productivity, savings in production cost through efficient use of resources, higher cropping intensity and diversification towards high-value crops, better price realisation and a shift to non-farm jobs. “We presume that if the State and the Central governments are making progress on these strategies, then incomes also must be increasing,” Dr. Dalwai said. His committee had used the NSSO’s 2013 income data and extrapolated it for 2015-16, chosen as the base year. The base income in that year was estimated at more than Rs. 97,000 per annum. “We estimated that the target income should be about Rs. 2 lakh per annum, from both farm and non-farm income, by 2022,” he said, He was cautiously optimistic about reaching the target, though he warned that COVID-19 could have an impact. “The NSSO is now carrying out another survey... now we have to take into account the impact of corona also,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-income-mission-off-target/article33837695.ece
15 February 2021||KOCHI,||Projects launched in Kochi will spur growth: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the five projects launched in Kochi would strengthen the growth trajectory of the country. Mr. Modi dedicated to nation the Propylene Derivative Petrochemical Project of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, launched the roll on, roll off vessels to be operated between Bolgatty and Wellingdon Island and inaugurated the Sagarika International Cruise Terminal. He laid the foundation stone for the reconstruction of the South Coal Berth at Cochin Port, besides opening the Marine Engineering Training Institute. Mr. Modi said the projects would go a long way in creating an Atmanirbhar Bharat. The Prime Minister urged the people to travel locally and explore places. He suggested that start-ups consider developing projects for the tourism sector. A large number of people were writing about local tourist destinations and posting pictures as they could not travel abroad due to COVID-19. Besides generating additional revenue, it would connect youth to the culture of the country, he said. Mr. Modi urged those in the start-up sector to think about innovative tourism-related products. In the World Tourism Index ranking, India moved from the 65th position to 34th in the past five years, he said. The Prime Minister assured the Indian diaspora in Gulf countries that the government was committed to their welfare. Many of the Gulf countries responded positively to the call for the release of Indians imprisoned in jails, he said. During the past few years, many Indians were released from prisons. The government would always speak up for such people. The Gulf kingdoms responded to the personal appeals and took special care of Indian community there. They were giving priority to the return of Indians to the region, he said. Mr. Modi said he had the opportunity to interact with the Indian diaspora in the Gulf countries during his visit to the UAE, Qatar and Bahrain. Around 50 lakh people were brought back to the country under the Vande Bharat programme and a large number of them were Keralites, he said. Mr. Modi said the Union Budget had devoted significant resources and schemes that would benefit Kerala, including the next phase of Kochi Metro. The metro network had come up successfully and had set a good example of progressive work practices and professionalism, he said. In his address, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the State government was always willing to cooperate with the Centre for the improvement of industry, tourism and infrastructure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/projects-launched-in-kochi-will-spur-growth-pm/article33837660.ece
15 February 2021||Srinagar,||Farooq, Omar under ‘house arrest’ on Pulwama anniversary||National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah and vice-president Omar Abdullah were placed under “house arrest” in Srinagar on Sunday, on the second anniversary of the Pulwama attack in 2019 that left 40 CRPF jawans dead. Posting pictures of police vehicles barricading the gates of the house on Gupkar Road, Mr. Omar Abdullah said, “This is the “ naya /new J&K after Aug 2019. We get locked up in our homes with no explanation. It’s bad enough they’ve locked my father (a sitting MP) and me in our home, they’ve locked my sister and her kids in their home as well.” He said the restrictions were placed “without any explanation”. “Your new model of democracy means that we are kept in our homes, but on top of that the staff that works in the house aren’t being allowed in and then you are surprised that I’m still angry and bitter,” Mr. Abdullah said. In a joint statement, top NC leaders termed the police’s measures “arbitrary” and a “gross intrusion of fundamental rights”. “It only exposes the iron fist approach towards J&K and gross violation of human rights ... The undue measure marks a new low in the curtailment of fundamental rights of people of J&K. The measures reveal abnormal is the new normal in this part of the world,” the statement read. A police spokesman, however, said the move was part of the elaborate security measures put in place on the anniversary of the Pulwama attack. “There were also directions that no road opening party will be carried out on the ground. Due to adverse inputs, movement of VIPs and protected persons was discouraged and all concerned were informed in advance not to plan a tour today,” the spokesman said. However, Mr. Abdullah said he was not informed by the police. The entire Gupkar Road, housing senior politicians and officials, was closed for traffic on Sunday. IED found Meanwhile, an improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered near the general bus stand in Jammu. “There were inputs that terror groups were planning an attack on the anniversary of Pulwama attack. Last night, we arrested a person named Sohail and recovered 6-6.5 kg of IED from his possession,” said Mukesh Singh, Inspector General of Police, Jammu. He said Sohail, a student of a nursing college in Chandigarh, was instructed by Pakistan-based outfit Al Badr to place the explosive in Jammu. “Another person, who was arrested on Sunday, hails from Pulwama district and was told to place the explosive in three to four locations,” the police said. The police added that the arrested youth, Qazi Waseem, in Chandigarh, was also aware of this matter. “We have also arrested a person named Abid Nabi,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farooq-omar-under-house-arrest-on-pulwama-anniversary/article33837674.ece
15 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm unions call Disha Ravi arrest an ‘intimidation tactic’||Protesting farm unions condemned the arrest of Bengaluru-based climate activist Disha Ravi, who has been charged in connection with a “toolkit” to coordinate support for their protest. “They are charging her for sedition. This is a very serious issue. This government is bent on punishing people who are in support of farmers,” said Darshan Pal Singh, president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, and a senior leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the joint front of unions which has been negotiating with the government. Truck owners get notices Noting that truck owners transporting raw materials for the agitation had also been slapped with notices, he said, “This is part of a wider pattern of intimidation. I don’t think it will impact us negatively, but some people may think twice about extending support.” In an official statement, the SKM said it condemned the arrest of the 21-year-old activist and “demanded her immediate unconditional release”. Another SKM leader, Kavitha Kuruganti, who is also based in Bengaluru and is involved in environmental activism and sustainable farming, said she had seen the work of Ms. Ravi’s organisation. “They are active in colleges, and holding town halls. This is a very strong intimidation tactic launched against young activists to stifle their democratic rights,” she said. “And it is atrocious that such action was taken because of a toolkit, which is simply something that alerts citizens to what they can do to support the farmers.” She dismissed any conflict between environmental activists like Ms. Ravi, most of whom want to end stubble burning, and the protesting farmers, who demanded changes in an ordinance against the practice. Finding a solution “Farmers groups recognise that stubble burning is a bigger problem for them than for air pollution in Delhi. They are only asking for penal provisions to be removed. Criminalising farmers is not the solution, as there are better ways to incentivise change,” said Ms. Kuruganti. “I think youth in the climate movement recognise that economically viable farming is what will lead to more sustainable practices,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-unions-call-disha-ravi-arrest-an-intimidation-tactic/article33837697.ece
15 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Kerala NCP MLA to form new party||The political drama that unfolded in Pala ever since the entry of Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)] in the ruling coalition has finally reached its climax with Mani C. Kappan, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA of Pala, formally joining the United Democratic Front (UDF) on Sunday. After a massive roadshow through the streets of Pala town in the morning, Mr. Kappan reached the venue of the Aiswarya Kerala Yatra led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and was accorded a rousing reception. Besides Mr. Chennithala, almost all top leaders of the UDF, including Oommen Chandy, P.J. Joseph, and P.K. Kunhalikutty, were present at the venue. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Kappan extended his gratitude to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for their wholehearted support to him during his tenure as the legislator of Pala. He also listed out the development projects worth Rs. 462 crore that had been implemented in Pala over the past 16 months. Flays Mani, Vasavan Further, he unleashed a scathing attack on KC(M) chairman Jose K. Mani and CPI(M) district unit secretary V.N. Vasavan ‘for standing in way of Pala’s development.’ “With the entry of Jose K. Mani, the fall of LDF has begun. In fact, whoever associates with Mr. Mani is bound to perish sooner than later,” Mr. Kappan said, amidst huge applause. The speech of Mr. Chennithala, meanwhile, focused mostly on election-related issues such as the problems faced by rubber farmers and various Christian communities. He promised to raise the rubber price stabilisation fund to Rs. 250 and initiate a slew of development projects in Pala. Resign from party Earlier in the day, Mr. Kappan and a few State-level leaders of the NCP had tendered their resignation from the party membership. Among those who have joined Mr. Kappan included NCP State secretaries Salim P. Mathew and Babu Thomas, besides the party treasurer Babu Karthikeyan. Meanwhile, a preliminary meeting of the NCP breakaway faction on Sunday evening decided to float a new outfit with Mr. Kappan as its chairman and Mr. Karthikeyan as convener. It further entrusted a 10-member committee to frame the party constitution and decide on the party flag and related aspects. The new outfit is slated to constitute district committees by February 28. The members of the new party, which will initially assume the name NCP Kerala, will step down from all the posts awarded by the LDF government, including corporations. To retain legislatorship Mr. Kappan, however, will continue to remain as a legislator and contest the next election from Pala as a UDF candidate. “Those demanding my resignation should instead focus on the KC(M) legislators and Parliament members, who had won the elections as UDF candidates,” Mr. Kappan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-ncp-mla-to-form-new-party/article33837663.ece
15 February 2021||New Delhi,||In Bengal, Left-Cong. talks meander||The inordinate delay in finalising the seat-sharing arrangement between the Left Front and the Congress is increasing anxiety among workers of both sides as the election to the West Bengal Assembly draws close. Three rounds of meetings have already taken place, and the fourth is slated for February 16. As of now, sources said, the Left parties are ready to cede 92 seats to the Congress, but the Congress has been insisting on a more “respectful” figure of 100-plus seats. The Left is eager to accommodate the newly formed Indian Secular Front (ISF) of Furfura Sharif’s chief patron Pirzada Abbas Siddiqui. While it is ready to give seats from its kitty to the ISF, it wants the Congress to contribute too. The Left-Congress alliance is planning to hold a joint rally on February 28 to begin its campaign. Whether a galaxy of leaders from Delhi, including former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, will be present or not will depend on the amicable settlement of a seat-sharing formula. The Trinamool Congress and the BJP have already stolen a march on the alliance in the campaigning. The BJP launched its Poriborton Yatra on February 6, and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already led 11 public meetings. The delay exacerbates the problem for the Left-Congress alliance, which has been boxed out by both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress, and is struggling to make it a three-corner fight by projecting itself as the third alternative. It was decided that each party would get to keep the seats it won or was the runner-up for in 2016. This formula no longer holds good, since in the past five years, many legislators have crossed over to the Trinamool Congress or the BJP. Of the 44 seats that the Congress won in 2016, only around 25 remain with the party. The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) has also had desertions. A section of the Congress is deeply unhappy with the delay. “The seat discussions should have been locked by January 31. There is no pro-Left or pro-Congress wave. We should have given time to individual candidates to begin their campaigns,” another leader said. The Left is equally apprehensive. “The coming together of the Left-Democratic-Secular parties had instilled this good vibe. The unnecessary delay is causing anxiety among our cadres, and unless a decision is taken quickly, it could dampen the mood,” former Lok Sabha member and senior CPI(M) leader Mohammad Salim told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-bengal-left-cong-talks-meander/article33837676.ece
15 February 2021||New Delhi,||Disengagement with China a surrender of rights: Antony||The disengagement in the Pangong Tso area and the Galwan Valley and the creation of a buffer zone are a “surrender of India’s rights at the moment”, former Defence Minister A.K. Antony said on Sunday. Mr. Antony cautioned that if China played mischief, it could help Pakistan capture Siachen as the “buffer zone” in the Galwan Valley would prevent Indian troops from accessing the Karakoram range. ‘Two-front war’ Addressing a press conference, the senior Congress leader said it was a “betrayal” of the country to have a meagre hike in defence budget, especially since India was facing a two-front war-like situation. Mr. Antony alleged that the government did not increase the defence budget to “appease” China and give a message of no confrontation. “To appease China, we have agreed to disengagement on China’s terms,” he alleged. Mr. Antony said it was sad that the Narendra Modi government was not giving priority to national security at a time when China was getting belligerent and Pakistan continued to promote terrorism. He said disengagement was good to reduce tension but not at the cost of national security. “Both disengagements in Galwan and Pangong Tso are a surrender ... We are surrendering our rights,” he said, adding that the Galwan Valley was not disputed even in 1962 and was always Indian territory. “Disengagement and buffer zone means surrender of our land at the moment,” he noted and asked the government to spell out when it would revert back to the status quo ante as on April 2020. When armed forces are demanding support and substantial increase in the defence budget, the current budget has made a meagre and insufficient increase of only 1.48% , he said. “It is a betrayal of the country. The government has let down our armed forces. The government is not paying proper attention to national security,” Mr. Antony said. The Congress leader said the government should always consult leaders of all political parties before taking such a decision and must keep national security in mind.  To appease China, we have agreed to disengagement on China’s terms A.K.

15 February 2021||New Delhi,||G-23 leaders upset over being ‘left out’||As the Congress gets into election mode for the next round of Assembly elections in crucial States such as Assam, Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, there is growing restlessness among a section of the group of 23 (G-23) dissenters for “being excluded from the consultation process”. Some members of the G-23 — leaders who had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi last August to seek a revamp of the party — have been given responsibilities in the poll-bound States. Mukul Wasnik has been made an observer for Assam and M. Veerappa Moily for Tamil Nadu; Shashi Tharoor has been given the key responsibility of taking feedback for a people’s manifesto in Kerala. But some leaders insist that the “sense of drift” continues, and decisions such as appointing District Congress and Pradesh Congress committee chiefs are still “dictated” by Delhi. Azad’s retirement They cite the appointment of the office-bearers of the Maharashtra PCC as an “example”. Ghulam Nabi Azad’s retirement from the Rajya Sabha and bypassing Anand Sharma, current Deputy Leader in the Upper House, for the post of the Leader of the Opposition are also sore points. Though there is some talk of bringing back Mr. Azad to the Rajya Sabha from Kerala — a proposal that has divided the State unit — key G-23 members allege that it was not done earlier only to ensure that Mallikarjun Kharge replaces Mr. Azad as the Leader of the Opposition. “There will certainly be a fallout as we think the leadership has violated the spirit of the understanding,” a member of the G-23 told The Hindu on Sunday. Not only did Prime Minister Narendra Modi refer to the G-23 in reply to the Motion of Thanks debate, the party’s internal differences with regard to the parliamentary strategy were clearly visible. While Mr. Azad-led Opposition agreed to a government proposal of clubbing the farm law discussions with the debate quickly, in the Lok Sabha, where former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took the lead in strategising, the party disrupted proceedings for almost a week. The G-23 leaders said whether it is the strategy on farm laws or crucial issues such as disengagement with China, “there has not been adequate consultative process”. “Arbitrary decisions continue to be taken and it will surely have a ripple effect,” the member said, indicating fresh moves from the G-23 after the Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/g-23-leaders-upset-over-being-left-out/article33837681.ece
15 February 2021||Srinagar/Delhi,||After lifting 4G ban, Centre plans trip of envoys to J&K||A week after restoring 4G Internet connectivity to Jammu and Kashmir, the the Centre is preparing to take a group of diplomats to Srinagar and Jammu to “showcase” the situation in the Union Territory, officials confirmed to The Hindu . According to the sources, the visit being planned in the next few weeks will have nearly 20 envoys and diplomats including from the European Union who have been invited by the External Affairs Ministry. A final decision on the visit and the composition of the delegation is still awaited. The visit will be the third official one by foreign diplomats to Jammu and Kashmir since the Centre’s decision to amend Article 370 and divide the erstwhile State into two Union Territories on August 5, 2019. A delegation of Members of the European Parliament visited the Union Territory in October 2019, but the trip ran into controversies over its sponsorship and was described by the government as a “personal” visit. During the coming two-day visit which is still in the planning stage, sources said, the foreign delegation is expected to meet government officials, newly elected local District Development Council (DDC) representatives, business chambers and members of civil society. An official said the Jammu and Kashmir Administration would also make a presentation on the recently held DDC polls as a “major opening of political space” in Jammu and Kashmir as well as the restoration of high-speed Internet, which was welcomed by the Biden administration in the U.S. It is unclear whether the group would meet former Chief Ministers Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah. Previous teams were able to meet only members of the J&K Apni Party, as most of the other political leaders were in detention at the time. The two delegations taken by the government in January and February 2020 included Ambassadors of the United States, Germany, Norway and the European Union, as well as those from countries in South America, South East Asia and Africa. The timing of the upcoming visit will be important as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the EU-India summit in Portugal on May 8, and the group’s assessment of the situation on the ground is expected to be included in the discussions. Over the past 18 months, the European Union has issued a number of statements expressing concern over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. In November 2020, after a videoconference with Pakistani officials and European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, an EU statement said that it was “following the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir closely”. “[Mr. Borrell] underlined the need for restraint, de-escalation of tensions and resolution of the dispute through dialogue and constructive political and diplomatic engagement,” the statement added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-revoking-4g-ban-centre-plans-trip-of-envoys-to-jk/article33837683.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Scheduled Tribe seats for Ph.D. programmes in IIT-Bombay remain unfilled||None of the 26 departments in IIT-Bombay managed to fill seats reserved for Scheduled Tribe students in Ph.D. programmes between 2015 and 2019, according to data obtained through Right to Information queries. The data obtained by the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle, a student collective in IIT-Bombay, showed that 25 of the 26 departments failed to fill Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Scheduled Caste (SC) quota as well. Eleven of the 26 departments did not admit a single student under the ST category in the period under question. Of the 2,874 admissions for which data were provided by the institution, 71.6% went to General Category (GC) students, which in terms of the IITs predominantly constituted students from historically privileged communities; 19.2% went to the OBCs, 7.5% to the SCs and 1.6% to the STs. Reservation policy demands a minimum allocation of 27% to the OBCs, 15% to the SCs and 7.5% to the STs. Skewed entry In 13 of the 26 departments, more than 75% of the seats went to students under the GC. The data showed the acceptance rate, which refers to the number of students selected for every 100 applicants, to be lower for students from reserved categories than those from GC. While the acceptance rate was 3.8% for GC, it was 3.1% for OBCs and STs and 2.5% for SCs. In 16 of the 26 departments, this skew in acceptance rate was more pronounced with SC and ST students having acceptance rates at half or lower than those for GC applicants. For instance, electrical engineering (EE) and mechanical engineering (ME) departments had the highest number of ST applicants. While two of the 148 ST applicants got selected in EE with an acceptance rate of 1.4%, the acceptance rate was 3.8% for GC. In ME, not a single ST candidate from 110 applicants got selected, whereas 168 students were selected from 4,590 applicants under the GC with an acceptance rate of 3.7%. In the Energy Sciences and Engineering department, only five of the 610 SC applicants got selected with an acceptance rate of 0.8%. In contrast, 82 from 3,902 GC applicants got selected with an acceptance rate of 2.1%. Computer Science was one of the few departments that recorded dismal acceptance rates across OBC, SC and ST categories. Only five from 797 OBC applicants, four from 495 SC applicants and one from 78 ST applicants were selected with an acceptance rate of 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.3% respectively. In contrast 69 applicants from 2,997 GC applicants were selected with an acceptance rate of 2.3%. The Centre for Studies in Resource Engineering (CSRE) and SJM School of Management (SJMSM) were the two departments that did not admit a single student from among SC and ST applicants. The two departments together selected 74 students from among 1,780 applicants under GC. However, none were selected from 313 SC and ST applicants. Environment Science and Engineering (ESE) and Centre for Policy Studies were the only departments to fill seats reserved for OBC and SC students. ESE and Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) came closer to filling seats reserved for STs. HSS also had marginally better acceptance rate for OBC, SC and ST applicants. The data also indicated that more students from marginalised communities were rejected at the interview stage. A comparison of the proportion of students from different categories showed that their proportion remained fairly the same at the application stage and the interview stage. Overall, around 12% of applicants got rejected; the remaining 88% made it to the interview stage. However, among those selected post the interviews, while the percentage of GC increased to 71.6%, the proportion of students from all other categories went down. GC candidates accounted for 64.8%, OBCs 22.2%, SCs 11.1% and STs 1.9% in both application and interview stages. However, among those selected post the interviews, while the percentage of GC increased to 71.6%, the proportion of students from all other categories went down. In response to queries on the data, the IIT Bombay administration said that the selection process was fair and transparent. Institute’s view “Lower cut-offs and extra efforts are made to take candidates as per reservation categories to fill the seats,” a spokesperson for the institute said. On the acceptance rate being different, the spokesperson said, “IITs have very high expectations of our student input, which is needed to carry out research towards a Ph.D.” “While we do get sufficient candidates in certain departments, in some other departments, students of the required calibre tend to take up industry jobs rather than join for a Ph.D. which has extra uncertainties and lower income levels during Ph.D. and in some areas even post Ph.D,” the spokesperson added.

15 February 2021||SANGAREDDY,||Short film on farm woes tugs at heartstrings||Last monsoon, two farmers had been washed away in the flood waters while trying to save their crops in Solapur district of Maharashtra. The same district has witnessed a high suicide rate among farmers. Heart-rending stories of farmers’ struggles were put together in a short film by Vishal Vijay Garad, a lecturer and son of a farmer couple. He owns five acres of land in Pangri village of Solapur district, but his parents Vijay and Mohini are active farmers who grow jowar, wheat and soyabean. Mr Garad has heard and seen innumerable stories of farmers incurring heavy losses due to unseasonal or incessant rain. He blames the erratic rain pattern on climate change taking place due to wrong policies adopted by successive governments. About 10 farmers in Solapur have died by suicide in the past year, he claims. With distressing stories playing on his mind, Mr Garad decided to write, direct and act in a short film titled ‘Buchad’ which means all harvested crops piled up at one place. In the film, he has played the character of Bhim Pawar, a soyabean farmer. His crop is almost ready for harvesting, but is washed away due to heavy rains following floods. While trying to save the crop, Bhim Pawar also gets washed away. The film ends with him floating in water, firmly gripping the soyabean crop in hand. There was not a single dry eye as the last scene of Buchad played out during the Jai Chandiram Memorial 3rd National Community Media Film Festival at Krishi Vignan Kendra run by Deccan Development Society at Didgi near Zaheerabad on Saturday. Not surprising, it won the best short film award. Chandrika, a young girl who was part of audience, broke down during the film and said her parents too had suffered due to crop loss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/film-on-farm-distress-tugs-at-heartstrings/article33837907.ece
15 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Nutritional support for elderly in Kerala||The Social Justice Department has decided to provide food kits to the elderly as part of a nutritional support scheme. Vayoposhanam will be piloted as part of the 2019-20 action plan of the Centrally-sponsored National Action Plan for Senior Citizens under which an amount of Rs. 1 crore has been allocated for all-round development of the elderly. The action plan sets aside Rs. 42 lakh for the nutritional support scheme. As lack of balanced diet and good nutrition cause loss of muscle mass, bone density and other ailments in the elderly, the food kits are aimed at increasing immunity, especially that of financially backward elderly people, those living alone or having none to take care of them. One food kit will be provided for two months to the eligible elderly. The State Nutrition Board has provided a list of nutrient-dense food items to be included in the kit. These items, such as rice, ragi, black gram, soya chunks, ground nuts, almonds, sesame balls, ghee, and coconut oil, will be made available from Supplyco. Recipes too Apart from food kits, recipes that can be made using the food supplied in the kit will also be given. A food kit for a beneficiary for two months will cost Rs. 1,639. The programme will be piloted in the Sayamprabha Home that are run with the department’s financial assistance in 12 districts. Nearly 2,500 elderly people who have registered with the Sayamprabha Home will be given the kit after beneficiary selection. The selection will be done by the home monitoring committees. To be eligible, the elderly should belong to the below poverty line (BPL) category. Those living alone will be given priority in the distribution of kits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nutritional-support-for-elderly-in-kerala/article33838075.ece
15 February 2021||GUWAHATI,||Congress will not implement CAA, says Rahul at Assam rally||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his party will not implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and promised to hike the daily wage of tea plantation workers if his party comes to power in Assam. Launching the Congress campaign at Sivasagar in eastern Assam for the coming Assembly election, he also took a swipe at the BJP for trying to divide Assam so that “business tycoons from Gujarat” took its wealth away. Mr. Gandhi recalled former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi as his guru who acquainted him with several key issues including the “divisive” CAA. Pointing to the crossed CAA printed on the Assamese “gamosa” around his neck, he said, “Listen, hum do hamaare do, come what may, we will not allow the CAA!” Mr. Gandhi had coined hum do for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah and hamaare do for corporate giants Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Deciding factor He devoted much of his speech to the tea workers, who are a deciding factor in a third of the 126 Assembly seats. He said their daily wage would be more than doubled. “What can you buy with Rs. 167? We will add Rs. 200 to this figure and take away Rs. 2 to fix Rs. 365 as your daily wage,” he told the crowd mostly comprising tea workers at the rally near a historic field where Mr. Modi had campaigned for the BJP a few days ago. The focus of the political parties has been on the workers. The BJP-led government has wooed them with cash and incentive schemes besides promising to hike their wages within a few days. Mr. Gandhi also promised to protect the principles of the Assam Accord signed between the All Assam Students’ Union and the Centre in 1985 at the end of a violent six-year agitation. “Assam has the issue of illegal immigration but the people of the State have the capability to resolve them through dialogue. The Congress will defend and protect the principles of the accord,” he said, referring to the delay in implementing a vital clause that guarantees constitutional safeguards for the indigenous people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-will-not-implement-caa-says-rahul-at-assam-rally/article33837690.ece
15 February 2021||Bengaluru,||JD(S) will contest Karnataka bypolls||The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Sunday announced that the party would filed candidates in the byelections to Maski, Basavakalyan, and Sindagi Assembly constituencies. This comes close on the heels of party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda’s statement that the party would not field candidates, which was later construed by Congress leaders as a decision that would help the BJP. He clarified that owing to paucity of funds to fight the byelections, the party had decided not to field candidates and the same had been announced by Mr. Gowda. “There have been allegations that we were not contesting the byelections to help the BJP. We had not discussed the issue with Mr. Gowda. Let there be no confusion. We have decided to field our candidates.” Asking party workers not to heed to rumours thatthe JD(S) would tie-up with the BJP for the 2023 Assembly elections, he said the party would not have any understanding with any national party. “We will contest all the 224 seats on our own. Do not bother about money. If need be, we will raise loans to fund party activities,” he said. Advisory role for Gowda Meanwhile, the party’s debacle in the Sira byelection had spurred octogenarian Mr. Gowda to take up the responsibility of strengthening the party. However, on Sunday, the former Prime Minister said he would be taking an advisory role since he was not in a position to travel across the State. “I can only guide you and I can only give suggestions. I cannot travel everywhere. We have to prove that our party is not behind in the ensuing taluk panchayat and zilla panchayat elections,” the former Prime Minister told party workers and leaders at a meeting to felicitate the party-backed gram panchayat members who were elected recently. He said JD(S) legislative party leader, Mr. H.D. Kumaraswamy, and party’s State president H.K. Kumaraswamy were preparing a blueprint to infuse life into the party. “I will only guide the party. I can only give suggestions because I cannot travel.” He also said that though the party had the power, it lacked unity. “There are differences of opinion, but those differences have to be overcome.” On the party’s preparation for the taluk and zilla panchayat elections,he said, “Seat distribution can result in small inconvenience. Do not get disturbed. We should work unitedly to get maximum seats in the elections. Only you can save the party,” he said. The former Minister Bandeppa Kashempur said the party was working towards winning 120 seats. “Enough of being dependent on other parties. We have to have power on our own after the next Assembly elections.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jds-will-contest-karnataka-bypolls/article33837652.ece
15 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Rock mass of landslide fell on frozen stream causing disaster’||The Uttarakhand landslide caused huge loss of life and property and while, the rescue and rehabilitation efforts are under way, city-based National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) Director V.M. Tiwari calls for mission mode projects to map landslide-prone regions especially in glaciers in this exclusive interview: What could have led to the Uttarakhand disaster and why are we still unable to pinpoint the precise cause? Based on satellite image analysis, and other observations it appears that bedrock landslide occurred at a higher elevation on the morning of February 7. The rock mass of the landslide has fallen on the frozen stream bed. That triggered the mass movement of partially saturated debris flow — sediment, ice, and melted ice/snow — and thus water flow was less than flash flood observed during 2013. However, investigations are underway whether this rock slide was triggered by a natural phenomenon such as heavy snowfall or seepage of water in the fractured zone from glacier melts over the time etc. Could the disaster have been prevented or it is one of those unpredictable natural events? Yes, but the prediction of exact time and location is not possible with the present state of understanding in the Himalayan region. To prevent any disaster from natural phenomena such as landslides and earthquakes it is necessary to study these processes by launching integrated scientific studies and instrumental observations constantly. It is necessary to undertake ‘mission mode’ projects for mapping the landslide prone regions, especially in glaciers for understanding such phenomena. Is it possible to have sensors and modern technological tools to give early warning signals like perhaps, for a tsunami to give some kind of alerts? Yes, we need to develop early warning systems using modern technological tools. There are some indirect indicators that provide information at far field sites, but need to be devised for the Himalayan region. Such glaciers or landslides are natural phenomena of tectonic plate shifts/glacier movements/melt or could it be the result of large scale deforestation plus man burrowing through the mountains for building infrastructures like roads, canals or power projects? It is difficult to pinpoint a reason for the event which occurred recently. Your question addresses a suite of phenomena such as plate tectonics. Yes, if there was no plate collision the Himalayas would not have evolved. If there were no Himalayas we would not have had glaciers. One must pause and understand that the Himalayan tectonics is still active since the Indian plate is still colliding with Eurasian plate and the mountains after attaining a certain height the mountain building activity moves to a new place. I agree that a sustainable science based action plan is the need of the hour. Is studying glacial movement a tough subject and very different from the quake or monitoring of the earth crust? Each of them has its own challenges and especially terrains like the Himalayas. However, there are also space techniques in conjunction with ground-based measurements to study the glacial movement. Is it possible to artificially cause such a landslide to cause large scale destruction? Yes, you know we do blasting for rock mining but for such a large slide to have occurred in Uttarakhand, it requires bigger energy to move. How is NGRI assisting the government in the rehabilitation measures? What is the way forward? First priority for the event was a rescue operation. Therefore within 48 hours, we undertook heliborne geophysical 3D mapping in the Tapovan project area to identify the aerial extent of possible slush penetration in the tunnels. A report was submitted to the authority concerned. This information would help the authorities to plan for rescue and rehabilitation. Further, using geophysical instruments we are trying to understand the rock slide/snow avalanche phenomena which shall have a direct application for the design of early warning systems.  One must pause and understand that the Himalayan tectonics is still active since the Indian plate is still colliding with Eurasian plate. V. M.

15 February 2021||BHOPAL,||Fossils of ‘Dickinsonia’ found at Bhimbetka||Researchers have discovered three 550-million-year-old fossils of the earliest living animal, ‘Dickinsonia’, on the roof of one of the UNESCO-recognised sites, Bhimbetka Rock Shelters, about 40 km from here. One can identify the fossils from the white leaf-like patches with a central vertebra (central midrib) and connecting veins. While one fossil is 17 inches long, the other two are much smaller. The new discoveries, published in a research journal from Elsevier,  can be seen right at the beginning of the ‘Auditorium Cave’, the first of such caves at Bhimbetka, located about 3.5 metres above the ground. Geological Survey of India’s Bhopal in-charge Tapan Pal, who had come to visit the site upon getting information from the journal, told The Hindu at Bhimbetka that they were the only such fossils available in the country, and were similar to the one seen in south Australia. “This is further proof of the similar paleoenvironments, including eolian, tsunamite, and intertidal bedforms. This new occurrence confirms assembly of Gondwanaland by the 550 Ma, but not reconstructions adjusted for true polar wander,” the five authors of the article said in the journal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fossils-of-dickinsonia-found-in-bhimbetka/article33837654.ece

Two years ago, the Pulwama attack happened. We pay homage to all the martyrs we lost in that attack. We are proud of our security forces. Their bravery will continue to inspire generations,” he said. Quoting from Tamil poet Subramania Bharati, Mr. Modi said India had undertaken a massive effort to become self-reliant in the defence sector. “One of the two defence corridors is in Tamil Nadu. The corridor has already received investment commitments of over Rs. 8,100 crore. Today, I am proud to dedicate to the country one more warrior to protect our frontiers. I am proud to handover the indigenously designed and manufactured main battle tank Arjun Mk-1A. It also uses indigenous ammunition. Tamil Nadu is already the leading automobile manufacturing hub of India,” Mr. Modi said. The Arjun Mk-1A has superior firepower, high mobility, excellent protection and crew comfort, with 14 major upgrades from Arjun Mk-1, according to the CVRDE. The indent for 118 of these tanks would be placed shortly with the Heavy Vehicle Factory (HVF) at Avadi near Chennai. The Army is expected to soon approach the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) for approval after which it would place the indent for 118 tanks at a cost of Rs. 8,956.59 crore.Defence officials said the indent is expected to be placed before the end of this financial year on March 31.

There has never been anything like it!” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the GOP senators who voted to acquit Mr Trump, “cowardly”. Ms Pelosi, however, ruled out censuring Mr. Trump, saying it would let “everybody off the hook”. Ms. Pelosi criticised Republican leader Mitch McConnell, saying the trail could not go ahead while Mr. Trump was in office because of the way Mr. McConnell — then the Majority Leader — had not permitted a speedy trial before Mr. Trump left office and after the House had impeached him on a charge of incitement of insurrection. Mr. McConnell said he had voted to acquit Mr. Trump because “former Presidents are not eligible for conviction.” However, shortly after the vote, Mr. McConnell said Mr. Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking” the January 6 attack.  The seven GOP Senators who voted to convict Mr Trump were Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy and Pat Toomey.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/senate-acquits-trump-of-incitement/article33837670.ece

The prosecutor added that a mobile phone was recovered from her, but she had deleted all the data from it. In her defence, Ms. Ravi said she had just edited two lines in the “toolkit” and that she was in support of the farmers and was influenced by their protests as farmers provide food. Ms. Ravi broke down after the magistrate ordered her remand but remained silent as the police took her away from the court. According to the police, the activist is an editor of the “Toolkit Google Doc” and was a key conspirator in the document’s formulation and dissemination. It alleged that she started a WhatsApp group to make the toolkit in collaboration with pro-Khalistani organisation Poetic Justice Foundation to spread disaffection against the Indian state. “She was the one who shared the Toolkit Doc with Greta Thunberg and later asked Greta to remove the main Doc after its incriminating details accidentally got into public domain,” the police alleged. The Coalition for Environmental Justice in India, in a statement, said the young environmental activist was the latest victim of the Centre’s continuing efforts to deligitimise the ongoing farmers’ protest and the nationwide solidarity it had generated. “The act of criminalising young people for extending solidarity to a struggle that resonates with their own aspirations for a healthy and secure future, strikes as a new low,” the statement said. The signatories demanded that Disha be immediately released. Expressing his solidarity with the activist, former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “Completely atrocious! This is unwarranted harassment and intimidation. I express my full solidarity with Disha Ravi.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/22-year-old-activist-sent-to-delhi-police-custody/article33837671.ece

Unlike many countries where available vaccines are fewer than those required, India is still to exhaust its first stock of vaccines — about 160 lakh doses — that the government ordered from vaccine companies in the first week of January. Until Sunday, about 82.4 lakh healthcare and frontline workers have been inoculated with at least one dose of the vaccine. Of them, around 2.72 lakh were vaccinated on Saturday. The 82 lakh vaccinations have been conducted over 1.72 lakh vaccination sessions, suggesting that only around half the total vaccination capacity was being utilised. For nearly a week, there have been around 4 lakh inoculations a day. India's active caseload of coronavirus patients has dropped to 1.37 lakh as of Sunday or about 1.26% of India's total positive cases. About eight in 10 of the new cases are from six States. Kerala reported the highest daily new cases at 5,471 followed by Maharashtra with 3,611 and Tamil Nadu at 477.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sharp-fall-in-recipients-for-second-vaccine-dose/article33837668.ece

15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Modi unveils key projects for State||Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled several key projects for Tamil Nadu at a function held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium here on Sunday. In the presence of Governor Banwarilal Purohit and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, he opened the Chennai Metro Rail phase-I extension, completed at a cost of Rs. 3,770 crore. He also commissioned the passenger services from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar. The 9.05-km extension links north Chennai with the airport and the Central railway station. Mr. Modi also unveiled the foundation for the extension, renovation and modernisation of the Grand Anicut Canal System. The canal is important for irrigation in the Cauvery delta districts. The modernisation of this canal will be taken up at a cost of Rs. 2,640 crore. “This programme is special because we lay the foundation to modernise the 636-km-long Grand Anicut Canal System,” he said. “The impact of this is going to be very big. It will improve irrigation facilities for 2.27 lakh acres. The districts of Thanjavur and Pudukkottai will gain especially. I want to appreciate the farmers of Tamil Nadu for a record food grain production and a good use of water resources.” “For thousands of years, this Grand Anicut and its canal systems have been the lifeline of the ‘Rice Bowl’ of Tamil Nadu,” he said. “The Grand Anicut is a living testimony to our glorious past. It is also an inspiration to the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ goals.” Quotes Avvaiyar Quoting Tamil poet Avvaiyar, Mr. Modi underscored the need for water conservation. “When water levels rise, cultivation rises, people prosper and the state prospers. We have to do whatever we can to conserve water. This is not only a national issue. It is a global subject. Always remember the mantra of ‘per drop more crop’. This will help future generations,” he said. Mr. Modi also inaugurated the electrification of the 228-km single line route from Villupuram to Thanjavur, through Cuddalore and Mayiladuthurai, and the single line stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur. The Rs. 423-crore project will facilitate a free flow of traffic by obviating the need for a change of traction between Chennai Egmore and Kanniyakumari and will result in a saving of Rs. 14.61 lakh a day on fuel cost. “The Villupuram-Thanjavur-Thiruvarur electrification project will be a great boon to the delta districts. One of the major things this 228-km line will do is to ensure a faster movement of food grains,” Mr. Modi said. In his speech, Mr. Palaniswami said: “I would like to thank the Prime Minister for announcing new National Highway projects, with an investment of Rs. 1 lakh crore, and improvement of fishing harbours of Tamil Nadu in the 2021-22 Budget. These projects would be a boon to the people of my State.” He also requested the Prime Minister to provide necessary financial assistance for the Grand Anicut extension and modernisation scheme. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam spoke. Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal, Industries Minister M.C. Sampath and Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan were among those who took part at the function.

15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Procedural haggling leaves garbage piling up||Solid waste management has become challenging for the Greater Chennai Corporation owing to the tussle between conservancy inspectors and private supervisors in the wards of seven zones where the work has been outsourced. Garbage has been piling up on the premises of bulk waste generators and along the roads as private supervisors have been refusing to comply with the instructions of the Corporation’s conservancy inspectors. Once a complaint is filed by a resident on helpline 1913, it is the duty of the conservancy inspector concerned to take the initiative to get the garbage cleared. In the past, all private supervisors used to comply with the instructions of conservancy inspectors. After supervisors of the private conservancy operator Urbaser Sumeet took charge, they have stopped taking instructions from conservancy inspectors and refuse to clean garbage in areas identified by the latter, sources said. The conservancy inspectors have planned to hold a meeting on Tuesday and then meet the Commissioner the next day to complain against the private conservancy officials. It has been a practice for conservancy workers to redress the grievances of residents’ associations and party leaders about piling up of garbage. Under the new system, each ward has reported more than 10 such instances every day, sources said. For the past few months, the issues flagged by residents to conservancy inspectors have not been redressed. App rolled out The private conservancy operator has launched an app to directly attend to such complaints in the zones of Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Sholinganallur, Perungudi and Valasaravakkam, they point out. Former councillors stress the need for monitoring by conservancy inspectors in these zones. “The conservancy inspectors are a bridge between the residents and the private operator. Without their monitoring the work, the private conservancy operator will not be able to resolve civic issues reported by the public,” said S. Mangala Raj, former councillor. Corporation Chief Engineer N. Mahesan said the civic body would continue to use the services of conservancy inspectors in the privatised zones. “They will be monitoring all micro compost centres and resource recovery centres and other wet and dry waste processing plants. Conservancy inspectors will carry out daily monitoring of source segregation and door-to-door collection and overall monitoring of conservancy activities in the ward,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/procedural-haggling-leaves-garbage-piling-up/article33837818.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||5 years on, Metro reaches Wimco Nagar||As the first service of Metro train started from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar on Sunday, several excited commuters entered the trains to take the journey they have been waiting for the past five years. Behind the 9-km Washermenpet-Wimco Nagar stretch is a story of struggle, say activists in north Chennai. “It was not in the original plan. We conducted human chains, protests, hunger strikes and met several politicians to remind them that these areas required a good mass transport system. We are thrilled to take the train today,” said Ernest Paul of North Chennai People’s Rights Federation. The foundation stone for the Metro phase-I extension line was laid five years ago. Federation co-convener T. Rajkumar said the areas along the stretch are home to working class and business communities. “Many residents are traders who travel to areas like Koyambedu. Similarly, people working in educational institutions, government and private companies will be keen on travelling by it,” he says. S. Mala, a resident of Tollgate, regularly commutes from Wimco Nagar to the city. She stepped into the Metro for the first time with her friends, looking visibly happy. “We would love to travel daily. But we still do not know what the fares are and we can travel only if we can afford it,” she says. The trains ran packed on Sunday as Metro offered free ride after 2 p.m.The real patronage will be known after some days as the fares are as high as Rs. 70.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/5-years-on-metro-reaches-wimco-nagar/article33837829.ece

Today, she is a proud employee issuing tickets and answering the queries of the commuters at the New Washermenpet Metro station. Vinithra Devi is one of the 13 enthusiastic transgender persons working for the Chennai Metro for the first time. “We want to make the best of this opportunity after enduring years of suffering. For someone who felt engulfed in darkness, this feels like a ray of hope. We will cling to it and go forward with pride,” she says, with a beaming smile. Gajakrishnan, 27, who was a State-level cricket player and national-level basketball player, says many attempted to demoralise him. Being jobless, he was exacerbated. “This almost seems surreal. When people look at us and our work, it will encourage and inspire more from our fraternity a great deal,” he says. Bhavani, V. Kanimozhi and S. Bhargavi say that from facing harassment to discrimination, they have seen it all, and now are looking forward to doing this job because they can interact with people directly. “After this, we are sure many will look up to us. And we will feel satisfied because we are helping and having a good interaction with the public. We are grateful to Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. and KCIC that hired us,” Ms. Bhavani says. An engineering graduate, Arun Karthick, 26, says he went through years of struggle doing part-time jobs. “From surviving alone to fighting all odds, I feel accomplished to have landed in this job. I only hope people accept us for what we are and not discriminate against us,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-metro-hires-13-transgender-persons/article33837833.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work to widen road awaits Forest Department nod||Work to widen a stretch along the 21 km-long Chengalpattu-Thiruporur road is awaiting sanction from the Forest Department. The rest of the road has been widened from a two-lane to four-lane facility. K. Sivaraman, advocate and long-time resident of Thiruporur, said the road runs through two stretches of forest land. Several roads in Thiruporur and Thirukazhukundram blocks run through forest areas and these stretches are not laid or repaired on a regular basis. “These are the Kattur-Chembakkam road, Chembakkam-Chengalpattu road and Saaalur-Ponpadhirkoodam road. The Highways Department and the Forest Department must sit down and sort out the issues and ensure such roads are repaired and relaid regularly,” he said. Sources in the Highways Department said that permission to lay paver blocks along the existing road had been sought in a 3 km stretch. The four-lane-wide road took a lot of traffic off the GST road during Pongal. K. Ganesan, a resident of Thiruporur recalled that some 15 years ago the road was narrow and filled with potholes. “It was then made into two-lane and now it has become four-lane wide. We welcome the work. It has a median now, which will help prevent head-on collisions,” he said. The road runs through villages including Thiruvadisoolam, Thenneri, Kottamedu, Chembakkam and Marayathur. However, it does not have lighting since these are all village panchayats and do not have funds. A resident of Chembakkam said the Highways Department could perhaps think of installing solar powered lights.

15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Focus on urban transport will improve ease of living, says Modi||From the locally procured rolling stock to construction by Indian contractors, the focus on urban transport will boost ‘ease of living’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after opening a slew of projects in Chennai on Sunday. Flagging off the Chennai Metro Rail phase-I extension service from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar, he said that though there had been a global pandemic, the project was completed on time. Mr. Modi said Rs. 63,000 crore had been set aside for the 119-km phase-II, one of the largest projects sanctioned for any city in one go. He also inaugurated the fourth rail line from Chennai Beach to Attipattu. The 22.1-km line, laid at a cost of Rs. 293.40 crore, will help in reducing traffic from the Chennai port. “Improved connectivity brings convenience. It also helps commerce. The Chennai Beach Ennore-Attipattu stretch of Golden Quadrilateral is a high traffic density route. There is a need to ensure faster freight movement between the Chennai Port and the Kamarajar Port,” he said. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami requested sanction for phase-II of Chennai Metro Rail, with a 50:50 joint venture between the Centre and the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/focus-on-urban-transport-will-boost-ease-of-living-pm/article33837807.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vehicles without FASTag will have to pay double toll from tonight||From Monday night, vehicles not having radio frequency-based FASTag cards will be charged double the fee at toll plazas managed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). This is being mandated based on the NH Fee Rules, 2008. Around 20% of vehicles crossing plazas in Tamil Nadu do not have FASTag cards that allow electronic collection of fee. These include buses being run by the State Transport Corporation. From January 1, 2021 when FASTag cards were made mandatory, coverage in the State had increased from 74% to the present 80%. “From midnight Monday normal cash payment will not be allowed. Those lanes at the extreme sides of the plazas, which were hybrid lanes, would become ‘FASTag only’ lanes,” said an official of the NHAI. A toll operator said that this could cause slowing down of traffic flow at plazas. “If vehicles enter lanes meant for FASTag cards, the other vehicles would have to wait. They would be made to purchase the RFID cards,” he said. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has also recently written to all States seeking support from various government agencies in implementing this rule. A retired engineer of the NHAI said the idea of FASTag was drawn from Japan, but even in that country there are lanes that allow cash payments. “The government is not giving time for sorting out technical glitches in the system. We don’t know why they are in a hurry,” he said. Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said that with such deadlines the NHAI and the Ministry were threatening the public. “They are already burdened with ever increasing fuel prices and very high insurance premiums. With such warnings, the government is denying the public the right to pay in cash. It seems as if the government was disrespecting the Indian currency by not accepting it,’ he said. A total of seven lakh vehicles paying toll crossed the 46 plazas in the State every day. This is apart from two and three wheelers and exempted vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-fastag-get-ready-to-pay-double-at-toll-plazas-from-midnight-today/article33837835.ece

15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||His devotion to religion is stamped on a huge collection||N. Ragupathy, an 80-year-old philatelist from Thanjavur, started his hobby 30 years ago, before narrowing his focus to Hinduism and Hindu culture. He now has over 1,500 stamps and covers on Hinduism released in over 125 countries. “Stamps on ‘Aum’ have been released in Trinidad and Kenya, but not in India so far,” said Mr. Ragupathy, who has won the silver medal at the Sydney Stamp and Coin Expo. He has participated in exhibitions in other parts of India and won awards. His collection includes a few stamps that are over 100 years old. A stamp released in 1877 was on Dhanurveda, a Sanskrit treatise on warfare and archery. A lesson in Delhi A “bitter experience” at a philatelic exhibition in Delhi forced him to concentrate on stamps on Hinduism and Hindu Culture. “There were stamps on Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. When asked about the missing of the collection on Hinduism, the philatelist behind the Sikhism section made some derogatory remarks. That day, I decided to collect stamps on Hinduism,” said Mr. Raghupathy, who retired as a personal assistant to the Thanjavur Collector. He acknowledged the help rendered by G. Balakrishna Das, the former president of the South India Philatelists’ Association, and Abdul Aziz, a philatelist from Varanasi, in collecting stamps. “Mr. Aziz helped me a lot in collecting stamps released in foreign countries,” said Mr. Raghupathy, who had a stamp depicting Lord Siva and Parvati released by Czechoslovakia. There are stamps on Vinayaka Chaturthi, Deepavali and Maha Shivaratri released in various countries. He has listed the stamps under ‘Hinduism, an analytical study’, which runs up to 257 pages. “I have approached various organisations to prevail upon the Indian government to release a stamp on ‘Aum’. But I am not able to succeed... Let the government do it by taking inspiration from Kenya and Trinidad,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/his-devotion-to-religion-is-stamped-on-a-huge-collection/article33837961.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘PM’s remarks on fishermen surprising’||Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri has expressed surprise over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that the Centre will protect the interests of fishermen. In a statement, he alleged that the BJP government hadn’t done enough to safeguard the fishermen, who had been facing a number of issues from Sri Lanka. Dry fish imports Sri Lanka had banned dry fish imports and refused to lift it and the fishermen suffered a huge economic loss, Mr. Alagiri said. He alleged that Mr. Modi had been taking a lot of decisions which were against the interest of Tamil Nadu. People won’t fall prey to his act of quoting lines from Tamil poets Avvaiyar and Bharathiyar, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pms-remarks-on-fishermen-surprising/article33837852.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A long-pending demand met at last||The demand of the communities — Devendrakulathan, Kadaiyan, Kalladi, Kudumban, Pallan, Pannadi and Vathiriyan — that they be known as ‘Devendrakula Velalar’ has been around for long. Since 2015, the demand has grown louder. Later Puthiya Tamilagam president K. Krishnasamy picked up the strands of the demand. Mr. Krishnasamy also wants the community removed from the Scheduled Caste list, a proposal that several leaders of the sub-sects oppose. A Dalit historian said the idea behind the sub-sects being brought under one umbrella was to have a significant voice while they put forth their demands. “As several sub-sects, they are not able to mobilise the number. When they are brought under one roof, to put it that way, it would ensure that the Devendrakula Velalars are seen as one and have a larger number of people putting forth their demands,” the historian said. In an interview to The Hindu in 2018, Mr. Krishnasamy said the Devendrakula Velalars were a wetland farming community but their lands were taken away during invasions many centuries ago. During the British rule, they were seen as marginalised and poor and were, therefore, included in the SC list. ‘Feel robbed’ Sushil Rajkumar, advocate, Madras High Court, who is part of the Devendrakula Velalar Samooga Paadhugappu Kootamaippu, said that while they were not against the name change, “we now feel robbed of our traditional Pallar name and the historical significance attached to the name”. The historian said the issue gained prominence because the BJP saw the space for gaining a foothold in the State. “The DMK and the AIADMK sat on the demand over the years as the balance of power in south Tamil Nadu rests with the Thevars. The BJP saw that this issue had not been addressed for long, and jumped in to take credit,” the historian added. An MP from Tamil Nadu, who did not want to be quoted, said the BJP was trying to gain political mileage from the issue but a mere change in nomenclature would not better the lot of the Scheduled Castes and much more had to be done for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-long-pending-demand-met-at-last/article33837810.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Devendrakula Velalars will now be known by their heritage name: PM||The Centre has decided to call members of the Devendrakula Velalar community by their heritage name and not by the names listed on the Schedule of the Constitution, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said here on Sunday. The draft Gazette to amend the Schedule to correct their name as Devendrakula Velalar had been approved. The announcement comes a few months ahead of the Assembly election in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. At a function to unveil several projects here, Mr. Modi said the draft Gazette would be placed before Parliament at the start of the next session. He also thanked the Tamil Nadu government for the detailed study on this demand. The State government had been backing the demand for long, he said. Recalling his meeting with representatives of the community in 2015 in Delhi, he said: “Their sadness could be seen. Colonial rulers took away their pride and dignity. For decades nothing happened. They told me that they had pleaded with governments but nothing changed. I told them one thing. I said their name Devender rhymes with my own name: Narendra. I understand their emotions.” The decision to call all of them Devendrakula Velalar was more than a change of name, he contended. “It is about justice, dignity and opportunity. We all have lots to learn from the culture of the Devendrakula community. They celebrate harmony, friendship and brotherhood. Theirs was a civilisational movement. It shows their self-confidence and self-pride.” Sri Lankan Tamils Taking pride in being the only Indian Prime Minister to have visited Jaffna in Sri Lanka, Mr. Modi said: “Our government has always taken care of the welfare and aspirations of our Tamil brothers and sisters in Sri Lanka.” Through development works, India had been ensuring the welfare of Sri Lanka’s Tamil community, he said, recalling the 50,000 houses built for the displaced Tamils in north-eastern Sri Lanka and 4,000 houses in the plantation areas. “I feel happy to share that India has built the Jaffna Cultural Centre, which we hope to open soon. The issue of Tamil rights has also been taken up by us consistently with Sri Lankan leaders. We are always committed to ensuring that they live with equality, justice peace and dignity,” he said. ‘Long-standing problem’ Holding that the problem faced by Tamil Nadu fishermen was long-standing, Mr. Modi said: “But let me assure you that my government will always protect their rightful interests. We have ensured early release whenever fishermen are apprehended in Sri Lanka. More than 1,600 fishermen have been released during our tenure. Currently, there is no Indian fisherman in Sri Lankan custody. Similarly, 313 boats have also been released, and we are working for the return of the rest of the boats.” Pointing to a Union Budget proposal, Mr. Modi said modern fishing harbours would come up at five centres in the country, including in Chennai. “We are optimistic about seaweed farming. This will improve the lives of coastal communities. For seaweed cultivation, a multi-purpose seaweed park will come up in Tamil Nadu.” India was making the world’s fight against COVID-19 stronger, he said. “We have to keep doing whatever we can to develop our nation and make the world a better place. This is what the makers of our Constitution wanted us to do.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devendrakula-velalars-to-get-back-heritage-name/article33837805.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Patient’s history crucial to treat perimenopause ’||Menstrual disorder is common in perimenopausal women but it is rare to have a sinister cause, said Mary Ann Lumsden, chief executive of International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). She was delivering the Second Esther Memorial Oration virtually on Sunday at the continuing medical education programme organised by Chennai Menopause Society. “Investigation is generally straightforward and effective treatment options are available even during a COVID pandemic,” she assured the participating gynaecologists. Since anaemia affects a woman’s life from the early reproductive years till their menopause and in India anaemia could be as high as 40%-60%, she said a patient’s complaints of abnormal uterine bleeding should alert the doctor to go through the patient’s history always keeping in mind the need to maintain a healthy level of haemoglobin. With India not offering routine screening for cervical cancer, gynaecologists should be alert when a woman comes with complaints of irregular bleeding and should examine the cervix, she said. Careful investigation of the women’s history, especially if they are entering menopause early, would provide a clue, she said. She advised against hysterectomy, particularly in women with large fibroids. History and routine examination would provide information about whether the woman was at risk of complications. Doctors should take into view factors such as obesity, genetic predisposition and history of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The oration was instituted by Hepzibah Kirubamani N., vice-president of the society, in memory of her mother, said Jaiashree Gajaraj, who presided over the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patients-history-should-guide-treatment-of-perimenopause/article33837831.ece
15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC makes fervent appeal to implement prohibition||Observing that a study had found that the State government loses more than Rs. 2 on providing healthcare for every Rs. 1 earned by it through sale of liquor, the Madras High Court has made a fervent appeal to the government to implement prohibition in the State in a phased manner “to wipe out the tears of women and children”. Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi wrote: “Though it is a difficult task, still every endeavour has to be made to discourage people from drinking and appeal to the government to stop selling liquor. Therefore, this court appeals to the State government to bring prohibition in a phased manner.” Collective demand The Bench went on to state that total prohibition was not an appeal made just by the court, it was also the collective demand of housewives, children and the entire society. If prohibition was brought in, definitely commission of criminal offences would decrease, an individual’s income would increase, drunkards would become healthy and drunken driving would not be there. “Society would be more peaceful and the dream of the father of the nation would be realised. Will the government listen to this court?” the Division Bench asked before concluding its order on a plea to shift a State-run liquor shop located close to a government higher secondary school in Madurai. After recording the submission of Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation, the sole authority for wholesale and retail sale of liquor in the State, that the liquor shop would be shifted, the judges said it was a matter of serious concern that numerous writ petitions were being filed in the court to shift liquor shops situated close to educational institutions, residential localities and places of worship. “Liquor outlet is neither a book stall nor a grocery shop to be located near a school or a residential area,” the judges said. About 5,300 liquor retail outlets easily earn about Rs. 30,000 crore every year. The average revenue was Rs. 70 crore on normal days, Rs. 90 crore to Rs. 100 crore on weekends and Rs. 110 to Rs. 120 crore on festival days, the Bench said. Tasmac earned Rs. 465.79 crore in just two days during Deepavali in November 2020, the Bench added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-makes-fervent-appeal-to-implement-prohibition/article33837850.ece

15 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Manifesto for the youth released||With State Assembly elections round the corner, the election desk of the Young People for Politics (YPP) released its Tamil Nadu youth manifesto on Sunday. The manifesto has been prepared by youth from different backgrounds and aims to help their voices resonate with political parties and leaders. The manifesto was unveiled at a virtual event organised by the YPP. The demands in the manifesto cover varied concerns and these include employment, women’s rights, building a casteless Tamil society, holistic rural well-being, tribal rights, and rights of persons with disabilities. Areas for action Rights of sexuality minorities, information and communication technology, environment wellness and student politics find a prominent place in the manifesto as areas for the government to act upon. One of the key objectives of preparing such a manifesto was that the voice and aspirations of the youth must reach the larger public. This was to ensure that there was some level of political engagement in the State, said the members of the YPP. “It is imperative that the youth talk a lot more about politics and governance,” said K.C.

According to a press release, though the check dam was built years ago, not much water flows into the structure now as the supply channels are blocked by waste and bushes. Sewage also flows into the check dam. Siruthuli selected the project with the main objective of conserving rain water and improving water percolation. A study of the check dam was taken up before launching the rejuvenation work on February 11. Robert Bosch has come forward to sponsor the work under its Corporate Social Responsibility works. The press release added that when the works are completed, the check dam will be able to hold 48.6 million litres of water and thus benefit all those in the vicinity. The local people have said they will maintain the water body and its surroundings when the works are completed and ensure waste is not dumped into it. Children took part in the inauguration and wanted to learn more about the impact of the work on ground water level and ill-effects of pollution. They also evinced interest in conserving water bodies, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/siruthuli-starts-work-to-desilt-sengalipalayam-check-dam/article33837872.ece
15 February 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Governments should reduce taxes on petrol, diesel: Eswaran||The Central and State governments should reduce taxes on petrol and diesel as the prices have skyrocketed to put the common man to hardship, Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi general secretary E.R. Eswaran told reporters on the side lines of an event held here on Sunday. The cascading effect of the rise in prices of petrol and diesel was seen on essential commodities. To reduce the common man’s burden both the governments should cut the taxes. The Union Budget did very little to address the plight of the common man. It had also failed to protect the MSME sector that was hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic period. And, the State government was more keen on giving freebies than ameliorate the suffering of the common man. His party was in position to determine the winner in at least 50 Assembly constituencies, Mr. Eswaran said and added that there was no misgiving among parties in the DMK alliance. Reservation He also sought an increase in reservation from 26.5% to 40% for communities in the Backward Classes as they constituted 55% of the population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reduce-taxes-on-petrol-diesel-eswaran/article33837883.ece
15 February 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||New species of fly named after Singanallur Tank||A new species of fly, which was recently identified by researchers at the Singanallur Tank, has been named after the water body. The insect was named Asphondylia singanallurensis in the research paper published in the Zootaxa journal in March 2020. The authors said in the paper that they collected the leaves of jujube shrub ( Ziziphus jujuba ) growing near the Singanallur Tank during their field visits between 2015 and 2018, that contained leaf galls (abnormal growth on leaves) on the surfaces. The leaves were dissected in a laboratory and the causative agent for the galls was identified to be a fly from the Cecidomyiidae family, which are commonly known as gall midges. Upon further research which also involved DNA sequencing, the insect was confirmed to be a unique species, according to the research paper. The paper was authored by Duraikannu Vasanthakumar and Radheshyam M. Sharma from Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) - Western Regional Centre (WRC) in Pune, Senthilkumar Palanisamy from the Department of Genetic Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur and Vinny R. Peter from Centre for Urban Biodiversity Conservation and Education (CUBE). Mr. Vasanthakumar, Senior Zoological Assistant at ZSI - WRC Pune, said there were about 396 different species of flies under the Cecidomyiidae family prior to the discovery of this new species. “This particular species has only been reported from Singanallur Tank so far,” he told The Hindu on Sunday. Despite the abundance of the jujube shrub ( ilanthai in Tamil) in the Western Ghats region, this particular fly has not been reported anywhere so far. Further research regarding the ecological parameters and the life cycle of Asphondylia singanallurensis are being carried out, he noted. According to Ms. Peter, four more insects have been recently found at Singanallur Tank by researchers and efforts to ascertain whether these are unique species are under way. In 2017, the Coimbatore Corporation declared the 288-acre Singanallur Tank as a biodiversity conservation zone owing to its rich biodiversity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-species-of-fly-named-after-singanallur-tank/article33837879.ece

Murugan said on Sunday at an event organised to pay homage to those who lost their lives in the February 14, 1998 serial blasts. “If the sacrifice of the 58 people who had died and the 200-plus who were injured in the blasts should not go waste and if Hindu faith has to be protected then the DMK should not be given a chance to rule the State as it is anti-Hindu and anti-Tamil,” he said. “In short, the election will be a battle between patriots and anti-nationals,” Mr. Murugan said. Be it the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blasts or the killing of Tamils in the Eelam war in Sri Lanka, it was the DMK that was responsible. To make a comeback, the party and its ideological ally Dravidar Kazhagam were engaged in vituperative and false campaign, which they had started even in the run-up to the 2019 Parliamentary election, he added. He held the DMK responsible for NEET or the Sterlite expansion project. The very DMK was behind the Karuppar Kootam’s assault on ‘Kandhar Shashti Kavacham’, he charged and pointed out that the party had made a ‘U’ turn with its president M.K. Stalin holding the spear because the Hindus had come together and the BJP’s ‘Vetri Vel Yatra’ was a success. Mr. Murugan and other speakers at the event also condemned the police for not acting on those who had attempted to denigrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Hindu gods and attempted to incite violence in Mettupalayam, while detaining BJP leader Kalyanaraman under the Goondas Act. BJP State vice-president K. Annamalai condemned the police for showing leniency to SDPI and other Muslim party leaders and delaying their arrest while detaining Mr. Kalyanaraman. The police had also not acted against VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan, pastor Ezra Sargunam and a few others and the best way for Hindus to show their anger was to vote for the BJP. Hindu Aikya Vedi president Sasikala said it was time for Hindus to stay united.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upcoming-poll-is-a-battle-between-patriots-anti-nationals/article33837856.ece

The association in a resolution passed at its monthly meeting a few days ago thanked the State government for waiving farm loans availed of in primary agriculture cooperative societies and urged the Central government to follow suit by writing off the loans availed in nationalised banks. The association drew the State government’s attention to the plight of those farmers who had repaid agriculture loans and submitted fresh applications for new loans but whose applications were processed in February. Those farmers had been left in lurch because of the cut off date for the waiver and the delay in processing new loans by the officials of the cooperative societies. It also wanted the Coimbatore Rural Police to probe complaints of cattle, motor thefts by farmers and sought the district administration to convene the inter-department meeting to address the issue of wild animals entering farms and destroying crops. The association objected to the way the representatives of a few nationalised banks duped farmers by taking money for one-time settlement of loans but used it to adjust outstanding dues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/waive-farm-loans-taken-from-nationalised-banks/article33837867.ece

15 February 2021||Karaikal,TAMIL NADU||Karaikal hopes for upgrade as administrative centre||Public welfare organisations in Karaikal enclave are watching the political discussion on Statehood for Puducherry with curiosity, as they surmise that it would mean automatic upgrade of Karaikal as administrative centre of the union territory of Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam. Citing the case of Statehood granted for Goa that resulted in de-linking of Daman and Diu and retention of their status of Union Territory, the Convenor of Karaikal Struggle Group, S. P. Selvashanmugam, said a separate union territory status has been a long-pending demand of the people of Karaikal. In accordance with the Union Government’s objective of ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’, considering small population and limited geographical areas, the union territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli were merged into one. “Statehood, if granted, will have to be confined to Puducherry,” Mr. Selvashanmugam said. Earlier this year, Puducherry adopted a resolution urging the Centre to grant full statehood to the Union territory. It was the 10th such resolution adopted by the Puducherry Assembly since 1987. The line of thinking of the political parties is that Statehood was a must from both administrative and financial angles, for implementation of welfare and developmental schemes. According to proponents of Statehood, Puducherry has sunk into a deep financial crisis due to the reluctance of the Central Government to sanction funds. The status of a State, they believe, will enable sanction of 41% grant from the Centre. Welfare organisations in Puducherry say Karaikal has been neglected for a long by successive governments in Puducherry, and that emancipation of the enclave was possible only by its upgrade into administrative headquarters of a newly constituted union territory. “Be it healthcare or transport connectivity, Karaikal residents have been getting a raw deal. For instance, the Puducherry government has not cared to take steps for creating the necessary infrastructure for economic progress of Karaikal enclave,” V. R. Dhanaseelane, president Karaikal District Citizens Welfare Association, said. A glaring example is the lack of interest in setting the greenfield airport project for Karaikal, Mr. Dhanaseelane has alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karaikal-hopes-for-upgrade-as-administrative-centre/article33837962.ece
15 February 2021||Karaikudi,TAMIL NADU||Modernise fireworks units, says Karti||Demanding the Centre and State governments to help entrepreneurs in Sivakasi and other towns in Virudhunagar district to modernise their fireworks units, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram said that more funds should be earmarked for this purpose. Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, after inaugurating a ration shop building constructed under the MPLAD scheme, he said that many fireworks units need to be modernised and safety standards have to be enhanced. Except for a few units, the rest functioned using old methods. For such cottage units, technology and funds should be provided, he pointed out. Similarly, workers engaged in the fireworks units should be insured for a high value and the premium should be borne by the governments. This would not only prevent accidents but also save the lives of the workers, Mr. Karti said. Attacking the Centre for increasing petrol price, he said that the common man would be deeply affected. By lowering the excise duty and increasing the cess, the Centre's methodology was sure to rock the economy. The Narendra Modi government, he said, was determined not to listen to suggestions from Opposition parties. “Media houses too give very limited coverage to the views of the Congress, though the MPs and MLAs were exposing the faults of the government across the country”, he charged. Be it the farmers issue or the Chinese aggression, the Prime Minister neither informed the Parliament nor discussed or briefed the Opposition parties. He added that the Congress would continue to stage protests until the controversial agriculture laws were withdrawn by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/modernise-fireworks-units-karti/article33837853.ece
15 February 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||Recite Thirukkural, get a litre of petrol free||Poet-saint Thiruvalluvar’s masterpiece Thirukkural could teach you sublime life lessons but at the ground level, it can also fetch you a litre of free petrol now in Karur if the children in your family know at least 20 of the 1,330 couplets of the Tamil classic by heart. A fuel station owner at Nagapampalli near Karur has been offering half-a-litre of petrol free to customers whose kids recite 10 couplets of Thirukkural. If they recite 20 couplets, they get a litre free. Introduced on Thiruvallavur Day last month, the offer at the fuel station named after Valluvar will run till April-end. The offer is open to students of classes I to XI who are required to be accompanied by their parents. They should submit in writing the couplets that they plan to recite. A participant can enter the contest multiple times but must recite different couplets each time. The idea behind the novel offer, conceptualised by K. Senguttuvan, owner of the petrol station and chairman of the Valluvar College of Science and Management, is to encourage students read Thirukkural. “First, the reading habit is on the decline among students. And reading Thirukkural could help bring about a focus among students. I want students to grow with Thirukkural; but this needs some encouragement. Hence I came up with the idea,” says Mr. Senguttuvan explaining the intent. The love for Thirukkural runs in the family of Mr. Senguttuvan. His father, Karuppiah, had named his electrical store after Valluvur, way back in 1960. The shop at Paramthi Velur is still run by his brother. “My father showed us how to live by the values of Thiruvalluvar. Nobody who lived by those ideals have failed. Those who followed the path shown by Thirukkural will enjoy a life of fulfilment,” says Mr. Senguttuvan who also runs a hotel named after Valluvar in Karur. Students too seem to relish the contest. “I enjoyed reciting the kurals, some of which I had learnt in my school,” said S. Dhivani, a Class VI student of the Panchayat Union Elementary School, Malaikovilur, who recited 10 couplets. Her father, Selvaraj, termed the offer useful which has kindled the interest of students. Till Thursday, 147 students have availed themselves of the offer, according to Mr. Senguttuvan. “Though the price of petrol is nearing Rs. 90 a litre, I don’t mind. I want the students to imbibe the spirit of Thirukkural,” he says. Mr. Senguttuvan is planning a follow-up programme for the participants at his college later so as to continue their learning of Thirukkural. Mr. Senguttuvan also runs a scholarship scheme for undergraduate students in the Valluvar College of Science and Management under which students who recite all the 1,330 couplets of Thirukkural are offered fee waiver for all three years. The only condition — the beneficiaries should visit villages for two Sundays every month to teach Thirukkural to rural students. Over the past five years, about 15 students have availed themselves of the scholarship, he claims.  Reading Thirukkural could help bring about a focus among students K.

15 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Workers had no identity cards, contractor engaged child labour’||“We work for 9 to 10 hours daily. The contractor gives Rs. 200 a day. On Fridays and Saturdays, the workload increases as we have to meet the production target,” said Balamary, a woman worker, who is under treatment at a private hospital here. She is one of the workers injured at in Friday’s accident at Sree Mariyammal Fireworks near Sattur. A team of social workers from Evidence, an NGO, visited the fireworks unit at Vembakottai, near Sattur, in Virudhunagar district and some of the injured workers at a private hospital. These workers told the team that at 1 p.m. on February 12, they heard a big sound and that’s all. “For the next 10 minutes, it was chaos. People were running to safety,” they recounted. At the time of the fire, there were at least 50 to 60 workers on the campus. Though the unit was spread on 18 acres, the approach road was bad. Infrastructure was very minimal at the work spot and water was available only for washing hands and face. “Where do we go for so much water to put out the fire which was billowing. With bad roads, the fire tenders took a long time to reach the spot,” they said. Multi-ownership A. Kathir, executive director, Evidence, said the factory was owned by a person, and it was taken on lease by another. The third person had engaged the workers. The workers were not insured. No log was kept on the premises or the workers had no identity cards, he said. His team found out that the contractor had engaged child labour. Mr. Kathir said Muthupandi, 17, and Muthukutti, 19, both of the Scheduled Caste, claimed to be working at the fireworks unit for the last three years and five years respectively. If the claim was true, the contractor should be booked for engaging child labour at a hazardous unit, he said. At least 60% of the workers were from the Scheduled Caste, and the contractors had exploited them, utilising their ignorance. The women workers said they reported to work at 8.30 a.m. and knocked off at 6 p.m. and the contractor paid them Rs. 200 a day with a 30-minute lunch break. The men were paid Rs. 300 a day. At weekends, the workers had to spend a few more hours at the unit as the production target for the week had to be completed, and the contractor would not allow it to be carried over to the following week. Hence, there would be a higher number of workers in the sheds, the workers told the Evidence team. Mr. Kathir said those arrested in such cases should not be granted bail for 12 months. While very few fireworks units at Sivakasi, Virudhunagar, Sattur and Kovilpatti followed the rules and the Standard Operating Procedure, a number of units violated them. He said the units that were found violating the rules should be sealed. Private hospital bills should be borne by the employer or the contractor or the licence-holder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/workers-had-no-identity-cards-contractor-engaged-child-labour/article33837859.ece
15 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Compliance with rules by bulk waste generators in Madurai poor||Bulk waste generators in the city have shown poor compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, which mandate setting up of composting units to process their biodegradable waste. Bulk waste generators include hotels, restaurants, hospitals, schools, apartments and other commercial establishments generating an average of 100 kilograms of waste every day. A total of 1,031 bulk waste generators have been identified by Madurai Corporation, says City Health Officer P. Kumaraguruparan. At least 100 tonnes of waste is collected from bulk waste generators every day. As per rules, bulk waste generators must segregate waste at source, process biodegradable waste within their premises and develop a system to reuse compost or biogas thus produced. Non-biodegradable waste must be given to the Corporation. Although four years have passed since the introduction of the rules, there is poor compliance by bulk waste generators. Most of them either throw away waste in the common dumper bins or hand it over to Corporation conservancy workers, says the manager of a hotel near Mattuthavani. Some hotels and restaurants shred biodegradable waste to feed livestock, says S. Senthil Nathan, (Director Operations), Hotel Germanus. Lack of space to process their own waste, especially in core city areas, is one of the main reasons for bulk waste generators finding it difficult to comply with the rules, says a Health Department official. The Corporation has provided a 5.5-acre land at Pazhathottam near Karuppayurani to process the waste generated by bulk waste generators. The unit is handled by K. Thirupathi, Director of KT Greens India Private Limited. Before COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, around seven tonnes of waste was processed in the unit, says Mr. Thirupathi. “Since the outbreak, we are able to process only two tonnes of waste. Many hotels have either shut down or have been sold to a different proprietors during lockdown,” he adds. Mr. Thirupathi stresses the need for the civic body to ensure that bulk waste generators comply with the rules. Chairperson of State-level Monitoring Committee of National Green Tribunal for Solid Waste Management Justice P. Jothimani, who held a meeting with Corporation officials on Saturday, suggested that the officials could work with a private party in collecting and composting waste from bulk waste generators, according to a source. “Justice Jothimani said such a system was practised in Coimbatore,” adds the source. The City Health Officer says more awareness would be created in this regard.

15 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Women must handle agriculture to ensure food security’||Agriculture must be handled by women as they would ensure food security of the nation through sustainable and environment-friendly practices, said Sheelu Francis, facilitator of Tamil Nadu Women’s Collective. She was addressing a webinar on ‘One Billion Rising’, a campaign against violence against women and children, which was organised by EKTA Resource Centre for Women and other institutions. Ms. Francis said women produced food through organic methods to feed her family. On the other hand, men focussed on earning money and hence produced food using fertilisers. “So, it is important that women have their own land to undertake agriculture,” she said. Speaking about the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs, Chithra Ganapathy, Managing Director of Kadambavanam, said women who were running businesses also had the additional duty of taking care of their household chores. “Although many educated women are working today, there are still restrictions that are imposed on women while taking independent decisions,” she said. In this patriarchal society, the roles of women and men are stigmatised, which had to change, said S. Nagarathinam, Head of the Department of Communication, Madurai Kamaraj University. “While men are identified to be strong and courageous, women are identified as caring and compassionate. The students must be taught not to stigmatise the roles of men and women,” he said.  Nutritious food It was important that women ate nutritious food right from their adolescence, said Kavitha Krishnan, Editor of Nalam. “Women must eat traditional, nutritious food to ensure that they are not anaemic,” she added. Bimla Chandrasekar, Director of EKTA Resource Centre for Women, said the main aim of the webinar was to provide a platform to highlight the issues faced by women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-must-handle-agriculture-to-ensure-food-security/article33838137.ece
15 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Fact-finding team visits Vembakottai fireworks unit||“We work for 9-10 hours daily. The contractor gives Rs. 200 per day. On Fridays and Saturdays, workload increases as we have to meet production target,” said Balamari, a woman worker who is under treatment at a private hospital here, on Saturday. Speaking to a team of social workers from Evidence, a city-based NGO, which visited Sri Mariammal Fireworks in Vembakottai near Sattur in Virudhunagar district and also some of the injured workers at a private hospital, the victims said around 1 p.m. on Friday, they heard a big sound. “For the next 10 minutes, it was chaos. People were running to safety,” they recounted. There were at least 50-60 workers on the premises. Though the unit was spread on an 18-acre plot, the approach road was bad. Moreover, infrastructure facilities in the work spot were very minimal and water was available only for washing hands and face. “Where do we go for water to extinguish the fire?. With the bad roads, fire tenders took a long time to reach there,” the workers said. The factory was owned by a person and taken on lease by another. A third person engaged the workers. And, there was no accountability to the workforce. The workers were not insured though labour laws mandates it. There was no log entry and the workers did not have ID cards, A. Kathir, Executive Director, Evidence, said, adding the fact-finding team also found that the contractor engaged child labour. Mr. Kathir said when he interviewed Muthupandi (17) and Muthukutti (19), both from Scheduled Castes, they claimed that they were working in the unit for the last three years and five years respectively. In that case, the contractor should be booked for engaging child labour in a hazardous unit, he said. At least 60% of the workers were from Scheduled Castes. While women workers said they came to work at 8.30 a.m. and left by 6 p.m., the contractor paid Rs. 200 for them and Rs. 300 for men, and they would get a 30-minute lunch break. The workers said they had to spend a few more hours on weekends, as weekly production targets had to be met. Hence, there would be a higher number of workers in the sheds. Mr. Kathir said those arrested in such cases should not be granted bail at least for 12 months. While a very few fireworks units in Sivakasi, Virudhunagar, Sattur and Kovilpatti followed rules and standard operating procedure, most violated them. Officials from various departments were hand in glove with contractors. There had been so many deaths in fireworks units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fact-finding-team-visits-fireworks-unit/article33837945.ece

15 February 2021||NAGAPATTINAM,TAMIL NADU||Centre blind to T.N.’s interests, says Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday termed the AIADMK government a “slave” of the BJP government at the Centre. He also accused the Centre of having ignored the State’s interests during the last four years. Referring to Mr. Palaniswami’s assertion at an election meeting a few ago that the AIADMK was not subservient to anyone, Mr. Stalin said the Chief Minister had done nothing to protect the State’s interests during his tenure so far. The Centre, too, had betrayed Tamil Nadu’s interests. At a time when the Assembly election was just a month away, Mr. Palaniswami’s assertion was a drama to hoodwink the people, he said. At a public outreach programme at Thirukadaiyur near Poompuhar, Mr. Stalin questioned why not a brick had been moved four years after the announcement was made on the establishment of an AIIMS in Madurai. The Centre had not come to the State’s rescue when it was badly affected by two cyclones. It had not released the sum sought by the State to carry out relief and rehabilitation measures, he said. Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Chennai, Mr. Stalin sought to know whether the Chief Minister had the conviction to seek an explanation for the Centre’s “inaction” on the Bills passed by the Assembly against NEET, non-release of funds to the State and Karnataka’s decision to build a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu.  Under the scanner Mr. Palaniswami could not raise questions as “scandalous misdeeds” by him and his Ministers were under the scanner of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, he said. The DMK president said Mr. Palaniswami, who came to power owing to the fallout of O. Panneerselvam’s ‘dharma yutham’ and the incarceration of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s aide V.K. Sasikala, had wasted an opportunity to serve the State. The Chief Minister had neither the courage and the talent nor the willingness to serve the people well. Instead, Mr. Palaniswami was trying to enact a drama at the end of his regime by announcing a slew of schemes. The “corrupt regime” would be voted out, Mr. Stalin said. The DMK leader said an intense race for supremacy between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam had warranted the intervention of Mr. Modi to broker peace. If not for the objection raised by former PWD Minister Durai Murugan to the inauguration of the Cauvery-Gundar project on the ground that it had already been launched during the DMK regime, the Chief Minister would have taken the Prime Minister for a ride, Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-blind-to-tns-interests/article33837804.ece
15 February 2021||NAMAKKAL,TAMIL NADU||Create awareness on crime against women: Kanimozhi||Thoothukudi MP M.K. Kanimozhi said that though there were sufficient laws, awareness must be created on handling crimes against women and children. As part of her campaign in Namakkal on Sunday, Ms. Kanimozhi interacted with the students of a private college. Responding to a question on laws on crimes against women and children, Ms. Kanimozhi said, “there is a lack of awareness among implementing agencies. Such complaints are seen ordinarily by society, the government and police. Hence, though there are sufficient laws, rightful punishments are not being delivered in these cases.” She added that complaints on crime against women were not properly investigated and argued in court. So, only a small percentage of accused were convicted in such cases. Ms. Kanimozhi said DMK leader M.K. Stalin had promised that separate courts would be set up in each district to investigate crime against women. Stating that her personal and political role model is E.V. Ramasamy (Periyar), she added that she was a proud atheist, but respected anybody who believed in a particular religion. Ms. Kanimozhi said caste was a big lie and caste and religion should never be allowed to decide things in politics. She also interacted with weavers, vegetable market vendors, lorry associations and party cadre here. In their petition, the lorry owners requested inclusion of diesel in GST, setting up of motor vehicle spare parts manufacturing centre in Namakkal and lorry sheds in the periphery of districts, and waiver of interests on loans for a year as the industry had been severely affected due to COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/create-awareness-on-crime-against-women-kanimozhi/article33837978.ece

15 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||New research shines light on U.T.’s pollution problem||New research that assessed stack emissions of polluting industries in Puducherry has noted that pollutant levels were in excess of permissible limits downwind of the major industrial estates in the capital of the Union Territory. The findings, which have been brought out in a 235-page book, evaluated air quality downwind of the seven major industrial estates and found that pollutant levels were exceeding the permissible limits prescribed for “sensitive areas” such as schools and hospitals. The book, titled Advances in Air Pollution Profiling and Control (Springer), co-authored by S.A. Abbasi, Emeritus Professor, Centre for Pollution Control and Environmental Engineering, Pondicherry University, says that though pollutant levels remain within the permissible limits in residential neighbourhoods, they are close to the liberal cut-offs for residential areas and could soon cross those thresholds. The other collaborators for the publication are Nihal Anwar Siddiqui and S.M. Tauseef, from the Department of Health Safety, Environment and Civil Engineering, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, and Faisal I. Khan, from the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John’s Canada. The authors note that from just three textile mills about five decades ago, the rate of industrialisation in Puducherry since 1992 has increased manifold. It now houses 8,966 industrial units of various sizes and employment ranges — 77 large-scale, 190 medium-scale, 7,792 small-scale and 907 micro-scale units. Air quality modelling According to Prof. Abbasi, the book touches on field studies on ambient air pollution done at Chennai and Puducherry, air quality modelling, various impacts of air pollutants and role of vehicles/speed breakers etc. All studies assayed Suspended Particulate Matter, Nitrogen Oxides, Sulfur Dioxide, and even lead in some cases, depending on the context. “However, comparisons with the 2005 survey or earlier assessments were not possible because of the lack of past data of identical depth and breadth,” Prof. Abbasi said. There is some discussion on the need for improved models that identify the linkages between ambient air pollution, its source and variables such as meteorology and terrain traits that determine the dispersal patterns of pollutants. The book also engages in a discussion of innovative methods to address air pollution related issues, looks at the impact of environment and health and highlights current and future research trends. The book was formally launched by Pondicherry University Vice-Chancellor Gurmeet Singh, who noted that while all forms of pollution were harmful, the one with the most significant impact was air pollution. While one can carry safe drinking water or dump solid waste in the dust bin, preventing air pollution is the only way to stop it from harming us, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-research-shines-light-on-uts-pollution-problem/article33838225.ece

15 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||NRCB announces initiative to utilise banana waste||The National Research Centre for Banana, Tiruchi, has announced the launch of an initiative to develop small machinery for extracting banana fibre and utilise the sap, central stem and other waste for producing a variety of products. The initiative was launched by NRCB in partnership with the Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing Kancheepuram (IIITDM Kancheepuram) and Gencrest, an industry partner, brought together at the behest of Mylswamy Annadurai, Vice-President, Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology and Chairman, National Design and Research Forum, a NRCB press release said. In Tamil Nadu, banana is cultivated in more than one lakh hectares and more than 10 million tonnes of waste is generated after the harvest of bunches. The initiative was aimed at managing this humongous quantity of bio-waste. An agreement was signed to develop pilot scale machinery for extracting more than three tonnes of banana fiber every day and utilise the sap, central stem and scutcher for producing a variety of products. On the occasion, Dr. Mylswamy observed that banana cultivation generated approximately 80 million tonnes of pseudostem waste per year, but it was not used well despite its huge industrial potential. Banana fiber could be used in textiles and scutcher waste generated after extracting the fiber could be used as acoustic and aircraft panels and self-healing composites. Banana sap can be used as an organic liquid nutrient for enhancing the yield of fruits and vegetables and reducing the carbon footprint, he said and added that the collaborative venture will hugely benefit the banana farmers in multiple ways. He asked the industry partner Gencrest to adopt the products developed by the NRCB such as central stem-based juices and, biscuits for large scale production in view of their nutraceutical potential. S. Uma, Director, NRCB, emphasised the need for adopting latest technologies to convert waste into innovative, high value products. Ravindra Naik, Principal Scientist, Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Coimbatore Regional Centre, demonstrated the high throughput semi-automatic fiber extraction on-farm machine which was developed by the centre in collaboration with NRCB and technical support of a Coimbatore-based industry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nrcb-announces-initiative-to-utilise-banana-waste/article33837942.ece
15 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Steady rise in occupancy at retiring rooms in Tiruchi railway junction||More than a month after the lockdown was relaxed, occupancy at the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) retiring rooms at the Tiruchi railway junction meant for short stays for train travellers has begun to improve. Although 10 retiring rooms were initially reopened in December last to gauge the extent of occupancy during the pandemic, the steady footfall of visitors and the demand has encouraged the IRCTC to open the remaining rooms now. The retiring rooms which remained shut for travellers in view of the pandemic were reopened on December 24 last year following relaxations in the lockdown norms and resumption of some special express trains across the country including some from Tiruchi Junction. Ever since it was reopened, the occupancy in the retiring rooms has been gradually increasing. The average occupancy of the rooms was above 60 %, says a senior official adding that the footfalls were high some times during weekends and sometimes on ordinary days too. There are AC deluxe and super deluxe rooms, AC suite room, AC deluxe family rooms and AC dormitories for men and women separately. The tariff depends on duration of the stay. The stay ranges from three hours to 48 hours for passengers and bookings have to be done online. However, some bookings were being done offline for passengers with reserved tickets. Passengers from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka who came to visit Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple had stayed at the retiring rooms, the official said. Some transit passengers who board the Tiruchi - Howrah Express from here also stay in these rooms. Despite the operation of a limited number of train services during the pandemic, the occupancy is picking up. Occupancy would rise further once more trains were introduced via Tiruchi, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/steady-rise-in-occupancy-at-retiring-rooms-in-tiruchi-railway-junction/article33837952.ece

Sasikala, aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, contesting the forthcoming assembly elections. “We are taking some efforts legally and if we emerge victorious, Ms. Sasikala would definitely contest the polls,” Mr. Dhinakaran told reporters at Orathanadu in Thanjavur district. On when Ms. Sasikala would meet the people, the AMMK leader said doctors had advised her rest after the COVID-19 infection and she would come out after taking enough rest.  ‘Evil force’ Stating that he would contest the upcoming assembly elections, Mr. Dhinakaran made it clear that his party was consistently fighting to prevent the “evil force” Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam from coming to power. He claimed that the real foot soldiers of Amma were with the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam and that his target was to bring “Amma Aatchi” and serve the people. People of the State had voted in different ways in Lok Sabha polls and for the Assembly elections, he further said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/legal-efforts-being-made-to-help-sasikala-contest-polls-says-ttv/article33837851.ece
15 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Halt arbitrary recruitment process in government colleges, says teachers’ body||Several doctorate degree holders and temporary faculty in government-aided and private colleges on Friday uploaded their voice messages on social media platforms requesting the Chief Minister’s Office to restrain the higher education department from going ahead with its “arbitrary” move to regularise services of a section of guest lecturers in government colleges. Since teachers in private colleges do not have any association to espouse their cause, informal meetings are being conducted region-wise under the aegis of Tamil Nadu Private Colleges, Aided and University Guest Lecturers and Research Scholars Coordination Committee to decide on the further course of action. The coordination committee has emphasised that regularisation of services of government lecturers must be carried out only through the Teachers’ Recruitment Board. Though the government has passed an order to this effect, it has not surfaced in the public domain as yet. Access to the government order or any appointment order issued by the Higher Education Department will be essential for the aggrieved teachers who are now in a ‘wait and watch] mode on seeking legal remedy, S. Tamilarasan, coordinator of the committee, said. There are several thousands of eligible candidates other than the guest lecturers in government colleges for the posts to be filled. Even for teachers in private colleges, landing a job in government colleges is a logical course, Mr. Tamilarasan said. Teachers of high mettle have been selected on two occasions in the past by TRB for appointment in government colleges. There is no reason why the system of recruitment in government colleges should not be retained. The government must realise that the career prospects of several thousands of ad hoc teachers in over 140 government-aided colleges and 850 plus private colleges must also be factored in, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/halt-arbitrary-recruitment-process-in-government-colleges-says-teachers-body/article33837950.ece

15 February 2021||Tirupathur,TAMIL NADU||Keeping an art form alive||With menacing moustaches, heavy make-up, colourful dresses and a handful dressed as female mythological characters, a few men wait behind a stage to perform at Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s public meeting in Tirupathur on Wednesday. Around them stand a group of children, looking at their attire with curiosity. The men are construction workers from Mookuner Pudur in Tirupathur district who earn a living by performing Theru Koothu (street play). They also teach the traditional art form free of cost to interested students. Among them is S. Tamil Arasu, a 37-year-old vaathiyar (teacher) of the Theru Koothu troupe, Gokula Kannan Nataka Sabha, in Mookanur Pudhur near Pudupettai in Tirupathur district. He works at a construction site to make ends meet. “This is the first performance for a political party this year. We perform plays like the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, Kanda Puranam and Shiva Puranam. Sometimes, the parties ask us to give a political angle to the play, sometimes they ask us to just give a dance performance to keep the audience occupied,” says Mr. Tamil Arasu, who has been teaching the art form for the past 18 years. Stipend to students A minimum of eight persons perform in a play. “Each of us get at least Rs. 1,000 per play and after our expenses, we save Rs. 500. We pool in this amount to pay stipends to students who come to learn the art form from us. We don’t charge the students anything,” he says. He adds that many college students from Tirupathur are now coming forward to learn the art from his school. “After March, we get many bookings for temple festivals. During COVID-19 we suffered a lot,” says R. Pandithurai, another troupe member who was dressed as a female mythological character. The troupe members feel that it would be great if the government extends some help for them. “Our earnings are spent on transport itself. We are doing this to keep a traditional art form from dying,” says Mr. Tamil Arasu before getting on to the stage dressed as a character from the Mahabharata.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/keeping-an-art-form-alive/article33837838.ece

He was suffering from age-related health complications, his family sources said. He was a stringer for The Hindu for over two decades, covering Bidar district. He was the founder editor of Daman, the first Hindi newspaper from Kalyan Karnataka region, that he started in 1969. A graduate in journalism from Osmania University, he served as the District Information and Publicity Officer in Mysore State. He resigned from his post to start his own newspaper. He served The Hindu from 1970 to 1997. His reports from the ground about the anti-Sikh riots of 1988 were noticed by the human rights commission that looked into the issue. Mr. Patil’s reporting of the flood and famine of the 1970s brought out the pain of the people in North Karnataka. He always campaigned for the development of the backward districts of the north eastern region. D.M. Nanjundappa Commission for studying the regional imbalance quoted from his articles in some chapters. He edited Daman, the Hindi newspaper, with a great local focus and took a stand with a pro-people outlook. He was feared and respected widely across Kalyan Karnataka region for his investigative stories and fierce editorials.  His final rites will be held at the crematorium near the Jharni Narasimha temple in Bidar on Monday, said his son Mahesh Patil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vishwanath-baburao-patil-passes-away/article33837995.ece

I will ensure that it happens. It is my personal responsibility,” Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said in Belagavi on Sunday. He said that he would ensure that the workers of other parties who have won gram panchayat polls joined the BJP. “That is the reason, I appeal to you not to fight with gram panchayat members who have won from other parties. They will soon be your colleagues in the BJP. Most of the Congress workers who have won now are my followers. I will speak to them to join the BJP,” he said. He also asked gram panchayat members of different parties to work for the development of their villages without differences. He criticised Congress MLA from the rural constituency Lakshmi Hebbalkar for accusing him of interfering in her constituency. “I am the district in-charge Minister and I want the whole district to develop. I am not playing politics over this,” he said. Most leaders spoke against Ms. Hebbalkar. Mahantesh Kavatagimath , MLC, asked the people not to believe the MLA’s claims of getting MGNREGA works in their villages. That is a Centrally-funded scheme, he said. Sanjay Patil, former MLA, asked the people to follow Mr. Jarkiholi and not Ms. Hebbalkar. “Follow the tiger and not the sheep,’’ he said.

They are all ready to join the BJP. If you know who they are, you will be surprised,” he said while addressing a programme held to felicitate newly elected gram panchayat members backed by the BJP. The Minister’s remarks are being seen as a response to rumours that he is considering going back to the Congress. “It is true that I speak to Siddaramaiah, Congress leader and former Chief Minister, twice a day. That is because I consider him as my leader even today. I have very good personal relations with him. But that does not mean I am going to the Congress. I will bring more Congress leaders into the BJP, rather than going back,” he said. “Earlier, I led a team of 17 Congress MLAs to the BJP to make sure that the party came to power in Karnataka. I still hold that clout. I can get the top five leaders of the Congress to resign. I can also get such leaders into the BJP,” he said. He criticised Lakshmi Hebbalkar, Congress MLA, for her complaints that he was concentrating on her segment of Belagavi Rural.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/can-make-5-more-mlas-quit-congress-jarkiholi/article33837791.ece

15 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Study finds high seroprevalence of antibodies in D.J. Halli slum||A study conducted by a team of doctors from Bangalore Baptist Hospital in the city’s D.J. Hallislum during the last week of August and early September found an overall 57.9% seroprevalence of IgG antibody against COVID-19. This means over half the population in the slum had been exposed to the virus by September. The findings of the study, which have been accepted for publication in Epidemiology and Infection , a peer-reviewed medical journal, are consistent with a study conducted in slums in Mumbai, where a prevalence of 57% was noted three months past the index case. Conducted two weeks after the violence in D.J. Halli, this is the first seroprevalence study from a slum in South India and the second in India. “About one-thirds of the 499 people surveyed in the slum had co-morbidities and 95.2% of them were asymptomatic. Hypertension (19.2%) and diabetes (15.4%) were reported as the most common co-morbidities. A majority of the people reported frequent use of hand sanitisers (97.8%) and face covers (88.4%),” Carolin Elizabeth George, lead author of the study, told The Hindu . Although seroprevalence among participants with diabetes and hypertension was 62.3% and 66.6%, respectively, the association with seropositivity was not significant. “Among the seropositive individuals, 41.6% had a history of an infected family member, and 33.3% had a history of exposure to a person with COVID-19 in the past,” she said. Case-to-infection ratio   The study found a high case-to-infection ratio (CIR) with 195 undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was calculated at 2.94 per 10,000 infections, said Dr. George, who heads the Department of Community Health at the hospital. “If we extrapolate our findings to the entire D.J. Halli slum, 57,900 people would have contracted the infection, as against the 295 cases officially reported by the State. This is no surprise, as the hazardous physical environment, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and the impracticability of social distancing, hand washing, and using face covers in slums are conducive to a rapid spread of infection,” she said. As over 95% of the surveyed individuals were asymptomatic, they harboured and dispersed the infection without being caught by tests or inviting medical attention. Although the State had also done a seroprevalence survey in all the 30 districts in September, it had not included the slums. This survey had shown that 16.4% had developed antibodies against COVID-19. The case-to-infection ratio (CIR) in the State’s seroprevalence survey was 1:40. “Our CIR being higher than that in other surveys can be attributed to the low testing rates at the beginning of the epidemic,” the doctor said. What it means “It suggests that the worst is over. It is a relief to realise that the virus spared most lives in this slum as a large chunk of the population here was young. With more than half of the population already being infected, the infection curve is likely to have started its journey down, and COVID-19 may cease to be a public health problem in D.J. Halli. This is confirmed by the low COVID-19 test positivity rate (1.5% to 2%) despite adequate testing (2,000 tests per million/day) from this slum in the past one and a half months,” Dr. George said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/study-finds-high-seroprevalence-of-antibodies-in-dj-halli-slum/article33837766.ece
15 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bleak future for taxi drivers||When taxi driver Kumar H.R. took a loan to purchase a vehicle, it was a first step towards building a secure future. The COVID-19 pandemic shattered those dreams, and he was forced to sell his vehicle as he did not have the financial resources to repay the loan. He returned to his native place in Hassan and remained there for six months while the COVID-19 virus took its toll on society. Two months ago, when the number of cases started to drop, he returned to Bengaluru and got a taxi by paying a daily rental. However, the increasing price of diesel is eating into his meagre profit. Last year around this time, diesel was selling at Rs. 68 per litre, but on Sunday the price was Rs. 83.81, while the per litre price of petrol was almost Rs. 92. “It is very difficult to explain what taxi drivers are going through. I returned to Bengaluru, but I am hardly getting any bookings. My daily earnings don’t cross Rs. 500 despite spending the whole day in traffic. The rising fuel price has made life worse for us. We hardly get Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kilometre from the aggregator. The rates fixed by the government are never implemented properly,” he alleged. Taxi drivers say that a large chunk of their earning goes towards fuel and maintenance of the vehicle. According to K. Somashekar, president of Namma Chalakara Trade Union, taxi drivers are yet to recover from the loss incurred during the lockdown, and business remains slow. “After the imposition of the lockdown, many drivers could not repay the loan and sold their vehicles. Only around 50% are running on the road, and they are not getting decent bookings,” he said. “The State government itself is struggling to maintain road transport corporations, and is not in a position to pay salaries. Just imagine the plight of taxi drivers.” Unions are unhappy with the response from both the Centre and the State. “Governments have hardly done anything to come to the rescue of taxi drivers who are going through a lot of financial distress. The increasing fuel price is making the situation worse for them,” he added. The applies not only to drivers who have attached their vehicles with aggregators. The consecutive rise in price of fuel has hit tourist and goods vehicle operators, too. K Radhakrishna Holla, president of the Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association, said, “The governments should stop relying heavily on taxes on fuel, and find other sources of revenue. We were given road tax exemption only for 58 days, and no other relaxation. We are now running only 50% of vehicles, as there are no bookings from companies due to work from home.” According to Mr. Holla, they are in no position to charge customers more. “If we increase our rates, we end up losing bookings,” he said. ( This is the last of the three-part series on the impact of rising fuel prices )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bleak-future-for-taxi-drivers/article33837761.ece
15 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Congress leaders to tour 100 segments to mobilise people||Amid agitation by some communities seeking enhanced reservation in government jobs and education, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar are expected to tour at least 100 Legislative Assembly constituencies, where the partylost in the 2018 elections, to lend a voice to the demands for quota and support the interests of “ignored” sections of society. After Budget session Sources in the party said both the leaders would, in such constituencies, extend support to the marginalised sections, largely belonging to the OBC category, to make their voices heard. Both of them would undertake the tours after the Budget session of the State legislature next month. The plan is to not only to unite the marginalised sections of society but also lend support to genuine demands for reservation of some castes, sources said. The Congress has decided to extend support for reservation demands of Kurubas, Valmikis, Panchamasali, and many other sub-castes. Though the Supreme Court has fixed the quota limit at 50%, there has been a growing demand from Kuruba and Valmiki leaders for either reclassification or enhancement of reservation. Congress leaders, besides some from within the BJP, including Ministers, have supported these demands. Two days ago, Mr. Shivakumar tweeted, “Congress party is always with the Valmiki community. The community was given reservation in politics during the UPA regime. It should get reservation in education as well in jobs. Justice Nagmohan Das Committee was constituted by the Congress. We will be with you in a fight seeking implementation of the report.” Though Mr. Siddaramaiah did not participate in the Kuruba community rally in Bengaluru last week, leaders visitedhis house and felicitated him seeking his support for getting ST tag for the community. OBC rallies? When asked about the party’s plan on holding rallies on the lines of AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes, and Dalits), the former Minister H.C. Mahadevappa, loyalist of Mr. Siddaramaiah, told The Hindu that as of now there was no proposal to hold such rallies. A section of the party leaders are believed to have not favoured such rallies. However, party leaders would embark on rallies and protests to mobilise people against the State and Central governments for “faulty” anti-cow slaughter law and farm laws and make efforts to augment the party’s base in OBC and Dalit sections, Mr. Mahadevappa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-leaders-to-tour-100-segments-to-mobilise-people/article33837787.ece
15 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘BJP had opposed quota’||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Sunday said BJP leaders who had consistently opposed reservation were now queuing up to raise the issue. “Is this a prompt realisation or an attempt to mislead the social justice movement as part of a political conspiracy? Who immolated in protest against the Mandal Commission report? Who hit the streets opposing reservation in higher education? Which party does Rama Jois, who questioned reservation in local bodies, belong to? Will you answer,” he asked the BJP in a series of tweets. “Why is the Sangh Parivar, which was speaking of Hindus as one, now sponsoring caste conventions? Will someone answer?” The Sangh Parivar leaders, who are unable to oppose the reservation, are creating confusion and burning bridges between communities. “Gullible people should not fall into the trap.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-had-opposed-quota/article33837792.ece
15 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Disha Ravi arrest: ‘Police didn’t follow due process’||Disha A. Ravi, 22, who was arrested by the Delhi police in connection with the Greta Thunberg ‘toolkit’ case on Saturday, has been a prominent young voice on environmental issues in the city for nearly three years. In 2019, Ms. Disha, then a student of Mount Carmel College, was one of the co-founders of Fridays For Future (FFF), India, an initiative led by Ms. Thunberg. One of her friends said that as she hailed from an agricultural family, concern for the environment and climate change came naturally to her. Ms. Disha also saw the ongoing farmers’ protests as part of the climate change crisis, sources said. As part of the FFF, she was also active in creating awareness on the new draft of Environment Impact Assessment Notification-2020. Incidentally, the campaign ran into trouble with the Delhi police last year, who issued notices to the FFF under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and later the Information Technology Act, before withdrawing both later. Disha’s work for FFF saw her profiled by international publications such as The Guardian and British Vogue . “It is not a matter of just fighting for our future; it’s also about fighting for our present. We are experiencing the climate crisis every day,” she had told Vogue in September 2020. She turned vegan a year ago, as a stand against cruelty to animals, and works at a vegan milk startup in the city. She was very active in several campaigns against tree felling in the city and saw a climate crisis unfolding in the city. Condemned Her arrest in connection with the ‘toolkit’ case has drawn strong condemnation from the city’s civil society. Officials of the Delhi police came knocking on her house in Soladevanahalli, where she lived with her single mother, on Saturday noon. “They told the mother that they were taking her for questioning. But the next thing we knew, she was put on a plane and taken to Delhi, where she was reportedly arrested,” said a source who did not want to be named. Multiple sources in the city police confirmed that the local police were not kept in the loop and did not know of the development until Ms. Disha was out of the city. The police refused to comment officially on the issue. “The Delhi police have come and taken a brave daughter of the State without adhering to due process. The authorities, including the Home Minister and the Chief Minister, did nothing to stop it,” said Leo Saldanha, from the Environment Support Group. Another activist, advocate Vinay Sreenivasa, said multiple High Court orders on the procedure to be followed while detaining a person in another State, including serving the accused a copy of the FIR in the regional language, were violated. “But the basic question remains — what is wrong with sharing a toolkit for a protest? How can it be a seditious act?” he asked. Ms. Disha’s mother and her counsel declined to speak to the media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/disha-ravi-arrest-police-didnt-follow-due-process/article33837756.ece

Yediyurappa has instructed officers not to stop the transportation of sand and jelly extracted legally as the materials were required for development works. He gave this instruction at a Karnataka Development Programme review meeting at Shikaripur, the constituency he represents, on Sunday. The excavation and transportation activities done legally with licenses issued by the competent authority should not be disturbed. The departments should not delay in issuing no-objection certificates for the needy. “The officers have to take action against only those into illegal activities,” he said. The CM told the officers to ensure all the works that were approved in the current financial year should be completed before March this year. “The officers should ensure good quality work,” he said. He also instructed the officers not to take up dredging work as tanks were full following good rains. “There should not be any scope for misappropriation of funds in the name of silt removal,” he said. Shivamogga Lok Sabha member B.Y. Raghavendra directed the officers to identify suitable land for graveyards in all villages of the district.

15 February 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Hucheshwara temple at Halebid suffers damage||The structure of the Hoysala period Hucheshwara temple at Halebid suffered damage after plants and shrubs grown around the structure were put on fire. Workers hired by the local office of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to clear the vegetation set the plants ablaze on Friday, ignoring the guidelines meant for clearing the vegetation around a protected monument. The temple located close to Hoysaleshwara temple is more than 900 years old. Following the incident, the structure’s surface has turned dark. Local people have expressed anger over the incident and blamed the negligence of ASI officers for the damage. When The Hindu contacted Conservation Assistant at Halebid Kishor Kumar Reddy, he said some workers committed the mistake while clearing the vegetation. “It is a small issue, nothing serious. There is no serious damage to the temple structure,” he said. When reporters reached the spot on Sunday morning, they were not allowed to get inside the complex. Nobody was allowed to take pictures of the structure on Sunday. It is said the officers tried to clean up the area with the help of workers. An officer of the ASI told The Hindu that clearance of vegetation in any monument had to be done systematically. “The officer concerned has to take permission from the department and take up the work as per the norms. Workers have to clear the plants, if any, manually, without using machines. And, there is no provision to set ablaze the green waste,” he said. Superintendent Archaeologist Shivakant Bajpai and other senior officers visited the spot on Sunday. The office of the Director- General of the ASI is said to have collected information about the incident from local officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hucheshwara-temple-at-halebid-suffers-damage/article33837796.ece

15 February 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Protest in Dharwad against fuel price hike, farm laws||Seeking immediate steps to check the soaring fuel prices and repeal of the three new farm laws, Congress workers took out a protest rally and staged a demonstration in Dharwad on Saturday. The Congress workers marched to the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad and staged the demonstration in front of it raising slogans against the Union government for what they termed as its apathy towards the commoners. Leading the protest, Congress leaders Ismail Tamatgar, Deepak Chinchore, Basavaraj Malkari, Devaki Yoganand, Deepa Gouri, Vasanth Arkachari and others strongly condemned what they termed as anti-people and anti-farmer policies of the BJP-led Union government. The protesters said that the three new farm laws had been passed without any consultation with stakeholders and they were detrimental to the interests of the farming community. Despite the farmers protest extending over two months, the Union government had been adamant and had failed to reach out to the protesting farmers, they added. The protestors raised slogans against the Union government for failing to check the fuel prices. They said that the BJP leaders who used to take to the streets every now and then over the fuel price hike when they were in the Opposition, had become silent now when the fuel prices were almost nearing Rs. 100 a litre. They demanded immediate cut in excise duty and taxes on fuel prices to mitigate the sufferings of the common people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-in-dharwad-against-fuel-price-hike-farm-laws/article33837991.ece
15 February 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Preparations on for agitations seeking AIIMS for Kalaburagi||Following the Union government’s declaration of its preference to Hubballi-Dharwad over Kalaburagi for the establishment of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), social and political activists in Kalaburagi have started preparations to organise a series of activities ranging from taking a delegation to the government to launching agitations demanding that the premier institute be set up in their city. In a meeting convened by Hyderabad Karnataka Janapara Sanhgarsha Samiti president Laxman Dasti here recently to discuss the future course of action, representatives from different political parties, including the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Janata Dal (Secular), the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), declared their support to the agitations that are being planned. Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey had, in his response to a question raised by Shobha Karandlaje, Lok Sabha member from Udupi-Chikmagalur, recently, said that the State government had offered a site at Hubballi-Dharwad for setting up AIIMS. He also made it clear that the State government’s earlier proposal to upgrade the ESIC Hospital in Kalaburagi to AIIMS has been turned down. “The Union government’s preference to Hubballi-Dharwad over Kalaburagi for the establishment of AIIMS is continued negligence of the development of Kalyana Karnataka. While the other areas, including Bombay Karnataka, are getting one development project after the other, Kalyana Karnataka’s long-pending demands have remained unfulfilled. The establishment of a Railway Division in Kalaburagi, a Secretariat for the implementation of Special Status accorded to the region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution and National Investment and Manufacturing Zone are some of the projects that are not being considered by the government,” Mr. Dasti told the meeting. CPI leader Mahesh Rathod cast doubts on the seriousness of the BJP governments in the State and at the Centre towards the development of the region. He strongly proposed to build a mass movement organising multiple agitations and involving people from all walks of life. “We cannot expect the BJP to do something good to the region. The BJP doesn’t believe in democracy. Top leaders in that party such as Narendra Modi and Amit Shah never considered the opinions of other leaders and people’s representatives of their own party, leave alone from other parties. I don’t think that they will consider the demands of Kalyana Karnataka leaders to establish AIIMS in Kalaburagi. A mass movement is the only solution to get our voices heard by the people in power,” he said. At the end, it was decided to take an all-party delegation shortly to the State and Union governments demanding that AIIMS be established in Kalaburagi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/preparations-on-for-agitations-seeking-aiims-for-kalaburagi/article33837987.ece

Basavaraddi has advised people to properly practice yoga for maintaining coordination between body and mind. Addressing a Yoga awareness programme organised by Kalyana Karnataka Human Resource, Agriculture and Cultural Society at Bharatiya Vidya Kendra near Sirnur on Sunday, he said that Yoga without spirituality would just be a physical exercise that would not be of great use. “Spirituality and Yoga should go hand in hand. Without spirituality, Yoga would lose its essence and become a physical exercise. Yoga is a science that helps attain coordination between mind and body and benefits both mental and physical health,” he said. Pointing to the growing popularity of Yoga across the world, Dr. Basavaraddi said that 177 countries in the world had accepted the proposal made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe International Yoga Day on June 21 every year. “Since Yoga is a time-tested science, many people across the world are increasingly getting attracted towards it. We are proud that an Indian-origin practice has worldwide acceptance now,” he said. Basavaraj Patil Sedam, senior BJP leader and Chairman of Kalyana Karnataka Human Resource, Agriculture and Cultural Society, who presided over the event, stressed more on adopting a proper lifestyle than Yoga. A team of Yoga practitioners led by Anand and Mahesh from Humnabad in Bidar district demonstrated attractive Yoga Asanas on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proper-yoga-practice-must-for-body-mind-coordination/article33837997.ece

Speaking at a conference on youth rights at Shivasharana Haralaiah Samskritika Bhavan in Kalaburagi on Saturday, Dr. Ustaad said that no government in the last 70 years had taken youth empowerment initiatives seriously. “Youth are facing serious problems such as unemployment. Many political parties ruled the country in the last 70 years. None of them has taken any constructive measures to empower the youth. All they did is using youth force as a vote-bank for capturing political power,” Mr. Ustaad said and called upon the youth to get organised and take to the streets for their rights. Gulbarga University Vice-Chancellor Dayanand Agsar, who inaugurated the event, stressed the need for the youth in understanding their rights enshrined in the Constitution authored by Ambedkar. Ashwini Madankar, an activist-lawyer, expressed concerns over youth increasing spending their valuable time on social media platforms instead of utilising their time for constructive activities. “Youth have always played an important role in changing society for the better. No revolution could be possible without youth power. Unfortunately, the youth are spending their valuable time on social media platforms instead of doing something constructive,” she said. Rukmini Nagannanavar, convenor of the samvada, presented the introductory words.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/support-comes-for-setting-up-youth-empowerment-corpn/article33837990.ece
15 February 2021||Kottigehara (Chikkamagaluru),KARNATAKA||Year and a half on, wait for new bridge continues||The floods that hit parts of Mudigere taluk twice in two years have left people waiting for relief measures from the government. A bridge, across Hemavati river, near Bankenahalli collapsed in the floods caused by heavy rains in August 2019. Since then, the residents of Bankenahalli, Chegu, Kudige and other nearby villages have lost connectivity to Banakal on the Mangaluru-Villupuram highway (NH-234). Nandish, a resident of Bankenahalli, told The Hindu , “The bridge collapsed in the floods in 2019. The locals made a temporary arrangement to cross the river. That too collapsed in the next rains. We have been waiting for a permanent solution for the last 18 months,” he said. The residents took elected representatives, including MLA M.P. Kumaraswamy and Lok Sabha member Shobha Karandlaje, to task during their visit to the spot last year for the delay in sanctioning a bridge. Following protests by residents, the local administration provided them with a metal footbridge last year to cross the river. However, those people commuting by vehicle have to take a longer route that is in a bad state. Travel troubles The growers are finding it difficult to carry their produce. And if somebody falls sick, relatives cannot take them to hospitals within a short period as vehicles cannot cross the river. Harsha, who runs a homestay at Bankenahalli, said he has had no business for the past two years. “People who choose the place to book online avoid it as soon as we inform them that vehicles have to be parked a few meters away andthat they have to walk up to the homestay,” he said.  Meanwhile, officials said the RuralDevelopment and Panchayat Raj Department has decided to take up the construction of the bridge under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). Somashekhar, assistant executive engineer in charge of PMGSY, said that the Government of India has given approval to take up the construction at a cost of Rs. 3.5 crore. The Centre and the State would share the project cost at a ratio of 60:40. “Now, the project hasto be approved by the State Cabinet. Then we can go for the tendering process,” he said. The official is not sure when the construction will begin. However, the locals are worried that if the construction is delayed further, the next rainy season in four months will hold things up for another year.  The bridge collapsed in the floods in 2019. The locals made a temporary arrangement to cross the river.

15 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||5% of 48,000 govt. schools facing threat of closure: Minister||Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada and Minister for Muzrai and Backward Classes Welfare Kota Srinivas Poojary said here on Sunday that 5% of 48,000 government schools in the State are facing the threat of being closed down for want of students in the next three years. Speaking at an open session at the valedictory ceremony of the three-day 24th Dakshina Kannada District Sahitya Sammelan, he said that the threat could be due to craving for English-medium schools or other factors. But the fact is that attendance of students in those 5% schools is very low. The Minister said that the State had about 50,000 schools of which 2,000 schools are private ones. The remaining 48,000 government schools had about two lakh teachers. About one crore children enjoyed mid-day meals in those schools. Earlier, S. Pradeep Kumar Kalkura, president, Dakshina Kannada Sahitya Parishat, reading out the resolutions passed at the sammelan, said that the government should appoint “teachers for every class”. It should also appoint enough non-teaching staff. The appointment of teachers to government schools is not being done scientifically, he said. Mr. Poojary said that the government has reserved 22% of its Budget to the education sector. The Legislative Council has 14 members representing teachers. Earlier, the Minister said that a private member had moved a Bill in the Council making all government employees and elected representatives compulsorily send their children to government schools. But this Bill did not make any headway later and the discussions on the matter has stopped abruptly. “This is because many politicians manage educational institutions,” he said. Responding to a demand from the parishat that every taluk and the district headquarter in Dakshina Kannada should get Kannada Bhavans, the Minister said that the government will reserve land for the bhavan in Mangaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/5-of-48000-govt-schools-facing-threat-of-closure-minister/article33838149.ece
15 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||122 species of birds sighted||The 11th edition of Manipal Bird Day last week saw enthusiastic participation by 78 birders who were able to spot 122 species of birds at the close of the event. Organised by Manipal Birders Group last Sunday, the annual exercise proved to be a great experience to birders who participated in large numbers while adhering to COVID-19 norms. Maintaining social distancing, wearing of face masks and use of hand sanitisers were strictly adhered to. The day began with a Bird Walk at 6.30 a.m. when birders divided themselves into smaller groups of 10-12 members and followed 11 different trails that took them through different terrains such as hills, plains, paddy fields and wetlands. The idea was to sight as many birds as possible and record their presence in the region. By the time the walk ended at around 10 a.m., the different groups had recorded sightings of 122 species of birds. After the walk concluded, the groups gathered at Indrali Temple for a discussion session. New and senior birders shared their experiences about the day and the highlights of what they saw. On this occasion, the formation of Manipal Birding and Conservation Trust (MBAC) was also announced. The trust will focus on conservation of trails in and around Manipal. A few butterfly hosting plants were also distributed. Participants were given hand-painted bookmarks as a souvenir. The bird species spotted during the day included Asian Brown Fly Catcher, Black Rumped Flame Back Woodpecker, Black-headed IBIS, Orange-breasted Green Pigeon, Plum-headed Parakeet, Spur Fowl, White Browed Bulbul to name a few. Manipal Birders Club conducts regular birding sessions every Sunday at 6.30 a.m. and visits different locations around Manipal to record birds. Tejasvi S.Acharya from Manipal Birders Club said that sighting of Eurasian Hoopoe excited birders as they are spotting this winter migrant after a gap of two years. As many as 20 of the birders for this annual exercise, including six children, were newcomers and the rest were regulars, he said.

15 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. urged to declare Yakshagana as an art form of the State||The three-day 24th Dakshina Kannada District Sahitya Sammelan which concluded here on Sunday urged the government to declare Yakshagana as a representative art form of the State. Reading out the resolutions passed in the sammelan, president of Dakshina Kannada Sahitya Parishat S. Pradeep Kumar Kalkura said that the State government should also declare Tulu as a language of the State. The sammelan said that development projects in the district should not be taken up at the cost of environment. The sammelan urged the government to construct a ranga mandir in Mangaluru at the earliest. The move to build the ranga mandir has not made any headway and the government should take it up on priority, the sammelan said. It also demanded a Kannada Bhavan for Mangaluru and Kannada bhavans in each one of the taluks. Speaking at the valedictory function, scholar B.A. Vivek Rai supported the demand of the sammelan for a ranga mandir and a Kannada Bhavan. Mr. Rai, formerly Vice-Chancellor of Kannada University, Hampi, and Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), said that having the Town Hall in the city is not enough for all activities and a ranga mandir should be built at the earliest. Like in Bengaluru, the Kannada Bhavan can also house a library, he said and added that it should house all types of Kannada books, including books on classic Kannada literature. Mr. Rai suggested that Kannada-medium schools could be supported and developed on public-private partnership by taking help from donors. Many Kannada-medium schools, mainly in the government sector, needed support to meet the challenges of modern education. They required Information Technology tools on par with other schools managed by private establishments. Each such school might require an investment of up to Rs. 30 lakh which could be collected from donors. President of the sammelan scholar M. Prabhakara Joshi was felicitated on the occasion.  One of the resolutions passed said that development projects in the district should not be taken up at the cost of environment||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-urged-to-declare-yakshagana-as-an-art-form-of-the-state/article33838146.ece

15 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Minister to discuss special permission for zoos to procure beef||Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Sunday said he would discuss with the government whether the zoos in the State could be given any special permission to procure beef for their carnivores with the anti-cow slaughter law coming into effect in the State. The zoos, including Mysuru zoo, were largely dependent on beef for feeding carnivores like tigers and lions. With the ban, beef has been replaced with chicken. Speaking to reporters after visiting the Mysuru zoo, Mr. Somashekar said Minister for Forests Arvind Limbavali was coming to his constituency – Yeshwanthpur – in connection with a programme soon. “I will take up the matter with him and seek to know whether any provision can be made to ensure beef supply to the zoos having carnivores for their feeding,” he said, in reply to a query. Civic felicitation Mr. Somashekar said he was planning to hold a civic felicitation (Poura Sanmana) to Sudha Murthy, Chairperson, Infosys Foundation for her support to restore the Hebbal lake spending nearly Rs. 105 crore and also her contribution to the Mysuru zoo to the tune of Rs. 3 crore. Lockdown impact The zoo was in a crisis following its closure during the lockdown and is yet to get back the same number of visitors post-pandemic. “In recognition of her gesture, we have thought of honoring her,” he replied. He visited the zoo today to see the works had been taken up from the contributions and check on the construction of an enclosure following a donation from the RBI and added that the works are expected to be done by March-April. Expressing satisfaction that the footfalls are on the rise in the zoo post-pandemic, he said the zoo’s revenue was also recovering. Animal adoption “Whoever had adopted the animals under the animal adoption scheme during the lockdown to support the zoo financially, will be encouraged to renew their adoption in the interest of the zoo,” said the Minister, who played a key role in getting funds from his constituency and also from other constituencies represented by the Ministers in the B.S. Yediyurappa cabinet when the zoo was facing serious revenue crisis. Gate collection Mr. Somashekar said the zoo’s annual gate collection was around Rs. 59 crore which dropped to Rs. 17 crore because of the impact of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minister-to-discuss-special-permission-for-zoos-to-procure-beef/article33838175.ece

After receiving instructions from the headequarters, the Central workshop of South Western Railway in Mysuru took up the work and renovated the lift. The cradle-lifting mechanism was provided with locking and anti-fall arrangement. A new ladder with anti-skid plates and hand rail were also provided, the press statement said. 45 days With additional propping arrangement, rigidity was provided to the structure. The whole unit has also been painted without affecting its antique look. The entire work on the heritage carriage cum lift was completed in 45 days.

15 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Fresh demand for Mysuru Dasara authority||Every year, ahead of the State Budget, the demand for a Mysuru Dasara Authority, a permanent body for organising the Dasara festivities in Mysuru, comes to the fore. And every time it gets no budget approval, forcing tourism stakeholders to press for the same demand next year. This time too, the stakeholders, especially the Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association, have urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was in Mysuru on Saturday, to announce the authority. In addition, they have sought a Mysuru Tourism Development Authority with Mysuru being the State’s most preferred tourist hub and lakhs of people reliant on the sector for their livelihood. The idea of the Dasara authority never took off although it is always talked about whenever festivities approach. The authority was sought to overcome confusion and prepare for the festivities at the eleventh hour. In response to the demand, Minister in charge of Mysuru S.T. Somashekar said the proposal is before the government and efforts would be made to give it a fresh impetus.   Hotel Owners’ Association president Narayana Gowda has also raised the issue of the film city which was out of Mysuru although land was allotted for the the project here. The CM was urged to retain the project in Mysuru. In the 2020-21 budget, Mr. Yediyurappa announced the film city project at a cost of Rs. 500 crore with private participation in Bengaluru. However, he did not allocate funds to the project as it was seemingly going to be a ‘private-funded’ facility. With no clarity yet on the project, stakeholders said Mysuru seems to have lost the race for the film city. Himmavu, near Mysuru, under Varuna constituency represented by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for two terms and now by his son Yathindra, was identified for the project. But efforts to move it closer to Bengaluru, the hub of Sandalwood, continued after Mr. Siddaramaiah’s tenure. One of the reasons cited for moving the project to Ramanagaram, when H.D. Kumaraswamy was CM, was that the industry and people dependent on it were based in Bengaluru and it was convenient for them. After the BJP government came to power, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan had spoken about setting up the film city in Bengaluru, causing doubts about the project in Mysuru. Stakeholders here had launched an online campaign to keep Mysuru as the site for the project. But their efforts failed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fresh-demand-for-mysuru-dasara-authority/article33838169.ece
15 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Minority panel vice-chairman to hear grievances||The vice-chairman of the National Commission for Minorities, Atif Rasheed, will hold meetings with government officials on the implementation of programmes for minorities and hear out the grievances of the communities during his three-day visit to the State. Mr. Rasheed began his three-day visit of Karnataka on Sunday with a visit to Gumbaz, the mausoleum of Tipu Sultan in Srirangapatna near here that is over two-centuries old. He is scheduled to hold a meeting with Chief Secretary Ravi Kumar and other government officials on the implementation of the Prime Minister’s new 15-point programme on minority welfare. Mr. Rasheed, who is also the officiating chairman of the commission, told reporters that he would examine the extent of usage of funds sanctioned by the Union and State governments for minority welfare. He also said the objective of the visit was to fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of “ sab ka saath, sab ka vikas and sab ka vishwas ”. The commission will also act against complaints of discrimination against any of the six minority communities of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists, and Parsis. “Whichever community gives us a representation in writing,we will act,” he said. When his attention was drawn to the perceived anti-minority laws such as the ‘love jihad’ and the anti-cow slaughter law in force in different States, he said the commission had not received any complaints on them. With regard to triple talaq, Mr. Rasheed said the number of complaints had come down drastically from a couple of thousands every year to 24 to 25 since 2018-19. Budgetary allocation When asked about the downsizing of the budgetary allocation for minorities in the Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said the funds earmarked for various development works last year could not be utilised because of COVID-19 and even the allocation set aside for minority affairs could not be used. “When the funds are utilised, the budgetary allocation goes up. And when it is not used, it will come down,” he said, expressing hope that it would go up in the future. Mr. Rasheed also pointed out that the allocation for minority welfare had gone up from Rs. 2,600 crore before Mr. Modi became Prime Minister to almost Rs. 6,000 crore. With regard to the post of the chairman of National Commission for Minorities remaining vacant since July 2020, Mr. Rasheed said the matter was left to the PM.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minority-panel-vice-chairman-to-hear-grievances/article33838002.ece

They will be focusing on ensuring segregation of waste and keeping a check on black spots across all 198 wards in the city in the light of the ongoing Swachh Survekshan 2021. The civic machinery seems to be focused on ensuring a better ranking this year. Though adjudged as the best ‘Self-Sustainable Mega City’, Bengaluru’s rank fell from 194 (2019) to 214 in 2020. BBMP Chief Marshal Col. (retd.) Rajbir Singh said, “Marshals have not been levying fines on citizens for not wearing masks or not maintaining social distance.” However, the BBMP has ensured that some monitoring mechanisms remain to keep a check on citizens. “There are 54 special teams to ensure that mask wearing and social distancing protocols are being adhered to by citizens. These teams work in two shifts every day in the 27 divisions [Assembly constituencies] in the city,” said Mr. Singh. These special teams, each with four members, will be in place at least till the end of March. “By the end of March, the second phase of vaccinations against COVID-19 is likely to be completed,” he said, adding that, by and large, the number of violations had come down. “The compliance among citizens to COVID-19 protocols has seen an improvement, with over 90% wearing masks in public places.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/marshals-no-longer-monitoring-wearing-of-mask/article33837759.ece

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||The issue of soaring fuel prices, given the vociferous protests held by BJP leaders when they were not in power, is causing much embarrassment to partymen. Given that Hubballi–Dharwad had seen a series of intense protests by the BJP during the UPA regime, any mention of the issue makes partymen speechless. Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar found himself in a similar situation recently when reporters reminded him about the “bullock cart protests” that he had led whenever there was fuel price hike during the UPA regime. Caught off-guard, Mr. Shettar reluctantly admitted that there was burden on the common people owing to the hike, but had no answer on what remedy would be offered. He said the party would take “suitable decision at an appropriate time” to mitigate the sufferings of common people. Looks like there is a long wait ahead for the common people.   People were forced to have simple weddings during the pandemic with limited guests. Now that things are limping back to normal, weddings are again a grand affair with invitees running to several thousands. Speaking at an event, Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah rued how 30 to 40 food items are served for guests attending marriages and it is a “national waste”. Earlier, in villages, it was largely an anna-sambar affair with some add ons such as papad , he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the government could as well have continued the norm of conducting simple marriages. During his 40-year political career, he had conducted weddings of his brothers and their sons in the village, Mr. Siddaramaiah recalled, and opposed display of wealth during weddings. Not many remember a private member Bill introduced by Congress MLA K.R. Ramesh Kumar during the Siddaramaiah government in 2015 seeking to stop excessive show of riches. Needless to say it got no support from the fellow legislators.     The issue of neglect of Kannada in Namma Metro in Bengaluru was raised in the Upper House of Parliament by G.C. Chandrashekar of the Congress. Support to him came from Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the Vice-President. The MP said that important notices and instructions in Namma Metro were not given in the local language. Minister for Civil Aviation and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said he was not personally aware of what signage was being used and promised to look into it. At that point, Mr. Naidu intervened and said his advise was to use the local language in all metros, since it is the locals who travel in local trains.

Sudhakaran has said. Mr. Sudhakaran said although Rs. 18 crore had been allocated in the previous years, the work got delayed due to various reasons. He said that the canal would be rejuvenated this year with the support of everyone. The 14.5-km canal, originating from Chungom in Alappuzha municipality, flows through Punnapra North, Punnapra South, Ambalappuzha North and Ambalappuzha South grama panchayats before emptying into the Pookaitha river. It has been reduced to drainage due to waste dumping and encroachments over the years posing a major health risk to people living in its vicinity. The pollution of Kappithode first came to light more than three decades ago when a few students of two schools, situated by the side of the canal, fell ill after breathing poisonous gases from it. Today, the waterbody is filled with all kinds of detritus and its dark water is stagnant posing a health hazard to local residents and students of Government Higher Secondary School and Sree Narayana Vilasom TTI school, both at Kakkazhom. The pollution is mainly due to the solid and liquid wastes being dumped into the canal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rs-16-cr-sanctioned-for-reviving-kappithode/article33838128.ece

15 February 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||A farm story of perseverance, imagination||Around 10 years ago, when farmer suicides cast a shadow on the agriculture sector, M.V. Mohandas, an engineering diploma holder, started scripting a different farm story — one marked by hard work, perseverance, and imagination. Maheshwari Farm, a large-scale dairy farm at Mathamangalam, near Thelampetta, in Wayanad, has set a model worth emulating. The government honoured Mohandas with the Ksheera Sahakari award in 2016 and 2021. He was chosen considering his herd of high-yielding cows, volume of milk production, and scientific breeding methods. Mohandas was at the crossroads after closing his workshop in Ernakulam in 2004. He decided to start a dairy farm with five cows near his house at Kodungalloor in Thrissur. “My father had reared cows in my childhood. Perhaps this might have given me the confidence to set up such a farm,” he says. A visit to Wayanad in 2010 was a turning point as he, charmed by the cool climate, decided to set up a hi-tech dairy farm here. He bought seven acres of fallow land at Mathamangalam village and set up a farm with 38 cows. “I cultivate CO3 variety of fodder, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the dairy,” he says. Now, he has 100 cows and sells 1,000 to 1,300 litre of milk a day. Last year, the farmer sold 3,58,000 litre of milk to the Sulthan Bathery milk cooperative society. Mohandas earns Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 lakh a month and is a model for many dairy farmers in the district. He also provides permanent employment to 10 youths. Four year ago, 48 of his cows were afflicted with foot and mouth disease. However, he was able to tide over the situation with the support of veterinarians. The outbreak of COVID-19 also hit the dairy sector as the farmer was forced to abandon the milk produced on three days as there was no demand. For a dedicated farmer, dairying is still a viable option, Mohandas says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-farm-story-of-perseverance-imagination/article33838092.ece

Vijayaraghavan has said. They have been shaken by the unprecedented development witnessed by the State in the past five years, he told mediapersons on the sidelines of the Vikasana Munnetta Yatra on Sunday. The Statewide yatra of the LDF was launched in Kasaragod on Saturday. The Pinarayi Vijayan-led government was pursuing a policy aimed at development for everyone in Kerala, as against the stated stances of the BJP-led Union government and the UDF. “The UDF and the BJP have joined hands to stymie Kerala’s development. Therefore, the UDF will not speak out even against the anti-people policies of the Union government,” he said. Stance on PSUs Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, who was leading the UDF’s Statewide Aishwarya Kerala Yatra, had said that the front would wipe out everything implemented by the LDF government. “This includes LIFE Mission, which provides housing to the poor, and Kerala Bank,” he said. Through Kerala Bank, the LDF wanted to use the money raised through cooperative banks for the country’s development. “The LDF is keen on protecting public sector units (PSUs),” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-bjp-trying-to-stymie-progress-ldf/article33838106.ece

Alongside, there should be efforts to attract private investment too. At the function to launch five major projects at the Kochi refinery on Sunday, Mr. Vijayan said the cooperation of the State and the Union governments in the implementation of development projects was an example of cooperative federalism. Making inland waterbodies navigable would help promote public transport system, which in turn would benefit environment. The Bekal-Kovalam waterway and the launch of Roll On-Roll Off vessels would be major steps in this direction. The State was always willing to cooperate with the Centre for the implementation of development projects, Mr. Vijayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/strengthen-public-sector-says-cm/article33838094.ece
15 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Traffic islands beneath flyovers put brakes on free flow of vehicles||Protest is brewing against the PWD (NH wing) for unscientific construction of traffic islands beneath the recently commissioned six-lane flyovers at Vyttila and Kundannoor, and for its reluctance in adhering to requests made by the traffic police to chip away a portion of the structures that obstruct the smooth flow of vehicles. Both motorists and the traffic police have been complaining of how traffic islands that jut into the NH bypass at both junctions and the unusually large roundabout at Vyttila occupy considerable space beneath the central spans of the six-lane flyovers. “They obstruct the free flow of vehicles, necessitating more waiting time for vehicles in other directions. The islands beneath the flyovers have been built at right angles, which pose a risk to motorists who turn right or take U-turn at the junctions,” traffic police sources said. The police were thus forced to make multiple changes in the signal timings, especially at Vyttila, since even rule-abiding motorists — who did not jump the red light — are oftentimes unable to cross the junction within the stipulated time. “It was under this circumstance that we shot off letters to the PWD about a month ago to chip away edges of the islands at both Vyttila and Kundannoor, so that vehicles can negotiate turns at the junction in a smooth and safe manner. But little has happened at the ground level,” they added. A senior PWD official said that the agency can undertake the rectification works only if the State government allot funds. “A high-level decision has to be taken on this. In addition, the police watchtower at the entrance to S.A. Road has to be relocated and land occupied by a few shops at the entry point of Kaniampuzha road acquired, in order to widen the road on the eastern side (Thripunithura side) of the flyover. This will free up considerable space at the junction,” he said.  No direction boards Chaos prevails at Kundannoor Junction, since the PWD and RBDCK, the key stakeholders, have not installed direction boards to guide motorists who want to turn towards Maradu or to Willingdon Island, from the junction. Thus, many motorists realise their mistake only after unknowingly entering the flyover. Some of them travel through the entire structure and further a km more to the nearest U-turn, to travel all the way back. There are others who abruptly stop their vehicle to turn or reverse down the flyover, posing danger to other motorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-islands-beneath-flyovers-put-brakes-on-free-flow-of-vehicles/article33838089.ece

This means: “convenience up, commerce up and capacity building up, while resulting in congestion down, pollution down and transport costs down,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, after commissioning the vessels here on Sunday. “Kochi is a city of trade and commerce. The people of this city understand that time is of the essence. They also appreciate the importance of proper connectivity. That is why the dedication of ro-ro vessels to the nation is special,” he added. The vessels were built by Cochin Shipyard at Rs. 12.50 crore a piece. The IWAI has handed them over to city-based Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) for operation. Each of the vessels — christened MV Adi Shankara and MV CV Raman — has a capacity to carry six 20-feet trucks, three 20-feet trailer trucks, three 40-feet trailer trucks and 30 passengers.

15 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Finding value in damaged currencies||A fortnight ago, Shyju Kudyirippil, a numismatist and public relations officer at an Angamaly-based private hospital, had a conversation with a fellow numismatist in Nagpur. It was over the acquisition of four U.S. dollars, which, owing to some error, were conjoined on a single sheet with the wet printing ink spread over them. They were found in a bundle of newly minted one dollar notes taken by a Mumbaikar to a currency exchange. Alerted about the unique currency by his friend working in the Mumbai exchange, Mr. Kudyirippil approached the Mumbaikar who directed him to his numismatist friend in Nagpur to ensure that he got full value for his accidental possession. “The guy from Nagpur said that I could have them for their face value and I obliged adding them to my collection of erroneous and disfigured currencies that now run into more than 300 in addition to similar coins. I try to mark every New Year by securing such currencies or coins and during the last New Year I got hold of a disfigured Rs. 10 coin,” said Mr. Kudyirippil. Unique story He chanced up on the unique hobby after overhearing an argument a passenger was having at the ticket counter at South railway station 26 years ago. The passenger was furious that the staff was not willing to accept a Rs. 100 note on the ground that it appeared fake since the figure wasn’t clear. “It pricked my curiosity, and I had a look at the currency which had all the security features in place, though the figure was not clear. I bought it from the passenger paying him a normal note. Later, when I checked with the Reserve Bank, I came to know that such errors would not render them fake, and that they were still legal tender. Since then, I have been after such error-filled currencies and coins,” he said. Among his collection is a bunch of Indian currencies without the image of Mahatma Gandhi. He even conducted an exhibition of those currencies at a private mall on Gandhi Jayanti Day in 2015. “It was conceived as a message to bring back Gandhian values to everyday life by projecting those currencies as symbolic of how the great man had chosen to walk away from the currencies after being repulsed by illegal purposes ranging from bribery to corruption for which those currencies bearing his image were being used,” said Mr. Kudyirippil. His collection also includes a Rs. 50 note with the image of Indian Parliament sans the national flag on top, notes without serial numbers, and two conjoined notes that look like a butterfly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/finding-value-in-damaged-currencies/article33838081.ece

While over 50% of the children rescued from trains and the station were from Kerala, the rest were from other States, predominantly Bihar. A majority of the rescued children were aged between 15 and 18 years. It was on June 7, 2018, that the RCHD started operating from the first platform of the station as a joint initiative of the district administration, the Ministries of Railway and Women and Child Development, and Sahrudaya Child Welfare Service. It was set up in view of the growing incidents of child exploitation on account of Kochi’s rising profile as a city of opportunities. Three similar help desks operate in Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode and Thrissur. “A majority of the rescued children from within Kerala were found to have fled broken families or run away for trivial reasons such as being scolded or denied desired gadgets. Children from outside are mostly victims of child labour and though they are alone when we rescue them, the presence of their family members or relatives accompanying them in the vicinity could not be ruled out,” said Shano Jose, coordinator, RCHD, Ernakulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/help-desk-at-station-rescues-507-children/article33838086.ece

15 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Long-pending warrants to be executed ahead of polls||The Ernakulam Rural police have launched a special drive to execute Long Pending (LP) warrants within its limits. District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik issued orders in this regard to the heads of all three sub-divisions at Aluva, Perumbavoor, and Muvattupuzha. At last count, 300 LP warrants, including 150 non-bailable warrants, were pending across 34 police stations in Ernakulam Rural. The Aluva East police have already arrested two persons — one who has been evading trial after absconding while on bail in a case related to non-payment of vehicle loan in 2014 and another who had been absconding in an assault case 12 years ago. The move assumes significance in view of the impending Assembly elections, with the Election Commission (EC) issuing directions to vet the electoral roll and clear it of ineligible voters. “We are on the lookout to track down and act against all those against whom LP warrants are pending. In the case of those who cannot be traced, we will submit reports to the District Collectors concerned, who are also the District Election Officers, recommending to erase their names from the electoral rolls, since they are ineligible on account of their status as fugitives from justice,” said Mr Karthik. All Station House Officers (SHOs) within the Ernakulam Rural limits have been asked to dust off crime files and track down those with LP warrants against their names for offences. A list is being drawn up categorising LP warrants by crime heads and police stations concerned. In case the persons concerned are originally from other districts, the District Police Chiefs concerned are being intimated about the LP warrant details with a request to forward them to the jurisdictional police station SHOs concerned to verify their whereabouts and arrest them. “We will also send a team from here, if needed. Just as we are banking on the cooperation of other district police chiefs for executing LP warrants, we will return that favour by acting against fugitives of law hailing from our limits and are wanted in cases there,” Mr. Karthik said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/long-pending-warrants-to-be-executed-ahead-of-polls/article33838090.ece

Cutting across three forest divisions including Punalur, Achankovil and Konni, the 37-km road connects Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts to Mekkarai-Achankovil inter-State route. This is also the shortest route for the pilgrims from Tamil Nadu to reach the temples in Achankovil and Sabarimala. In the 37 kms, the 4.5 km from Alimukku to Karavoor is PWD road while the next 10.5 km distance upto Kottakayam falls under Punalur Forest Division. The road upto Mullumala had been leased to State Farming Corporation while the other stretches come under Punalur Forest Division, Konni Forest Division, Achankovil Forest Division and Piravathur grama panchayat. The project was completed by the Forest Department spending Rs. 13.84 crore. “Since the road comes under different departments, the entire stretch was never renovated at the same time. It was left in a pathetic condition for more than one decade and the residents had been struggling. It takes nearly three hours to cover around 40 kms and bus services are also minimal due to the condition of the road,” said an official. More than 3,000 residents living in two wards of Aryankavu panchayat are completely dependent on the road and they have been facing connectivity issues for several years. “There have been many complaints regarding the condition of the road and some residents had lost their lives due to the lack of timely medical assistance. The residents of Chembanaruvi village that falls under Konni forest division will also benefit from this road,” he added. Apart from bringing cheer to the residents, the road is expected to boost tourism in the area and expedite development in the tribal region. 4 lakh pilgrims “Nearly 4 lakh of pilgrims from Tamil Nadu visit Achankovil temple every year and an equal number of tourists come to Kumbhavurutty waterfalls. This road can be developed as a tourism circuit as it also offers access to Konni eco-tourism centre,” he said.

He declared open a gender museum, gender library, convention centre, and an amphitheatre that form the first phase of the pioneering project aimed at boosting gender equality in the subcontinent. The Chief Minister also laid the foundation stone for an International Women’s Trade and Research Centre (iWTC) that envisages a secure and sustained ecosystem for women entrepreneurs. He also unveiled a model of the multi-storey complex and a space for women to market products. The Gender Park, as a special purpose project, was launched in 2013, and its campus at Vellimadukunnu in Kozhikode was opened in 2016 by then President Pranab Mukherjee. But the ambitious project did not take off as expected due to technical reasons. The second International Conference on Gender Equality (ICGE-II) concluded at the Gender Park campus on Saturday. The 16-session hybrid summit featured 90 speakers from 20 countries and was organised by the Department of Women and Child Development in association with UN Women, a body of the United Nations. Social entrepreneurship Minister for Health, Social Justice, Women and Child Development K.K. Shylaja who chaired the functional launch said the State government would bring out a policy to promote social entrepreneurship among women and transgender individuals, and that the deliberations at ICGE-II were poised to make their way into a policy framework, which the Gender Park and UN Women would submit to the State government as recommendations for social inclusiveness and sustainable social business. Nishtha Satyam, Deputy Country Representative of UN Women (MCO - India, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka), hailed the opening of the Gender Park campus as a historic step towards the empowerment of women and transgender people. US Consul General (Chennai) Judith Ravin and Ambassador for Gender Equality from Australia Julie Ann Guivarra spoke on the occasion. Legislators A. Pradeep Kumar and Purushan Kadalundy, Mayor Beena Philip, transgender activist Akkai Padmashali, and dancer-social worker and advisor of Gender Park Mallika Sarabhai were present. The upcoming iWTC will include a women’s-only start-up incubation centre, claimed to be the world’s first of its kind, besides a business facilitator, space for rent and retail trade, a conference centre, performing arts centre, space for sustainable development, women’s health and welfare centre, and residential facilities for parents and children of women workers at the Gender Park.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/womens-trade-centre-to-come-up-in-kozhikode/article33838058.ece

As a huge sum had to be spent on its maintenance, the authorities decided to build a new bridge and the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) released funds for the purpose. The new bridge, to be inaugurated by Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran, was built by the Kerala Road Fund Board and the National Highway division of the Public Works Department. It is 12-metre-wide, has a 7.5-metre carriageway, and a 1.5 metre-wide footpath on both sides. There are 150-metre-long approach roads on both the banks of the river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-korappuzha-bridge-to-be-opened-on-feb-17/article33838061.ece

In Kozhikode district alone, as many as 9,356 persons have received title deeds. Officials said a special project, Bhumithra, initiated by the district administration had effectively addressed most complaints pertaining to title deed distribution. Special adalats were held to examine complaints and propose spot solutions. A number of ‘pattaya melas’ were held to reach out to beneficiaries. According to officials, even long-pending grievances over title deed distribution in remote villages were addressed through the Bhumitra project.

15 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Universities need a makeover, says CM||The State government is trying to convert higher educational institutions into centres of excellence, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The Chief Minister made this remark on Sunday during his opening speech at CM@campus, an interactive session with students from the University of Calicut, Kerala Kalamandalam Deemed-to-be-University, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University and Kerala Agricultural University on the University of Calicut campus. Mr. Vijayan said that aided and government schools in the State had undergone a makeover since 2016 when the drop-out rate was high. Around six lakh students had joined schools in the public sector after the government launched the ‘Save Public Education’ campaign. There had been improvement in terms of infrastructure and academic programmes, he said. Academic facilities “Our universities and other institutions should undergo a similar change. Students should have lodging facilities. There should be new courses. Laboratories and libraries should be open for students all the time. The faculty members should be qualified academic experts,” he said. Mr. Vijayan said the tendency of students from Kerala going outside the State to pursue higher education courses should stop. “We need to have more inter-disciplinary courses. Priority should be for vocational courses. When students complete their courses, they should be employable,” he said. Many topics The students raised issues such as gender equality, awareness of mental health, job opportunities for those pursuing art courses, and representation of transgenders. The Chief Minister agreed to look into most of the suggestions. Responding to a question on social justice in the wake of reservations for economically weaker sections among forward communities, Mr. Vijayan said there was no room for fears about snatching away the rights of the marginalised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/universities-need-a-makeover-says-cm/article33838067.ece

Apart from re-tarring works and the construction of retaining walls, the widening of some of the narrow stretches will also be considered. The Ghat Road Development Committee has come up with the demand to widen some of the hairpin curves, considering the frequent incidents of traffic blocks on the route. The committee said the long goods carriers were finding it difficult to negotiate the steep curves even after several rounds of renovation work. Traffic curbs In view of the emergency renovation works, vehicular traffic will be controlled on the ghat road for a month from February 15. The restriction will be in place from Adivaram to Lakkidi till March 15. Vehicles from the Wayanad side will have to take a diversion from Kainatty and come to Kozhikode via the Pakranthalam ghat road. Vehicles to Malappuram side will have to pass by Nadukani ghat road. No entry of goods vehicles will be permitted on the Adivaram-Lakkidi stretch between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. Mini-bus service In order to address the concerns of passengers, the Kerala State Road transport Corporation would operate mini-bus services on the route by complying with the regulations. During the tarring and retaining wall work, light vehicles would be allowed to go on the route.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thamarassery-ghat-road-being-renovated/article33838055.ece

The amenities were completed at a cost of Rs. 2.15 crore. The hill station located about 2,000 feet above sea level became a popular destination among tourists and pilgrims with the opening of a Muthappan temple there in 1989. The main attraction at the renovated spot is a spacious gallery constructed by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), which gives visitors a panoramic view of the hills. Payamkuttimala is one of the few destinations in Kerala from where a visitor can enjoy views of both sunrise and sunset.

There is also a proposal to set up more seating arrangements, shelters and a children’s park.

The DYFI workers will hold protest meets at Engapuzha and Adivaram on February 15 and February 18 respectively to draw the attention of the Public Works Department and the government. There were a number of protests against the contractor under the leadership of various youth organisations in Thamarassery and surrounding regions. Potholes have developed on the newly re-tarred road between Thamarassery and Adivaram stretch. The protesters alleged that materials of poor quality were used for the repair work. DYFI leaders said the company was accountable for the maintenance of the completed road for five years. However, it did not respond positively when the poor quality tarring work was brought to its attention, they said. “After local protests, a mass signature campaign will be carried out to record public complaints. We will send it to the PWD Minister and the National Highways Authority of India to blacklist the contracting firm,” said a DYFI leader from Thamarassery. A section of traders from Thamarassery region, who supports the protests, said two motorcycle riders had fallen into gutters along the road and sustained serious injuries as road workers had not put up signboards when the work was under way. “Both of them should get reasonable compensation for their treatment,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dyfi-to-protest-against-poor-condition-of-road/article33838050.ece

The regulator connecting Ongallur panchayat in Palakkad district and Desamangalam panchayat in Thrissur district was constructed by the State Irrigation Department with financial aid from NABARD at a cost of Rs. 32.50 crore. The regulator is 290 metres long and 9.50 metres high, and has 22 shutters. By closing the shutters, water can be stored up to six kilometers upstream. Thus, lift irrigation projects and drinking water projects on both sides of the Bharatapuzha can be strengthened. Irrigation Department officials said that water scarcity in the area could be addressed to a large extent with the setting up of the regulator. The work of the regulator had started in 2016. Apart from Shoranur and Pattambi municipalities, Ongallur and Vallapuzha panchayats in Palakkad district will benefit from the regulator. Beneficiaries In Thrissur district, Desamangalam and Vallathol Nagar panchayats will be the beneficiaries. Mohammed Mohasin, MLA, presided over the function. U.R. Pradeep, MLA, was the chief guest.

15 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||The art of being a ‘commodity’||In a world where commodities can more easily cross national boundaries than people, Sam Ali, fleeing a civil war in Syria and persecution by the authorities, turns himself into a commodity. An art commodity to be specific, lending his body as a canvas to a celebrity artist. Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania borrows the idea for her film The Man Who Sold His Skin , screened in the World Cinema category at the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), from Belgian artist Wim Delvoye, who created an artwork on the back of a man named Tim, who was later auctioned to a collector. But, to this basic thread, she weaves in a host of others, including the refugee crisis caused by the situation in Syria, the commodification in the art world and the prejudices that westerners hold about those from the Middle East. The artist tattoos a large Schengen visa (which allows seamless travel within Europe) on Sam’s back, making a statement on how national borders stop only human beings. But, Sam is in for another kind of bondage in mega galleries, where he is treated as an inanimate art object. The artist’s loud statements about the work ring hollow when Sam’s individuality is suppressed for the sake of the piece of art that he has become. Parallel threads Parallel to this goes Sam’s attempts to get in touch with his girlfriend Abeer, who was forced to get married to a wealthy man settled in Europe, after Sam had fled the country. Sam seems to have an awareness of his body canvas not being a coveted job, as he hides the fact from Abeer. An organisation for Syrian refugees takes up his cause, against him being used as a living artwork, but Sam is not so keen on being aided by them. The film raises some valid questions about the concepts of anything becoming an artwork, and artworks or even sports players becoming commodities to be auctioned off, to be bought by the highest bidder. The price of the art work then adds to the hype around it, rather than discussions on its politics or its beauty. The Man Who Sold His Skin is thus a critical conversation between two media of expression — cinema and installation art. The refugees from war-torn countries — where continued western interventions are one of the major causes of instability — being unable to enter these same countries that perpetrate these acts, is another uncomfortable question the film raises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-art-becomes-commodity/article33838244.ece
15 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Launch of waterway today||Overcoming several hurdles over decades, the 310-km stretch of the inland waterway from Veli to Chavakkad will be commissioned on February 15, opening a new fuel-efficient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. The rejuvenated waterway, a pet project of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, is from Veli to Kollam (State Waterway: 62 km) and the National Waterway’s 168 km from Kollam to Kottapuram and Kottapuram to Chavakkad (80 km).  Indigenously made The Chief Minister is expected to undertake a short cruise on a 24-seater solar boat from Veli after the formal inauguration at 10.30 a.m. on Monday. The solar boat, indigenously manufactured for Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL), arrived from Kochi and carried out trial runs on the Veli-Kadinamkulam stretch of the Parvathy Puthanar on Saturday. The trials were successful and the 15.6-m-long and 3.15-m-wide solar boat that can attain a maximum speed of 10 knots needs only one-metre depth. Official sources said they maintained 1.5 m to be on the safer side. All work except 1.5 km on both sides of the 722-metre Sivagiri tunnel (completed in 1880) and the 350-metre Chilakoor tunnel, the major challenges on the Akkulam-Kollam stretch, had been tackled. Boats can move along the two tunnels as they have a diameter of 4.7 m and the remaining works will be completed by the Inland Navigation Department this month. The 168-km Kollam-Kottapuram stretch of the 633-km West Coast canal — the main arterial waterway traversing through 11 districts — is already navigable. The corridor from Kollam to Kottapuram can facilitate the movement of 350 to 500 tonnes of cargo.  Demolition delay The stretch from Akkulam to Kollam has a width of 10 to 15 m and depth of 1.2 to 1.5 m. Kerala Waterways and Infrastructure Ltd. (KWIL), the special purpose vehicle created for the rejuvenation of the inland waterways, has also completed the work along the six km from Akkulam to Vallakadavu. But the delay in demolishing the 2.75-m high bridge at Karikkakom and installing a hydraulic bridge is preventing the movement of the solar boat to Vallakadavu. Beyond Chavakkad, the six low-level bridges and the Kuttai regulator in the Ponnani-Kozhikode corridor are the hurdles. The priority is to make the waterway from north to south navigable by 2022 and then attain the National Waterway III standards by 2025.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/launch-of-waterway-today/article33838246.ece

The by-election to the Malappuram Lok Sabha segment, necessitated by P.K. Kunhalikutty vacating the seat, will be held alongside the Assembly polls. Briefing the media on the meetings the Commission had with various stakeholders over the weekend, Mr. Arora said political parties had urged the Commission to schedule the elections in April by factoring in the festival dates for Easter, Vishu, and Ramzan. With the number of voters per booth fixed at 1,000 given the COVID-19 scenario, Kerala will have a little over 15,000 auxiliary polling stations, taking the total number of stations to 40,771. COVID-19 patients will be permitted to vote at the polling stations in the final hour of polling. The polling time will be extended by one hour. Eighty-plus and PwD (people with disabilities) voters will have the option of postal ballots, Mr. Arora said. Vaccination for officials Election officials will be treated as frontline workers and administered COVID-19 vaccination. Polling teams will also be issued COVID-19 kits. Special arrangements, including the deployment of additional forces, will be made in three districts — Malappuram, Palakkad and Wayanad — which have been designated ‘vulnerable’ by the Ministry of Home Affairs as per the September 21, 2020, notification. For the effective utilisation of State police and Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), the Commission has decided that a committee comprising the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), State police nodal officer and the CAPF coordinator will jointly decide the election security plan of poll-bound States, he said. On whether the Sabarimala issue will fall within the ambit of the model code of conduct, the Chief Election Commissioner said law and order issues, whether in a religious space or elsewhere, would be dealt with appropriately. The Commission is committed to ensuring free, fair, inducement-free, and COVID 19-free elections in the State. It has zero tolerance towards money power and will ensure that malpractices are dealt with swiftly as per the law of the land, Mr. Arora said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/exams-to-have-a-say-in-poll-dates/article33838071.ece

The huge outer wall of the building is now adorned with two relief works laying out the history of the renaissance movement in Kerala and the history of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. TRIDA decided to construct a shopping complex in 1.25 acres of land after a long and arduous process of removing the waste accumulated here over years. According to TRIDA chairman Jayan Babu, the initial plan was for a vertical garden to beautify the building, but it soon gave way to an idea to have something more concrete, connected to the city's history too. “This place itself is a part of our State’s history, but many are unaware of it. So, we had a discussion with groups of artists as to what can be done here, which led to the idea for these two relief works of events, which are connected to this region too,” he says. The relief work on renaissance movements have depictions of Sree Narayana Guru’s consecration of a Siva idol at Aruvippuram, Ayyan Kali’s villu vandi (bullock cart) ride, Chattambi Swami and disciples, Kallumaala Samaram (stone necklace protest) by the Pulaya community, the Punnapra-Vayalar protest and police firing, the protests for the formation of Kerala, and the swearing in of E.M.S. Namboodiripad as the first Chief Minister of Kerala. Ten artists, 29 days The relief work on the history of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple depicts the time from the construction of the temple, when elephants were used to haul the stones to build the temple gopuram, the temple entry proclamation being made by Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, the Aratt festival, and a depiction of the temple complex. Detailed information on the events depicted in the two relief works will be put up soon. The works were completed by a team of ten artists led by Manikandan Punnakkal over 29 days, working through day and night. The shopping complex has space for 42 shops and ample parking facilities. Minister for Local Self Governments A.C. Moideen will inaugurate the complex on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bringing-renaissance-temple-into-focus/article33838252.ece

15 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Experimental cinema via ‘captive’ conversation||A static camera inside a car focussing on two characters constantly bickering through the better part of one-and-a-half hours — that is Don Palathara’s Santhoshathinte Onnam Rahasyam in one line. But, one-liners can be deceptive as to what it leaves out unsaid. Don, who has the rare distinction of having two of his films being screened at this edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), takes a shift from his trajectory in his fourth film, but keeps alive the element of experiment, which was evident from his first film Shavam onwards. The narrative centres on Maria (Rima Kallingal) and Jithin (Jithin Puthenchery), living-together partners, who are heading to a clinic in their car for a pregnancy test. Maria is demanding a ‘solution’ from him. He is a small-time actor, with no steady income. Their parents do not have a whiff of their relationship. She is not yet ready to have a baby and also plans for higher studies. She thinks that he is irresponsible, and the baby would add to their burden. Old wounds This demand for a solution sets off a back-and-forth conversation, making them dig up old wounds. One can sense the tension slowly rising within the car, accentuated by the closed space that we are caught in with them. The only movements of the camera are those made by the car, and the constantly shifting scene outside the car, seen through the back and side windshields. The film can be seen as a cross between Jafar Panahi’s Taxi , set inside a car, and Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise series, made up of conversations between two lovers. However, here much of the conversations, including a phone call and a script that Jithin is reading during a break, revolve around relationships, instead of being random. Don and both the performers manage to make the conversation flow look organic, rather than scripted. While Jithin is portrayed as a laid-back young man with some faults, Maria, who has genuine grievances about his lack of seriousness, at times comes across as someone who is obsessed with blaming him. But the mindset she is in at that point of time gives her some leeway. Amid this experiment, there is a delicious scene poking fun at experimental cinema, when Maria, a journalist, has a phone interview with a rather pompous director, who says experimental cinema is a term used by those who have no idea what they are making. Don clearly has an idea of what he is making while setting out for yet another experiment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-experiment-in-captive-conversation/article33838118.ece

15 February 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Mala’s Jewish remnants to get a makeover||The more than 1000-year-old vestiges of rich Jewish culture in Mala, one of the important Jewish settlements in the State, are getting a fresh lease of life. As an effort to preserve the Jewish cemetery, considered the largest remaining Jewish heritage space in the country, a compound wall of around 800 metres has been built. A heritage park will also be set up there. Preservation works are progressing at the Jewish synagogue, one of the oldest synagogues existing in the country, under the Muziris Heritage project. “The cemetery situated in four acres of land was reduced to a waste dumping yard with its compound wall destroyed. Its gate and heritage plaque were also gone. People used the space for grazing cattle,” said P.K. Kittan, activist of the Mala Paithruka Samrakshana Samithy, which relentlessly fought for the conservation of the structures. The Mala panchayat became the custodian of the cemetery and synagogue when the Jews, who were settled in Mala for more than 1,000 years, immigrated to Israel in 1950. According to documents, there were 40 Jewish families in Mala. One of the first batches of Kerala Jews who made it to Israel in early 1950 was from Mala. And Mala synagogue was the first one to become defunct in Kerala. In a contract signed in 1955 between the then Mala panchayat president A.D. Joseph and Jewish representatives, the panchayat agreed to preserve the cemetery and the synagogue. Digging and excavation were banned in the cemetery, as it could damage the tombs. But over a period, the structures were neglected and conditions in the contract were violated. Encroachments and attacks ruined the structures. Most parts of the compound wall of the cemetery were demolished. Except three, the 30-odd graves were destroyed. There were reports that tombs were even used as markers for shooting practice by the Home Guards. Construction was started to set up a sports stadium inside the cemetery. The synagogue, decorated in lavish wood works with carvings and writing in Hebrew and Malayalam, was first turned into a school and then in to a community hall. It was alleged that many parts, including the Holy Ark and the pulpit, went missing. A line of shops came in front of the synagogue, depriving it of even an entrance. Protected monuments The Mala cemetery and synagogue was declared as protected monuments by the State government in 2017. It was also decided to protect them under the Muziris Heritage project. Constructions were banned at the cemetery ground. The Tourism Department took steps to evacuate the shops in front of the synagogue for building an entrance. Structure of the synagogue, which was weakened in the absence of proper maintenance, is also being strengthened. “Now with a proper compound wall to the cemetery, encroachments can be stopped. The Tourism Department is planning a heritage park. Sports Department has dropped the plan for a sports stadium,” Mr. Kittan said. Tourism Minister Katakampally Surendran inaugurated the renovated cemetery on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/malas-jewish-remnants-to-get-a-makeover/article33838210.ece

15 February 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Green, not red, rules Valentine’s Day in Chittoor||The district wore a cheerful look on Valentine’s Day and Sunday being an auspicious day for the Hindus, the day also saw a large number of wedding ceremonies in the district. Gaining momentum What was different this time, however, was that some of the families opted for giving saplings as presents to the guests. The initiative of presenting saplings to the guests/organizers of marriage functions was initiated in 2019 by the Forest Department officials, but the pandemic halted it temporarily. With a sharp decline in the number of cases, the gesture has once again gained its momentum. Usually, varieties of Tulasi, pomegranate, guava, jamun are preferred. The idea was welcomed by many people and particularly, it was a rage among couples who were encouraged to do their bit by planting a sapling in their backyards on special occasions. For some, it has become a ritual to plant saplings on Valentine’s Day and marriage anniversaries. Nowadays, young lovers too have started following the trend. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor) G. Srinivasulu says that during the last one-and-half years, close to 15,000 saplings were provided to the families performing marriage functions. Along with other presents, “vriksha prasadam” was being given to the guests. “Considering the gift as a sign of longevity to married life, the guests show much enthusiasm to plant the saplings on their compounds. On request, we have also supplied the plants to the newly-wed couples at their doorstep, while several others would visit our forest nurseries to collect the saplings,” he said.  Source of joy Explaining why it has become a hit among couples, the official says: “Several newly-weds informed us that it gives them immense joy to plant a sapling. They consider the saplings as testimony to their love as they start growing year after year. Valentine’s Day is the best occasion to promote the theme of greenery.” Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories (Chittoor) M. Sivakumar Reddy, who got married in 1993, said: “For the last 28 years, we have been planting saplings on every Valentine’s Day. Several of them have become huge trees. Our happiness only grows every year,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/green-not-red-rules-valentines-day-in-chittoor/article33837732.ece

15 February 2021||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ghat roads turn into death traps for commuters in Visakha Agency||The ghat roads are turning into death traps for motorists and other road users in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam district. Since January 2020, over 70 people have died and more than 130 were injured in the 11 Agency mandals of the district. According to statistics provided by the district police, during the year 2020, the Agency mandals reported 108 road accidents, in which 62 persons had died and 126 were injured. Out of these 108 accidents, more than 60 were reported in Araku and Paderu regions alone. In January 2021 alone, 18 road accidents were reported in which 12 persons died and 19 were injured. According to the police officials, overspeeding, rash driving, overloading, drunk driving and poor road infrastructure are the major reasons for the accidents. “Many accidents are reported due to negligent and rash driving on the ghat roads. While negotiating steep curves, the motorists lose balance due to overspeeding and meet with accidents. In several accident cases, the motorists are found to be drunk,” said a senior police officer from the district.  Overloading There were a number of instances of overloaded jeeps and vans overturning while taking a turn near steep curves on ghat roads. This has been one of causes for major road accidents in the Agency areas. “If a jeep can accommodate 10 persons, the drivers here will let 20 passengers to board. With most of the drivers being untrained, they lack road safety knowledge and drive at a very high speed, which causes accidents,” said a senior police officer from the district. However, the locals say that lack of proper infrastructure and facilities are the root cause of the road accidents.  ‘No road connectivity’ “A number of Agency villages do not have road connectivity, such as bus services. Jeeps and vans are the only mode of transport to these village and the ratio of private vehicles to the people is very low. How would the tribals commute?. If the government runs a safe transport facility, why would we not use them?” said Andhra Pradesh Girijan Sangham (APGS) member Killo Surendra. He said that several ghat roads in the Agency do not have proper warning boards at steep curves or proper safety measures to prevent accidents. He said that there is a need of road re-engineering works at hairpin bends which report many accidents.  Re-engineering works Deputy Transport Commissioner, Visakhapatnam District, G. Raja Ratnam, said that all the areas which report road accidents are monitored continuously. He said that as per the district police, there are about 326 black spots in the rural areas, including in Agency. He said that soon, Roads and Buildings Department will be taking up road re-engineering works and construction of the required infrastructure on all the roads, which report more accidents in the rural areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ghat-roads-turn-into-death-traps-for-commuters-in-visakha-agency/article33838279.ece

Travelling solo gives that liberating experience of soaking in every ounce of the beauty from the simple life of the countryside to the evolving beauties of cities across India,” says Nidhi Kurian, a 34-year-old solo woman traveller, on a nationwide tour from Kochi. A creative head of a film production house, Ms. Nidhi embarked on an all-India tour on February 7 from Kochi. Calling her journey as ‘The Great Indian Solo Trip,’ she says it was planned with a purpose to “experience first-hand how safe” India is, especially for women, as well as to document her travel experiences for her next book. Ms. Nidhi has so far covered 2,300 kilometres crossing Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In her next leg of the journey, she will be heading to Odisha and West Bengal travelling Northwards and intends to complete 100 days of her solo trip by covering 25,000 kilometres. Halting in the Youth Hostel Associations and other budget-friendly accommodations, Ms. Nidhi says her journey so far has been memorable and enriching. From interacting with tribals in Araku to soaking in the countryside charm of Andhra Pradesh, she made pit stops across the region to document the heartwarming stories of agrarian success from the rural parts. Plastic-free Ms. Nidhi’s journey is completely plastic-free since she believes in the principles of sustainability. “I carry my own plates, cups and bottles and ensure that there is no wastage of food,” she adds. To sustain energy levels, Ms. Nidhi prefers a fibre-rich meal, and always carries a reserve of dry fruits, seasonal fruits and water to stay hydrated throughout.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/solo-woman-traveller-on-india-tour/article33838272.ece
15 February 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP-backed candidates win big in South Coastal A.P.||The YSR Congress Party has put up a good show in the second phase of the panchayat elections as the candidates backed by it won a majority of seats in the south coastal Andhra Pradesh. In Nellore district, 117 sarpanch candidates backed by the ruling party emerged victorious when compared to the 64 aspirants backed by the Telugu Desam Party in the elections held on Saturday on the non-party basis. In Prakasam district, 131 sarpanch candidates backed by the YSRCP won. As many as 103 aspirants supported by the TDP emerged victorious. Much of the gains for the TDP came from the panchayats in Addanki Assembly constituency, which the party had wrested in the 2019 general elections, even as the YSRCP swept the polls across the State. TDP attributed to success to Addanki MLA Gottipatti Ravikumar as the candidates sponsored by the party won 25 sarpanch posts. Bickering and lack of team work in the Assembly segment are being cited as the reasons for the poor show of the the YSRCP-backed candidates. Meanwhile, a festive atmosphere prevailed at Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy’s camp office in Nellore as 112 winning candidates gathered there for celebrations. The YSRCP-backed candidate won the sarpanch post for the first time in Battepadu panchayat. The winning margins went up to 85% when compared to about 60% in 2019. The success is being attributed to YSRCP leader and former Minister Anam Ramanarayana Reddy, who represents Venkatagiri Assembly constituency as the nominees backed by the ruling party won 18 of the 20 sarpanch posts in Kaluvai mandal, leaving only two posts for the TDP-backed candidates in the mandal. ‘Pro-poor policies paid off’ Mr. Goutham Reddy gave the credit for the ‘impressive performance’ to the ‘collective effort’ of the YSRCP functionaries at the grassroots level. “The people have reposed faith in the Jagan Mohan Reddy government. The pro-poor policies have paid off,” he said. The welfare schemes and development projects launched by the government had paid dividends, said Mr. Ramanarayana Reddy as 27 sarpanches have been elected without contest even as the polls are due in the third and fourth phases in Venkatagiri constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/candidates-backed-by-ruling-ysrcp-win-big/article33837715.ece

15 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State to borrow Rs. 25,000 crore to clear pending bills||The State government is availing a loan of Rs. 25,000 crore from a consortium of national banks, and plans to clear all types of bills before the end of this financial year. According to information, the government has created a new entity, Andhra Pradesh State Development Corporation (APSDC), exclusively to raise the loan. Through the process that had begun about three months ago, the government could so far mobilise about Rs. 6,000 crore from the consortium comprising the State Bank of India (SBI), the Punjab National Bank (PNB), the Union Bank of India (UBI), and the Canara Bank. “The government is trying to ensure the release of the remaining amount before March 2021. The aim is to clear all pending bills,” says an official on condition of anonymity. Aiming for a ‘clean’ budget “Due to grim financial condition, the government could not clear bills totalling 1.08 lakh pertaining to various works and schemes in the last quarter of the 2018- 2019 financial year, and the number was brought down to 40,000 by May 2019 with great difficulty,” sources say. The situation has remained more or less the same in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 budgets, it is said. “It is estimated that the government has to clear bills worth Rs. 25,000 crore, and has set itself a target to present a clean budget with no carry forwards,” the sources say. The government has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the consortium, and has agreed to place the income mobilised from sale of liquor, enhanced cess on petroleum products, and other taxes in escrow account. It will act as a guarantee for the bank loans. It will take five to six years to repay the loan, sources add. The revenue through excise will be more than Rs. 7,900 crore. This excludes the Value Added Tax (VAT) levied on liquor. The government had generated an excise revenue of Rs. 4,352 crore in 2014-15, which increased to Rs. 6,220 crore by 2018-19. The revised estimates for the year 2019-20 stand at Rs. 6,914 crore, and the budget estimates for 2020-21 are Rs. 7,931 crore. Many agencies that have completed works in irrigation, housing, rural water supply, roads and buildings, and municipal administration are yet to receive payment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-to-borrow-rs-25000-crore-to-clear-pending-bills/article33838203.ece
15 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||APNRTS to rescue of Telugu workers stranded in Oman||The Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu Society (APNRTS) has come to the rescue of the people from the State who went to Oman in the Middle East to find work but were stranded due to reasons like ‘greedy’ agents taking away their passports, losing of passport or expiry of their visa. Many people from Andhra Pradesh migrate to the Middle East in search of work. Taking advantage of the high demand, ‘dubious’ agents take many of them for a ride by making false promises of high salaries. In their desperation to go there, many people walk into the trap of these agents who resort to unlawful means to send them there. Many such people are stranded in Oman. With the Oman government asking them to leave the country and with no money to buy the flight ticket to return home, the victims contacted people at the APNRTS seeking help. At the behest of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, the NRTS collaborated with its coordinators in Oman Haribabu and Pratap and made quick arrangements for their safe return to their homeland. The Non-Resident Telugu Society deputy director and staff members received the first batch of workers who arrived at the Gannavaram airport on Sunday evening. Taking care of their flight ticket fares and food, the society staff ensured that they headed safely to their homes from the airport. President, NRTS, Venkat S. Medapati, said people who wanted to go to other countries to find work should go through authorised agents only. He said those migrating for the first time should acquire sound knowledge about the place and the laws in that particular nation to avoid problems at a later stage. He said even during the lockdown in the aftermath of the outbreak of COVID-19, the society had gone to the rescue of a large number of workers stranded in Kuwait. He said Telugu migrants in other countries in need of help could utilise the APNRTS helpline numbers 0863-2340678, 8500027678.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apnrts-to-rescue-of-telugu-workers-stranded-in-oman/article33837737.ece
15 February 2021||vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||They will vote here for the one last time||For members of about one lakh families in the Polavaram project area, the ongoing gram panchayat elections will be the last such exercise in their native habitations, as they will be displaced and rehabilitated soon in the upland areas. In all, 1.03 lakh families residing in 373 habitations – 240 in East Godavari and 133 in West Godavari – will be shifted. The officials have so far evacuated the families from 17 habitations. “During the recent Godavari floods (in September last), our village was completely inundated. We had to take shelter on top of a hill for about one week. We request the government to shift us to the R&R Colony before the advent of monsoon,” said Soyam Durga of Koida village. Members of a few tribes and non-tribes staying in various hamlets in Polavaram, Velerupadu, and Kukunoor mandals had approached the State High Court, seeking a direction to halt the election process as they would be shifted to other villages. ‘Arrangements made’ However, the State Election Commission had decided to conduct elections in the habitations, which would soon be inundated under the project, as the villagers need public representatives to represent their problems and take decisions in a democratic way till they were evacuated, the officials said. “All arrangements have been made for conducting the elections for 178 panchayats and 1,904 wards in the third phase of polling on February 17 in West Godavari district. We have conducted coordination meetings with the community elders, and the voters are ready to exercise their franchise,” Polavaram Sub-Collector R.V. Suryanarayana said. Prior to bifurcation of the State, the villagers formed part of Khammam district and had cast their vote in 2013. Post bifurcation, the habitations were merged in residual Andhra Pradesh, and 373 hamlets were bracketed under the Polavaram project submerged area. “My father and my forefathers had stayed in the Agency area. Our family members have been exercising our franchise here for the last 50 years. Now, the government is evacuating us. This is the last time we will be casting our vote in Kacharam village,” said Kunja Somaraju, a tribal. West Godavari Superintendent of Police K. Narayan Naik said elaborate bandobust arrangements had been made for peaceful conduct of polling. Polavaram Deputy Superintendent of Police K. Latha Kumari, who camped at Velerupadu, said the villagers could exercise their franchise freely in the Agency habitations in the district. “I want to vote as this may be the last time for me to do so in my ancestral village. We have been listed as one of the project displaced families,” said Tati Srinu of Kakuturu village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/they-will-vote-here-for-the-one-last-time/article33838197.ece

15 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP supporters bagged more than 80% seats in second phase polls: Sajjala||The YSR Congress Party supporters have continued their winning streak in the second phase of the gram panchayat elections in the State by bagging more than 80% of the seats, according to Adviser (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. These results reflected the overwhelming response to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s governance, and the trend would continue in the next two phases too, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy told the media on Sunday. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) was making false claims over the election results and fudging the figures to prove its existence and relevance. The good governance of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had sunk deep in the people’s minds, while the TDP had to resort to its old tricks to woo the voters, but to no avail, he added. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy claimed that in the second phase of the elections, the YSRCP supporters and sympathisers put together had won 2,649 seats against the total of 3,325, with the TDP settling for 538. The BJP and Jana Sena Party were lagging way behind. ‘Fake website’ He alleged that the TDP was behind the fake website on polls that closely resembled the YSRCP’s. The people gave a clear mandate to the YSRCP again as the welfare schemes stood in good stead whereas the TDP chief was churning out lies to show the ruling party in poor light with ulterior motives, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-supporters-bagged-more-than-80-seats-in-second-phase-polls-sajjala/article33838206.ece

Addressing the media at Dachepalli in Guntur district on Sunday, Mr. Veerraju ridiculed former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for failing to develop Amaravati as the capital city and his successor Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for coming up with the impracticable idea of three capitals. The BJP leader also questioned what prompted the YSRCP to resort to “glaring malpractices” in the panchayat elections if the government’s claims to have won the peoples’ heart by implementing various welfare schemes were true. Mr. Veerraju said the TDP and YSRCP governments had done little for the development of the State, and asserted that the credit for the progress achieved by the State entirely went to the Centre. “Andhra Pradesh has 975-km-long coastline, but its potential has remained largely untapped as not a single port has been built post bifurcation,” he said. Mr. Veerraju said the Cente had given Rs. 30,000 crore for 20 schemes to the State under the MGNREGS and another Rs. 20,000 crore was in the pipeline. He said the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant would not be allowed to be privatised at any cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-will-develop-five-industrial-capitals-in-ap/article33837665.ece

Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday hailed the high polling percentage in the second phase of panchayat elections as a victory of democracy in the villages. The voting percentage was 81.67 against 81.66 in the first phase. Addressing the media, Mr. Naidu asserted that the people fought against the “flagrant poll violations” of the YSRCP and showed their trust in the right to self-rule for the local bodies. The voters should display the same enthusiasm in the third and fourth phases in order to save their villages from slipping into the hands of “criminals” of the ruling party, he said. Mr. Naidu asserted that the credit for creating public faith in democracy would go to the TDP alone. The ruling party Ministers, MPs and MLAs were rejected in their own villages on a large scale, he claimed. A YSRCP-backed candidate lost by a margin of 271 votes in a Minister’s ancestral village, he said. Similarly, In MP Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose’s village, the ruling party lost by 206 votes. In a village belonging to an MP, the people gave voted against the ruling party. In Marripadu, which is Industries Minister M. Gautham Reddy’s native village, the YSRCP lost by 100 votes, Mr. Naidu said.

Mr. Lokesh visited the indefinite hunger strike camp of party leader and former MLA Palla Srinivas here on Sunday and expressed solidarity. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Lokesh wondered as to what the 151 MLAs and 28 MPs of the YSRCP were doing to prevent privatisation of the VSP. Alleging that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had no guts to pull up the Centre on the VSP issue, the TDP leader asked as to how the Chief Minister could get Special Category Status (SCS) to the State. He claimed that VSP had flourished during the TDP rule. He alleged that YSRCP leaders were trying to create anarchy in peaceful Visakhapatnam by indulging in land grabbing, attacks and destruction of property. He alleged that Mr. Jagan had agreed to privatisation of the VSP as his mother, who had contested for Lok Sabha as MP from Visakhapatnam was defeated in the 2014 general election. He alleged that the Chief Minister had directed the party MPs not to speak in Parliament on the VSP issue and now he was planning to buy VSP, which is worth Rs. 2 lakh crore, as scrap Mr. Lokesh claimed that it was only the the TDP which had fought for VSP and was doing it now. He recalled that former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had fought against privatisation of the VSP by taking up the issue with the then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and prevented it from being referred to the BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) and TDP MPs K. Yerrannaidu and M.V.V.S. Murthy had taken it up in Parliament. The TDP leader said that the struggle would be continued till the Centre came up with a statement that VSP would be continued in the public sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-govt-failed-to-protect-interests-of-steel-plant-alleges-lokesh/article33838208.ece
15 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu failed to oppose move to privatise VSP in 2014: MLA||Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath has alleged that the TDP, which has no interest in saving the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), is trying to gain political mileage by making baseless allegations against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Addressing a media conference here on Sunday, Mr. Amarnath said TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh was either feigning ignorance or was unaware that his father and former Chief Minster N. Chandrababu Naidu had not opposed the decision to privatise VSP, when the proposal was floated by the Centre in 2014. He said that the same was reported by national dailies, including The Hindu, on July 30, 2014. He also alleged that the representatives of POSCO had met Mr. Naidu in 2018 in the same way as they met Mr. Jagan last year. Any decision on the VSP could be taken only by the Centre but not the State government and Mr. Lokesh seems to be ignorant of it. While Mr. Naidu had not even opposed the decision to privatise VSP, Mr. Jagan had written to the Prime Minister suggesting three alternatives to continue it in the public sector. Mr. Amarnath alleged that 54 PSUs in the State were privatised during the tenure of Mr. Naidu. These include Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) in Visakhapatnam and a number of cooperative sugar factories were closed in combined State during the tenure of Mr. Naidu, he added. He recalled that former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had prevented the privatisation of BHPV and HSL in Visakhapatnam. Mr. Naidu, who had failed to take upon himself the responsibility of protecting the VSP or securing captive mines for the plant, and the TDP leaders were now shedding crocodile tears to gain political mileage. Mr. Amarnath also alleged that Mr. Lokesh’s landing out of the blue in Visakhapatnam and visiting only the indefinite hunger strike camp of TDP leader Palla Srinivas and not visiting the hunger strike protests, being staged by various trade unions and employees, to express solidarity with them indicated his sincerity towards protection of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vsp-privatisation-mla-slams-naidu/article33838193.ece

Raghavulu has said that only a united stir by the people and all political parties can save the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), which was achieved after relentless struggles, he said. Ridiculing the reason being given by the Centre for privatisation of the VSP, he said the Centre wants to sell ‘ukku’ (steel plant) for ‘tukku’ (scrap) in the name of losses as it wants to hand over VSP land (22,000 acres) to its cronies. The VSP could make profits in a short time, once the pandemic situation improved and there was help from the government, he said. Mr. Raghavulu recalled the contribution of the VSP to the growth of Visakhapatnam and north Andhra region. The NDA government, which had failed to give special package to the backward districts of north Andhra, was now preparing to privatise VSP, he said. Referring to the reported statements of Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan that it was for the Centre to take a call on the VSP, he said it was unfortunate that those who spoke of Telugu pride were ‘toeing the BJP line’. He appealed to the JSP chief to join the agitation against privatisation of VSP as it was a historic necessity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-trying-to-sell-vsp-as-scrap-alleges-raghavulu/article33838275.ece

15 February 2021||YETAPAKA (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials on their toes as Naxal-hit panchayats go to polls on Feb. 17||The authorities are on their toes as the Naxal-affected tribal panchayats in East Godavari district are going to elections during the third phase on February 17, even as elaborate security arrangements have been made to prevent any untoward incident. As many as 2.60 lakh voters will exercise their franchise during the elections to be held in the challenging terrain as a considerable part of it does not have access to telecommunication network. However, a group of habitations in the Papikonda National Park would be a testing field. Of the 186 panchayats that are scheduled to go to election in the third phase in the Rampachodavaram and Yetapaka revenue divisions, 78 are affected by Naxal activities. In total, 1,734 polling centres have been set up, enabling the voters to exercise their franchise amid tight security in 11 mandals in the Agency area. As the areas share border with the three States—Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Telangana—, the Andhra Pradesh police do not want to take any chance. Combing operations The State police have sought help from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) which has already completed combing operations in the strategic areas in the Agency, averting any untoward incident during the transportation of the polling material. East Godavari SP Adnan Nayeem Asmi said that combing operations have been completed in the areas affected by the left-wing extremist activities. “Forces have been posted in the strategic areas. We are prepared to complete the counting process during the day time itself, without leaving any chance to any disruptions at any stage of polling. Preparations are also being made to ensure completion of the counting by 5 p.m.,” Mr. Asmi told The Hindu.  The SP said a good number of security personnel have been deployed along the inter-State border. However, the detailed security strategy and size of the deployment can not be revealed for obvious reasons, he said. Polling time reduced Meanwhile, the time of polling has been reduced by two hours in the Agency. “It will help ensure a peaceful election. Polling will be conducted between 6.30 a.m. and 1.30 a.m.,” he said. East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy said that 5,300 non-local polling staff would be sent to the Agency a day before the polling. “At least 130 special bus services will drop the polling staff at their destinations on 65 routes in the Agency. A day has been reserved for the polling staff to collect material and reach the polling stations on time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-on-their-toes-as-naxal-hit-panchayats-go-to-polls-on-feb-17/article33838188.ece

Collector G. Veerapandian, SP K. Fakeerappa and senior officials from Kurnool rushed to the spot. They said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had been informed about the accident. Deputy Transport Commissioner (Kurnool) Suman said the minibus was in a good condition and had all the valid documents.  Panchayat Raj Minister P. Ramachandra Reddy, speaking to the media at Ramakuppam in Chittoor district, said that the State government would ensure treatment to the injured and aid to the bereaved families. He asked Madanapalle MLA Nawaz Basha to make arrangements for the last rites of the deceased. Though the driver’s negligence is said to be the cause of the tragedy, another version cites a tyre burst leading to the accident. Lorry driver Farooq Basha of Banaganapalle mandal, the eyewitness, told the reporters that the mishap had occurred around 3.30 a.m. Seeing the minibus jump the median, he had stopped the lorry. However, within seconds, the bus had ploughed into the stationary lorry, he said. Rescue efforts “In pitch darkness, we could rescue four children with the help of the local residents. Another rescued child died later. The police and ambulance personnel retrieved 14 bodies using a crane and a gas cutter,” he said.

15 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bodies of Araku bus accident victims arrive||Two ambulances trudged through the traffic and mourners along the Sheikhpet road on Sunday, and turned right on to a ramshackle road. They made their way towards a large tent erected near a house where family and friends waited for the injured, and bodies of those who had lost their lives on Friday after the bus in which they were travelling fell into a valley while negotiating a hairpin bend on the way to Araku. As many as 24 persons from the family were aboard the bus. In the morning, K Naresh, one of the relatives of those aboard the bus, who was dealing with the arrangements, said that he was waiting for the bodies to arrive. A little after noon, the bodies of victims Kottam Satyanarayana (61), a retired employee of a public sector undertaking bank, and his eight-month-old grandchild Kottam Nithya were moved to their home. The body of another victim, Kottam Saritha (40), was taken to a house along one of the roads running parallel to the house of Satyanarayana. The body of the fourth victim, N Latha (45), was taken to Moghalpura in the Old City, those in the know said. As the ambulances stopped near Satyanarayana’s house, his body and that of toddler Nithya were carried into the house. A bevy of policemen, posted along the Puppalguda-Manikonda road, kept a watch. A man carried the body of the toddler into the home which was then kept beside the body of her grandfather. They were surrounded by grieving relatives. Photos of a smiling Satyanarayana cradling in his arms the toddler were placed at the entrance of the lane, and also at a couple of stalls. A few lanes away, under a shed and on the margins of the road, relatives waited for the body of Saritha to arrive. A young boy with an injured arm was one of the first to disembark from the ambulance. His family helped him into the house. A woman, who found it difficult to walk, was also helped by the family. District administration officials present at the spot said that the family of 24 went to Araku. While four had died in the road accident, as many as 14 were injured. Apart from six, who are still being treated for their wounds in King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh, the remaining had arrived. A document shared by one of the district administration officials showed that three persons suffered head injuries, and two others sustained chest injuries.

15 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||University plans to promote summer pulses, inter-cropping||At a time when the irrigation potential is increasing as also cultivation of paddy in the conventional flood irrigation method in Telangana, Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) has plans to promote cultivation of summer pulses in a big way not only to improve the income of farmers but also to boost the soil health on the decline. Although the National Food Security Mission has reduced import of pulses to a large extent in the recent years and helped export of some pulses, the country is still importing some small quantities to meet the diverse needs. Promotion of pulses’ cultivation along with oilseed would save foreign exchange and improve farmers’ income. According to food and nutrition scientists, pulses play a key role in making the diet healthy, particularly when the food habits are changing as pulses are the rich source of plant-based protein of about 20% to 25% by their weight, potassium and folate and low-fat, sodium and glycemic index. Diversification of farmers from paddy cultivation to other crops would also prevent the glut of the major food crop. “Apart from making the diet healthy, cultivation of pulses would also fix atmospheric nitrogen in the range of 30 kg to 150 kg per hectare, enrich soil health and improve the organic carbon content in the soil”, says Vice-Chancellor of PJTSAU V. Praveen Rao, a professional agronomist. Under the enhanced irrigation potential conditions, there is a need to encourage pulses cultivation as they best fit all inter-cropping systems, in order to avoid mono-cropping of rice, cotton and maize in the State, which comprise about three-fourths of total cultivation. “Increasing demand for pulses will not only ensure better price and income to farmers but also keep up the soil health status,” he explains. Stating that cultivation of summer pulses after rabi groundnut and maize and long-duration crops such as cotton, turmeric and chilli would help farmers in multiples ways, the PJTSAU Vice-Chancellor says it would improve the soil health for the next crop and also reduces expenditure on supplementation of soil nutrients. “There used to be a healthy cropping pattern of using a particular piece of land for long-duration crop one year and the short-duration crop the next year till three decades back even in rain-fed cultivation. We use to sow the second crop in the short-duration crop area of the first agricultural season,” recollects S. Shankreppa, a farmer in Sirgapur mandal of Sangareddy district adding that impact of cotton has changed it all. Mr. Praveen Rao says they plan to promote bengalgram with early removal of cotton under limited irrigation sources. The university also has plans for horizontal expansion (area) and vertical expansion (productivity) of pulses by promoting inter-cropping of redgram with cotton (1:6) and maize (1:4) and also pre-paddy/pre-chilli greengram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/university-to-promote-summer-pulses/article33837748.ece
15 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||FASTag compulsory at all toll plazas from midnight||Finally, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has issued orders making FASTag compulsory at all toll plazas from the midnight of February 15, 2021 across the country. In a communication on Sunday, the MoRTH said: “Now, to further promote fee payment through digital mode, reduce waiting time and fuel consumption, and provide for a seamless passage through the fee plazas, it has been decided that all the lanes in the fee plazas on National Highways shall be declared as ‘FASTag lane of the fee plaza’ w.e.f midnight of 15th /16th February 2021.” Therefore, as per NH Fee Rules 2008, any vehicle not fitted with FASTag or vehicle without valid, functional ‘FASTag’ entering into the ‘FASTag lane’ of the fee plaza shall pay a fee equivalent to two times of the fee applicable to that category, the order said. With the Ministry giving clarity that there would be no more extension of deadline, now it is mandatory that all the lanes on the toll plazas including those in Telangana would be FASTag enabled only. The regional office of NHAI in Hyderabad has jurisdiction of 21 toll plazas. Authorities have made arrangements to set up at least 8-10 Point of Sales on either sides of the toll plazas. According to the NHAI authorities in Telangana, 70 percent of the vehicle users affixed the tags on their vehicles. These FASTag stickers are available from either the banks or the point of sales opened at the Toll Plazas. Although the government wanted to make it mandatory from December 1, it was later put off till January 1 and finally February 15. The officials of Telangana are hopeful that the balance of 30 per cent vehicles without FASTags would comply with the latest orders. The standard operating procedure issued last month had clearly stated that the ETC infrastructure at the plazas should be fully operational and top class and any normal FASTag vehicle will be able to cross the Toll Plaza within three seconds without stopping at all. Hand-held readers are strictly prohibited except in temporary toll plazas. The authorities have also prohibited back and forth movement of vehicles to adjust FASTag reading. CCTV feed would be checked to verify this and strict penal action would be taken against the concessionaire if such activity is noted, the guidelines pointed out. A relief that will come to the vehicle users is if the ETC is not working, free pass will be given to the valid FASTag holders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fastag-compulsory-at-all-toll-plazas-from-midnight/article33838017.ece
15 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||DGP kicks off TSRS-Sarvail golden jubilee celebrations||Golden jubilee celebrations of the Telangana State Residential School (TSRS), Sarvail, in combined Nalongda district kicked off with a logo launch by Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy, an alumnus of the school, and NIT-Warangal director N.V. Ramana Rao here on Sunday. Prominent alumni who participated in the inaugural included retired IAS officer Dinakar Babu and Joint Transport Commissioner C. Ramesh among others. COVID-19 pandemic ensured a low-key start to the celebrations, which would continue year-long. New horizons Mr. Mahender Reddy attributed his personal and professional achievements to his foundation provided by the school and said he would have perhaps resorted to farming in his village had the school not opened new horizons to him. Had it not been for the vision of late Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who started the school in 1971 as the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, rural students wouldn’t have grabbed the opportunities that eluded the earlier generations. The DGP recalled that TSRS-Sarvail was the role model for all residential schools in the country as Narasimha Rao replicated the model by establishing Navodaya Vidyalayas in all backward districts of the country to provide quality education to rural students. He also attributed his selection into civil services to his school classmates who guided him. Mr. Ramana Rao, who was the chief guest, said Sarvail alumni commanded respect in the society and the school was a big brand given the achievements of its alumni across the world. Stating that he was privileged to be the guest at the golden jubilee celebrations, he said great institutions acquire the brand name due to their alumni’s achievements and contributions. Praise for teachers Mr. Dinakar Babu, former Adilabad Collector and a first-batch student, said the vision of Narasimha Rao and land donor Maddi Narayan Reddy helped build an institution whose alumni are making a difference in every segment of society. He praised the selfless service of teachers who stayed in that remote village in the most challenging times. TSRS-Sarvail Alumni Association president B. Narender Reddy, general secretary Rajashekhar Reddy and treasurer Vivekanand, and prominent alumni including P. Lakshminarayana and Veera Nandi also spoke.  Great institutions acquire the brand name due to their alumni’s achievements and contributions. N.V.

Chandrasekhar Rao, he said enumeration should be taken up to identify the beneficiaries immediately as lakhs of people are waiting for pensions as promised by the TRS party during the election campaign. It was also included in the TRS manifesto while seeking votes, he said. The Malkajgiri MP also said single women who lost husbands after 2018 were not getting the pension and they should be identified immediately and extended the benefit. He said only person in a family was getting the pension even though two were eligible. In such cases if the pensioner died their partners were not extended the benefit.

Speaking to farmers at Nagpur village in Balkonda constituency in old Nizamabad district during his “Face to Face with Farmers” on Sunday, he said farmers were the worst hit after Telangana came into being with the policies of the TRS government.  Farmers losing crops during rains were never compensated while the government is also reluctant to buy the produce after forcing them into regulated cultivation. Mr. Vikramarka asked the Chief Minister to visit villages to understand the problems and not assume that everything is fair and proper sitting in his farmhouse. He said farmers are disillusioned with the government and were dejected with its decision to close down all the procurement centres. The Chief Minister wants to see only his family happy and not others, he alleged. The CLP leader said farmers are opposing the new farm laws by the Centre and they are unanimous on this. Telangana farmers are ready to support farmers protesting in New Delhi against the new laws, he said and asked the farmers to participate in huge numbers in the “Chalo Hyderabad” programme of Kisan Congress on February 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-didnt-expect-a-suppressive-state-bhatti/article33838239.ece

Speaking to reporters here, he said despite claiming to be employee-friendly, the government is treating them shabbily without giving their rightful due. Pay hike is the right of employees, he claimed. The MLC questioned the silence of the employee union leaders despite the PRC recommending just 7.5% fitment. In the Congress governments, they used to fight for their rights and get a dignified response. But despite insults, the union leaders still express confidence in the government for unknown reasons, he said. The Congress held three three preparatory meetings for MLC elections where TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and all senior leaders participated. They discussed the strategy for the Nalgonda- Khammam- Warangal MLC constituency and Hyderabad- Ranga Reddy- Mahabubnagar MLC constituency.

15 February 2021||M. RajeevHYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Registration of lands gathers pace||Registration of land related transactions gathered momentum ever since the government relaxed the restrictions since November last year. The sub-registrar’s offices are said to have received huge number of applications since the government allowed registration of agricultural lands through Dharani and non-agricultural properties in the normal mode. An estimated 1.10 lakh sale deeds are said to have been registered for open plots between December 21 and February 10 fetching revenue of Rs. 375.99 crore to the government. The department earned another Rs. 80.99 crore through other charges taking the total revenue to Rs. 456 crore in the last one and a half month. This assumes significance as the government set a target of Rs. 10,000 crore revenue for the current financial year, but could not achieve at least half of it in the three quarters. Registrations in Ranga Reddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri, abutting the State Capital, are said to be particularly impressive going by the high volume of transactions witnessed in these two districts. While the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down registration processes, the government’s decision to halt registration owing to enactment of new revenue laws brought the process to a grinding halt. As a result, there were apprehensions that the government would fall well short of the expectations during the current year. The situation however improved significantly since the government allowed registration of non-agricultural properties through normal process following the legal issues faced due to implementation of Dharani. The department had since then assigned 2,46,101 documents of which 2,20,209 were scanned and returned to the parties. In the process, the department earned revenue of Rs. 1,565.32 crore raising 2.64 lakh challans through these transactions. The number of transactions is significantly higher on Dharani too with the portal registering 1.26 lakh applications pertaining to registrations/mutations from December till Saturday and another 5,714 for NALA conversions. Of these, 1.19 lakh registrations/mutations had been approved and process relating to 5,256 cases of NALA conversions completed. The portal said the average registration time was 60 minutes while it was just 24 minutes for NALA conversion. Officials are confident that much of the revenue gap that was observed since the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath would be covered as there is almost one-and-half month left for the completion of the financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/registration-of-lands-gathers-pace/article33838031.ece

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Controversy over tahsildar’s transfer||Transfer of a tahsildar a couple of days ago has raised many an eyebrow. First, the transfer of N. Srinivas Reddy took place a day after G. Vijayalaxmi with whom he had a tiff in his office last month was elected Mayor of Hyderabad. Two, the tahsilidar was transferred after the announcement of the schedule for the election to Legislative Council from graduates constituency in spite of restrictions on transfers due to model code of conduct. The incident in the tahsildar office took a serious turn as Mr. Reddy lodged a complaint in the police station against Ms. Vijayalaxmi saying he was obstructed from proceeding to High Court in a case. He was immediately relieved after the new Mayor took over and asked to report in the office of the Chief Commissioner of Land Administration. Also, the model code of conducted mandated that the officials take the approval from the State election authority for effecting a transfer, but revenue associations are alleging that none of the procedures had been followed in transferring the official.      It appears to be a season for undertaking padayatras for the Congress leaders. Malkajgiri Member of Parliament A. Revanth Reddy was the first to start padayatra against the central government’s farm laws claiming they are harmful to the interests of the farmers. Even as Mr. Revanth Reddy is continuing his yatra, another Congress MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy has announced his resolve to launch foot march from February 20 demanding completion of works on pending projects in his native Nalgonda district on war-footing. Mr. Reddy proposes to cover 120 km yatra in six days “educating” people about the delays in completing the works along the way. Padayatras gained importance in the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh with late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy undertaking a marathon foot march and several parties tried their hands on it to highlight their grievances.    Ever since Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) rode to power on statehood sentiment in 2014, the Opposition parties did not miss any opportunity to target Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for his ‘action or inaction’ on various issues and at times linking their reactions to the farmhouse of the former’s family. More recently, Malkajigiri MP and TPCC working president A. Revanth Reddy, during his ongoing ‘rythu bharosa padayatra’ alleged that farmers in the State did not even enjoy the freedom to raise crops of their choice due to regulated farming being implemented by the State government. Rebutting the Congress leader’s remarks, TRS legislator Balka Suman said farmhouse of the CM’s family is in fact a laboratory where crops suitable to Telangana soils are tested before being advocated to farmers. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi legislator further went on to say that whenever the Chief Minister interacts with farmers and suggests some crops, he does it based on his own experiences so that farmers could get more income. Besides, the Stsate government has discontinued regulated farming following enactment of new farm laws. (M. Rajeev & B.

15 February 2021||Bhubaneswar,||‘Inter-State boundary issue creating bad blood’||A day after Andhra Pradesh held an election in a disputed region in Odisha’s Koraput district, Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said it was a matter of concern that a State had conducted panchayat elections inside another State’s geographical boundary. “It may be Andhra Pradesh or any other States, the interstate-State boundary dispute is creating bad blood. If the Odisha government does not take step in time to resolve the issue, we may have to face problem,” Mr. Pradhan said on Twitter. “The government has taken legal steps. I hope the government takes it to logical end. The administrations need to strengthen development projects and government services,” he said. A unified effort of all political parties, social organisations and individuals would help strengthen the bond with people living in border villages, said the Union Minister. While Mr. Pradhan appeared more moderate in his attack on the issue, his party did not spare the Naveen Patnaik government. “At a time when the Supreme Court has ordered a status quo in the Kotia Gram Panchayat, Andhra Pradesh has held elections for the first time, defying the apex court’s order. The Odisha government could not stop the neighbouring State from doing so,” said Sameer Mohanty, president of Odisha Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ‘Neglect by Odisha govt.’ Mr. Mohanty said, “When the illegal election was supervised by Andhra Pradesh government officials, Odisha government’s officials did not even visit the place. While people who worked under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in Kotia gram panchayat have not received their wages for the past three years, Andhra Pradesh came forward to provide electricity.

15 February 2021||Gurugram,||Death of farmers: controversy over Haryana Minister’s remark||Haryana Agriculture Minister Jai Parkash Dalal has courted controversy over his remarks that the farmers’ death during the ongoing agitation was commensurate with the annual death rate and they would have died at their homes as well. In a video clip going viral on various social media platforms, Mr. Dalal, apparently speaking to a group of journalists on the farmers agitation, said the farmers’ death during the agitation was in proportion to the annual death rate and the average age. “Around 200 people die in a population of 1-2 lakh every six months. So these farmers would have died at their homes as well,” said Mr. Dalal. He added that the farmers had died due to natural reasons during the agitation. “Some died due to heart attack. And a few were not keeping well,” said the Minister. When a journalist insisted as to why he could not express sympathy for them, Mr. Dalal retorted that the sympathy could not be expressed in bits and pieces and he had sympathy for the entire 135 crore population. “When a person dies, the entire family is hit. Many of these [the farmers who died] had young kids. I express full sympathy for those who died,” said the Minister, with those around him breaking into laughter. Mr. Dalal said an average farmer was innocent and lost his life for the “sake of sympathy for others or his caste” during the agitation. “Our own people are gullible. Soon they too will cool down,” said Mr. Dalal, a Jat, apparently referring to the participation of farmers from his own caste in Haryana in large numbers.  Damage control On being corrected by a journalist, Mr. Dalal, hastened to add that all people were part of the movement saying that he did not want to court another controversy. However, it is not for the first time that Mr. Dalal’s remarks on the farmers agitation have created a controversy. Earlier, he had said that many foreign powers, including China and Pakistan, wanted to create instability in the country in the name of farmers’ movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/death-of-farmers-controversy-over-haryana-ministers-remark/article33837932.ece
15 February 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam uses combs for voter literacy||The way to a prospective voter’s head is through the hair, the authorities in a western Assam district have found out. The Goalpara district administration has been distributing combs and other utilitarian items of daily use, such as sanitary pads, with SVEEP messages printed on them. SVEEP expands to Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation, the flagship programme of the Election Commission of India for promoting voter literacy in the country. “We chose simple essentials like the comb so that people are reminded of their civic responsibility on a daily basis,” Goalpara Deputy Commissioner Varnali Deka told The Hindu . ‘Low voter turnout’ “The district election office is particularly ramping up SVEEP activities in areas with polling stations that have recorded low overall and low female voter turnout in the 2016 Assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” she said. The four Assembly constituencies in Goalpara — Dudhnai, Goalpara East, Goalpara West and Jaleswar — averaged a voter turnout of 90.83% in the 2016 State polls but the turnout at some polling booths was less than 10% of the average of a constituency. Two such polling booths with low voting in 2016 and 2019 were Belpara Lower Primary School and Rowmari Junior Basic School, both in Dudhnai. Ms. Deka and her team have also been mobilising the Poshan Clubs in the district’s colleges to reach out to hitherto unenrolled voters with special focus on the 18-19 age group, persons with disabilities, women and other weaker sections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/assam-uses-combs-for-voter-literacy/article33837937.ece
15 February 2021||New Delhi,||Mahapanchayats giving timely impetus to farmers’ protest||The two-month-old farmers’ sit-in agitation around Delhi opposing the three farm laws seemed set to fizzle out in the aftermath of the Republic Day violence during the tractor parade, but the series of khap mahapanchayats in its wake have apparently turned the tide. These mahapanchayats have emerged as new rallying points for the agitating farmers after Republic Day. The massive turnouts at these meetings have not only been just a show of strength, but also given a new lease of life to the movement. First to hold a mahapanchayat in Haryana’s Jind on February 3 on the farm laws, Kandela Khap president Tekram says the trend is catching up fast and khaps across Northern India, including Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, are now holding mahapanchayats to support the agitation. The aim, he avers, is to show the massive support to the movement and mount pressure on the government. “Earlier, the government would say it is the movement of Punjab farmers alone. Now khaps across Northern India have extended support to it,” says Mr. Tekram, also the convener of Uttar Bharat Khap Panchayats. A recent meeting between the khap leaders and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a coalition of around 500 farmer unions, has decided to hold more such meetings in Haryana, Rajasthan and U.P. Swelling support    Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal and Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab president Darshan Pal too have been going to these mahapanchayats . It signifies that Punjab unions’ appreciation for the contribution and significance of the khaps has also gone up in the wake of the Republic Day violence. Supported by the khaps, the farmers from Haryana have now outnumbered the protesters from Punjab at the Tikri and Singhu borders. Mr. Tekram claims that the massive turnout at Kandela mahapanchayat sent across a strong message and the farmers are on the boil. “Thousands of people gathered at Jind’s Kandela. They were not Khalistanis and Maoists. They were all farmers seeking their dues,” asserts Mr. Tekram, a former BJP leader. ‘Not anti-nationals’  Farmer leader Raju Maan was among the organisers for the Charkhi Dadri mahapanchayat on February 7 along with Sangwan Khap president and Dadri MLA SombirSangwan. Mr. Maan argues that the huge crowds at the mahapanchayats manifest the farmers’ anger against the attempt to label them as “anti-national”. “It is the son of a farmer who stands guard at the border, you cannot call him anti-national,” says Mr. Maan. The conspiracy to defame the farmers fighting for their survival has infuriated them to no end and the massive turnouts at mahapanchayats are a testimony to it, he says. In Haryana, farmer unions have little influence and the political leaders have failed the farming community, so only khaps hold the fort, says Mr. Maan, a former Congressman. The women too have been turning up in hordes. The two meetings recently -- a Meo Muslims mahapanchayat in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur and another in Haryana’s Jat belt in Charkhi Dadri-- recorded a huge turnout of women. “When women can rub shoulders with men in all other spheres of life, they can fight for their rights too. Women too are farmers,” says Nirmala Devi, ex-Sarpanch Pandwan village in Charkhi Dadri. She was among the women from Haryana to participate in the Republic Day tractor parade. “I drove tractor all the way from Charkhi Dadri to Delhi and in the parade,” she proclaims with a sense of pride. The 40-year-old says that women could not camp at borders for days because of household responsibilities, but they came out to take part in the protests at toll plazas and now at mahapanchayats . Women power  All India Democratic Women’s Association national vice-president Jagmati Sangwan says the women have been contributing to the agitation in multiple ways from the onset and their participation has grown. “The women are more involved with the farming and the family than the men in Haryana. It is more so in case of small and marginal farmers. So they are impacted the most. We have been educating them about the impact of these laws and their participation is heartening. The AIDWA also created awareness among the Dalit women and labourers to tell them that this movement is not just about farmers, but also about them. It is about the food security,” says Ms. Sangwan. Young women students and sportspersons have also been visiting the Tikri and Singhu borders both to conduct research and make the contribution. Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Haryana, vice-president Satvir Singh says working class women, including the Accredited Social Health Activists and mid-day meal workers, have also been supporting the agitation and detained a couple of times. Following the Republic Day violence, the number of women protesters is swelling at the Tikri and Singhu borders as well. Having first come to the protest site to partake in the tractor rally on Republic Day, Ompati from Haryana’s Hisar says she decided to stay back at the Tikri border after things went awry on January 26. “We are from the Rakhigarhi village, 50 of us have come; almost everyone except a handful [of women] who need to tend to the fields are left in the village while the rest are here,” she says. Ompati says they would have returned if they had not seen how the government wanted to give the movement a bad name by orchestrating violence. But now they have decided to stay and not leave their boys alone. Mini buses, too, have been arranged for women protesters to travel to and from the protest site. From helping the men with daily chores, the women and young children at the Tikri border also take out foot marches and raise slogans aboard tractors with tents erected by various khaps including the Poonia, Rathi, Hooda, Guliya, Malik and Dalal on both sides of the road. But these mahapanchayats also have political overtones. Though the political leaders are not allowed to share the dias at the Tikri and Singhu borders, Meham Independent MLA Balraj Kundu was present at Charkhi Dadri meeting and three Congress MLAs from Haryana’s Nuh attended the Bharatpur mahapanchayat . Mr. Tekram, however, denies the charge. “The political leaders may be present on the dais at mahapanchayats , but they are not allowed to address. We welcome the political support, but it remains a farmers’ movement.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mahapanchayats-giving-timely-impetus-to-farmers-protest/article33837930.ece

15 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Candle march at border for Pulwama martyrs||Protesters at the Ghazipur border protest site held a candlelight march on Sunday evening in remembrance of the Pulwama attack martyrs as well as the farmers who died during the stir while Jai jawan, Jai Kisan (Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer) echoed all around. The march started from the main stage went towards the other side of the road on the blocked national highway, took a U-turn, and circled back to the main stage. A group of former defence personnel also reached the site to participate in the march. ‘Conspiracy by govt.’ Satyendra Singh, a protester, said: “All tools and conspiracy planned by the government to uproot or defame the farmers’ protest have been wasted. The government has no option other than repealing the new farm laws. We will go back home only after the new farm laws get withdrawn.” Former BSF jawan Tej Bahadur, who attended the protest and participated in the candle march, said if the government refused to repeal the laws, then they will change vote for someone else in the next election. According to him, not only farmers but also defence personnel are suffering. He requested the government for a detailed inquiry into the Pulwama attack. He alleged that the government has tried to pit farmers and soldiers against each other. Another protester, Sushil Singh from Shamli, said: “More than 70% of India’s population directly or indirectly depend upon agriculture. I request people to come forward and join the protest. Today or tomorrow, the government has to agree to the demands of farmers.” Pictures of farmers, who died during the protest, were pasted along with images of Pulwama martyrs on the main stage.

It is an insensitive government and the death of farmers or jawans doesn’t matter to them,” said Ashok Kumar, a protester.

GeneStore had promised to provide “most affordable COVID-19 testing kits” in India. Complainant Vineet Singh Chauhan, who had sales rights in the firm, said the company was misrepresenting manufacturing expenses. He said even after getting feedback from the laboratories, GeneStore continued to sell bad quality testing kits through a diagnostic , endangering public health. ‘Forced to pay labs’ They forced complainant to pay the labs to accept items as they were doing, which Mr. Chauhan rejected. The FIR stated that the firm cheated the complainant of Rs. 1.5 lakh loan/investment with fraudulent intent for administrative cost in personal account by claiming certain promised benefits such as equity.Later, he was forced to accept less margin once all work was done.

15 February 2021||Pune,||Fadnavis targets MVA govt. over Pune woman’s suicide||The alleged suicide of a 23-year-old woman in Pune has turned into a political slanging match between the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. On Sunday, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis took aim at Mr. Thackeray and the MVA, alleging that the Maharashtra police were under political pressure in probing the death in Pune. The deceased, who hailed from Parli in Beed district, belonged to the nomadic tribal Banjara community and had come to pursue her studies in Pune. She is suspected to have died after jumping from the first floor of a building in the city’s Mohammadwadi area in the early hours of February 7. Mr. Fadnavis attributed the police’s tardiness in lodging a case to State Forest Minister and Sena leader Sanjay Rathod’s alleged involvement in the case. “The police should ideally have conducted a suo motu investigation. But, it appears that they are under some kind of political pressure. Ideally, the police ought to have filed a case by now and begun the investigation,” he said. Hinting at Mr. Rathod’s probable involvement, he said it must be probed whose voice was featured in a series of audio clips allegedly linked to the case. Mr. Fadnavis alleged that Mr. Thackeray did not appear to be taking the case seriously. “The police must be allowed to get to the bottom of this case to uncover whether the woman’s alleged suicide was a case of abetment or something else. Unfortunately, either the Chief Minister is not taking this seriously or he has not obtained complete information. I urge him to do so without delay,” he said. Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut said Mr. Thackeray was a sensitive person who would ensure that justice was done in the case. He said, “Mr. Thackeray gave instructions for a probe the moment this matter came up. But in the last few years, there has been an increasing trend of character assassination and defaming a person before any conclusive evidence comes to light.” “Some people think that by indulging in such tactics, they can harm the government. However, nothing of the kind will happen,” he said, speaking in Nashik. He said Mr. Rathod had been a pillar of the Sena in the Vidarbha region, and would be probed. However, it would not be conducted in a way the Opposition wanted it. Senior Congress leader and State Minister Balasaheb Thorat defended Mr. Thackeray and dismissed allegations of the police being under any political pressure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fadnavis-targets-mva-govt-over-pune-womans-suicide/article33837903.ece
15 February 2021||Pune,||Gogoi’s remarks on judiciary shocking: Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday said former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi’s statements on the “ramshackle” state of the country’s judicial system was “shocking”. “I had read that PM Narendra Modi in a meeting with Supreme Court judges praised the country’s judicial system. Obviously, we all felt happy about it then. So, the former CJI’s statements were indeed startling and a matter of concern for all. Was Mr. Gogoi, who has been nominated to the Rajya Sabha, trying to tell the truth about the judiciary with his remarks?” asked Mr. Pawar. On Thursday, the former CJI, in a conclave organised by a prominent media house, was quoted as saying that one had to wait for an inordinate time to secure a verdict if one approached Indian courts. “How important the judiciary is as a constitutional body need not be emphasised. You want a five trillion-dollar economy, but your judiciary is ramshackled,” Mr. Gogoi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gogois-remarks-on-judiciary-shocking-pawar/article33837908.ece
15 February 2021||Washington,||Trump remains a dominant force in GOP||It is still Donald Trump’s Republican Party — at least for now. The vote by 43 of the 50 Republican Senators to acquit Mr. Trump on the charge of inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, with only seven voting for conviction, highlights just how powerful a grip he has on the party he remade in his image over the past five years. The former President, who has largely stayed out of sight at his Florida home since leaving the White House on January 20, commands fervent loyalty among his supporters, forcing most Republican politicians to pledge their fealty and fear his wrath. But after two impeachments, months of false claims that his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden was rigged, and an assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters that left five people dead, Mr. Trump remains a critical force in many of the swing districts that often decide American elections. That leaves Republicans in a precarious position as they try to forge a winning coalition in the 2022 elections for control of Congress and a 2024 White House race that might include Mr. Trump as a candidate. “It’s hard to imagine Republicans winning national elections without Trump supporters any time soon,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and aide to Senator Marco Rubio during his 2016 presidential primary race against Mr. Trump. “The party is facing a real Catch 22: it can't win with Trump but it’s obvious it can’t win without him either,” he said. Political plans Mr. Trump has not signalled his long-range political plans for after the trial, although he has publicly hinted at another run for the White House. “Whether he does run again is up to him, but he’s still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message,” one adviser said. “You can call it a kingmaker or whatever you want to call it.” Mr. Trump has maintained strong support from Republicans in polls even since the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Just days after the riot, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found 70% of Republicans still approved of Mr. Trump’s job performance, and a later poll found a similar percentage believed he should be allowed to run for office again. But outside his party he is unpopular. A new Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed that 71% of Americans believed Mr. Trump was at least partially responsible for starting the assault on the Capitol. Fifty percent believed he should be convicted in the Senate with 38% opposed and 12% unsure. Mr. Trump's defenders in the Senate argued that the trial was unconstitutional because Mr. Trump had already left office and that his remarks ahead of the riot were protected by the constitutional right to free speech.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-remains-a-dominant-force-in-gop/article33837647.ece
15 February 2021||Yangon,||‘Do not harbour fugitive protesters’||Myanmar’s new military regime warned the public not to harbour fugitive political activists on Sunday after issuing arrest warrants for veteran democracy campaigners supporting massive nationwide anti-coup protests. Much of the country has been in uproar since last week when soldiers detained Aung San Suu Kyi and ousted her government, ending a decade-old fledgling democracy after generations of junta rule. Security forces have stepped up arrests of doctors and others joining a civil disobedience movement that has seen huge crowds throng streets in big urban centres and isolated frontier villages alike. Police are now hunting seven people who have lent vocal support to the protests, including some of the country’s most famous democracy activists. “If you find any fugitives mentioned above or if you have information about them, report to the nearest police station,” said a notice in the state media on Sunday. “Those who receive them will [face] action in accordance with the law.” Among the list of fugitives was Min Ko Naing, who spent more than a decade in prison for helping lead protests against an earlier dictatorship in 1988. “They are arresting the people at night and we have to be careful,” he said in a video published on Facebook on Saturday, skirting a junta ban on the platform, hours before his arrest warrant was issued. The 1988 protests vaulted Ms. Suu Kyi to the top of Myanmar’s democracy movement, and the Nobel laureate spent years under house arrest as a prisoner of the generals. She has not been seen in public since she was detained on February 1 alongside top aides. Nearly 400 others have been arrested in the days since, including many of Ms. Suu Kyi’s top political allies, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/do-not-harbour-fugitive-protesters/article33837640.ece
15 February 2021||Washington,||U.S. President’s staffer resigns over comments to journalist||The White House said on Saturday it has accepted the resignation of a staffer who allegedly threatened to “destroy” a journalist who was asking about his personal life. White House Deputy Spokesperson T.J. Ducklo was originally suspended for one week without pay, but now the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has accepted his resignation, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. According to Vanity Fair magazine, Mr. Ducklo called Politico journalist Tara Palmeri after she began asking questions about his months-old personal relationship with a journalist from Politico rival Axios , Alexi McCammond. “I will destroy you,” Mr. Ducklo allegedly said to Ms. Palmeri in a phone call shortly after Mr. Biden’s January 20 presidential inauguration. According to Vanity Fair , Mr. Ducklo “made derogatory and misogynistic comments” to Ms. Palmeri and called her “jealous”. Ms. Psaki said the White House accepted Mr. Ducklo’s resignation after speaking with him on Saturday evening and is acting with the support of the White House Chief of Staff. “We are committed to striving every day to meet the standard set by the President in treating others with dignity and respect, with civility and with a value for others through our words and our actions,” Ms. Psaki’s statement said. As the story broke on Friday, Ms. Psaki said Mr. Ducklo apologised to the journalist “with whom he had a heated conversation about his personal life”. Mr. Ducklo, who was national press secretary for Mr. Biden’s 2020 election campaign, issued a statement on Twitter addressing his “intolerable actions”. “No words can express my regret, my embarrassment, and my disgust for my behavior. I used language that no woman should ever have to hear from anyone, especially in a situation where she was just trying to do her job,” he said. “It was language that was abhorrent, disrespectful and unacceptable.” Mr. Ducklo added that he was “devastated to have embarrassed and disappointed my White House colleagues and President Biden”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-presidents-staffer-resigns-over-comments-to-journalist/article33837637.ece
15 February 2021||Moscow,||Russia’s Foreign Minister holds talks on climate with U.S. envoy||Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov discussed climate change with U.S. envoy John Kerry and the two agreed to cooperate further within the Arctic Council, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. “During the conversation, questions were raised about the implementation of the Paris climate accord,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement released late on Saturday. ‘Welcomed decision’ The Foreign Minister told Mr. Kerry, a former Secretary of State who is now the U.S. Climate envoy, that he “welcomed” the decision by new U.S. President Joe Biden to rejoin the landmark Paris Agreement on curbing global emissions of greenhouse gases. Mr. Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump had pulled out of the 2015 accord. The two men also “underlined the need for as wide a cooperation as possible” in the area of the environment. They also agreed to “develop cooperation” within the Arctic Council — a high-level intergovernmental forum that addresses various issues, including sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic region. Strained relations The telephone conversation came at a time when already strained relations between Russia and the West have been further exacerbated by the arrest and imprisonment of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny and Moscow’s merciless crackdown on the ensuing protests. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden said the U.S. would no longer be “rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions” and demanded Mr. Navalny’s release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russias-foreign-minister-holds-talks-on-climate-with-us-envoy/article33837642.ece
15 February 2021||Islam Qala,||Fire destroys 100 fuel tankers in Afghanistan||At least 100 oil and gas tankers have been destroyed by a fire in a “catastrophe” at Afghanistan’s biggest trade crossing with Iran, causing millions of dollars of losses, officials said on Sunday. The huge blaze, which broke out Saturday afternoon at Islam Qala port, 120 km from the western city of Herat, has been contained and an investigation launched into its cause. “We were told that 100 or 200 tankers have been destroyed, but this number could be higher,” Jailani Farhad, spokesperson for the Governor of Herat province, said after visiting the scene. During the blaze, looters descended on the site, stealing goods that were being imported and exported across the border, Younus Qazi Zada, the head of the Herat Chamber of Commerce said. “The catastrophe was much bigger than imagined,” he said. “Unfortunately, irresponsible people have looted a large number of goods,” he added. Mr. Qazi Zada said initial estimates were of “millions of dollars of losses”. Mr. Farhad added that investigators needed more time to examine the extent of damage. Videos posted on social media on Saturday night showed the towering fire and huge clouds of thick black smoke billowing into the sky. On Sunday, security forces opened fire on a vehicle, killing one man, after the driver failed to stop at a checkpost that had been hastily set up to prevent suspected looters from entering what was left of the customs office compound. Around 20 people were injured in the fire, according to Herat officials. The Finance Ministry said early findings suggested that the blaze started in a tanker before quickly spreading and causing “heavy financial losses”, including fuel, tankers and customs facilities. Damage to power lines from the incident left large parts of Herat without power on Sunday. Islam Qala is one of the major ports in Afghanistan, through which most official trade with Iran is conducted. Kabul has waivers from Washington allowing it to import oil and gas from Iran despite U.S. sanctions. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said the border “was held open for trucks, cars and people running from the fire”. Afghanistan’s Vice-President Amrullah Saleh said hundreds of trucks were allowed to enter Iran to escape the fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/fire-destroys-100-fuel-tankers-in-afghanistan/article33837638.ece
15 February 2021||Moscow,||Russia’s increasing poverty rates fuel political discontent||The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a new blow to Russia’s stagnating economy, which was already chafing under Western sanctions, low oil prices and weak corporate investment. Observers say that rising poverty, falling incomes and lack of tangible government support during the pandemic are fuelling discontent with President Vladimir Putin’s two-decade rule and strengthening the opposition. Answering the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s call, tens of thousands of people have protested across Russia over the past few weeks. Russians’ real disposable incomes have been falling for the past half-decade, and contracted by 3.5% in 2020, while the cost of basic foodstuffs surged.  “From the point of view of political consequences, the current situation does not look good,” said Igor Nikolayev, head of strategic analysis at FBK Grant Thornton. “The risks for the authorities have increased.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russias-increasing-poverty-rates-fuel-political-discontent/article33837643.ece

The picture “captured the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, emerging into the early morning sunlight”, it said in a statement. The image was taken from an altitude of 24,700 km above the Martian surface on Wednesday, a day after the probe entered Mars’ orbit, it said in a statement.  ‘First picture’ Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, UAE Prime Minister and Dubai’s ruler, shared the coloured image on Twitter. “The first picture of Mars captured by the first-ever Arab probe in history,” he wrote. The mission is designed to reveal the secrets of Martian weather, but the UAE also wants it to serve as an inspiration for the region’s youth. Hope became the first of three spacecraft to arrive at the Red Planet this month after China and the U.S. also launched missions in July, taking advantage of a period when the Earth and Mars are nearest. The UAE’s venture is also timed to mark the 50th anniversary of the unification of the nation’s seven emirates. Hope will orbit the Red Planet for at least one Martian year, or 687 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uaes-hope-probe-sends-home-first-image-of-mars/article33837644.ece
15 February 2021||Islamabad,||Pakistan Army conducts exercises in Thar Desert||The Pakistan Army is holding a month-long exercise in the Thar Desert, located in the Sindh province, to prepare for conflict in extreme desert environments. The exercise, code-named ‘Jidar-ul-Hadeed’, began on January 28 and is scheduled to conclude on February 28, the Army said in an official statement on Saturday. “The four-week long defensive manoeuvre exercise is aimed at validating the concept of defence in deserts,” the statement said. Troops from the Karachi Corps will be practising tactical drills and procedures as part of the exercise. The Army said the exercises are being conducted in extreme desert conditions, 74 km ahead of Chhor in Sindh, under conventional operations. The Army has a Desert Warfare School at Chhor, which is 165 km from Hyderabad, Sindh. The school was established in 1987 to promote desert warfare. The Thar Desert is an arid region that covers over 2,00,000 sq km. It forms a natural boundary along the border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, a multinational naval exercise hosted by Pakistan, Aman-2021, began in the Arabian Sea. It will conclude on February 16. As many as 45 countries, including the U.S., Russia, China and Turkey, will be participating in the exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-army-conducts-exercises-in-thar-desert/article33837650.ece

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||When Twitter was in the right||Twitter has not complied fully with the Indian government’s statutory orders under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act to block hundreds of accounts for allegedly posting messages suggesting that the Prime Minister was planning a genocide against farmers. Twitter has said that the government’s blocking list had accounts of journalists, activists, and politicians whose accounts appear to be bonafide; that their posts are legitimate expression; and that it reasonably believes that keeping them blocked would be a disproportionate act contrary to both Indian law and the platform’s charter objectives. This apparent defiance has not gone down well with many, including the government. Independent verifications revealed that many such accounts (for example, the Kisan Ekta Morcha) did not post messages suggesting a genocide plan, although all of them had posted in favour of the farmer protests and against government measures to quell the protests. Criticism against Twitter Criticism against Twitter’s stand seems to be three-fold. One, Twitter is an intermediary bound by statutory orders of the government under the Act, and its refusal shows a lack of respect for Indian law. Two, Twitter, as a private company, cannot adjudicate or sit in appeal over the government’s judgment on what is proportionate or lawful. It may challenge the order in a court, but cannot simply choose to comply partially or not at all. Three, Twitter’s blocking of Donald Trump’s account even while he was the sitting President of the U.S. and its refusal to block here shows it denying parity to India with the U.S. Four, its defiance indicates the increasing power and impunity of Big Tech, requiring a clear and unequivocal zero tolerance response. The first two arguments miss the vital detail that Twitter, or any person for that matter, is only bound by lawful orders of the state. Twitter being a private company or a foreign company does not change that. Once there is a blocking order, an intermediary is within its rights to take a considered view on whether the order is lawful; to what extent it is lawful; and to what extent it must comply to achieve substantial compliance acceptable in law. Lawfulness of an order is not merely about citing the statutory provision, being on a letterhead with the national emblem on it, and having the designated officer’s signature and seal. For an order to be lawful, it needs to demonstrate having satisfied all statutory conditions and conditions cumulatively evolved through judicial reasoning, which takes into account constitutional provisions and international human rights jurisprudence. In a polity in which the government is limited by a Constitution and laws, different kinds of state action entail varying consequences and command varying degrees of deference. A government order of the non-statutory type is not quite the same as a government order validly issued under a statute (where the government is acting as a delegate of Parliament). Neither of them commands as much deference as an express provision of law. Even an express provision of law differs from an order of a constitutional court in that respect. One may add, even compliance with orders of a constitutional court is subject to one’s own studied sense of constitutional reason. In this case, Twitter appears to have justifiably formed an informed opinion that the blocking orders, even if validly issued under Section 69A(1) of the IT Act, are partly not lawful and that it is confident of succeeding in a challenge to the orders should the government take any coercive action to enforce them. Twitter’s actions desirable Quite apart from the social media giant being within its rights to defy government orders to the extent it views them as not being lawful, it is indeed desirable that it does so. It is undeniable that platforms such as Twitter have significant control over how people’s right to free and informed speech is fulfilled. Mechanically following government orders without regard to their lawfulness, necessity or proportionality will seriously impact their audience’s fundamental rights. The assumption of this responsibility to defy government orders is consistent with the power they wield. The tension between two powerful entities — the government and social media platforms — on questions of which speech to promote and whose speech to curtail is healthy and constructive. It acts as a check on the arbitrary power that would prevail if both were on the same side as a matter of routine. Therein also lies the response to the argument about the increasing power and impunity of Big Tech. This functional tension as demonstrated in this case, however, is no alternative to structural and institutional solutions that must be found to limit the power of both the government and Big Tech and to enforce their obligation to act rationally and responsibly. Big Tech has often sided with the government (and the political party in power), hurting its users’ rights. The Wall Street Journal report on Facebook India’s failure to act on the disinformation-laden and incendiary posts of a member of the BJP on the consideration of not wanting to be it loggerheads with the Central government is a case in point. Red Fort is not Capitol Hill Kisan Ekta Morcha is not Donald Trump and Red Fort 26/01/2021 is not Capitol Hill 06/01/2021. Mr. Trump’s Twitter account was operational with no limits on reach throughout his tenure despite repeated calls for curtailment pointing to his messages being persistently incendiary, inciteful and promoting lies. Even leading up to the day of the Capitol Hill riot, his account had been spreading misinformation (or what Twitter reasonably concluded as misinformation) calling into question the election results to the office of the President. Twitter initially resorted to the less intrusive measure of flagging his content, followed by limiting its reach before suspending his account. His account’s permanent ban was the last step in the series of measures, after an appraisal of his Twitter posts’ effect on the Capitol Hill riots and the probability of further imminent lawlessness. All of these actions were suo motu and not under government orders. If anything, the present episode is arguably among the rare instances that Twitter has accorded parity to its Indian audience with that of its U.S.’s — choosing to take an independent view of the matter and not mechanically complying with the wishes of the national government. Social media platforms enjoy better immunity and warmer first amendment protection under U.S. law that help them better guard their users’ interests against government action. The attempt to extend similar safeguards to Indian users, who also in theory are guaranteed the same protection under a universal human rights regime, is welcome. That would also be consistent with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights endorsed by the UNHRC.

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Fuzzy law, unclear jurisprudence, trampled rights||On February 1, 2021, in the wake of the intensification of the farmers’ protests and reports of violent incidents on January 26 – a number of Twitter accounts became inaccessible in India. These included (among many others) the accounts of The Caravan magazine, the actor Sushant Singh, and the Kisan Ekta Morcha handle, which was chronicling the protests. In the beginning, it was unclear whether this was Twitter’s decision, based on its belief that the accounts had violated its Terms of Service (the reason for its permanent suspension of Donald Trump from its platform, for example), or whether Twitter had been ordered to do so by the government, or by a court. As outrage mounted, the Government of India clarified that it had invoked Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, and ordered Twitter to block access to these accounts. The reason, it appeared, was the use of the hashtag #ModiPlanningFarmerGenocide, which was deemed a threat to public order. The merits of this argument aside, the government’s Section 69A order was clearly an overreach even on its own terms, as media outlets such as The Caravan had not used the hashtag. Uneasy truce Soon after, Twitter restored access to many of the withheld accounts. This prompted a sharp reaction from the government, including a non-compliance notice and veiled threats that Twitter’s employees would be prosecuted for violating Section 69A. A meeting between Twitter officials and the government appears to have yielded for now an uneasy truce. On February 10, Twitter also published a blog post (https://bit.ly/378vIof) where it remarkably — and in my view correctly — argued that the government’s own actions in directing it to withhold access to the accounts of journalists, activists, and politicians, violated Indian law, and the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of speech. These events of the last few days throw into sharp relief the unsatisfactory state of Indian law and how it is interpreted and applied by censorship-happy governments. At present, the online free speech rights of Indian citizens depend entirely upon the extent to which multinational social-media platforms are able to stand up to the government’s censorship requests, how willing they are to risk legal prosecution, and how much confidence they have that their interpretation of Indian free speech law will stand up in court, even over the claims of the government. It should be clear that this is not a sustainable situation. The root lies in the IT Act The root of the problem is Section 69A of the IT Act. Section 69A grants to the government the power to issue directions to intermediaries for blocking access to any information that it considers prejudicial to, among other things, the sovereignty and integrity of India, national security, or public order. Section 69A(3) envisages a jail sentence for up to seven years for intermediaries who fail to comply. In 2009, the government also issued “Blocking Rules”, which set up the procedure for blocking (including regular review by government committees), and also stated that all requests and complaints would remain strictly confidential. Violation of rights There are a number of problems with this legal structure. The first is that it makes censorship an easy and almost completely costless option, for the government. Rather than having to go to court and prove a violation even prima facie of law, the government can simply direct intermediaries to block content, and place the burden of going to court upon the users. It stands to reason that the easier it is to censor speech, the more likely it is that a government — any government — will resort to that option. Furthermore, the confidentiality requirement means that the user will not even know why their account has been blocked and, therefore, will be in no position to challenge it. Third, there are no procedural safeguards — no opportunity for a hearing to affected parties, and no need for reasoned orders. This, then, violates both free speech rights, as well as the right to due process. In the famous Shreya Singhal case that is well known for the striking down of Section 66A of the IT Act, the scope of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules were also litigated before the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, however, the Supreme Court missed an opportunity to guide the law in a pro-free speech direction, as it had with Section 66A: without engaging in any detailed analysis, the Court largely endorsed the legal regime, as it stood. The Court only noted that every affected individual would retain the constitutional right to challenge a blocking order, through a writ petition before the High Court. Need for transparency Now, it would appear to follow from this holding that the Shreya Singhal judgment made it mandatory for the government to furnish blocking orders along with reasons to affected parties; it is evidently impossible to challenge something that you cannot even see. However, as recent events show, in practice, that is not being followed (the lack of clarity in the Shreya Singhal judgment is no doubt a contributory factor). In a recent article in The Indian Express , Apar Gupta also pointed out that after the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Kashmir Internet Ban case, it is, at least now, an arguable position of law that any order restricting access to the Internet, or information on the Internet, must be made public. There is, at present, a pending case before the High Court of Delhi, which makes the same argument; until that is resolved, however, the present state of affairs is likely to continue. Consequently, a combination of bad law and unclear jurisprudence has created a situation where Twitter or the intermediary that might be caught in the government’s crosshairs is the only entity that is in a position to defend the free speech rights of Indian citizens. And there is little doubt that doing so entails a non-trivial risk: in particular, the record of the Indian judiciary in civil rights cases involving the government has been remarkably poor in recent times, and it would take considerable courage for any entity to bet on the proposition that its interpretation of Indian free speech law would be necessarily upheld by the courts. Thus, while it may still be possible for Twitter to stand up to the government in obvious cases of overreach and abuse, such as the suspension of The Caravan , there will be a host of borderline cases where it will simply be easier to back down; indeed, as MediaNama reported recently, the Twitter account of a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament remains suspended even now. Enable a fair hearing There is, thus, an urgent need for both legal and jurisprudential reform. Legally, the best case scenario would be to prohibit the government from being able to directly order intermediaries to block access to online information, except in narrowly-defined emergency cases, and to require it to go through court to do so, with an adequate opportunity for affected parties to defend themselves. Short of that, however, it is vitally important that blocking orders be made public, and that even under the current legal regime, affected parties be given the opportunity of a fair hearing before a blocking order is issued. This process will also ensure that the blocking order is a reasoned one, and can be effectively challenged before a court, if need be. Long term, however, the hard work of contesting governmental impunity in cases of censorship, both in courts and outside, remains to be done.

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||A disengagement deal better than expected||The year 2021 has begun on an optimistic note for reduction of military tensions between India and China. Both sides announced on February 11, the simultaneous disengagement of their massive forward deployments in the Pangong Lake area, cheek by jowl for the past 10 months in Eastern Ladakh. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a carefully worded statement in Parliament about the breakthrough which envisages a pullback by both sides in “a phased, coordinated and verified manner”. The headway in the impasse, achieved after lengthy talks between the two sides, surprised the doubting Thomases who questioned India’s will and capacity for a military counterpoise that is essential for restoration of the situation as it prevailed before April 2020. It also caught off guard those who scoff at the notion of a peaceful resolution of territorial differences in keeping with the longer-term interests of both Asian giants. Peaceful resolution Tracing the genesis of the problem since April-May 2020, when the Chinese side had suddenly positioned a large body of troops and armaments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian Defence Minister also paid rich tribute to the armed forces and lauded their valiant sacrifices.  Indeed, the intentions of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were thwarted by India’s robust military response guided by a resolute Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Relations between India and China suffered a dramatic setback following the violation by China of the bilateral agreements and protocols, which ruptured peace and tranquillity. The bloody incident at Galwan on June 15, 2020, the first involving casualties since 1975, brought about the collapse of the prevailing consensus that bilateral ties could develop in parallel with efforts to resolve the boundary question and the maintenance of peace and tranquillity. Since June last year, India has consistently highlighted the view that peace is a fundamental prerequisite for the normal conduct of relations. The stand-off at the Pangong Lake was but one of several in Eastern Ladakh, but undoubtedly among the most significant. After China took steps to alter the ground situation between Fingers 4 and 8, the Indian Army had carried out daring manoeuvres to take up advantageous positions along the Kailash range on the southern bank, thereby dominating the key Chinese garrison at Moldo across the Spanggur Gap. Even on the northern bank, the Indian Army succeeded in offsetting any initial advantage that the PLA may have had along the spurs. Message of endurance Having acquired powerful leverage, Indian troops dug in for the long haul and mirrored the PLA’s deployments. On its part, the government left no stone unturned to ensure that they were provided with the necessary wherewithal to deal with any real or perceived asymmetry. The message was unambiguous. India was not going to cave in and stood ready to impose a harsh penalty if China engaged in any act of adventurism. The endurance of the Indian Army through the harsh winter months has been extraordinary. China appears to have realised that a prolonged stand-off, hardly a part of its original calculus and of little avail militarily or politically, was permanently impairing bilateral relations. The uncertainty associated with the law of unintended consequences, the high reputational costs to itself, and the forward momentum in India-U.S. relations and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (India, the U.S., Japan and Australia), better known as the Quad, may also have proved to be factors for China. The disengagement at Pangong Lake is certainly a welcome development. This is an area in which the patrols of the two sides have been encountering one another for decades, whether on land or on the lake. The construction of a road by China from Finger 8 towards Fingers 5 and 4 many years ago had led to a spike in face-offs and gradually reduced access for Indian troops to their traditional patrolling point at Finger 8. Meanwhile, India too built better infrastructure all the way to its permanent presence at the Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3. The disengagement deal is perhaps better than one might have expected under the circumstances. The Chinese have agreed to pull back forward deployments to their permanent base at Sirijap, east of Finger 8, and to dismantle all infrastructure created after April 2020. India’s tough negotiators, both diplomatic and military, have ensured that our troops retain their presence at the permanent Indian post at Finger 3 even though China had earlier demanded that India fall back further. Moreover, all the Chinese posts atop the high spurs on the northern bank will also be dismantled, including those that overlooked the Dhan Singh Thapa Post. Of course, India will also fall back from its recently held positions along the Kailash range to earlier positions. With trust badly shattered after April 2020, one expects the Indian side to tread warily in implementing the deal at Pangong. Carrying out simultaneous disengagement in a phased and coordinated manner, with proper verification, is key to its success. There is little doubt that cautious diplomatic and military planning and hawk-like vigil will be called for throughout the implementation. Faith in forces, negotiators The government of Prime Minister Modi has amply demonstrated its willingness to take tough calls on matters pertaining to sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has demonstrated boldness in the face of a major military challenge. It has shown equal courage in grasping the nettle of peace. More importantly, the government has reposed full faith in its armed forces and negotiators. Mr. Singh’s statement, containing just the right blend of steel and velvet, generously acknowledged the unity of purpose among all departments of the government and highlighted the consistency with which India’s unwavering position was put across. Both he and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had engaged their Chinese counterparts last September and drawn the red lines. This no doubt strengthened the hand of the senior commanders and foreign ministry officials who hammered out the deal. The progress at Pangong notwithstanding, the doubting Thomases will continue to raise questions. They run the risk of doing so without sufficient familiarity with either the facts or the military complexities on the ground. The truth is that India’s tough military and diplomatic posture has paid off, resulting in an honourable disengagement. If tensions could be defused at Galwan, where much blood was shed, and at Pangong, it should be equally possible to fashion mutually acceptable terms for disengagement at Gogra/Hot Springs as well as the resolution of patrolling issues in Depsang. Over the next two to three weeks, both sides should be given a chance to implement the agreement. The temporary moratorium on military activities by both sides along the north bank, including on patrolling up to the traditional points, will improve the situation. That patrolling will be resumed only consequent to an agreement being reached in future diplomatic and military talks is also a step forward. Naturally, the pullback will prove to be a complex exercise involving meticulous planning of intricate details and scheduled withdrawals that must factor in the local terrain, the disposition of troops and a vast array of armaments. No doubt, one must also keep the powder dry. Sujan R.

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||The retreat of democracy||On February 11, The Hindu published an editorial, ‘Media as target’, on the Enforcement Directorate’s raids in the office of NewsClick, an online video news network. The editorial was unambiguous when it said: “The present regime’s record is quite dismal when it comes to the obvious use of central agencies such as the CBI, ED, IT and even the NIA, to rein in dissenting voices. It is unfortunate that specialised agencies are allowing themselves to be used as force multipliers in political battles against sections of the Opposition.” In response to the editorial, Purender, a reader, wrote: “It may be a part of ‘toolkit’... and what’s the problem, if they had not done anything wrong... why to fear... let them do their work.” Mr. Purender was not alone. Some readers read this editorial along with my last column, ‘Debunking vs. prior restraint’ (February 8), and asked two questions. Why is the ombudsman, who is independent of the editorial process, taking a similar view as the newspaper on the government’s actions? News organisations and free speech advocates always raise questions about searches by the government. If there is nothing to hide, why should they fear such raids? Diverting attention Before answering these questions, let us remember that the raid at the residence of NewsClick’s editor-in-chief, Prabir Purkayastha, lasted for nearly 114 hours. There are multiple problems with these intimidating acts. The agencies who carry out these acts know that they may not be able to get a legal judgment against journalists and media organisations. But they know pretty well that searches, selective leaks and concocted tales divert the attention of the news organisation from its task of providing credible information and generating ‘sense-making news’. As I have been arguing over the last three decades, in the case of freedom of the press, the approach of the government is to create a process that is itself the punishment for critical media players, rather than securing a judicial verdict against those media houses that actually flout journalistic rules with consummate ease. An independent ombudsman at times concurs with the newspaper and at times differs with the stand taken by the newspaper. ‘Sense-making news’ is the way to go Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, is credited for coining the term ‘sense-making news’. He has a broad and inclusive definition of ‘sense-making news’, which he thinks is central for journalism to thrive in the age of information overload. His prescription: “It is the news that helps people figure out what to believe. It helps them make order out of random facts. If information is in oversupply, knowledge becomes harder to create because it requires more sifting and sorting.” He is convinced that ‘sense-making news’ is the best way to earn public trust for quality journalism. As someone who is subjected to both information overload and credible journalism on an hourly basis, I completely endorse Mr. Rosenstiel’s views. For any observer of the Indian information ecosystem, one issue is clear. The long arm of the government is extended to muzzle the voices of those who are engaged in ‘sense-making news’. The First Information Reports filed against some prominent journalists by the Delhi Police and the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh governments, for their tweets relating to the death of a farmer during tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day, is an attempt to prevent discussions that would contribute to ‘sense-making news’. The Supreme Court has protected them from arrest in multiple sedition FIRs registered against them. But the larger question is whether the government is justified in using a colonial law like sedition to cripple independent voices. Readers should realise how these moves can have not only a chilling effect on journalism but on the entire information ecosystem. Democracy cannot thrive in a climate of self-censorship and partial reporting. The fear of executive overreach that is stifling some of our fundamental rights is very real. How else can one understand the arrest of a 21-year-old climate activist, Disha Ravi, on Saturday in Bengaluru for “spreading” the “toolkit” on the farmers’ protest? Can the Delhi Police explain how sharing a toolkit to canvass support for farmers is a crime under Sections 124A (sedition), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 120B (criminal conspiracy)? readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-retreat-of-democracy/article33837630.ece
15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Opening up the vaccine market||Today, India completes nearly four weeks since it began administering the two COVID-19 vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. During this period, the country has managed to give the first dose of the vaccine to only about eight million people, which is about 0.6% of the population. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that some 400 million people already have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in India. Assuming true herd immunity is reached when 60% of the population develops antibodies against the virus, for a population of 1.3 billion, that would require over 780 million people to develop antibodies either naturally or through vaccines. If we assume that 400 million have already developed antibodies, how will the additional 380 million develop antibodies quickly, without contracting the virus, especially given the high level of vaccine hesitancy and lack of trust in both vaccines and the government? In fact, at the current rate of vaccination, which is about eight million over four weeks, the country would require about 47 months (or about four years) to reach herd immunity. It simply cannot afford to wait that long. Constricted market In this context, it is surprising that the Indian government has stayed away from a free market system for COVID-19 vaccines, especially given that several vaccine options are now knocking at its door. Instead, there are only governmental channels, which can work only to a certain extent. The rules and elements of a free market, such as competition, choice, and prices, will go a long way in advancing social welfare. On this count, the drug regulator of India has not inspired confidence. Pfizer recently withdrew its application for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in India. There is no transparency on the Moderna-Tata discussions. Gamaleya Sputnik V has positive results and has advanced in its work with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. This vaccine should soon be ready to hit the market, but here too it seems like the regulator is slowing it down by distorting incentives. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson has its one-dose vaccine ready; Novavax’s vaccine is also in the offing; and Gennova might also speed up its clinical trials for its mRNA vaccines if incentives start making more sense through free markets. Not opening up the market for these options suggests that there may be other considerations at play here, which are beyond the health and welfare of citizens. Many households in India are waiting to pay privately for the vaccines, in addition to socially bearing the cost of the vaccine for extended families. A constricted vaccine market does nothing to help the government’s aspiration of a $5 trillion economy. In fact, the sooner the country reaches herd immunity, the more likely the chance that the economy will recover faster. Stimulating the economy would also be an incentive for the government given that its international image has taken a beating recently following the farmers’ protests. Private motivations Economists point out that since vaccines boost health and immunity, creating additional private motivations with a free market makes rational sense in India’s context. India is not really a place where one can expect private subsidies to take vaccines to socially optimal levels, such as in the U.S., because that may be socially unaffordable for the government. If this is not done, the country’s rich will find a way to engage in vaccine tourism. This would mean that events that can show celebrities taking the vaccines and reducing the stigma surrounding vaccines would be few and far between in India unlike in the U.S., the U.K., or other Western economies. Also, several Indian pharmaceutical firms must be waiting to respond with their manufacturing capacities should the tap of private channels be opened. Will the government listen? We will have to wait and hope that good sense prevails before mutating virus strains minimise our chances of efficient social and policy responses.

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Boosting confidence||The downward trend in fresh coronavirus infections in India continues to inspire confidence that the pandemic is on the wane. The daily new cases fell below 10,000 for the third time this month. India’s tally is now 10.9 million cases and fresh reported fatalities were recorded below 100 for the eighth time this month, according to Health Ministry data. On January 1, there were around 20,000 fresh infections, which fell to about 11,000 by the month end. Should this sharp decline continue for this month too, then it would be a truly propitious turn of events. So far, around 8.2 million doses of vaccine have been administered to health-care workers and some frontline workers, though this is still below the first lot of 16.5 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin that the government commissioned from their manufacturers. India has also managed to donate vaccines to neighbouring countries. For now, supply seems to far exceed demand, with only around half of those enrolled for vaccinations showing up for their doses. Saturday marked 28 days since the first doses of vaccine were administered and time for the first batch of those inoculated to show up for their second dose. The government is also considering administering vaccines to those above 50 and those younger with co-morbidities from March. India is also likely to get 97 million doses of Covishield by June — half of them by March. This is a far cry from many countries where demand far exceeds supply and experiments are under way to test if different vaccines can be administered as first and second doses, so that more people may get at least one dose. However, the disappearance of a pandemic does not equate to the vanishing of the virus. The results of the ongoing serology surveys from the ICMR, meant to estimate the prevalence of COVID-antibodies, say that only around 21% of the population has been exposed to the virus. That, combined with the fact that there is so far no reliable information on the kind of coronavirus variants prevalent in the population, means that India can ill-afford to be complacent. Though dreaded variants such as the South African one have not yet been identified in India, key mutations (E484K and N440K) that are known to help the coronavirus evade antibodies have been reported in India. In spite of a consortium of labs analysing variants since December, there is no firm indication from the Centre if the U.K. variant has been found outside of those with a history of international travel. However, the government’s message to not be complacent and continue to adhere to mask use is in the right scientific spirit, given the uncertainty about virus evolution. Considerable hesitancy continues to exist as evidenced in Chhattisgarh. The Centre should work on furnishing efficacy data on Covaxin as well as improving public confidence, in ways that the available stocks of vaccine can be efficiently used.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/boosting-confidence/article33837619.ece
15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Endless war||The Biden administration’s decision to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s Yemen war is a signal to Riyadh that the Trump-era open support it had enjoyed is a matter of the past. The U.S. offered support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen when Barack Obama was the President. Donald Trump continued that policy, overlooking the disastrous effects of the war that has turned Yemen, one of the poorest Arab countries, into a humanitarian catastrophe. In its last hours, the Trump State Department designated the Houthis, who are backed by Iran, as a terrorist organisation. Rights groups have condemned the move, saying that the designation would complicate aid efforts as the Houthis control a sizeable part of Yemen, including the capital. Mr. Biden has now taken a different line, initiating steps to remove the Houthis from the terror list, among other actions. This is part of his larger attempts to rewrite the U.S.’s West Asia policy which, under Mr. Trump, was almost entirely focused on containing Iran. The administration’s message seems to have reached Riyadh. Saudi Arabia ended a nearly four-year-long blockade of Qatar, another American ally, after Mr. Biden was elected President. It has also signalled that it would carry out domestic reforms keeping human rights in focus. But it is yet to make any definite moves to wrap up the Yemen conflict. Yemen is a case study for a war that has gone wrong on all fronts. When the Saudis started bombing the country in March 2015, their plan was to oust the Houthis from Sana’a and restore a pro-Riyadh government. Despite the Saudi-led attacks, the Houthis held on to the territories they captured, while the Saudi-backed government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was teetering on the brink of collapse. After five years of fighting, the United Arab Emirates pulled out of the war last year. And the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council wants southern Yemen to be an independent entity. While these multiple factions continued to fight, more than 10,000 people were killed in attacks and tens of thousands more died of preventable diseases. Yemen also stares at famine. It is a lose-lose war for everyone. Saudi Arabia has failed to oust the Houthis from Sana’a and is now facing frequent rocket and drone attacks by the rebels. The Houthis are living in permanent war, unable to provide even basic services to the people in the territories they control. Yemen’s internationally recognised government practically lacks any power and legitimacy at home as the war is being fought by other players. Ending the war is in the best interest of all parties. Mr. Biden should push Saudi Arabia and its allies to end their blockade of Yemen and initiate talks with the country’s multiple rebel factions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/endless-war/article33837620.ece

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||For others only (From an Editorial)||To outer space and Antarctica, the ocean floor has now been added as a nuclear-free zone, which is as much as can be said for the treaty which the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain signed last week banning nuclear weapons and other instruments of mass destruction from the sea-bed. The contribution that this pact can make to the nuclear disarmament that the rest of the world is yearning for will be practically nil. In fact, every one of the nuclear limitation treaties which the U.S. and Russia have put through so far has only been a non-armament move aimed at preventing the non-nuclear countries from acquiring atomic weapons rather than a step towards limiting their own armaments. If Washington and Moscow have agreed not to install nuclear weapons in outer space and Antarctica and on the ocean floor, it is because they feel there is no military advantage to be gained by doing so. Under the latest treaty all that they have committed themselves to do is not to “implant or emplace” nuclear weapons on the bed of the sea, in other words not to erect permanent missile launching pads on the ocean floor. Who would want to erect them there anyway? They would make easy targets for the enemy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/for-others-only-from-an-editorial/article33837628.ece
15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Ask us||Q.I am a retired senior citizen, aged 71. Along with my wife, I have invested about 50% of my retirement corpus in leading public sector banks’ and NBFCs’ deposits. The balance is distributed across SCSS, LIC Vaya Vandana Yojana, PPF, RBI 7.75% taxable bonds. Some bank and NBFC FDs worth Rs. 30 lakh will be maturing shortly. The new interest rates are very low. Kindly advise any other secure investment option available for regular income with better returns as we are dependent on our interest income.  Rajesh  A.The ultra-low interest rates in the economy have allowed lenders to raise deposits at very low rates that don’t really compensate for inflation. We do think that the abnormally low interest rates will improve once economic growth normalises. Presently it makes sense to invest mainly in Central government-backed instruments which carry the highest safety in terms of capital. We hope you have availed of the individual limits of Rs. 15 lakh both for yourself and your wife in the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme and LIC Vaya Vandana Yojana. If you have done so, the other option you can look at are the Government of India’s new series of floating rate taxable savings bonds. These bonds offer half-yearly interest at a rate which is linked to the prevailing interest on the National Savings Certificates, with a 0.35 percentage point premium over NSC. These bonds are available on tap with no maximum limit on your investments. Presently, the bonds offer 7.15%, though this rate may change as NSC changes its rates. Given that, we think interest rates in the economy are close to bottom. The possibility of rates falling below 7% is quite low. To invest in these bonds, you need apply through physical application forms available at 14 designated banks that include leading ones like SBI and HDFC Bank. You can find the details of the bond and the application form here. https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/GOI26062020.pdf. The only negative with these bonds isthey have a 7-year lock-in period; but early withdrawals are allowed with penalty for seniors like you. Given the Central government guarantee, these bonds are among the safest instruments you can buy. This apart, India Post’s National Savings Monthly Income Account is also a safe option to consider. This account with a 5-year lock-in allows up to Rs. 9 lakh investments in joint capacity. The interest rate is currently 6.6%. While this may not seem attractive, it is superior to the return on bank deposits at this juncture, for an instrument with higher safety. The account allows withdrawal after 1 year with a prefixed penalty. After exhausting these two options, you can consider investing a limited sum (say Rs. 5 lakh) in floating rate debt mutual funds with good quality portfolios. While they carry market risks, their advantage is that you can get tax-efficient income by setting up Systematic Withdrawal Plans in such funds. If you aren’t sure how to choose the right funds, take the help of a qualified advisor. Q.My mother (58) is a beneficiary of family pension. Her section 80C and 80D are full for tax purposes and I was looking to invest in NPS to get benefits under 80CCD. Please advise whether NPS is a good option? Vivek Keshri A.NPS is an option for young people saving towards retirement rather than those on the verge of retirement, seeking a pension. It may not be suitable for your mother, as it is market-linked and carries risks to her capital. This apart, she cannot withdraw the entire amount you accumulate in the scheme in the form of a lump sum when she turns 60. As much as 40% of the maturity proceeds need to compulsorily go into an annuity scheme, which is likely to provide low returns, that are moreover taxable. As your mother is set to soon turn 60, there’s also very little time to accumulate enough money in NPS to meet her requirements. There are, frankly, not too many options beyond Sections 80C and 80D to reduce the tax outgo. If you have not availed Section 80 TTA, you can park some money in savings accounts with banks that offer higher rates. Under this section, interest income of up to Rs. 10,000 is exempt from tax. You can watch out for issue of any tax-free bonds in the coming year to supplement her income.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ask-us/article33837614.ece

15 February 2021||Chennai,||Ashwin’s wizardry has England staring down the barrel||Russian Roulette it is. Which delivery has your name? It’s a cricketing version of life and death. Dust emanating from the surface on day one was a pointer. The pitch showed its true colours on Sunday when 15 wickets fell. True colours The ball turned and jumped, the bounce was uneven and all this coupled with the dust — the top soil was loose — made batting hard. Actually, this Indian team can defeat top sides on sporting tracks. It doesn’t have to manufacture a win. After bundling out England for 134 — R. Ashwin scalped five — and gaining a mammoth first innings lead of 195, India further consolidated. The host was 54 for one at stumps on the second day of the second Test at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday. Shubman Gill fell to a Jack Leach slider. Rohit Sharma — he was let off on 24 when the normally reliable Ben Foakes missed a leg-side stumping off Leach — was together with Cheteshwar Pujara (7 batting), he did not field after being struck on the hand on day one, at stumps. When England began, Ishant Sharma flummoxed opener Rory Burns with a good length delivery that nipped back. And Dom Sibley’s attempted sweep off Ashwin saw the ball brushing the back of his bat. England continued to lose wickets in heaps. Among them was key man Joe Root. Now, Root’s strength is his sweep. His strength can be his weakness, too. He swept debutant left-arm spinner Axar Patel against the turn and saw Ashwin hold the top-edge at short fine-leg. Dan Lawrence battled hard, waited for the turn and played Ashwin off the backfoot. However, the experienced off-spinner got one to bounce from round the wicket to snare the Englishman. Ashwin picked up the big scalp of Ben Stokes. Big Ben succumbed to Ashwin with the ball drifting across the left-handed Stokes to strike his off-stump. Wickets continued to fall as Kohli shuffled his bowlers having a dash of pace to complement spin. And Mohammed Siraj grabbed his first Test wicket at home with Ollie Pope getting a tickle down the leg-side and ’keeper Rishabh Pant producing a fine diving catch. Axar found the edge of Mooen Ali’s bat, and Ajinkya Rahane, in the close-in cordon, caught the ball off Pant’s pads. Then, Pant defied gravity to dive to his left to snaffle the catch after the tireless Ishant found Jack Leach’s edge. ’Keeper-batsmen shine Only wicketkeeper-batsman Ben Foakes (42 not out) offered resistance. He used his feet, went forward or played back. There were no half measures. He pulled Ashwin and then skipped down to on-drive the experienced off-spinner, off-drove Kuldeep, and presented a broad blade. In the morning, another wicketkeeper-batsman, the explosive Pant, delighted during his 58 not out. Riding on natural ability, he, almost casually, struck sixes on this track. He jumped down to Joe Root and smacked against the turn and danced down to Moeen and stroked inside out. Wickets fell at the other end. ’Keeper Foakes, with his refined technique and stunning reflexes, was sharp standing up. His lightning stumping when Moeen floated one to Axar was top class. The speedy Olly Stone, clocking around 150kmph, polished off the tail with a bouncer-fuller length routine to finish with three wickets. He has a future!  It is wonderful to have crowds back. Playing in front of my home crowd is always special and taking five wickets is something I will always cherish Ashwin    Statosphere  329 is the highest score without Extras in a completed Test innings Siraj has become the first Indian bowler to pick up a wicket off his first ball at home in Test cricket Rohit is the first player to hit 200 sixes in international cricket in India This is Ashwin’s 23rd five-for in 45 home Tests||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ashwins-wizardry-has-england-staring-down-the-barrel/article33837708.ece
15 February 2021||Melbourne,||Dimitrov stuns Thiem; Djokovic hangs on through pain||US Open champion Dominic Thiem became the first major men's casualty of the Australian Open on Sunday, as Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams survived scares to reach the quarterfinals. A fatigued-looking Thiem, last year’s runner-up and third seed coming off a five-set win over Australia's Nick Kyrgios, slumped in straight sets to Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov who took it 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 in just over two hours. Novak Djokovic clocked his 300th Grand Slam win playing through pain from an abdominal injury that nearly forced him to pull out. The World No. 1 battled on against giant Canadian Milos Raonic, grinding through 7-6(4), 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 to set up a clash with sixth seed Alexander Zverev. Djokovic's win was his 300th at a Slam, only the second player in history to reach the mark after Roger Federer, on 362. Earlier, Japan's Osaka edged a thriller with fellow Major-winner Garbine Muguruza and Williams came through a physical test against Aryna Sabalenka to maintain her bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title. Second seed Simona Halep gained revenge over Iga Swiatek after her heavy loss at last year’s French Open, where the Polish teenager won her maiden Grand Slam title. Halep won just three games against Swiatek, 19, at Roland Garros, but she turned it around with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win. In an empty Rod Laver Arena, Osaka was on the verge of elimination at 3-5, 15-40 in the third set. But the three-time Major champion rattled off four points in a row and then twice broke Muguruza's serve to prevail 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. Serena, 39, was meeting Sabalenka for the first time and she had to weather an onslaught from the Belarusian to reach the last eight 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. Milestones Taipei’s Hsieh Su-wei became the oldest player to make a last-eight debut in the Open era after winning 6-4, 6-2 against Czech Marketa Vondrousova. Hsieh’s reward is an all-Asian quarterfinal against Osaka on Tuesday. Karatsev also claimed a slice of history as he became the first player in 25 years to reach a quarterfinal on Grand Slam debut, stunning 20th seed Auger-Aliassime of Canada 3-6, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. Alexander Zverev subdued Dusan Lajovic 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-3 to bring up his 50th Grand Slam win.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dimitrov-stuns-thiem-djokovic-hangs-on-to-win/article33837777.ece
15 February 2021||Chennai,||A special double hundred for the irrepressible Ashwin||R. Ashwin and records are never far away, particularly while playing at home. The experienced off-spinner on Sunday became the first bowler in Test history to dismiss 200 left-handed batsmen. Ashwin achieved the feat when he castled England’s No. 11 Stuart Broad. It is a stunning achievement and behind Ashwin in scalping left-handers are Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan 191, and England’s James Anderson 190. This is Ashwin’s 45th Test at home and he has 268 scalps, bettering fellow off-spinner Harbhajan Singh’s 265. What makes Ashwin so effective against the left-handers. Firstly, he turns the ball sharply away from the southpaws and the ball leaving you is always more dangerous at the highest level. One that holds its line Then Ashwin can get the ball to straighten. The left-hander plays for turn but the ball holds its line. And as we saw on Sunday, he gets the ball to drift across the left-hander. He did just that on the second day here and Ben Stokes was bowled in the process. Ashwin is also someone who harnesses the angles cleverly. The same ball from a different angle will demand a different response. Ashwin has the variations as well. The carrom ball is a delivery that shapes away from the right-hander. This delivery can drift into the left-hander. Ashwin is effective while bowling at the left-handers from round the wicket, giving them little room and cramping them for space. Then he imparts revs on the ball and has got the southpaws caught in the deep as the ball dips. Level with McGrath Ashwin, on Sunday, equalled Glenn McGrath’s record of 29 five-wicket innings hauls in Tests. Both are jointly in seventh place. Ashwin has, after the England first innings, 268 home wickets in 45 home Tests at a healthy 22.54. And in 31 away Tests, he has 124 scalps at a creditable 31.18. The Chennai lad is relishing his time at home.  Obviously, the ball turning away from left-handers is a very big advantage for off-spinners. One thing I have learnt better and started doing a lot more is varying the seam position, using the crease and creating different angles Ashwinon his success against left-handers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-special-double-hundred-for-the-irrepressible-ashwin/article33837840.ece
15 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Aman wins appreciation from coaches||With a whirlwind performance in the four ITF junior tournaments this season, Aman Dahiya, who won back-to-back singles titles in Nepal, has shot into the limelight in Indian junior tennis.  After ending last year at 537 in the world junior rankings after winning three titles in a row — before the pandemic broke — Aman is already knocking on the doors of the top-100 rank. In two weeks, he did not drop a set in Nepal and beat the top seed Nishant Dabas for his first grade-4 title. The coaches who have been grooming the 16-year-old Aman, Jignesh Raval and Alexander Waske at the Altevol-Waske tennis academy in Ahmedabad, are not surprised. Fire in his eyes “When I first saw him about a year and a half ago, I saw the fire in his eyes. “I right away mentioned that this hungry young player had the potential. I really like his attitude,” said Alexander Waske from Germany. “After he had won three tournaments last year, we had a lot of plans for Aman, but COVID broke. “He was very disappointed. It was good that he was staying with me at my place. We turned this time into an opportunity. We did lots of off court work, match analysis, life style development,” recalled Jignesh. With more tournaments lined up, the target for Aman is to be around the top-80 before he goes to Germany for tuning his game with Waske. “I like the way he is respectful to his coaches and thankful for the amount of energy being put into him. “He is paying back with very good results. I have already got him a club in Germany,” said Waske. “Aman’s firepower is good. He is outstanding with his mindset of working very hard and going to the limit, playing every point. I am looking forward to see more of him,” said Waske. Jignesh was grateful to Waske for the interaction and help. The club stint in Germany will help Aman get some matches “as well as some financial help to support his tennis journey”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aman-wins-appreciation-from-coaches/article33837912.ece
15 February 2021||Coimbatore,||It’s Team Old is Gold||The greens were pretty fast and the wind swirling. Obviously, it made life a bit difficult for the golfers. But, Team Old is Gold — comprising P.R. Ramakrishnan, N. Soundarajan, D. Lakshminarayanaswamy and Anish Mathai — played well to tally 217 and emerge champion of the 23rd GKD Memorial Gold Cup all-India team golf tournament at the Coimbatore Golf Club course here on Sunday. The two-day tournament, sponsored by Lakshmi Machine Works in memory of its Founder G.K. Devarajulu, attracted 144 golfers. “With the outstation golfers around, it was a tough challenge. But, we played a good round of golf. I must say experience prevailed,” said Lakshminarayanaswamy and quickly added that Mathai did one better than the rest. “I was confident of clinching the Cup after our game yesterday. “We had a great combination and above all, we played consistent. We are all over 60 and, true to our team’s name, we proved that old is indeed gold,” said Ramakrishnan. Mathai was elated as well. “It was a terrific win but I must admit that I did not expect it. I had a good putting round but it was team effort.” CGC president R. Gopinath and golf captain Ashwin Chandran thanked the sponsors for their support over the years.  The results: Format (Team event, medal round): Nett: 1. Old is Gold (P.R. Ramakrishnan, N. Soundarajan, D. Lakshminarayanaswamy, Anish Mathai) 217; 2. V-Four (M.M. Elango, M. Ramu, K.K.

Dhoni is ever-present in Chennai. As India got on top of England with the ball, skipper Kohli urged the crowd to get behind the team and make more noise, indicating he wasn't hearing them. Soon the India skipper gestured to the fans to whistle, referencing the Chennai Super Kings’ anthem of ‘Whistle Podu’ and the faithful responded immediately by amping up the noise.

15 February 2021||DHAKA,||WI pips Bangladesh in thrilling finish||West Indies secured a thrilling 17-run victory over Bangladesh in the second and final Test to complete a 2-0 sweep here on Sunday. Off-spinner Rahkeem Cornwall played a key role, ending the match with nine for 179 as West Indies clinched the series despite stubborn resistance from Mehidy Hasan. Cornwall followed his five for 74 with four for 105 in the second innings to help the visitors bowl out Bangladesh for 213, with the hosts chasing a target of 231. Left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican (three for 47) and skipper Kraigg Brathwaite (three for 25), who bowls off-spin, also took key wickets.

15 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Ashwin defends spinning pitches||India’s top spinner R. Ashwin feels that playing on pitches that offer turn from day one is not too different to tackling seaming conditions. “It is about being patient, just like when you play on a seaming wicket. You need to tide through the early phase and start putting runs on the board,” said Ashwin when asked if the pitch was challenging to bat on as England was shot out for 134 in its first innings. “We will be putting up another batting performance on it,” he added. “When it comes to spin, they want conditions to be in their favour, be it driving or cutting. On a seaming wicket, you can’t do all that when you play in the morning. So the same benchmarks must be set when you play spin on a challenging wicket,” said Ashwin, who finished with a five-wicket haul to put the home side in control of the second Test here on Sunday. “I would say that the challenges are far greater when the ball is moving at 140-150 kph off the deck compared to a ball spinning at 85-90 kph,” he said.  When he dismissed Ben Stokes, he became the second-highest wicket-taker for India at home, overtaking Harbhajan Singh (265). Only Anil Kumble (350) has more wickets in home Tests. Ashwin is also the first bowler to have 200 dismissals against left-handers. “When I was watching the 2001 series between India and Australia when Harbhajan was playing, I didn’t even imagine I would go on to become an off-spinner for India. I was still a batsman for my State. Try and bowl like him “Back then, a lot of my teammates used to make fun of me because I used to try and bowl like him. From there, to break his tally, is incredibly special. I didn't know about it. Now that I know, I feel happy,” said th 34-year-old. Tough conditions England assistant coach Graham Thorpe felt that the conditions were demanding and early wickets had pegged the team back. “It was challenging for us on that surface on day two. They are a skilled spin attack in these conditions and it was a very good toss to win (for India). “We know the pitches deteriorate here as the game goes on and this one has gone a bit quicker,” said Thorpe.  I would say that the challenges are far greater when the ball is moving at 140-150 kph off the deck compared to a ball spinning at 85-90 kph Ashwinabout the pitch assisting the spinners   Obviously, the ball turning away from left-handers is a very big advantage for off-spinners.

15 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||AICF’s initiative to turn the page||After a year and a half that saw unprecedented infighting leading to an acrimonious election process, the All India Chess Federation (AICF) is showing signs of putting the game back on track. In its Annual General body meeting here on Sunday, it was decided to return to over-the-board competitions in a phased manner, reduce the financial burden on the registered players, hold at least one elite tournament annually, and bid for the Chess Olympiad, among others. Reflecting on the roadmap ahead, the newly-elected president Sanjay Kapoor told The Hindu , “Our players-first approach will remain paramount in everything that we do. For a start, we have decided to do away with multiple registration fees paid by the players at the district, state and National level. “From now on, the players who get registered at the district level pay an unchanged, one-time annual fee of Rs. 250. Out of this, Rs. 125 will go to the affiliates, who will give a share to the districts.” Meanwhile, Chauhan was named to replace D.V. Sundar as India’s FIDE Delegate. Ajay Patel will be the new president of Asian Zone 3.7, in place of Ravindra Dongre. Biggest takeaway “For me, the biggest takeaway from the meeting was the way the house resolved the conflicts,” said Chauhan. In Rajasthan and Maharashtra, the two rival bodies have come together, thereby putting an end to years of conflict. As a result, Rajasthan Chess Association and Maharashtra Chess Association will be back as the governing bodies in these states. Fresh elections In Bengal, a five-member committee was formed, including two members each from the warring factions of Dibyendu Barua and Atanu Lahiri, to hold fresh elections within six months as per the amended constitution, in line with the Sports Code. Sanjay Kapoor also announced AICF’s decision to bid for the 2026 Chess Olympiad, 2022 women’s Grand Prix and plans to hold the Chess League by the year-end. “The AICF has also earmarked Rs. 10 lakh to each of our 33 affiliates towards upgrading their offices and communication channels so that it helps them to serve the game more efficiently,” concluded Kapoor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aicf-initiative-to-turn-the-page/article33837909.ece
15 February 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Nationals: TTFI faces a host of challenges||The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) faces a huge test when its National championship begins at Panchkula on Tuesday. A first-hand experience of the logical challenges faced by the host Haryana Table Tennis Association (HTTA) suggests no effort is being spared in making the event a success in spite of the pandemic. A secure bio-bubble, scores of protocols, getting the players and officials to follow the instructions in ensuring smooth conduct of the ‘singles-only’ competition forms the core of the challenges facing the host Haryana Table Tennis Association (HTTA) over the next nine days. After doing away with the team championships and the three doubles events, the TTFI is starting with the women’s singles. At the outset, only players with negative RT-PCR test reports are allowed to enter the venue. Field of Play The matches will be played on 12 tables. At any given time, the Field of Play (FOP) allows only 24 players, their coaches and 24 umpires besides two officials. At the conclusion of the first set of matches, the next set of 24 players and officials are ready in the “Call Area”. They enter the FOP only after it is sanitised. At the conclusion of the ladies’ competition on February 18 and upon their departure, hotel rooms will be sanitised and allotted to the male competitors. The four-day men’s singles will commence after a day’s rest on February 20. Manika is top seed In terms of the field, Manika Batra leads 16 players into the main draw where they will be joined by 48 qualifiers. In the qualifying stage, there are 47 groups of three players and one group consists of four. The group toppers advance to the knockout phase. Though Manika is ranked as low as 18th in the National rankings after she played in the Inter-Institutional championship and skipped the rest of the domestic circuit in the previous season, the TTFI made her the top seed due to her world ranking of 63.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nationals-ttfi-faces-a-host-of-challenges/article33837913.ece
15 February 2021||Manchester,||Relentless Manchester City marches on||Manchester City’s relentless march towards reclaiming the Premier League title continued with a 3-0 romp over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. In-form Ilkay Gundogan scored twice for City, which has now won 11 Premier League games in a row. The German took his tally to 11 league goals this season as he struck twice in the second half after Rodri’s first-half penalty, following a foul on Gundogan by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, had given Pep Guardiola’s side the lead. Victory put City on 53 points.  Messi again Lionel Messi scored with two scorching strikes as Barcelona hammered Alaves 5-1 on Saturday in LaLiga to warm up for its upcoming Champions League clash with PSG in style.  Spezia felled another Serie A giant as it shocked league leader AC Milan with a dominant display in a 2-0 victory on Saturday. Having already beaten AS Roma in the Coppa Italia and Napoli in the league since the turn of the year, Spezia, making its Serie A debut this season, scored twice through Giulio Maggiore and Simone Bastoni, both in the second half, to seal a surprise success.  The results: Premier League: Southampton 1 (Ings 25) lost to Wolves 2 (Neves 53-pen, Neto 66); West Brom 1 (Diagne 2) drew with Manchester United 1 (Fernandes 44).

15 February 2021||Dubai,||Asian records for Praveen, Nishad||Teenaged high jumpers Praveen Kumar and Nishad Kumar produced their personal best efforts to take a gold each and set new Asian records as curtains came down on the 12th Fazza International World Para Athletics Grand Prix here. Praveen’s and Nishad’s gold medal-winning efforts were the high points for India, which also had three silver and a bronze on Saturday, to end its campaign with 23 medals. Thailand returned home with 34 medals. Praveen’s 2.05m jump was enough to set a new Asian record and fetch him the gold in men’s high jump F42/44/64. He finished ahead of former Asian Para Games gold medallist Sharad Kumar (1.76 m) and Hamada Hassan, who also cleared the 1.76m bar.  This was Praveen’s first senior international gold in his second senior event after the Dubai 2019 Worlds where he had booked a Tokyo Paralympics quota with his fourth-place finish. Nishad, who already has booked a Tokyo Paralympics quota with his bronze medal finish at the Dubai 2019 Worlds, leapt to his personal best 2.06m for the gold and an Asian record in men’s high jump T46/47 (for competitors with a below elbow or wrist amputation).  Earlier, Simran won her second medal in the championships — the women’s 400m final T13 silver in 1:01.56. Simran already had a gold in the women’s 100m T13. Bhagyashri Mahavr Jadhav claimed silver in women’s shot put F34 with 6.18m behind Morocco’s Saida Amoudi (8.33m). Atul Kaushik claimed men’s discus F57 bronze with a 42m throw.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/asian-records-for-praveen-nishad/article33837779.ece
15 February 2021||BENGALURU,||My steady rise to success can inspire many: Vignesh||D. Vignesh vividly remembers the early days of the Indian Super League (ISL). “We all know who all came… Del Piero, Marco Materazzi and all stars. I didn’t even dream of playing ISL because I wouldn’t have got in. There was Lucio, Elano… all World Cup players. I thought I could reach that stage only much later.” After six years of toil, the 22-year-old Bengaluru native has finally realised his dream, becoming an integral part of Mumbai City FC, for whom he has played in all sixteen games this season — including eight starts. The icing came against Hyderabad FC last month when he scored one of the goals of the season, a stupendous volley after bombing forward from his left-back position. On Monday, he will be up against his hometown club Bengaluru FC, as Mumbai looks to ward off ATK Mohun Bagan’s threat in the race for the AFC Champions League spot. “I feel very lucky to have got this opportunity under Sergio Lobera (Mumbai coach),” Vignesh says. “Last two years I didn’t get many chances (under Jorge Costa). So, I wanted to prove myself. I am training with that mindset and that is what has helped me do whatever I have in the available game-time.” Vignesh credits the Ozone Academy in Bengaluru for shaping this journey of his, that has also seen him play for the India age-group teams before making his national team debut at the 2018 SAFF Cup. “At Ozone, for the first two years I was under Bert Zuurman from Holland. His game style was similar to Lobera’s. That’s where I first learnt that a left-sided defender can also play on the attack. Then under David Booth I felt a big impact on my game. He knew what was required to succeed in India and I developed the aggression and confidence.” “Lobera believes in the same attacking style I was playing at Ozone. So, it was easy to fit in and also easier to understand what the coach wanted.” Vignesh believes that his story can inspire more players in the various city-based local leagues to dream big. “I have reached this stage after playing BDFA Super Division (in Bengaluru) and I-League Second Division. So, it is not impossible for those players to come up.” “If you are focussed and true to yourself, you can achieve. That should be the motto. Why limit at ISL, you can even go abroad and play.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/my-steady-rise-to-success-can-inspire-many-vignesh/article33837774.ece
15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Krishna’s goal helps ATKMB reach the top||Roy Krishna’s finish late in the second half helped Mohun Bagan prevail over Jamshedpur FC in an ISL match at the Fatorda Stadium. The win propelled Mohun Bagan to the top of the table with 36 points from 17 outings. Mumbai City, which Bagan dislodged from the top, will now have to win its match against Bengaluru FC on Monday to regain its position. Bagan had a penalty claim in the sixth minute when Krishna went down on a Hartley challenge but the referee deemed the tackle valid. Jamshedpur operated well on the breaks but none of its attackers had a clear look at goal. Just when frustration was welling up, Krishna produced a brilliant finish to break the deadlock. David Williams, his attack partner since their Wellington Phoenix days, paved the way with a nice diagonal chip that found Krishna unmarked inside the Jamshedpur box. The Fijian striker created space and powered an angular left-footed grounder that found its way past the Jamshedpur goalkeeper T.P. Rehenesh.  The results: ATKMB 1 (Roy Krishna 85) bt JFC 0; NEUFC 3 (Luis Machado 9 & 24, Deshorn Brown 19) bt Odisha FC 1 (Bradden Inman 45)..

15 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Reshma wins u-20 10km||Reshma Patel won the under-20 10km at the eighth National/ fourth International Race Walking Championships in Ranchi, on the second and final day of the competition on Sunday. With the women’s 35km shelved due to lack of entries — the best walkers focussing on the 20km instead — the spotlight was on Reshma and Munita Prajapati, who had set new junior National records in 5,000m and 10,000m race walk respectively at the National junior championships in Guwahati only last week. While Reshma completed the event in 49 minutes 28 seconds, a comfortable 29 seconds quicker than second-placed Geeta Lohar. Olympian Manish Rawat won the inaugural men’s 35km event in 2:49:12, a nine-minute margin over second-placed Ganapati Krishnan of Tamil Nadu. In the 50km, Punjab’s 36-year-old Gurpreet Singh won in a personal best time of 3 hours 59 minutes 42 seconds and became the fifth Indian to break the 4-hour mark over the distance.

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Steeped in devotion||In the 18th century, Amritalinga Iyer of Thirukkadaiyur was blessed with a child who was named Subramaniam. Right from childhood, Subramaniam was a devotee of Goddess Abirami of the temple in that town. So steeped in devotion was he that his parents were afraid he might become an ascetic. So they got him married. But marriage did not diminish his bhakthi, said M.A. Manickavelu, in a discourse. One day, King Serfoji of Thanjavur visited the temple and an abhisheka was done for Amritakateswara, the presiding deity of the temple. When the king arrived at the shrine of Abirami, he asked Subramaniam who he was. But there was no reply from Subramaniam. The king was told that Subramaniam was a mad man and that was why he had ignored the king. The king then asked Subramaniam what day of the month it was. Still engaged in the worship of Abirami, Subramaniam said it was a full moon day. But it happened to be a new moon day! And the angry king said that if the moon did not appear that evening then Subramaniam would be punished. As the day came to a close, a fire was lit, a wooden platform was erected above it, with hundred ropes tied to it. Subramaniam mounted the platform and began singing in praise of Abirami. At the completion of each verse, a rope was cut. Once all hundred ropes were cut, he would fall into the fire. But, when he finished singing the 78th verse, and began the 79th a miracle happened. Abirami appeared in the sky and flung her diamond earring which lit up the sky as a full moon! Subramaniam was saved! He sang more verses and stopped only when he had sung 100 verses. The world was shown what a great bhakta Subramaniam was. The king gave him the title Abirami Bhattar and gifted land to his family to be enjoyed by his descendants too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/steeped-in-devotion/article33837702.ece

15 February 2021||February 15 2021 00:00 IST,||NEUFC climbs to third||NorthEast United FC played football of a delightful kind. The Highlanders passed with precision and finished with panache as they defeated Odisha FC 3-1 in the ISL at the Tilak Maidan Stadium, Vasco da Gama (Goa), on Sunday. The win took them to 26 points and to third in the table, behind Mumbai City (34) and ATK Mohun Bagan (33). It also brightened their chances of making the playoffs. Odisha remains at the bottom with nine points. Luis Machado struck twice and Deshorn Brown once for NorthEast, while Bradden Inman pulled one back for Odisha. All the three goals scored by NorthEast were lovely. The first of those came in the ninth minute. From the right flank, V.P. Suhair gave a fine pass to Ashutosh Mehta, whose superb cross found Machado inside the box. The Portuguese winger volleyed the ball home with flourish. Ten minutes later, Brown's pace helped NorthEast double the lead. After receiving an excellent through ball from the hard-working Man-of-the-Match Federico Gallego, he pierced the defence and drove the ball between Odisha's bewildered goalkeeper Arshdeep Singh. Machado made it 3-0 with a lovely header on the 24h minute. Gallego had a leg in that goal too, as he came up with a splendid cross. The Highlanders had taken control, with Gallego reigning supreme in the midfield. Odisha, however, was able to reduce the margin at the stroke of half-time, as the NorthEast defence was caught napping. Inman slotted the ball home off an assist from Daniel Lalhlimpuia. After all that heady stuff, the second half paled, though it saw Gurjinder Kumar getting a second-yellow card and NorthEast being reduced to 10 men with four minutes left in normal time. Bagal on top In another match, Roy Krishna’s finish late in the second half helped Mohun Bagan prevail over Jamshedpur FC in an ISL match at the Fatorda Stadium. The win propelled Mohun Bagan to the top of the table with 36 points from 17 outings.  The result: NEUFC 3 (Luis Machado 9 & 24, Deshorn Brown 19) bt Odisha FC 1 (Bradden Inman 45); ATKMB 1 (Roy Krishna 85) bt JFC 0.

15 February 2021||New Delhi,||CAT relief to reserved category nursing officers||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has granted relief to a bunch of reserved category nursing officers, who were denied their choice of branch posting in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The tribunal ruled that meritorious reserved category candidates cannot be put to disadvantage merely because they make it to general unreserved list. It directed AIIMS to allot preferred choice of posting to those meritorious reserved candidates, who had filed the petition, taking into consideration their merit. The applicants, who belong to OBC, SC and ST categories, in their collective petition had claimed that they were not allotted their first preference of AIIMS institutes — Bhopal, Jodhpur, Patna and Raipur — even after scoring higher marks than other reserved category candidates. Not meritocracy The petition filed through advocate Gyanant Kumar Singh claimed that after the result of the exam was declared on February 20, 2020, the petitioners were placed in the unreserved/general category merit list, having scored more marks than their counterparts in the reserved category lists. “The applicants being put in the general merit list were not allotted their first preference while many of their counterparts in the reserved quota lists who had scored less marks were allotted institutes listed as their first preference,” Mr. Singh said. He argued that an ST candidate having overall rank of 952 did not get Bhopal, while less meritorious ST candidate with rank as low as over 4,228 had been allotted AIIMS Bhopal as the candidate was in ST list. Acting on the petition, the tribunal ordered AIIMS to revise the posting of the candidates within two months.
