The PLA said the announcement, made eight months after the clash, was aimed at honouring the soldiers and “setting the record straight”, after it accused India of “distorting the truth” and “slandering the Chinese border troops”. Twenty Indian soldiers died in the clash, which marked the worst violence on the border since 1967. The official PLA Daily said “five Chinese frontier officers and soldiers stationed in the Karakoram Mountains have been recognised by the Central Military Commission of China for defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, one of whom was injured. “Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong and Xiao Siyuan fought to the last minute and sacrificed their lives,” the report said, adding that Chen Hongjun was a battalion commander. “Wang Zhuoran, a fellow soldier, also gave his life to rescue his comrades when crossing the river to support the others.” The regimental commander of the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, Qi Fabao, was also recognised “and given the title of “hero regimental commander for defending the border”. The report said he sustained “a serious head injury” and survived. A first-class merit was awarded to Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran. The report, however, did not say how many injuries the PLA suffered in total.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/4-pla-soldiers-died-in-galwan-china/article33884759.ece

20 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. open to talks, CM tells party||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday reportedly told the CPI(M) State secretariat that his government was open to talks with the striking Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) rank holders. By one account, the CPI(M) did not want to cede political advantage to the Opposition by inadvertently giving the impression of being unsympathetic to the angst of youths for government jobs. The party also seemed aware that the BJP had attempted to steal a march on the government by seeking the intervention of Governor Arif Muhammad Khan. BJP State vice president Sobha Surendran had on Friday shepherded the leaders of the striking rank holders to meet Mr. Khan at Raj Bhavan. In her memorandum to Mr. Khan, Ms. Surendran said the Left Democratic Front government had made an estimated 1.19 lakh back-door appointments by sidestepping the PSC. Its actions had whittled down employment chances via the constitutional body and driven the youth to the street in protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-open-to-talks-cm-tells-party/article33884897.ece

20 February 2021||TENKASI,||Action against anti-CAA protesters, lockdown violators will be dropped: CM||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Friday that the cases registered against those who had protested against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, last year would not be pursued any further. However, the cases filed for major offences would not be dropped. He also said the cases registered against members of the public on the charge of violating the COVID-19 lockdown rules would also not be pursued. “This decision has been taken considering the well- being of the common man,” Mr. Palaniswami said while campaigning at Kadayanallur, which has a large Muslim population, in Tenkasi district. He also addressed a well-attended public meeting on the third day of his campaign in the southern districts. Mr. Palaniswami said around 1,500 cases had been registered against the anti-CAA protesters. “Among these cases, except for those filed for preventing the police from discharging their duty and for specific offences, further action is being dropped,” he said. The cases had been filed against over 10 lakh persons for violating orders issued under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939, and the Epidemic Act, 1937, to enforce the COVID-19 lockdown since March 25 last year and for allegedly spreading rumours about the pandemic. The relief would not be applicable to the cases registered for specific offences such as illegally obtaining and misusing e-passes and prevention of policemen from discharging their duty. Mr. Palaniswami said his government had withdrawn many cases registered against those who had protested against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project. It would consider withdrawing the remaining cases, all in the stage of FIR and pending before court. He made the announcement after the coordinator of the People’s Movement Against Nuclear Energy, S.P. Udhayakumar, and others submitted a memorandum to him on Thursday night, seeking withdrawal of all the cases. The Chief Minister assured the petitioners that he would look into their appeal and discuss the issue with the Director-General of Police. In the petition, villagers of Idinthakarai, Kudankulam and Kooththenkuzhi sought withdrawal of the 105 cases pending against a few thousand villagers for having participated in the agitation at Idinthakarai between 2011 and 2014. In all, 349 cases were registered against over 2.27 lakh persons, both identified and unidentified. Of these cases, 213 cases were closed, and action was dropped in 31 cases following the direction of the Madras High Court. Of the remaining 105 cases, the charge sheet has been filed in 37 cases at the Valliyoor court and the remaining 68 are still in the stage of FIR. Since 40 of the 105 pending cases have been registered under Sections dealing with sedition and waging of war against the state, the affected persons are in an uncomfortable situation. These cases stand in the way of the villagers applying for and renewal of passports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/action-against-anti-caa-protesters-lockdown-violators-will-be-dropped-cm/article33884795.ece

At a meeting of the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court at Kumily on Friday, it was informed that the rule curve level had been finalised by the CWC. It also discussed the inflow forecasting system at the Mullaperiyar dam. It is in accordance with an apex court order raising the water level to 142 ft in 2015. With the rule curve level coming into effect, the dam cannot be allowed to hold water above the level that is fixed in accordance with the rainfall pattern in the area. The CWC has already set the new rule curve level for the Idukki reservoir downstream of the Mullaperiyar dam. As per the rule curve level, Tamil Nadu has to draw more water in case of an increased inflow into the dam. It was a long-pending demand of Kerala to keep the Mullaperiyar water level at a manageable level after it was raised to 142 ft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-fixes-rule-curve-level-for-mullaperiyar/article33884941.ece
20 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Modi launches slew of infra projects in Kerala||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated a bevy of infrastructure projects in Kerala, including the 2,000-MW Pugalur-Thrissur high voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission corridor. He said the power transmission corridor would ensure the transfer of a large quantum of power from the national grid to the State and guarantee reliable access to electricity. Stating that “development is our aim, development is our religion,” the Prime Minister also inaugurated, via videoconference, a 50-MW solar park in Kasaragod and a 75-mld (million litres a day) water treatment plant at Aruvikkara, Thiruvananthapuram, and launched the work on two Smart City Mission initiatives in the capital — the Rs. 427-crore 37-km Smart Road project and the Integrated Command and Control Centre at the City Corporation. “The great Malayalam poet Kumaran Asan said, ‘I’m not asking your caste, sister, I ask for water. I’m thirsty’. Development and good governance do not know caste, creed, race, gender, religion or language. Development is for everyone,” Mr. Modi said.

Development strategies targeting the fishermen community were based on “more credit, increased technology, top-quality infrastructure, and supportive government policies”. Government policies would ensure that India became a hub of seafood exports, he added. Presiding over the function, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that in a federal structure, it was imperative that governments at various levels work together for the benefit of the people. Mr. Vijayan assured the Centre of the State’s continued cooperation in projects that were being implemented jointly by the State and the Centre.

The process started on February 10, with tanks and mechanised columns being pulled back initially from the south bank. The other major friction areas between the two countries are Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plans.

20 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka drops 2 pages from Class VI textbook||The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) in Karnataka has decided to withdraw two pages from a lesson, “Birth of new religions”, that was part of the Class VI social studies textbook. The content talked about some practices during the latter Vedic period. In a letter issued by the Karnataka Textbook Society, teachers have been told not to teach two pages from the lesson that carry references to practices, such as animal sacrifice during religious rituals. The lesson states that offering foodgrains in fire rituals and animal sacrifices added to food scarcity. The lesson further states that Sanskrit, used extensively in religious ceremonies, was not accessible to a larger section of people. The department has ordered that pages that refer to these be omitted based on the instructions given by Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar. Earlier, a delegation from the Brahmin Development Board had petitioned Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa that certain contents in this chapter be omitted since it “hurt the sentiments” of the community. The Minister had then said that contents of the book were prepared years before the BJP government came to power. Speaking to The Hindu, writer Baragur Ramachandrappa, who headed the textbook revision committee that drafted the syllabus, said that with these two pages gone, a significant chunk of information pertaining to the birth of Buddhism had been deleted. “The information omitted was also part of the NCERT book and was based on facts. When a controversy arises, governments cannot take a decision on what needs to be eliminated unilaterally. Subject experts should take a call on such matters based on facts,” he said. Officials of the DPI said a committee was formed to look into this matter but did not elaborate on the modalities involved. The Minister had then said that contents of the book were designed years before the BJP government came to power in the State.

20 February 2021||Kozhikode,||BJP meet to take stock of political situation in Kerala||Rattled by allegations of factionalism in the party here, the BJP Central leadership will strictly monitor the selection of candidates for the coming Assembly polls in the State. Sources say a clear picture on the poll strategy will emerge when BJP national office-bearers meet in Delhi on Sunday to take stock of the political situation in poll-bound States including Kerala. Although BJP president J.P. Nadda has asked chiefs of the State units to be present at the meeting, State president K. Surendran, busy commencing his Vijay Yatra from Kasaragod, will not take part in the conclave. However, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Prahlad Joshi, who is the election in-charge for Kerala, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, also in-charge for Kerala, and C.P. Radhakrishnan, party State in-charge (Prabhari), are expected to take part in the meeting. Already, the Central leadership, the sources say, has received reports about the grim reality of the faction-ridden party in the State, an issue that remains unresolved for over a decade. More than having to balance the main factions led by Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan and national executive committee member P.K. Krishnadas, the Central leadership now faces a fresh task of dealing with national executive committee member Sobha Surendran who had raised a banner of revolt against the State leadership. Now out of the State core committee, Ms. Surendran has portrayed herself as a victim of partisan politics and probably feels the national executive committee reshuffle, due in some days, may not include her. In the run-up to the polls in 2016, the Central committee had received numerous complaints about the selection of candidates and the arbitrary decision of the State committee in sharing of seats among its two prominent factions. Sources feel, with Assembly elections impending, an intervention was now necessary to reboot the party’s electoral strategy on a wider canvas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-meet-to-take-stock-of-political-situation-in-kerala/article33884939.ece
20 February 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul flags delay in review of OROP||At the second day of the three-day meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioned government officials on the review of One Rank One Pension (OROP) which has been pending since last June. Ministry officials, according to sources, informed the panel that there were certain ‘loopholes’ which need to be fixed. A committee has been constituted to look into the issue and a review will be held once the committee submits its report, officials said. Last year in June, the Defence Ministry had formed a committee to work out the modalities of the revision but no announcement has been made on when the revision would be undertaken. After the war of words between committee Chairman, Jual Oram of the BJP, and Mr. Gandhi at the meeting on Thursday, it is learnt that that Chairman did not intervene on Friday The Congress had earlier in Parliament raised the issue of a cut in Defence budget, especially the allocation for pensions for the retired personnel. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her reply to the Budget debate had informed both Houses of the Parliament that the reduction in pension allocation was because OROP arrears had already been paid. OROP implies uniform pension to personal based on rank and length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement. The Government had implemented the long pending demand of veterans in November 2015 and as per the notification, it is to be revised every five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-flags-delay-in-review-of-orop/article33884728.ece
20 February 2021||Patna,||Jharkhand HC denies bail to RJD chief in fodder scam case||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday denied bail to Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad in the case pertaining to the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs. 3.13 crore from the Dumka treasury in then undivided Bihar between December 1995 and January 1996. Mr. Prasad was sentenced in this fourth case of the multi-crore fodder scam, in March 2018. The decision spread a pall of gloom among RJD leaders and workers in Patna and Ranchi who were hoping that Mr. Prasad would come out of jail. “The court denied bail to Mr. Prasad on the ground that he is still two months short of serving half the jail sentence in the case. The court will hear the case afresh after two months,” Mr. Prasad’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar told the media in Ranchi. Earlier in October 2020, Mr. Prasad was granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court in the Chaibasa treasury case (RC 68 (a) / 1996) as he had served half his jail term in the case. Convicted in several cases pertaining to the Rs. 950-crore fodder scam of fraudulent withdrawal of money from different treasuries of Jharkhand districts in undivided Bihar in the name of supplying fodder to animals, Mr. Prasad has been at the Birsa Munda central jail of Jharkhand since December 2017. Currently Mr. Prasad is undergoing treatment at the AIIMS in New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jharkhand-hc-denies-bail-to-rjd-chief-in-fodder-scam-case/article33884703.ece
20 February 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. surviving on fuel taxes: Congress||Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused previous governments of being dependent on imported crude that “burdens” the middle class, the Congress on Friday hit back by alleging that domestic crude production under his government had fallen substantially from its level during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime. Taking a dig at Mr. Modi's andolan jeevi [professional agitator] comment, the Congress termed the Modi government indhan-tax jeevi [surviving on fuel taxes] and the BJP Bhayankar Janloot Party.  At a press conference, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala and spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the domestic production of crude oil had fallen by as much as 53.66 lakh metric tonnes in the past six years. The party accused the government of earning over Rs. 21.5 lakh crore as taxes on petroleum products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-surviving-on-fuel-taxes-congress/article33884706.ece
20 February 2021||Mumbai,||After 15 months, Mumbai sailor is glad to return home||For the last 15 months, 46-year-old Anand Fernandes has stepped foot on land only once. A resident of Vasai near Mumbai, Mr. Fernandes was a crew member on the cargo ship Anastasia ,  which was stranded at a Chinese port due to the coronavirus pandemic. And though he finally returned to Mumbai four days ago and is desperate to meet his 12-year-old son, he will have to wait for two more days due to the mandatory quarantine for foreign travellers coming to Mumbai. “I know I have to follow the rules. But imagine not meeting to your family for 15 months. It was mentally exhausting. Never in my two-decade long career, have I been away from my family for such a long period. We knew people from outside were helping us, but that feeling of uncertainty never left me,” Mr. Fernandes said, speaking to The Hindu over telephone. Mr. Fernandes is currently being kept at a mandatory seven-day quarantine at a hotel in Andheri East. Mr. Fernandes started his journey on Anastasia before the pandemic in November 2019 and the ship travelled to the U.S., Netherlands, South Africa, India, China, and Australia, However, the second trip to China resulted in the ship being stranded in Chinese waters as the pandemic scare prevented unloading of Australian coal. China also had new regulations on imports. “We had to work on our mental health. We had to be careful to ensure nobody lost his control as we did not want any untoward incident on the ship,” said Mr Fernandes, who worked in the engine department of the vessel. After the successful negotiations with Chinese officials, the ship was then taken to Japan from where the crew flew to Dubai and then to the respective cities of residence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-15-months-mumbai-sailor-is-glad-to-return-home/article33884717.ece
20 February 2021||Kolkata,||NEP is a milestone to self-reliant India: PM||Describing the new education policy as a major milestone in the making of a self-reliant nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore developed systems at Visva-Bharati which were the medium of modernising Indian education and freeing it from the shackles of slavery. Mr. Modi, who was virtually addressing the convocation at Visva-Bharati University, said the new education policy promoted entrepreneurship and self-employment, research and innovation. “This education policy is a major milestone in the making of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” he said. The Prime Minister said West Bengal had served as an inspiration for ‘Ek Bharat-Shreshth Bharat’ (One India-Superior India) and added that Visva-Bharati would play a big role in the 21st century knowledge economy, taking Indian knowledge and identity to every corner of the world. He urged the students of Visva-Bharati to prepare a vision document for next 25 years about when the country would celebrate 100 years of independence. Mr. Modi said students should utilise the knowledge for society and should not be part of the problem but of solution. The Prime Minister said Gurudev Tagore named the university Visva-Bharati, meaning ‘Global University’, since he expected that anyone who came to learn in the university would see the whole world from the point of view of India. He said Visva-Bharati was not just a knowledge imparting institution but an attempt to reach highest goal about realising the self. “So, he made Visva-Bharati such a place to learn, which can be seen in the rich heritage of India. He gave a call researching on Indian heritage and working towards solving the problems of the poorest of the poor,” the Prime Minister said. Mr. Modi also quoted Tagore’s poem Chhatrapati Shivaji on the unity of India and also Gandhian Shri Dharampal’s book ‘The Beautiful Tree- Indigenous Indian Education in the Eighteenth Century.”   Tagore gave a call to work towards solving the problems of the poorest of the poor Narendra Modi Prime Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nep-is-a-milestone-to-self-reliant-india-pm/article33884727.ece
20 February 2021||Kozhikode,||Little chef sets a new Asian cooking record||Hayan Abdulla dreams of setting up a ‘pasta bar’ and making everyone fall in love with pasta. It may sound insignificant coming from a nine-year-old. But not very much when one learns about Hayan’s talent in cooking. This Class 3 student of Sherwood Hall Senior Secondary School in Chennai cooked up a storm at Feroke, Kozhikode, recently, setting a new record gaining entry to both India Book of Records and Asia Book of Records. He whipped up 172 dishes in just one hour. The dishes he prepared include different types of salads, munchies and dosas. Of them, a delicacy made of sausages is Hayan’s personal favourite. “I just boiled the sausage and served it with mayonnaise and sauce. It’s yummy,” Hayan said. He hails from a family known for its restaurant chain in Chennai and started showing an interest in cooking when he was just three-and-a-half years old. Now he runs a YouTube channel, Hayan Delicacy. He has also been part of several cooking shows on television. “My family lives at Feroke. Kozhikode is known to be a hub of food items and foodies as well. Hence we chose this place for the feat,” said Rasha P.V., Hayan’s mother. He is also passionate about dancing and playing the violin and aspires to be a pilot. Hashnas Abdulla and Rasha are all support for their son’s endeavours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/little-chef-sets-a-new-asian-cooking-record/article33884688.ece
20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Make private traders pay MSP: Kisan Sabha||Minimum support prices for farm produce should be paid by private traders, not just the government, the All India Kisan Sabha said on Friday. The Left-affiliated farmers organisation, which is part of the ongoing farm protests, argued that its proposal for legally guaranteed MSPs would not place the entire additional burden on the government budget, or ultimately, the taxpayer. Instead, the large corporates who make large profits from agribusiness must be forced to share their surplus with the primary producers, AIKS general secretary Hannan Mollah told journalists. “Basmati farmers get paid Rs. 18-30 per kg for their crop. The Adani group’s Fortune Special Basmati rice is sold at Rs. 208 per kg. Some brands sell in the range of Rs. 700 to Rs. 2,200 per kg. Those who make such immense profits must share some of it with primary producers. Why not pay Rs. 40 per kg to the farmer? There will still be plenty of profits left over,” he said. Mr. Mollah argued that the Centre’s role was to enact a law stipulating that no one — neither government nor private players — could buy farm produce below the MSP rate. “We are not saying that the government should purchase everything. We are not stubborn. We understand that no government can pay that kind of money. Let the government buy 15%, [which is] needed for the public distribution system anyway. But the remaining 85% should also be bought at a remunerative price for the farmer,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/make-private-traders-pay-msp-says-aiks/article33884707.ece
20 February 2021||Guwahati,||Sun shines at night in remote Nagaland village||A remote village in Nagaland is celebrating the sun – for shining at night. The bamboo torch was the source of light after dusk in Shinnyu for almost 44 years after it was set up close to the border with Myanmar. The last of these torches were lit on February 15, the day before solar-powered bulbs lit up the village of 60 families belonging to the Konyak Naga community. Shinnyu would probably have been in darkness for some more time had not John Khangnyu, the headmaster of the government-run village school, lamented the lack of electricity on social media. Mr. Khangnyu is from Tobu, the nearest connected settlement about 58 km from Shinnyu. He is one of the few people in Shinnyu to own a mobile phone because recharging the battery involves travel of several kilometres. The nearest village, Yongkhao, is 25 km away towards Tobu, which is about six hours drive from district headquarters Mon. “We took 16 hours to travel from Mon to Shinnyu with solar panels and accessories. We came to know about the village from Brother John’s social media post on the electricity and connectivity issues in Shinnyu,” Jaideep Bansal of Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) told The Hindu on Friday. GHE is a social impact initiative that has been working on sustainable development for remote communities since 2013. Partnering the local administration, it has set up solar energy projects in more than 100 remote villages in Ladakh and 21 villages in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya. Mr. Khangnyu said it wasn’t easy for him to log on. He had to come home in Tobu from Shinnyu, where he is posted as one of three teachers of the primary school catering to 74 students, to post his views on social media. “Shinnyu was set up in 1977 and recognised by the State government in 2002 but it has virtually remained cut off in the absence of proper road infrastructure. The Power Department tried to electrify the village in 2013-14 but the project was abandoned due to logistical problems,” he said. “We hope the installation of solar lighting will transform the lives of the community. Shinnyu was one of 10 un-electrified villages in our district. We intend to work with GHE for the other nine,” Mon district’s Deputy Commissioner Thavaseelan K. said. GHE executed the Rs. 23 lakh solar project under its corporate social responsibility with the district administration taking care of the logistics. A team of 10, including engineers, set up the project. “Our next mission is a solar engineering workshop to train locals in maintaining the technology we have developed,” Mr. Bansal said. Part of the agreement made with the villagers, Mr. Bansal added, is for them to open a village bank account where every household contributes Rs. 100 periodically for maintenance, repair and replacement of components of the solar installation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sun-shines-at-night-in-remote-nagaland-village/article33884723.ece
20 February 2021||New Delhi,||SC refuses petition against M.P. ordinance||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to entertain a petition challenging the validity of the controversial Madhya Pradesh ordinance regulating religious conversions through inter-faith marriages. A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde asked petitioner Vishal Thakre to approach the Madhya Pradesh High Court. Privacy rights The plea said the law, which followed a similar ordinance made by Uttar Pradesh, infringed a person’s right to privacy and freedom of choice, leading to violations of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution. The apex court had refused to hear some other pleas on the issue. However, the court, on January 6, issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments on the pleas of NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace and others against their laws on religious conversions. On February 17, the court permitted the NGO to implead Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as parties to its petition challenging the controversial laws. It also allowed Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind to become a party to the petition on the ground that a large number of Muslims are being harassed under these laws across the country. Laws under challenge include the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-refuses-plea-filed-against-mp-ordinance/article33884725.ece

She added that the investigation was still on and that Vinay’s confession was being verified. The three girls were found in unconscious state, frothing at their mouths, in their family’s fields where they had gone to collect fodder. The mother of one of the girls who died has alleged that the girls were sexually assaulted. The FIR, however, does not include the allegation and the police said that the post-mortem report found no injury marks on the victims. Speaking after the funeral, the mother said she had found the body of her 16-year-old daughter with her hands and feet tied. “I untied the dupattas myself,” she said, breaking into tears. When a plainclothes woman constable comforted her, she said “You are my [daughter’s name] now.” The brother of the 17-year-old survivor said she had never spoken of Vinay and did not have a phone of her own. “We are not fully satisfied. We still want an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation,” he said. His sister, he said, had stopped attending school since the lockdown and was helping out with the family’s fields and cattle. The day of the incident had been like any other, he said. “There was no fight, no enmity, no suspects in our mind. I just got a call while I was at work in Lucknow that this had happened. It didn’t happen, it was done by someone,” he said, demanding the strictest punishment for the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/two-including-minor-held-for-death-of-girls/article33884680.ece
20 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||33 contacts of man test positive for COVID||At least 33 persons who came in contact with a COVID-19 patient in the past two days have tested positive for the virus in Karimnagar district. According to sources, a man got himself tested on Wednesday at a government facility after he realised that he was having COVID symptoms. The test result was positive and was instructed to immediately quarantine himself. Father’s funeral The sources said that while it was on February 10 that the last rites of the patient’s father were conducted in Kothapally village in Karimnagar district, the COVID–19 situation emerged only after he got himself tested. Karimnagar district administration, including the office of the District Medical Health Officer, began to take stock of the situation. The patient informed officials of the funeral. Soon after, contact tracing began and continues to be in progress. It is suspected that some of them were at the funeral. Confirming the development, an official said, “So far 160 people have been tested. All of these are his contacts. Once the patient was spoken to, mobile teams began the process of contact testing. His immediate contacts were identified and they were tested. We traced the locations of his movement. We have gathered that only his relatives attended the last rites of his father. Of these 160 people, 33 have tested positive.” The source said it is not known whether the patient’s deceased father was suffering from COVID. What is known is that he was a cancer patient. Asymptomatic All the 33 persons who have tested positive are said to be asymptomatic. “No person is serious. There has been no hospitalisation. All are in home isolation. They were given the required medication. There is nothing to be worried about,” the source said. The district administration has embarked on a fever survey which is likely to continue for another couple of days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/33-contacts-of-man-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-karimnagar/article33885367.ece

On February 13, A.P. conducted local body elections in three villages claimed by Odisha. A bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari took note of the submission of senior advocate Vikas Singh that Odisha be given some time to file its reply on the A.P. government's affidavit. In its affidavit, the A.P. government told the top court that there was no breach of undertaking or its direction and it has been duly administrating its own territories and has not infringed upon the area of Odisha. The Naveen Patnaik government has challenged the A.P. notification for polls with regard to the disputed area and said the notificationsaying it amounted to “invading Odisha's territory”. The dispute over jurisdiction over 21 villages popularly called as Kotia Group of villages first reached the top court in 1968 when Odisha on the basis of three notifications -- issued on December 1, 1920, October 8, 1923 and October 15, 1927 -- claimed that Andhra Pradesh had trespassed into its well-defined territory. The top court had on December 2, 1968 directed both the states to maintain status quo till disposal of the suit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odisha-gets-4-weeks-to-reply-to-aps-affidavit/article33884699.ece

The PLA likely suffered a far higher number of injured, with Indian officials saying they counted around 60 Chinese soldiers being carried on stretchers after the clash. Explaining why China made the announcement eight months after the clash, PLA Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, said “the public reporting of heroic deeds” was “conducive to clarifying the truth and setting the record straight so that the world can see clearly the rights and wrongs.” He accused India of “repeatedly playing up and hyping up the incident, distorting the truth, misleading international public opinion and slandering the Chinese border troops.” ‘Distorting the truth’ The Foreign Ministry in Beijing also hit out at India for “distorting the truth”. “This will help people to better know the truth and this is a tribute we pay to our heroes and martyrs,” spokesperson Hua Chunying said. “I read the reports time and again and I was so moved by the stories of these soldiers. The martyr Chen Hongjun was about to be a father in four months and the martyr Xiao Siyuan missed so much the girl he loved and wished to marry but they would not see that day come, regrettably. They have dedicated their life and youth to the land they are defending. The motherland and the people would never forget them." The news of the deaths was among the most discussed topics on Friday on Chinese social media, with many posts expressing anger at the loss of life and calling for the four soldiers to be honoured appropriately. Over recent months, there have been isolated calls on Chinese social media to recognise those lost in Galwan, but no major discussion on the PLA’s casualties, a sensitive topic that China’s state-controlled media has studiously avoided. In August, a leaked photo circulated on the Chinese social media app, WeChat, showed a grave of a PLA soldier named Chen Xiangrong, but it was not confirmed by the authorities. This was among the names announced on Friday. In June, a source close to the PLA told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post that Beijing was “very sensitive” about military casualties, saying all numbers had to be approved by President Xi Jinping, who heads the Central Military Commission, before being released.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/4-pla-soldiers-died-in-galwan-says-china/article33884700.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Disha Ravi sent to 3-day judicial custody||Police said further interrogation would take place after co-accused Shantanu Muluk and Nikita Jacob joined the interrogation.  Mr. Muluk and Ms. Jacob have been asked to appear before the investigating agency on February 22. Ms. Ravi’s bail application is likely to come up for hearing before a sessions court on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court on Friday ordered the Delhi Police to ensure that there is no leakage of any documents relating to its investigation into the FIR against Ms. Ravi. It, however, said the police could conduct press briefings in relation to the case “as per law” so long as none of her rights was violated. The court direction came on Ms. Ravi’s plea seeking to restrain the police from leaking any investigation material relating to her case to the media. Ms. Ravi has claimed that after her arrest, various messages were leaked by the police to the media, resulting in a large number of programmes, news bulletins and online dissemination of various private messages and interventions which were broadcasted. “Some of the bulletins also made allegations that she is associated with various illegal and unlawful groups,” she stated. She pleaded for action against News18, India Today and Times Now for publishing contents or extracts of her private WhatsApp chats, claiming it to be “violative of fair trial rights and right to privacy”. ‘Sensationalism’ Taking note of the facts of the case, Justice Prathiba M. Singh said, “Recent coverage by the media definitely shows that there is sensationalism. While police briefings and the happenings in court proceedings etc. can also be broadcasted and disseminated, leaked investigation material ought not to be disseminated so as to prejudice the investigation”. The court said, “Media houses shall also ensure that the telecast/broadcast by them is from verified/ authenticated sources, though the sources need not be revealed... The channel editors shall ensure that the channels exercise proper editorial control so that the Petitioner’s [Ms. Ravi) investigation is not hampered, in any manner.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disha-ravi-sent-to-3-day-judicial-custody/article33884701.ece

The STF officials took Shareef from a temporary jail in Mathura to Noida for interrogation. The STF sought a 10-day remand but additional district and sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey granted only five-day custody. Shareef, who will be sent back to prison on February 23, was brought from Ernakulum jail, where he was lodged after being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in December last in a money laundering case. According to the STF, Shareef needed to be interrogated on funding received from foreign countries and funding the trip of Siddique Kappan, Delhi-based Kerala journalist, and three other alleged PFI activists to Hathras. Defense counsel Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi said, “I requested that the interrogation process should be video-recorded to ensure no third-degree torture is inflicted upon the accused, but the court rejected it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pfi-leader-shareef-sent-to-5-day-police-custody/article33884712.ece

According to informed sources, the committee, which was meeting to discuss the demand for grants, saw the Opposition members question Petroleum Ministry officials and representatives of oil marketing companies. Petrol is now retailing above Rs. 90 per litre in all major cities, including Delhi, and is on the verge of crossing Rs. 100. The members wanted to know why despite a historical low in the rate of global crude oil prices the fuel prices are spiralling. “But the Chairman did not let us ask the questions, saying that the meeting is solely to discuss the budgetary provisions and a separate meeting will be held for the fuel price hike,” a member said. Mr. Bidhuri blamed the State governments for the hike, instead of the Centre. “He said thw States should waive tax to reduce the burden. And the only solution to rationalise fuel prices is to bring them under the GST regime, which will save the common man from multiple taxes levied by both the Centre and the States,” another member said.

Bank||The Reserve Bank on Friday said it has barred Karnataka-based Deccan Urban Cooperative Bank Ltd. from granting fresh loans or accepting deposits and customers cannot withdraw more than Rs. 1,000 from their savings account for a period of six months. The lender has also been asked not to make fresh investments or incur any liability without its prior permission. The RBI said it issued the directions to chief executive officer of the bank on February 18. It has also asked the lender to desist from disbursing any payment whether in discharge of its liabilities or otherwise, or dispose of any of its assets except as notified in the RBI direction. “Considering the bank’s present liquidity position, a sum not exceeding Rs. 1,000 only of the total balance across all savings bank or current accounts or any other account of a depositor, may be allowed to be withdrawn,” RBI said in a release on Friday. It said customers can set off their loans against deposits subject to conditions. “However, 99.58% of the depositors are fully covered by the DICGC insurance scheme,” said the regulator. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RBI, provides insurance cover on bank deposits. The RBI further said putting the bank under restrictions should not be construed as cancellation of its banking licence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rbi-curbs-on-deccan-urban-coop-bank/article33885246.ece
20 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Starvation cause of four deaths in Shivamogga?||In a development that has shaken Shivamogga city, four persons have been found dead over the last four days, raising suspicion that they could have died of starvation. All the four are yet to be identified. They were found unconscious on the premises of the private bus stand in the city and later died at McGann Hospital. The bodies have been kept at the hospital mortuary. A youth, aged around 27, was found unconscious at the bus stand on February 16. The Doddapete police took him to McGann Hospital and he died the next day. A woman, aged around 40, was found unconscious on February 15. The police shifted her to the hospital late in the night and she died within a couple of hours. A person, believed to be between 50 and 55 years, was found unconscious on the morning of February 15. The hospital staff declared him dead soon after he was shifted to the hospital. In another case, a 60-year-old person was found unconscious at the bus stand on February 2. He was shifted to the hospital, where he died on February 15. So far, nobody has come forward to claim the bodies. The police, on Friday, said in a press note, that they were suspected to have died because of “illness, age-related reasons, starvation, or any other cause”. Health reasons “Hundreds of people from distant places reach the bus stand every day. Nobody knows from where these people came and why they were left abandoned here. The reason for the deaths could be starvation or some health reason. The cause of death would be known only after post-mortem,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/starvation-cause-of-four-deaths-in-shivamogga/article33885009.ece
20 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Contract workers must get maternity leave: HC||Lamenting the State government’s conduct of terminating a woman employed on contract basis merely because she sought maternity leave, the High Court of Karnataka has observed that “it would be power at wrong hands when men who man such offices become insensitive”. The court imposed a cost of Rs. 25,000 on the government while quashing the order of termination and directing the authorities to reinstate her to the post with 50% back wages from the date of termination of contract. The court also directed the government to recover Rs. 25,000 cost from the officer who had passed order of termination. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing the petition by B.N. Rajeshwari, who was working as Project Information Officer/MIS Expert on contract basis with the Directorate of Municipal Administration in Bengaluru since 2009 with regular renewal of contract annually. “The action of the DMA cannot be countenanced, as the Maternity Benefit B Act, 1967, does not classify or qualify a mother to be a government servant, temporary employee, employee on contract basis or an employee on daily wages,” the court held. “... the pendulum of her fate swung from the buoyance of hope to the fatigue of despair as she is terminated on the score that she opted to become a mother and had sought maternity leave,” the court observed while describing the petitioner’s plea as “I chose motherhood; the State chose to terminate me.” Her contract was terminated in August 2019 after she sought maternity leave, based on medical advice for complete bed rest, at the eighth month of her pregnancy in June-July 2019. When she remained absent from work after seeking maternity leave, the government issued notice cautioning her that the contract would be terminated if she failed to report to duty within two days. It was government’s contention that she was eligible only for one day’s leave per month as per the terms of the contract and no other leaves. She gave birth to a child a month before the due date and gave representations in January 2020 to the authorities to take her back to duty but the authorities did not consider her plea. Ms. Rajeshwari’s another representation, submitted in August, 2020, quoting a judgement of the High Court on entitlement of maternity leave for employees on contract also fell on deaf ears of the authorities. Narrating a 21-year-old judgement of the apex court that had ruled that maternity leave is not restricted only to regular employees, the court wondered how the authorities denied her the benefit even after she had enlightened them about law on maternity leave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/contract-workers-must-get-maternity-leave-hc/article33884685.ece

Ravindran said. The flight that took off at 7 a.m. from Sharjah was to land at Kozhikode at 12.40 p.m. The commander of the flight noticed a warning of hydraulic failure and alerted the Kozhikode Air Traffic Control. As the Kozhikode runway is tabletop, it was initially decided to land in Kochi. Thiruvananthapuram was then opted for landing after considering all safety aspects. As Category B emergency was declared, all agencies were alerted by the Airports Authority of India and five crash fire tenders kept a close watch on the aircraft till all passengers alighted. The aircraft was later examined by aircraft maintenance engineers. The passengers were flown to Kozhikode around 5.30 p.m. in another aircraft, sources said.

20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Banks cannot disclaim responsibility on lockers: SC||Banks cannot wash their hands of any liability if any harm is caused to their customers’ lockers or safe deposits in an era when miscreants can manipulate technology to gain access to electronically-operated bank lockers, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment on Friday. Ditching responsibility would not only make banks liable for legal action under the Consumer Protection Act but also damage investor confidence and harm the nation’s reputation as an emerging economy, a 41-page judgment by a Bench, led by Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, noted. Six months time The court gave the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) six months to lay down “comprehensive directions mandating the steps to be taken by banks with respect to locker facility/safe deposit facility management”. “Banks should not have the liberty to impose unilateral and unfair terms on the consumers. In view of the same, we direct the RBI to issue suitable rules or regulations within six months from the date of this judgment,” Justice Shantanagoudar ordered. “The very purpose for which the customer avails of the locker hiring facility is so that they may rest assured that their assets are being properly taken care of,” he said. The judgment came on an appeal filed against the Union Bank of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/banks-cannot-disclaim-responsibility-on-lockers-sc/article33885235.ece

Speaking at an India-Australia Circular Economy Hackathon (I-ACE), he noted that there was need to look at the consumption patterns and how their ecological impact could be reduced. “This is where the concept of a circular economy comes in. It can be a key step in solving many of our challenges,” he pointed out. Consumption-oriented economic models have put a great strain on the planet. “We must never forget that we are not the owners of all that mother earth has to offer but merely its trustees for all the future generations to come. It is not enough to make our production processes more efficient and less polluting. No matter how fast or slow one drives, if the direction is wrong, then one is bound to reach the wrong destination”, he observed. Recycling and reusing things, eliminating waste and improving resource efficiency must become part of everyone’s lifestyle, Mr. Modi asserted. “This hackathon has seen innovative solutions from Indian and Australian students, start-ups and entrepreneurs...I have no doubt that your innovations will inspire our two countries to take the lead in circular economy solutions,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-australia-have-key-role-after-covid-19-era-says-modi/article33884709.ece

20 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Cases booked against PFI activists after Home Minister’s nudge||Home and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday lashed out at the Popular Front of India (PFI) for what he called “anti-national speech” by the organisation’s general secretary Anis Ahmed at a rally in Ullal near Mangaluru on February 17. He said the speech was aimed at “creating divisions” in society and directed the police to initiate action. Following this, the Mangaluru police registered two cases against PFI activists in connection with the foundation day programme held at Ullal on February 17. The first case is against PFI activists for carrying out a “unity march” for which no permission was granted. In the complaint filed by the Mangaluru South police inspector, it is alleged that the activists in 11 buses got down at Mukkacheri and went ahead with the march. The second case is against activists in the rally for allegedly raising slogans to condemn the Supreme Court’s decision of allowing construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. The activists have also been accused of raising slogans that had derogatory references to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The activists have been accused of hindering traffic movement and raising slogans that “instigated hatred among communities”. The police sub-inspector of Ullal police station sought action against Abdul Khader, Shaeed Deralakatte, and other PFI activists. However, there are no cases booked specifically against Mr. Ahmed. Earlier in the day, speaking to mediapersons in Bengaluru, Mr. Bommai termed the PFI leader’s address as “hate speech” and said he had “spoken against the country, against the nation, and against the Constitution”. He said the PFI was trying to create divisions among the people of this country. The Home Minister said that the PFI had once again shown its “true colours” by speaking against the Ram Mandir and the RSS. Meanwhile, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi termed the PFI an “anti-national organisation” and urged people not to heed to its remarks. A couple of days ago, Revenue Minister R. Ashok had advocated banning the PFI. Addressing presspersons in Dharwad on Friday, Mr. Joshi said the ‘Ram Janmabhoomi dispute’ had been resolved by the Supreme Court and the trust for the construction of Ram Mandir had been set up as per the guidelines of the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cases-booked-against-pfi-activists-after-home-ministers-nudge/article33884686.ece

20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anomaly in Madras university Ph.D admission criteria?||Is there an anomaly in the eligibility criteria for admitting OBC (non-creamy later) candidates to Ph.D programmes at the University of Madras? A clarification has been sought from the office of the Governor/Chancellor of the university. A petitioner has written to Raj Bhavan, stating that the eligibility criteria is 55% marks in aggregate or an equivalent grade of ‘B’ on the 7-point scale of the University Grants Commission (UGC). A relaxation of 5% of the marks, from 55% to 50%, or an equivalent relaxation of grade, may be allowed to those belonging to the Scheduled Caste and Tribe and differently abled categories. But the university follows the UGC’s guidelines as per the notification dated May 5, 2016. It states that the eligibility criteria — the relaxation of 5% of marks or an equivalent relaxation of grade — may be allowed to those belonging to the SC/ST/OBC (non-creamy layer) /differently abled and other categories as per the UGC’s decision from time to time. “The ‘OBC (non-creamy layer)’, mentioned in the notification, is missing from the guidelines of the University of Madras. Thereby, candidates of the OBC categories who have less than 55% marks in the Masters, but with more than 50%, will not be eligible for a Ph.D programme at the University of Madras,” V. Nidheesh, of Chennai, said in his petition under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. He appealed to the Governor/Chancellor to initiate steps to correct the “mistake” in the regulations. Since there was no response to his first petition filed under Section 6(1) and appeal under 19(1) of the Act, he moved an appeal before the Tamil Nadu Information Commission. After the Public Information Officer, Raj Bhavan, informed that a letter received from the petitioner was referred to the university, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj directed the university to reply to Mr. Nidheesh within a week. Going by the university’s guidelines, a relaxation of 5% of marks or an equivalent relaxation of grade may be allowed to those belonging to the SC/ST/differently abled categories or to those who have obtained their Master’s degree before September 19, 1991. The UGC’s 2016 notification detailing the eligibility criteria for appointment as faculty members says a minimum of 55% marks (or an equivalent grade on a point-scale) at the Master’s level shall be the essential qualification for direct recruitment of teachers and other cadre of an equivalent rank at any level. A relaxation of 5% shall be allowed at the Bachelor’s as well as Master’s level to the candidates of the SC/ST/OBC (non-creamy layer) and differently abled categories.  Candidates of the OBC categories who have less than 55% marks in the Masters, but with more than 50%, will not be eligible for a Ph.D V.

Speaking at a meeting held at the State BJP headquarters Kamalalayam after representatives of the Devendrakula Velalar communities thanked the government for bringing the seven Dalit sub-sects under a single nomenclature, Ms. Sitharaman said the opposition parties were creating “drama” among the people out of the fear that the BJP would do good for the country. “The BJP has understood Tamil Nadu, grown in Tamil Nadu. Even if we don’t have a single MP [in T.N.], we have stood by the State and are solving the unique problems ... in an efficient manner,” she said. Ms. Sitharaman said certain parties were creating fear among the people that the BJP would indulge in violence. “Our party works in a peaceful manner. They [opposition] are just creating fear among the people,” she said. She questioned parties that accuse the BJP of being a party of baniyas and brahmins and asked how many OBC Chief Ministers they had compared to the BJP. Ms. Sitharaman said Devendrakula Velalar is one community that has been talked about in Sangam literature. “But from the time of the British, they have been pushed further down. Their rights have to be given to them and they will be given,” she said, adding that certain political parties were bothered about the community just for votes.

20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Trial in case against film director Shankar adjourned to next month||The Metropolitan Magistrate Court-II, Egmore, on Friday adjourned a trial proceeding in a case filed against film director Shankar to next month. The case was filed by Tamil writer Aarur Tamilnadan, who alleged that a short story of his had been copied and made into a movie Endhiran , starring superstar Rajinikanth, Aishwarya Rai and others. Plea in SC In October last year, the Supreme Court had dismissed a petition by Mr. Shankar challenging the order of the Madras High Court in connection with a copyright violation case against him for the movie Endhiran . Dismissing his plea, the Supreme court held that the finding that had been made only prima facie by the High Court would not in any manner influence the trial. Taking up the case for commencing the trial, the Metropolitan Magistrate Court had last month issued a notice to Mr. Shankar’s side for appearance. On Friday, when the matter came up for hearing, the complainant, Aarur Tamilnadan, was present. Evidence sought  Mr. Shankar was represented by his lawyer and a memo was filed on his behalf seeking to direct the complainant to adduce evidence. The matter was adjourned to March 19 for adducing evidence by the complainant. According to the complaint, he had penned a story, titled Jiguba , which was published in a Tamil magazine Iniya Udhayam in 1996. The story was later re-published as a novel, titled Dhik Dhik Dheepika, in 2007. ‘Copyright violation’ In 2010, after the release of the blockbuster movieEndhiran,directed by Mr. Shankar, it was found that the story of the movie had been copied from Jiguba , the complainant alleged. The complainant had also stated that the director had copied his story to create the film Endhiran, which was a violation of provisions under the Copyright Act, 1957.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trial-in-case-against-film-director-shankar-adjourned-to-next-month/article33885303.ece

20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Accessibility remains an issue in Metro phase I extension||Years ago, when the Metro phase I project was constructed and opened to the public, disability rights activists raised issues about the lack of accessibility in stations. Despite reiterating their concerns, quite a few issues remain unchanged even in the phase I extension stations, which were opened to the public on Sunday, making it very difficult for differently abled persons to use them. Many differently abled persons took a ride on the Metro as part of the audit on Friday and observed that from tactile strips to slippery floors, there were a host of issues. R. Manimegalai, a 29-year-old with locomotive disability, said one of the primary concerns was the floors look reflective and slippery, especially the blue tiles in various parts of the stations. The newest stations do not have wheelchair accessible ticketing counters. Vaishnavi Jayakumar, from the Disability Rights Alliance, said the tactile strips were not connected to staircases in some places. “They should have a dark colour — since the flooring is lightly coloured — to make it accessible for those with a range of vision issues. The tactile warning in the platforms should be placed along the platform’s length for at least 2 ft,” she said. R. Satish Kumar, a disabled person, said it was a relief that the buttons in the elevators and automatic fare collection gates were accessible in the extension stations, unlike in phase I. “But we cannot use the toilets. The flush and taps are not reachable and the soap dispenser has also been placed too high,” he said. Officials of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd (CMRL) said the staff would help and guide differently abled persons from the staircase or elevator to the nearest coach. Hence, a continuous tactile on the platform was not required. They said the design was based on the National Building Code, 2005, as per the detailed project report. “To avoid slipping, we have provided grooves in the stairs. Persons in wheelchairs are given physical assistance by the CMRL staff. Hence, low-level ticket counters are not required,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accessibility-remains-an-issue-in-metro-phase-i-extension/article33885291.ece
20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘DMDK does not have upper hand in negotiations’||Once a sought after party during elections, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) founded by actor Vijayakant may have to settle for fewer seats than the PMK in the AIADMK-led alliance this Assembly election. Though party treasurer Premalatha Vijayakant has been posturing that the DMDK is prepared to contest alone in all 234 seats, the ground reality is different — sources in the DMDK and AIADMK, who are in the know of seat-sharing discussions, suggest that while the DMDK will remain in the alliance, it may have “to settle for a respectable number of seats” but not expect to be treated on a par with the PMK as its best days are in the past. Even before the Lok Sabha election, the DMDK had insisted that it must be allotted the same number of seats as the PMK, but had settled for four seats as opposed to the latter’s seven. The party’s office-bearers reiterated the same sentiment recently during a consultative meeting. Pointing to how Ministers had made a beeline to PMK founder S. Ramadoss’ residence to discuss his demands, DMDK sources said it was clear that the AIADMK considered PMK a more valuable partner. A few days ago, Ms. Premalatha urged the Dravidian majors to “start negotiations on seat sharing” and added that it would face the election alone if it was not treated with respect by the AIADMK. A senior member of the party, who polled 10% of the total votes in his constituency in the 2016 Assembly election, said the party had lost its sheen and would have to depend on its alliance partner, the AIADMK, to win a seat now. “The party does not have the strength to win seats on its own. We need an alliance. We are not what we were in 2011, 2014 and 2016. The party will have to settle for what is being offered and work towards winning the seats,” he said. He opined that the party could only survive if it won a few seats in the election. “We have to choose winnable constituencies and candidates properly. Otherwise the party’s survival post the election will be difficult,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmdk-does-not-have-upper-hand-in-negotiations/article33885315.ece
20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||LPG cylinder delivery personnel cannot overcharge customers, says HC||The Madras High Court on Friday agreed with a public interest litigant that domestic LPG cylinder delivery personnel cannot fleece customers by demanding a fixed amount of money towards tips. However, the court impressed upon the necessity for customers to reflect on the way in which delivery personnel were treated, with utter disregard for dignity of labour. Closing the PIL petition after recording the submission of oil marketing companies that a complaint redressal mechanism was already in place, Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote: “While it is appreciated that customers may not be charged any additional money by the gas delivery personnel, it is also time for customers to reflect as to how such personnel are treated... Oftentimes, the cylinders have to be carried up the stairs or taken a substantial distance from the entrance to the residence. In peak summertime, it is back-breaking work, and the delivery personnel are scarcely stopped to be offered a glass of water or allowed to sit. The problem is in the Indian psyche and the complete lack of dignity for manual labour.” Since oil marketing companies had clarified that it was the duty of delivery personnel to hand over the gas cylinders at appropriate locations and no extra charge had to be paid by a customer on such account, the judges said it was up to those companies to ensure that the personnel do not demand extra payment or threaten customers of not completing the delivery if such payment was not made. “There will be the odd case where there will be an errant delivery personnel just as there will be customers who are difficult to handle. The court cannot issue a blanket order or set down any guidelines for, in effect, prohibiting a payment in the nature of a bribe or illegal gratification to be made or obtained,” the Bench observed before closing the PIL petition. An association of the LPG cylinder delivery personnel, too, made an appearance before the court and complained that they had no option but to seek tips from customers because LPG dealers do not pay them proper wages. The association insisted upon issuing a direction to oil companies to fix the wages to be paid to the deliverymen and ensure prompt payment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lpg-cylinder-delivery-personnel-cannot-overcharge-customers-says-hc/article33885317.ece

Lt. Gen. Manoj Pande, Commander- in-Chief, Andaman and Nicobar Command, laid the foundation stone for the project. Goa Shipyard Ltd. (GSL) will build ship simulators for damage control. It has already built six simulators of various types for the defence forces and recently exported one simulator to a neighbouring country, a press release from GSL said. The Damage Control Simulator is a training system that simulates a realistic and stressful but controlled environment for crew training in damage control and repair for ships in various scenarios, the Goa shipyard said. In real-life operational service, there is a possibility of ship damage in times of both war and peace. To contain the damage and save the vessel, the crew should be able to respond to threats with efficiency, expertise and confidence gained from training in similar situations, the company said. The simulator will help Navy trainees think on their feet and improve team-building skills and prepare them for unforeseen hardships that may emerge at sea, said GSL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/goa-shipyard-to-build-damage-control-simulator-for-navy-in-port-blair/article33885309.ece

20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State government allows operation of buses with AC facilities||The Tamil Nadu government has permitted all State Transport Udertakings and private operators to operate buses with air-conditioning facilities. The decision also applies to buses operated or engaged by industries to transport their employees, or for school and college students on a need-basis by complying with the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued in this regard. “The temperature setting of all air conditioning devices should be in the range of 24-30 degrees Celsius, relative humidity should be in the range of 40-70%, intake of fresh air should be as much as possible and cross ventilation should be adequate. The air circulation system should allow fresh/treated air with a fresh air level of more than 50%. The air conditioner temperature should be more than 25 degrees Celsius and maximum air circulation should be ensured. People with co-morbidities and senior citizens above 65 years of age should be barred from boarding to travel,” said a G.O., issued by Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan. As per the SOP issued, passengers must mandatorily cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth and should board only from the rear door and alight from the front door. “If all seats are filled in the buses, passengers shall not board the bus and shall wait for the next bus,” the guidelines state. Passengers with fever, cough and other ailments will not be permitted to travel on the buses. Local bodies are to ensure that all bus stops and terminals are cleaned and well- maintained. All state transport undertakings will promote the issuance of monthly passes to passengers using city/town bus services to avoid cash transactions. “Wherever possible, QR code panels may be deployed, including inside buses and on ticket and pass-issuing counters,” it said. Seats that are to be occupied by passengers and seats to be left vacant shall be marked to ensure physical distancing inside buses. Body temperature of the crew will be checked daily before the commencement of duty.

However, help came in the form of young members from her community, trained by the Voluntary Health Services (VHS), who counselled her and helped her recover. “I run the Roopakala Tiffin Centre in Washermenpet. But during the pandemic, I did not have any income. The volunteers from VHS gave me courage and hope. Today, I am earning Rs. 300 per day and I am sure I will be earning more in the future,” she said. Over 400 people More than 400 transpersons in six districts — Chennai, Vellore, Salem, Madurai, Pudukottai and Tiruvallur — were helped under the VHS - Gilead TRANS Life project. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly transpersons were affected and suffered from stress, anxiety and depression due to various issues, such as loss of income and diminished social support. We imparted mental health-related counselling to a select group of transpersons who, in turn, provided psychosocial support to the affected communities,” said Joseph D. Williams, director, Projects, VHS. A. Vijayaraman, programme director, VHS, said they trained 25 young members of the trans community. “The trained volunteers visited elderly transpersons and provided them with necessary care and help. This helped them tide over their struggle. This initiative has been going on for the past five months,” he added. Besides, they were provided with assistance to avail themselves of social welfare schemes. “We also provided all of them with dry ration kits, which had 30 products,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vhs-helps-elderly-transpersons-during-pandemic/article33885304.ece
20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hospitals see a spike in mature cataract cases||The number of eye-related disorders has increased manifold owing to COVID-19 and the consequent inability and hesitation of the patients to visit hospitals, doctors at Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital said. Amar Agarwal, chairman of the group, told presspersons here on Friday that there had been a five-fold increase in the number of cases of mature cataracts and dry eyes reported in their hospitals after the pandemic. “In the last quarter of 2019, less than 10% of all cataract patients we saw were suffering from advanced cataracts. This jumped to 50% in the last quarter of 2020 as many people did not get their eyes checked in the early stages of cataract due to the pandemic,” he said. He said the hospital witnessed worsening of existing cases of glaucoma as patients failed to come up for regular follow-ups. Ashvin Agarwal, executive director of the group, said there had been many cases of increased morbidity due to lack of timely treatment. “For instance, an elderly person suffered high eye pressure and partial loss of vision after he delayed his cataract surgery,” he said. Online activities S. Soundari, head of medical services, Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital, said the hospital had been seeing an increase in the number of people with computer vision syndrome and dry eyes due to excessive use of gadgets during the pandemic for online meetings, classes and entertainment. “It is important to take a break from looking at the screen every 20 minutes,” she said. Highlighting that hospitals were taking adequate precautions for COVID-19, Dr. Amar Agarwal urged the people to not delay hospital visits if they faced any issues in their eyes and for regular check-ups. “Most of our staff have undergone the first round of vaccination. People should not hesitate to visit hospitals as it may significantly worsen their problems,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospitals-see-a-spike-in-mature-cataract-cases/article33885296.ece

20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK submits second complaint to Governor against CM, 4 Ministers||The DMK on Friday submitted a second complaint to the Governor alleging acts of corruption by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, four of his Cabinet colleagues and an MLA. DMK general secretary Duraimurugan, treasurer and MP T.R. Baalu and senior leader T.K.S. Elangovan met Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Friday evening at the Raj Bhavan and submitted the complaint on behalf of DMK president M.K. Stalin, seeking action. In the representation, Mr. Stalin accused Mr. Palaniswami, Ministers P. Thangamani (Electricity), S.P. Velumani (Municipal Administration), K.C. Karuppannan (Environment) and K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji (Dairy Development) and MLA K.R. Rajakrishnan of corruption, misconduct and abuse of public office. Mr. Stalin said Mr. Palaniswami had amassed property and assets through benamis, and that the benamis named in the letter were targeting agricultural land, purchasing and registering them at much lower value than the actual market rate and using them for commercial purposes without proper sanction. He accused the Chief Minister of corruption in the purchase of CCTVs and walkie-talkies for the police. Detailing various transactions, Mr. Stalin said the material was sufficient to initiate inquiry under provisions of the Constitution, and various statutes, including the IPC, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Transparency in Tender Rules and so on. Mr. Stalin said they were submitting the second representation because of the continued obstruction of legal proceedings by the Council of Ministers, alleging that the Ministers were influencing the police, the DVAC and the State Vigilance Commission. The DMK chief accused the Council of Ministers, led by the Chief Minister, of exerting undue influence on public servants to stop them from taking action against organised plunder of the public exchequer. Following the meeting with the Governor, Mr. Duraimurugan said the party would not be submitting a third representation as there would be a regime change after the election. “For the last four years, we have been raising these issues. We have gone to court. We have gone to the Vigilance Commission and we have also come to the Governor,” he added. Mr. Duraimurugan said the Governor told the delegation that he had sent their earlier complaint to the Home Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-submits-second-complaint-to-governor-against-cm-four-ministers/article33884830.ece
20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders regularisation of cooperative society workers||In 2001, the State government decided to regularise the services of around 35,000 people who were employed since 1980 as salesmen and packers in various cooperative societies, marketing societies and cooperative wholesale stores. However, it could regularise the services of only about 26,000 employees and the rest were left behind because of a legal interruption. The Madras High Court on Friday came to their rescue and ordered regularisation of the services of all left-out employees. Disposing of a batch of cases filed by employees who were excluded, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh ordered that the benefit of regularisation must be extended not only to the petitioners but also to similarly placed persons who had not knocked on the doors of the court. He said the services of all those who were employed, without being sponsored by the employment exchange, before March 12, 2001, must be regularised within eight weeks so that they could get promotions and retirement benefits. Tracing the case history, the judge recalled that immediately after a government order was issued on March 12, 2001, for regularising the services of 35,000 employees, it was put to challenge before the High Court. A Division Bench upheld the validity of the order in 2002 and permitted the regularisation of those who were employed between July 8, 1980, and March 12, 2001, in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act of 1981. When the matter was taken on appeal to the Supreme Court, the latter in 2004 dismissed the appeal but reversed certain findings of the Division Bench with respect to the power of the State government to regularise backdoor appointments. Thereafter, during a second round of litigation, a Full Bench (comprising three judges) of the High Court, in 2007, held that the government could not regularise the services of employees who had not been appointed without following the procedure. Pointing out that it was not a case of unqualified candidates being appointed, the judge said the appointments made without employment exchange sponsorship could be termed as an irregularity and not an illegality. Therefore, such services could be regularised, Justice Venkatesh held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-regularisation-of-cooperative-society-workers/article33885329.ece
20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Give priority to cancer patients for vaccination’||A panel of doctors, mainly oncologists from across India, have said that cancer patients must be included in the priority list for COVID-19 vaccine. Speaking at a virtual webinar organised by Apollo Cancer Centres, the panel of doctors, which included Deborah Enting from Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in the U.K., said that taking a vaccine was effective for cancer patients, except for a couple of scenarios where they were undergoing specific type of treatments, particularly in case of haematological malignancies. Guidelines outlined Abdul Ghafur, consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, highlighted the recommendations made by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in the U.S. with respect to administering vaccines to cancer patients. While stressing that his hospital was still pooling data for a detailed analysis, Arvind Krishnamurthy from the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, said preliminary indications showed that cancer patients were more vulnerable to COVID-19, and mortality among them due to the disease was higher than that seen in other patients. Though most of the doctors on the panel agreed on mortality being higher for cancer patients, some said there was a lack of adequate data, and the mortality did not appear to be significantly higher. A majority of the doctors recommended the Covishield vaccine for cancer patients by pointing out that Covaxin was still being used under clinical trial mode. Purvish Parikh from Shalby Cancer Research Institutes moderated the discussion.

20 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Trough may bring rain||A deep westerly trough extending up to south Tamil Nadu is expected to trigger a wet spell over a few parts of the State till February 22. Some parts of Chennai reported light rain on Friday under the influence of the weather system, according to the India Meteorological Department. A trace of rainfall was reported by the weather stations in Meenambakkam, Ennore, Villivakkam and Coonoor on Friday. Officials said the westerly trough at upper level and its interaction with a trough in the easterlies at the lower level may bring light to moderate rain over few places in the State and Puducherry. N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, said Chennai, too, has prospects of light rain in some areas till the weekend and the minimum temperature may increase to around 24 degrees Celsius due to the cloudy weather. The minimum temperature across the State is likely to climb up due to the presence of the weather system. However, dry weather is expected to return from February 23. “If such weather systems had formed during pre-monsoon season, it may have brought good rainspell due to better moisture convergence and increase in temperature level. While forming of trough occurred during the dry month of February too, its extension till south Tamil Nadu does not happen often. The present weather system may bring sporadic rains in the State,” he said. For Chennai too, it is one of the driest months of the year and the city records only an average of 3.4 mm during February. Senior meteorologist Y.E.A. Raj said formation of trough was normal during February. However, not all the weather systems would translate into rainfall. “We have had instances of coastal areas, particularly Cuddalore, Vedaranyam and Nagapattinam, having received good amount of rain in February. But it may not be possible every year. Several other weather parameters like moisture at lower troposphere, wind and higher temperature levels are needed for troughs to bring more rain during this time of the year,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deep-westerly-trough-likely-to-cause-rain-in-state/article33885306.ece

20 February 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Must show that Kongu region is no longer an AIADMK fort’||The upcoming Assembly election is the time to bury the ruling party in the Kongu region, perceived as an AIADMK fort, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Friday in Coimbatore at ‘ Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin ’ (Stalin in your constituency), the party’s poll outreach event. “There is a perception that this [Kongu region] is an AIADMK stronghold. It is time to prove this wrong. The DMK, which has already dented the perception in the 2019 parliamentary election, will win all the 10 Assembly seats here,” he said. It was important to win all the 10 seats because the party wanted to dedicate the victory to late leader M. Karunanidhi, whose last wish was not to return to power but to promote the State’s welfare, Mr. Stalin said. When the DMK returns to power, it will initiate action against Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani, whose rise in the last few years has been dramatic, he said. According to the Opposition leader, from a small-time contractor a few years ago, Mr. Velumani’s business empire had grown by 3,000% after he became a Minister, as his brother’s and friend’s companies won all contracts. His corruption was similar to that of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s TANSI land deal case, said Mr. Stalin, adding, “Mr. Velumani has come to think that he owns Coimbatore.” When people question his corruption or write about it, the Minister, misusing his authority, threatens them or jails journalists. All this will change after the DMK returns to power, Mr. Stalin said. He also criticised Mr. Velumani for comparing Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, saying there could not have been a greater disservice to the Congress leader than this. Later, in Karamadai near Mettupalayam, Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government had made a mark in corruption, for which Mr. Palaniswami could claim credit and not the achievements he publicised. “If there is one thing in which he [Mr. Palaniswami] has achieved the number one position, it is in corruption and nothing else,” he said. He said Mr. Palaniswami did not have the administrative capacity of former Chief Ministers M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa. He said both Mr. Velumani and the Chief Minister had joined hands to build bridges and flyovers in places where there was no necessity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/must-show-that-kongu-region-is-no-longer-an-aiadmk-fort/article33884813.ece
20 February 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Infant deaths: Health Dept. to hold back batch of vaccines||Following the deaths of two infants within 24 hours of receiving paediatric vaccines in Coimbatore, the Health Department has ordered all primary health centres (PHC) and anganwadis not to use the batch of vaccines administered on Wednesday. Sources in the Department told The Hindu on Friday that the regular immunisation programmes would continue on Wednesdays in the district using other available batches of the vaccines. Precautionary measures While the link between the vaccination and the two deaths has not been established yet, the Health Department has taken precautionary measures, sources said. On Wednesday, two baby boys aged around two-and-a-half months were administered paediatric vaccines - Pentavalent, rotavirus vaccine (RVV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) - at an anganwadi in Masakalipalayam near Singanallur and at an urban PHC in Sowripalayam. While the first baby was reported to have died by Wednesday afternoon, the second baby was pronounced dead on Thursday morning. The first infant died due to pneumonia as per the autopsy report and the cause of death of the second infant is yet to be ascertained, the sources said. The possibility of death due to anaphylaxis (allergic reaction) elicited by vaccination was ruled out as any adverse reaction would be evident within 30 minutes of vaccination, which was not the case in either of the deceased infants, the sources noted. The 27 babies (13 in Masakalipalayam anganwadi and 14 in Sowripalayam PHC), who were administered the same batch of vaccines as that of the deceased babies, were normal as of Friday, the sources said. These babies will be monitored till next Thursday by the Health Department. Meanwhile, a nine-member ‘adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) committee’ including Deputy Director of Health Services (Coimbatore) G. Ramesh Kumar and Dean of Coimbatore Medical College Hospital P. Kalidas convened a meeting on Thursday regarding the two infant deaths and had sent a report to the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. Samples The samples of the vaccine batch that were administered to the deceased will be sent to Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh for testing, according to the sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/infant-deaths-health-dept-to-hold-back-batch-of-vaccines/article33884848.ece

20 February 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Traffic signals become operational at GH roundabout in Erode||Traffic signals at the GH roundabout here have been made operational on Friday on a trial basis to ensure smooth flow of vehicles. Five roads, Perundurai Road, Nasiyanur Road, Mettur Road, E.V.N. Road and Meenatchi Sundaranar Road (earlier Brough Road) meet at the junction which is the busiest traffic point in the city. A flyover connecting Perundurai Road, Meenatchi Sundaranar Road and E.V.N. Road was constructed to ease traffic congestion at the junction. Later, a temporary roundabout was created to ensure that vehicles move freely. However, chaos continues to prevail at the junction due to increase in vehicle movement on all the five roads. Hence, the district police have resumed the operations of traffic signals from Friday. Earlier, during peak hours, traffic police personnel regulated the traffic manually while during non-peak hours, automatic traffic signals were operational. But, motorists complained that the waiting time was high and wanted the timings reduced. They said the signals only delayed vehicle movement causing congestion. However, senior officials said traffic regulation was implemented on a trial basis and the problems in implementation, including reducing the waiting time, would be studied and rectified. “We want to ensure smooth flow of vehicles and prevent accidents at the junction,” they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-signals-become-operational-at-gh-roundabout-in-erode/article33884859.ece

The meeting that was conducted after 10 months was chaired by Collector C. Kathiravan. Members of Kalingarayan Pasana Sabai said that recently over 30 units were sealed for discharging effluents into the canal and other water bodies. They wanted action against the violators and also wanted processing units to function five km away from the water bodies. They sought an automatic pollution detector installed in the canal. The farmers said their crops were damaged by rats and if tablets were placed to kill rats, peacocks consumed it leading to their death for which cases were registered against farmers. Hence, they sought a solution to protect their crops from rat invasions. They wanted a separate board established for turmeric and tapioca and also integrate all the four turmeric markets so that auctioning took place under one roof. Members of Keel Bhavani Pasana Sabai wanted the concrete lining project dropped as it would affect the recharging of groundwater. Mr. Kathiravan said monthly meetings would not be held once Assembly election date was announced. In that case, farmers could submit their petitions in the box kept at the Collectorate.

20 February 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||BJP’s poaching tactics inappropriate, says Karti||Though the Bharatiya Janata Party projects itself as popular and powerful, the way it poaches MLAs and leaders from other parties contradicts that image, said Congress MP Karti Chidambaram here on Friday. Speaking to reporters, when asked about developments in Puducherry, he said either the Centre or the outgoing Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi alone would know the reason for her sudden departure. But there should be some ‘deep’ reason in giving additional charge to Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. “Normally, the Tamil Nadu Governor is given such a role whenever the Puducherry Governor either retires or when the term ends,” he said. The Congress functionaries may leave the party, but should not be joining the BJP as the views and ideologies were diametrically opposite. “It only showed that the functionaries (MLAs) going to BJP were opportunists,” he said and added that the Congress would not be cowed down by such tactics or pressures. The BJP may indulge in teasing the Congress in Puducherry, but elections would ultimately show that the people are with the Congress-DMK front. The BJP, he said, believed in capturing governments through the backdoor. This tactic would not last long, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjps-poaching-tactics-inappropriate-says-karti/article33884839.ece
20 February 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Neolithic grooves discovered in Denkanikottai||A new site of neolithic pits called grooves has been discovered by the members of the Krishnagiri District Historical Research Centre at Kundhukottai in Denkanikottai here recently. According to a release by the Centre, the site of discovery was 4 km east of Kundhukottai at Yaanaipallam falls. Sixteen such pits had been discovered in this region. These pits or grooves were 15 to 20 cm long, 5 to 8 cm wide and 2 to 3 cm deep. These grooves were formed as a result of sharpening of stone tools by neolithic people. The pits were discovered by Centre members Suresh and Anbarasu, during their site examination at Kundhukottai. The site was reviewed and verified by Krishnagiri-based archaeologist Sugavana Murugan. The foundation of the Kundhukottai hill had been found to contain the remains of the habitats of neolithic people. Pottery dating back to neolithic period and iron age were also found. Similarly, the top of this hill had been the site of discovery of many prehistoric stone age artefacts. The release said, previously such neolithic pits were discovered in Keelanur of Javadhu hills by Ramesh, assistant archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai. There were 21 pits along with 75 neolithic stone tools that were discovered during the time. Following this, in a similar discovery, around 36 such neolithic pits were discovered in Pathiri village of Javvadhu hills by archaeologist Umapathy. Similar pits discovered in Senji by Vilupuram-based archaeologists Veraragavan and Parandhagan Tamilselvan were notable, the release added. In the past, neolithic stone tools were found near Kundhukottai in places near the falls, where these tools were worshipped by locals in the nearby Jalaveerabthirar temple and other local temples. Kundukottai discoveries had testified the prehistoric stone age, neolithic age and iron age habitations, the Historical Research Centre said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/neolithic-grooves-found-in-denkanikottai/article33884864.ece
20 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC comes down hard on poaching, greed of man||“Man is the most insane species. He worships an invisible God and destroys a visible nature, unaware that this nature he’s destroying is this God he’s worshipping,” the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court quoted Canadian Astrophysicist Hubert Reeves in its elaborate order transferring a batch of elephant poaching incidents that took place prior to 2015 to the CBI. Quoting a couplet from Thirukkural, a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and N. Sathish Kumar observed that Thiruvalluvar emphasised the primary function and duty of a human being stating that man, who shares his belongings with fellow living beings and takes care of them, is more virtuous, endowed with wisdom than what the greatest literatures would teach. The court which was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation petition initiated in 2018 had directed the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau to file a report after making an elaborate study. The report submitted before the court lists the accused who had committed the offence at the bottom and the kingpins at the top. One of the statements of an accused - ‘Eagle’ Rajan - has been extracted in the order and names influential people such as S.K. Bangur, Kamal Murah Babu Bichu, A.C. Muthiah, Pooja Dalmia, Sanjiv Goenka and Preethi Goenka, Ashok Poddar, Susheela Nagotia, Anitha Hemanth Singha, A.C. Burman and Sonal Modi. “From the above, it appears that the crime which happened on ground in the forest over a decade prior to 2015, got extended beyond the boundaries of not only the State but also the country. It further indicates the network involved. Therefore, we are not dealing with a mere case of poaching, but also a demand created by customers, whose numbers will double up only after investigation, other than the names we have already recorded”, the judges said. “The investigation also reveals the details of transactions, including transfer of money through bank accounts. The greed of the man could well be seen from the transactions that happened. It is not a mere case of poaching for livelihood, but a trading on wildlife, driven by the sadistic pleasure of man. We do not wish to say anything more. The report speaks for itself,” the judges observed. “The persons mentioned in the report are numerous, hailing from different places and their roles are also different. The arrests made are with respect to a few cases and that too at the bottom level. Suffice it to state that middlemen and kingpins are left untouched. We do not know whether it is an oversight or design. Even after the report having been addressed, the respondents turned a furtive look feigning ignorance. “These cases involve investigation crossing the borders as indicated earlier. Thus, we are not in a position to agree with the submissions made by the learned Additional Advocate General that further investigation would be made with the cooperation of the nearby State. Under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, not only poaching but also mere possession is an offence. ”While parting with this issue, we make it clear that our observations are only prima facie in nature. Therefore, they have to be taken in their own context, which is inclusive of the ones made against the State governments and its officials. In this connection, we may note that the report clearly suggests that the poaching has been going on for over a decade prior to 2015 and obviously, there are few reported now. The CBI is also at liberty to have its investigation without being influenced by our observations,” the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-comes-down-hard-on-poaching-greed-of-man/article33884845.ece
20 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Armed patrol teams get body-worn cameras||Three months after launching two-wheeler patrol with armed police personnel in an attempt to prevent daylight murders in the city, Madurai City Police have strengthened the patrol teams with body-worn cameras. “We have provided body-worn cameras to all the 14 patrol teams,” said Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha. Stating that gruesome murders and attempt to murders in full public glare had become a disturbing trend in the city, Mr. Sinha said special teams with pistols were formed to patrol areas prone to gangsters targeting their rivals. “The policemen have been provided arms to protect themselves from attack by armed men,” he added. A senior police officer said that after the introduction of armed patrol team comprising police constables with commando training, gruesome offences on the road have not been reported. “It has sent a stern warning to the anti-social elements,” the officer added. The body-worn cameras, with audio and video recording facility, will be able to capture images of the gangsters and also videograph any violent incident which could prove to be an evidence for the crime, the Commissioner said. The cameras would be worn by the bike-riders while the pillion rider would have pistols. The teams, working in two shifts, during daytime, have not been involved in any other routine police duty other that patrolling their areas. Meanwhile, the City police have stepped up action against history-sheeters ahead of Assembly election. Out of the 1,825 rowdy elements, action have been taken against 1,738 persons, like remanding them under specific cases, binding them over with promise for good conduct, detaining them under Goondas Act. “We are in the process of updating the data on history-sheeters. While those who are not living in the city or not involved in any crime for the past five years would be removed from the data of history-sheeters, new persons who are involved in grave offences will be added,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/armed-patrol-teams-get-body-worn-cameras/article33885414.ece
20 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Quarrying must be done in a scientific manner: HC||Natural resources such as minerals are gift from mother nature and minerals are required for sustainable development. Therefore quarrying must be done in a systematic and scientific manner, bearing in mind the conservation, environment and ecology, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed. Disposing of a batch of public interest litigation petitions that complained of illegal and rampant sand quarrying in southern districts under the guise of quarrying ‘savudu’ sand, a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and B. Pugalendhi issued a series of directions to the State to follow so as to curb illegal quarrying. The court observed that it appeared that ‘savudu’ quarries were permitted without any lease agreement, without any mining plan and without any environmental clearance. Further, the court said the Department concerned did not take any steps to identify the mineral for examination with a laboratory to ascertain the contents / components of the mineral. High-level committee The court directed the State to constitute a high-level committee comprising geologists and other experts and eminent officers from the Public Works Department and Water Resources Department to conduct a detailed study / survey on possibility or availability of river sand on adjacent patta lands to rivers. These places have to be notified and declared protected zones and there cannot be any quarrying operations other than by the government in the notified areas. There shall not be any grant of quarry lease without ascertaining the composition / component of the minerals and without obtaining a report from an authorised lab, the judges said. ‘Set up lab’ The court directed the Department of Geology and Mining to establish a lab on its own or to authorise any lab in this regard. Further, the judges said that there shall not be any quarry operation in the name of colloquial terms / local terms and any lease shall be in accordance with minerals notified under Section 3 of the MMDR Act.

20 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Grandmother held for infanticide||Two days after the police registered a case of suspicious death of an infant — the third girl child of a couple — post-mortem conducted on Friday confirmed that the infant had been murdered. The child’s grandmother has been arrested in connection with the crime. The police said that C. Sivapriya, 28, of K. Paraipatti brought the infant to the government hospital in Usilampatti around 9.20 p.m. When the doctor declared that the 7-day-old infant had been brought dead, the woman head constable on night duty, Dhanalakshmi, lodged a complaint at the Uthapanaickanoor police station, registering a case of suspicious death as a nail mark was found on the infant’s face. Additional Superintendent of Police (Crime against Women and Children) S. Vanitha, along with district child welfare committee member B. Pandiaraja, conducted an inquiry in the village on Thursday. The infant was the third girl child of Ms. Sivapriya and Chinnasamy. The eldest daughter, who is seven, is affected by polio and the second is aged two. The woman had given birth to the third child in Palani. The woman said that after the girl was fed milk on Wednesday afternoon, she became motionless. After alerting her husband, she took the child to the hospital at night, she said. However, since Ms. Vanitha found contradictions in the statements of the couple, the body was sent for post-mortem to Government Rajaji Hospital. “It seems the infant was smothered to death. During interrogation, Chinnasamy’s mother confessed to the crime. The parents are being interrogated to ascertain if they had any role in it,” Ms. Vanitha said. Mr. Pandiaraja said after two incidents of female infanticide in the district in 2020, the district administration had taken up a campaign against the practice, giving the parents an option to surrender children under the cradle baby scheme. “If parents cannot raise the children, they have been asked to surrender them to the Child Welfare Committee,” Mr. Pandiaraja said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grandmother-held-for-infanticide/article33884822.ece

20 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court Bench seeks explanation from official||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed Secretary of Finance (Salaries) S. Krishnan to render an explanation as to why he should not be punished for his wilful disobedience of a court order. The court directed him to give an explanation within 15 days in a contempt petition. The court was hearing a petition filed by S. Dhanalakshmi of Madurai. In 2019, the court took note of the recommendations made by the District-level Empowered Committee, headed by the Collector, and directed the Finance Secretary to disburse an eligible amount to the petitioner as per the Tamil Nadu Medical Attendance Rules. This order was not complied with. Justice M.S. Ramesh observed that the contempt petition was adjourned on seven occasions and a statutory notice was issued by the court to the Secretary for personal appearance. However, the Secretary had not appeared before the court, either physically or virtually, nor an application was filed to dispense with the appearance. “This court was constrained to adjourn the contempt petition on the eight-occasion owing to the inaction on the part of the Secretary. All these callous and careless attitude in dealing with the order of the High Court shows utter disregard the Secretary has to the sanctity of law,” the judge said.

The explosion occurred on February 12 when some chemicals were being mixed to produce fireworks at the unit at Acchankulam. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel issued notices to the Tamil Nadu government, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), Virudhunagar District Magistrate and Sree Mariyammal Fireworks factory. The green panel said that to secure credible facts, it is constituting an eight-member committee including former High Court judge Justice K Kannan, representatives of Union Environment Ministry, CPCB, State Disaster Management Authority, Head of the Chemical Engineering Department of IIT Chennai, Chief Control of Explosives in Nagpur, Nominee of Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation and Chief Inspector of Factories, Tamil Nadu. ‘The District magistrate, Virudhunagar, and Regional Office, State PCB may provide logistic support to the committee to enable their fact-finding and reporting. State PCB will bear the initial cost of functioning of the committee, including the honorarium to non-official members to be determined in consultation with them. The committee will be at liberty to take assistance of such experts, individuals and institutions as may be considered necessary. The State PCB and the CPCB will jointly act as nodal agency for coordination and compliance,’ the Bench said. The committee (or such members as the Chairman may decide depending on availability) may visit the site preferably within one week and give its report within one month by e-mail, the NGT said. The tribunal said that except for visit to the site at least once, the committee will be free to conduct its proceedings online. It will be free to take the assistance from any other expert/organization. ‘The committee may suitably interact with the stakeholders and, apart from considering the present incident, also consider remedial measures for preventing such incident in the area or by other establishments even beyond the said area,’ it said while posting the matter for hearing on April 30.

20 February 2021||P.A. NarayaniMadurai,TAMIL NADU||Transgender clinic at GRH is unknown, underutilised||The transgender multi-speciality clinic at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), which was inaugurated around a year back, has been serving only a few. If more people know about the clinic, the facilities could be better utilised, said members of the transgender community. A team of doctors from endocrinology, plastic surgery, gynaecology, psychiatry, dermatology, venereology and urology departments attend to patients at the clinic. A senior doctor from the clinic says reconstructive breast surgery, sex reassignment surgeries, facial hair removal and counselling services are offered at the clinic. “Some transgenders were handed over identification certificates after undergoing examinations at the clinic. No sex reassignment surgery has been performed at the clinic yet as each patient has to go through psychological and other medical evaluation for at least a year before the surgery. So, currently a few patients are under consultation to undertake surgery,” he said. The clinic, which was inaugurated a few weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic, was used to treat other patients during the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. The clinic resumed functioning around three months back, says a source from the GRH. “Currently, other patients, along with transgenders, are being treated at the clinic. The construction of the operation theatre complex on the main building premises and the treatment of COVID-19 patients at the super speciality block has led to space constraints. As a result, other department outpatients are also consulted at the transgender clinic,” the source said. Although the clinic has been functioning all these months, there is almost no awareness among the transgender community about it, said Solu, a transgender physiotherapist working at the School Education department. “A lot of transgenders, including me, are under the impression that the clinic is not yet inaugurated. Many transgenders, including those from other districts, made several enquiries about the status of the clinic,” she said. Jeyachithra, a transgender who runs a catering unit, said the transgender clinic would be highly beneficial for the community as cost of treatment at private clinics is high. “Many transgenders resort to begging and sex work to save money to undertake surgery at private hospitals, which can be avoided now,” she said. An exclusive clinic for the transgender community will also ensure that the transgender people feel safe and comfortable while undergoing treatment, she added.

Narayanasamy has said he had written to Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan seeking clarification on how the three nominated MLAs in the Assembly were listed as BJP legislators. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Narayanasamy said under Assembly rules, the three nominated MLAs could not be treated as BJP legislators. Though a nominated legislator could join a party of choice after six months, this procedure in the case of the three MLAs had not been decided upon yet by the Speaker. The Chief Minister said it was an error on the part of the Lt. Governor in describing the nominated legislators as BJP MLAs in her letter directing the convening of the Assembly for a floor vote on Monday. “I have written to the Lt. Governor on this,” he also said. The Congress-DMK legislators would meet again on Sunday to chalk out a strategy to face the floor vote in the Assembly. A meeting was earlier held on Thursday night.

Sheethal Nayak, founder of Sahodaran, an NGO working with LGBTIQ communities, has been appointed Puducherry chairperson of the National Child and Woman Development Council (NCWDC), a not-for-profit organisation registered under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882. The NCWDC appointment is for a period of one year and her role involves raising awareness about rights among youth, students, workers and women. “When I was offered the post before, I was reluctant to take it up as organisational work is quite heavy,” said Ms. Sheethal, who has undergone sex reassignment surgery. Since forming Sahodaran in 1998 — it was later registered as an NGO in 2003 — she has been in the forefront of advocating for the rights of the LGBTIQ population, with a particular focus on the transgendered individuals. ‘Respect for community’ Sahodaran has been organising safe spaces and providing peer group support for the members of the community through counselling, seminars and political activism. “But, after consulting wellwishers, they urged me to take up the responsibility. Apart from the recognition that comes with it, I hope the post will also bring more respect to the community,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgender-to-head-woman-and-child-development-council/article33885498.ece

In the clip, when a fisherwoman complained that he had not turned up in the area when Cyclone Nivar passed through the region, Mr. Narayanasamy translates it as “she is saying that I visited the area and distributed relief material”. Not a lie “As the woman was speaking from afar I could not hear her properly. So, as someone who had been at the spot, I could tell Rahul Gandhi with conviction that I had visited the place in the aftermath of the cyclone. How can it be a lie?” he countered at a press conference. Produces videos He also produced videos of his visits to Sholai Nagar, where Mr. Gandhi interacted with fisherfolk, and also to the fishermen settlement in Vaithikuppam. “As the BJP and those who left the Congress and joined the saffron party are engaging in deceit and spreading false propaganda, I have an obligation to set the record straight,” Mr. Narayanasamy said. “Ironically, it is those who never stepped out of their homes during the cyclone who are engaging in lies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-have-an-obligation-to-set-the-record-straight-says-puducherry-cm/article33885327.ece

Addressing a press conference, he said the Congress legislators were leaving the party because of the non-performance of its government. “You should do introspection within yourself rather than criticising us.

Prasad,TAMIL NADU||Diploma students of University in a fix||Students graduating from Annamalai University’s two-year diploma programmes in horticulture and agriculture are in a fix as their qualifications have not been recognised by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) for employment. While the University administration has taken up the issue with the Tamil Nadu government, the delay has resulted in students missing opportunities in jobs. Rude shock Over 35 students from the 2017-19 batch from the Chidambaram main campus, who had graduated with Diplomas in Agriculture and Horticulture were in for a rude shock when they applied online for the posts of Assistant Agricultural Officer and Assistant Horticultural Officer. A student, on the condition of anonymity, said that the name of Annamalai University was not published among the list of recognised institutions in a notification by the TNPSC in February. “The notification pertains to only courses offered and recognised by the government of Tamil Nadu or those affiliated with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University or the Gandhigram Rural Institute, Dindigul, or any other institution under the control of the Commissioner of Agriculture,” he said. While this notification will affect the career prospects of candidates who are pursuing or have completed Diploma courses offered by Annamalai University, the University’s claim that all the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes offered by the Faculty of Agriculture have been accredited by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has become a bone of contention. ‘We won’t qualify’ “While students will be able to apply for the posts online, the diplomas cannot be considered since TNPSC has not recognised the institution in its recent notification. Even if the students are selected, the candidates won’t qualify for the interview,” said another student. When contacted, a senior official in the University claimed that its name was inadvertently left out in the notification. “The Diploma programmes in Agriculture and Horticulture were introduced in 2017-18 and are in direct compliance with the minimum requirements and academic regulations duly approved by its statutory bodies, namely the Academic Council, Faculty and Syndicate,” he said. “The University administration has requested the government to consider the candidates possessing Diplomas in Agriculture and Horticulture awarded by the university for the respective posts and to make necessary amendments in the prescribed educational qualification,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/diploma-students-of-university-in-a-fix/article33885495.ece

20 February 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||‘Waiver will benefit DMK most’||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday rejected DMK president M.K. Stalin’s charge that AIADMK functionaries were the major beneficiaries of the crop loan waiver. Instead, he said, the DMK members were the biggest beneficiaries as “they are the owners of large farms”. Speaking at an election meeting at Kadayanallur in Tenkasi, he said DMK functionaries had obtained more loans from the primary agriculture cooperative societies; hence, they were the biggest beneficiaries of the waiver of Rs. 12.110 crore in crop loans. “The family of former Rajya Sabha member Agniraj of the DMK has obtained Rs. 7 lakh in loan in the name of his wife, son and son-in-law, and it has been waived. All these beneficiaries should vote for the AIADMK,” Mr. Palaniswami said, prompting thunderous applause. According to him, former Chief Ministers M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa had left behind a legacy of service to the poor. Whereas the DMK, “the family party”, was nurturing “family politics”, passing on the power from M. Karunanidhi to his son Stalin, who has almost handed it over to his son Udhayanidhi Stalin, he said. “Since the people of Tamil Nadu have shunted the DMK out of power, Mr. Stalin has been spreading lies to malign the pro-people government of the AIADMK and return to power. If it returns to power after 10 years, the DMK will gobble everything, including the land of the voiceless. So the people should not get deceived by these lies, and keep the DMK out of power forever,” he said. The Chief Minister halted his speech twice and asked the people gathered on the busy Madurai Highway to give way to ambulances. After addressing members of the AIADMK’s information and technology and youth wings at the end of his three-day electioneering, Mr. Palaniswami boarded a flight to Chennai at the Thoothukudi airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/waiver-will-benefit-dmk-most/article33884820.ece
20 February 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers plead for linking Kadaiyakudi lake with GA Canal||Farmers of three villages in Budalur taluk have pleaded that a new feeder canal be created to bring water to a lake in their area so that they could take up agricultural operations with confidence. The Kadaiyakudi lake spread over 100 acres serves as the main source of irrigation for the farmers in Kadaiyakudi, Surakudipatti and Solagampatti. Normally, the farmers of these villages will take up cultivation of paddy during the rainy season every year as their irrigation requirements will be taken care of by the water that gets stored in the Kadaiyakudi lake which has the Uyyakondan Extension Channel as its feeder canal. The feeder canal starts from the Vazhavanthankottai lake in Tiruchi district and merges at Kadaiyakudi lake. Every year the prospects of sustaining the late Samba crop cultivation on about 300 acres of agricultural lands by the Kadaiyakudi, Surakudipatti and Solagampatti hamlets heavily depend on the arrival of Cauvery water through the 72-kilometre-long Uyyakondan channel which originates near Tiruchi, according to T.Balan, a progressive farmer. This season cultivation of late Samba crop in these three villages got delayed due to the unexpected and unprecedented inclement weather conditions, he said and added that the transplantation of crop was completed by the farmers late in December 2020. At the same time, the farmers claimed water release from the Vazhavanthankottai lake into Uyyakondan Extension Channel became a reality only during December 2020, though the shutters of the Stanley Reservoir at Mettur was lifted on the scheduled date of June 12. Now with the closure of the Mettur Dam on the customary date of January 28 and the water flow in the Uyyakondan extension channel had been cut off and saving the standing crop in around 300 acres of lands at Kadaiyakudi, Surakudipatti and Solgampatti has become a Herculean task, the farmers said. In order to save farmers of these three villages from taking up risky late Samba cultivation every season, they suggested that a new feeder canal to the Kadaiyakudi lake be created to conduct water from the Grand Anicut Canal, which is located just three kilometres from the Kadaiyakudi lake. Such a measure would result in weeding out the heavy dependence on the water arrival to Kadaiyakudi lake through the Uyyakondan irrigation system and ensure timely storage of water in Kadaiyakudi lake for future use, they added. A demonstration was also organised by the local farmers at Kattuvari irrigation channel near Kadaiyakudi recently in support of their long-pending demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-plead-for-linking-kadaiyakudi-lake-with-ga-canal/article33884801.ece
20 February 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||‘Standardise latest technologies in agriculture operations’||The need to standardise latest technologies in agriculture operations in delta districts was stressed by A. Justin, Joint Director, Agriculture, Thanjavur. Inaugurating a seminar on the advantages of Zero Tillage Planting Machine (ZTPM) for sowing rice fallow crops organised at Aduthurai on Tuesday by the Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute (TRRI), Aduthurai, in association with the Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Coimbatore, Mr. Justin said the extensive field studies should be conducted to standardise the technologies in the Cauvery delta region. Referring to the declining trend in pulse production in the country in general and particularly in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Justin emphasised the need to increase the area of cultivation of pulses in the Delta region after samba harvest. Deployment of ZTPM would help counter problems such as non-availability of farmhands for sowing of pulses during peak labour demand period of December and January months, TRRI Director V. Ambethgar said. Dr. Ambethgar claimed that the deployment of ZTPM would help maintain crop population which is a key factor for higher yield in pulse. Forty-two officials in the grade of Assistant Directors of Agriculture and Horticulture, Assistant Executive Engineers, Agricultural and Horticultural Officers and officials of Agriculture Business participated in the seminar, according to a TRRI release. In addition to the officials from the Agriculture and Horticulture departments, undergraduate students from the Agricultural Colleges at Coimbatore and Echankottai and from Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College, Tiruchi, attended the seminar. Meanwhile, a group of students from Maharishi Vidya Mandir, Thanjavur, have designed a farm vehicle to plough, sow, transplant and harvest crops using a bicycle. The students, N. M. Yuvaraj, K. Thulasi Ram and P. Vedha Sri guided by their Physics Teacher, K. Sundari have also designed an agrobot to sense excess water and store the same and also a drone to detect crop diseases and monitor crop growth. They also presented their invention at the virtual IRIS National Fair held during January this year, according to a school release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/standardise-latest-technologies-in-agriculture-operations/article33884800.ece
20 February 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Plea to reschedule Plus Two exams||The Tamil Nadu Private School Correspondents Association has called upon the State government to reschedule the Plus Two examinations for the current academic year for the benefit of the students. In a statement issued here on Friday, the founder-president of the association, G.R. Sridhar pointed out that though it was announced that around 60 %of the portions would alone be considered for preparing the question papers for the forthcoming public examinations it would not be possible to cover the reduced syllabus and conduct practical tests/assessments before the end of April. Because just around 40 % of the students have opted to attend the regular classes in view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Further, the practice of preparing the question papers under the `blueprint’ method had been suspended from the last academic year and hence the students have to study the entire reduced portions to get themselves prepared to take up examinations, he added. Stating that most of the parents fear that their children would be forced to take up the examinations under stress, Mr. Sridhar urged the government to reconsider its decision to hold the examinations from May 3 to 21 for the benefit of the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-reschedule-plus-two-examinations/article33884802.ece
20 February 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||BJP leader predicts landslide victory||BJP co-in charge for Tamil Nadu P Sudhakar Reddy on Friday claimed that the BJP alliance (led by AIADMK) will secure a landslide victory in the coming Assembly elections. On the sidelines of a BJP Booth Committee members meeting in Thanjavur, he told journalists that he had toured more than 70 Assembly segments and had witnessed a good and enthusiastic response from the public and the party cadres. “I have also interacted with the farmers in Tamil Nadu and the interaction with them revealed that they (the farmers) are well aware of the advantages the three new [central] farm laws, especially the weeding out of middlemen in marketing agriculture produce”, he said. Several people-centric welfare schemes and measures have been implemented by the current National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, he said, when asked whether the farm laws would have an impact on the forthcoming Assembly elections in different states. “People are the better judges,” he added. The BJP’s strength in the next Assembly would be in double digits after the elections, he believed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-leader-predicts-landslide-victory-for-its-alliance-in-tn/article33885526.ece
20 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Work on multi-level parking lot makes slow progress in Tiruchi||Work on the multi-level parking lot near the city's central business district is progressing at a snail's pace. The project, undertaken to decongest the crowded bazaar area, has been going on for over a year and the work is yet to pick up pace. The Tiruchi City Corporation began work on the multilevel parking lot in September 2019 under the Smart Cities Mission. Sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 19.70 crore, the parking lot is coming up next to the District Central Library where the erstwhile City Club used to be. The parking lot will come as a huge relief to vehicles- both two-wheelers and cars, who struggle to find a spot before visiting commercial establishments along the West Boulevard Road and the Singarathope areas. Most buildings, including textile showrooms, do not have designated parking areas, forcing the customers to park along narrow and busy roads. The parking lot is being constructed in an area of 3,989 sq m. and will have four floors. It will have the capacity to accommodate 138 four-wheelers and 536 two-wheelers. However, the work, which was to be completed in September 2020, continues to drag. "Until March 2020, we were only able to erect pillars on one side. While work was slow even before the COVID-19 lockdown, it came to a standstill for at least five months due to the pandemic. Work on creating underground spaces has just begun. It will take at least one more year to complete," a supervisor at the site said. Shoppers said that the increasing crowd in the areas and the upcoming summers would make matters worse. "We are forced to walk in the sun after parking our vehicles elsewhere. Haphazard parking around the area makes it more difficult to navigate. The civic body must ensure that the parking lot is constructed soon and that the vehicles are cleared from the streets," a shopper said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-on-multi-level-parking-lot-makes-slow-progress-in-tiruchi/article33884805.ece

20 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||‘TRY 4 rice variety is suitable for sodic soil’||The TRY 4 rice variety, which was developed and released earlier this year by the TNAU’s Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute (ADACRI), has been found to tolerate sodicity at the study fields of the institute at Navalurkuttapattu on the outskirts of the city. “Farmers in Tiruchi and other parts of the State can raise TRY 4 in salt affected soils and get better yield,” P. Masilamani, Dean, ADACRI, said in a press release after a field visit by Joint Director of Agriculture (in-charge) S. Shanthi and V. Lakshmana Swamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture (State Scheme) to inspect the variety raised on the college campus. In Tamil Nadu, saline or sodic and alkaline soils accounts for approximately about 4.5 lakh hectares. The rice variety suited to normal soils may not suit such salinity / sodicity areas. Hence, research for development and release of rice varieties suitable to these areas were carried out at Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, ADACRI. Earlier, three rice varieties -- TRY 1, TRY 2 and TRY 3 -- were released by the college in 1995, 2002 amd 2010, respectively. These rice varieties are either long slender or medium bold suitable to idli making only. TRY 3 variety has become popular among farmers due its high yield. However, there was a demand a medium slender white rice variety of 120-130 days duration, Dr.Masilamani said. TRY 4 had an average grain yield of 5,730 kg per hectare (ha) with 22% increased yield over TKM 13, 16.5% over ADT and 7.0% over TRY 3, he added. P. Jeyaprakash, Professor and Head, Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, explained the features of the new variety such as its high milling of (68.1%) with high Head Rice Recovery (57.2%). The variety was resistant to major pests such as leaf folder, stem borer and gall midge and major diseases such as blast and brown spot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/try-4-rice-suitable-for-sodic-soil/article33884834.ece

20 February 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Rs. 5.77 crore disbursed as crop loss compensation||Disbursal of crop loss relief in the district has commenced and 5,798 farmers, whose crops on 5,607.72 hectares were damaged in the recent unseasonal rains received Rs. 5.77 crore as compensation. Informing this at the farmers’ grievances redressal meet held in the Collectorate on Friday, Collector V. Vishnu said farmers had cultivated paddy on 38,427 hectares, minor millets on 602 hectares, grams on 7,494 hectares, cotton on 663 hectares, sugarcane on 33 hectares and oilseeds on 474 hectares. Precisely, cultivation had been taken up on 47,513 hectares, thanks to the surplus rainfall. However, the unseasonal rains in mid-January affected the crops, especially paddy. Paddy cultivated on 163.05 hectares by 482 farmers, grams on 5,839.75 hectares by 5,727 farmers and horticultural crops on 34.49 hectares by 135 farmers were found to be affected during the survey conducted by the Departments Revenue and Agriculture. Based on the reports submitted by the inspection teams, the district administration forwarded proposals to the State Government seeking compensation for the crop loss. Subsequently, Rs. 5.77 crore had been paid in the accounts of 5,798 farmers, Mr. Vishnu said. On the ongoing harvest of paddy in the district, the Collector said of the 40 Direct Purchase Centres – 29 were already opened and 11 would be opened during next week. The Collector said quality agro inputs in adequate quantity had been stocked in the Agriculture Extension Centres and other authorised traders for the summer paddy cultivation even as the officials had been deployed to check the quality of seeds and other agro inputs. The Collector also informed that the reservoirs of the district, which had 60.70% water during the corresponding period last year, have 90.61% water. When the farmers appealed to the Collector to take steps for establishing cold storage facility at Kalakkad to store the plantain being cultivated on a large scale, Mr. Vishnu said the proposal was about to be submitted to the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rs-577-crore-disbursed-as-crop-loss-compensation/article33885540.ece

According to G. Balaji, secretary of Tiruppur Taxi Drivers Owners Association, six other taxi driver associations in the city supported the strike, which began at 6 a.m. “The price hike has severely affected our livelihoods,” he alleged. With the taxi drivers already hit hard due to the COVID-19 lockdown last year and having resumed their services in a full-fledged manner only recently, the fuel price hike has once again caused hardship to them, Mr. Balaji alleged. The fuel prices must either be controlled or the taxi drivers must be allowed to collect additional fares, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/taxi-drivers-go-on-strike/article33885333.ece

20 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Human-elephant conflicts linked to disappearing forest cover in Gudalur||The forest cover along crucial elephant corridors in Gudalur has decreased by around 13 per cent in the last four decades, and could be driving problematic human-elephant interactions in the region, a research paper suggests. The research into land-use change in the Gudalur landscape, a crucial corridor for elephants moving between the Mudumalai and Bandipur Tiger Reserves to Nilambur, was conducted by S. Karthick, a Ph.d student from the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology in the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam, with the use of comparative satellite imagery. Land conversion According to Mr. Karthick, the forest cover in the Gudalur landscape reduced from a total of 432 square kilometres in 1977 to 370 square kilometres by 2016. “Furthermore, the reduction in forest cover was highest through the period since 1990, when around three quarters of the conversion from forests to tea plantations, farms and buildings took place,” said Mr. Karthick. B. Ramakrishnan, Assistant Professor at the department who guided Karthick’s research and analysis, said that taken as a singular figure, the reduction in forest cover was not that striking. “However, the areas where the forest cover has reduced could be along important elephant corridors, leading to more problematic interactions between humans and elephants,”Mr. Ramakrishnan said. “The Nilgiris landscape has the single largest population of Asian elephants in the world. Elephants require these corridors to move from one habitat to another. These habitats are crucial for elephants’ feeding and also to ensure the genetic viability of this population,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan. Conflict zones The research has also delved into whether more problematic interactions occur in pockets of the Gudalur region where most of the conversion of forests into plantations and residential areas has taken place. “The correlation is very clear,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan, pointing out that Cherambadi, Pandalur and Bitherkad forest ranges had seen the most number of problematic interactions between people and elephants. These ranges had also seen some of the highest losses in forest cover, the analysis has shown. Mr. Ramakrishnan said that long-term studies need to be conducted and elephant corridors identified. “Once this is done, corridors can be restored wherever viable, which will allow elephants to move between different landscapes. However, even after these corridors are restored, it could take years for elephants to begin using them again,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/human-elephant-conflicts-linked-to-disappearing-forest-cover-in-gudalur/article33884850.ece

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Teaching the right moves across the board||K. Jeywin, a Standard IV student, and M.K. Shaoren, of Standard VI, are locked in a game of chess. Both make their moves — Ruy Lopez (Pawn e4) and Sicilian Defence (Pawn c5) — even as Nithilan S, an LKG student, keenly watches the contest. And the two are monitored by their coach R. Raghavan at his home in Avadi. Mr. Raghavan, 31, has been coaching underprivileged and a few differently abled students in chess free of cost for the past few months. An engineer, he worked at a private engineering college in the city for four years before losing his job. “After seeing Viswanathan Anand, I learnt chess on my own from books, and have attended many tournaments. I am also an international chess rated player. Last year, I saw Sakthivel, a Standard I student from Arakkonam, playing chess, and his family wanted someone to coach him because it did not have sufficient funds. So I started travelling to Arakkonam whenever I was free and coached him,” says Mr. Raghavan, whose father S. Raju is a retired MTC driver and mother R. Vijayalakshmi is a housewife. In November 2019, Sakthivel took part at an official world record attempt and received the Unico world record certificate. But the lockdown began a few months later, and Mr. Raghavan could not travel. “I also trained Hamilton Prabhu, a differently abled boy, and he took part in State-level tournaments,” he says. Now, he teaches underprivileged students who approach him. “I go to their homes if they do not have money to travel,” he says. Suganthy Vinodhini, founder of the Arakkonam-based Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Educational Trust, who coordinated Sakthivel’s coaching, said the coaching was of great help to the boy. “His parents are daily wage earners, and his aunt was teaching him chess. Owing to COVID-19, the coaching has stopped,” she says. R. Arunselvam, 9, and his sister R. Azhagumathi, 10, students of a government school at Perambur Loco Works, were also coached by Mr. Raghavan. “He told us that more than money, he would be happy to see the children come up in life,” said their mother R. Mala. Mr. Raghavan said he wishes to create many young champions. “I can also teach children across the country either in person or offline. It would be convenient if a time slot is allotted on TV channels,” he said, adding that he could have helped more people had he continued to have a job.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teaching-the-right-moves-across-the-board/article33884818.ece

20 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP set to build 75 toilets||To address the problem of shortage of public toilets in the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is constructing new facilities in different locations. To begin with, 25 toilets will be constructed, while tenders for another 50 will be floated soon. The city currently so far has 387 functioning public toilets, most of which are concentrated in the three core zones of East, West and South. Apart from these, there are around 170 e-toilets. However, most of these e-toilets are not in a working condition, BBMP officials have admitted. As per the national guidelines set by the Swachh Bharat Mission for public toilets, there should be one toilet seat for every 100 men and two seats for every 100 women. Given the city’s population, estimated at over 12 million in 2017, there is a shortage of more than 1,000 public toilets. Recently, Janaagraha sought inputs from citizens across the city as part of its annual ‘MyCityMyBudget’ campaign to put an end to public urination and make the city safe for pedestrians. Of the total 9,706 inputs received from citizens, 3,143 were about public urination, 916 about dirty or unusable public toilets and 591 were about locations where toilets were needed. Huge shortfall Srinivas Alavilli, head, civic participation at Janaagraha, said that based on citizens’ input, new toilets were needed in around 250 locations across the city. An exercise had been taken up by the organisation to map the existing facilities and locations where they were needed. “BBMP has made it clear that funding is not an issue. The actual concern is space; ground truthing will reveal if there is adequate space for new toilets in locations pointed out by citizens,” said Sapna Karim from Janaagraha. BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep said the locations of the 25 new toilets were decided first based on need and easy access to water and sanitary connections, apart from ensuring there was no obstruction in public access to the facility. The new toilets have been designed to have good ventilation, usage of treated water and water saving features. “They will be pre-fabricated structures, making construction easy and quick, and come with a clause of operations and management for a period of five years,” Mr. Randeep said.

20 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||D.J. Halli violence: Only 3 applications seeking redressal for property damage||Claims commissioner for D.J. Halli violence Justice (retd.) H.S. Kempanna appealed to people who suffered property damage in the August 11, 2020 violence to submit their applications to the Commission. While February 28 is the last date for submitting applications for damage claims, Justice Kempanna said his office had received only three applications so far. More than 50 FIRs have been filed in D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli police stations for property damage during the violence. Interestingly, Pulikeshi Nagar MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy, whose home was partially burnt down by a violent mob on the fateful night, is also yet to make an application claiming damages, sources said. “We have taken several measures to create awareness about the process. We have given advertisements in newspapers and put up posters in D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli. But the response has been lukewarm. I appeal to people who have suffered damages to submit their applications to us. We will get it independently valued by valuators and submit a report to the High Court, which will take measures to recover damages from the individuals and organisations found culpable for violence,” said Justice Kempanna. Applicants need to submit details of the police report, evidence if any with their particulars as part of the application. He added extending the deadline to submit applications was also being considered. Violence broke out in D.J. Halli and neighbouring K.G. Halli over a provocative post against Islam on August 11, 2020 night. D.J. Halli police station and the local MLA’s house came under attack by a violent mob, apart from several vehicles at multiple locations being burnt down and damage to property. Police have filed 75 FIRs, of which two cases that invoked Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act are being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Most of the remaining cases pertain to property damage during the violence. The Karnataka High Court had appointed Justice Kempanna as the claims commissioner in the case later that month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dj-halli-violence-only-3-applications-seeking-redressal-for-property-damage/article33885273.ece

20 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ensure social distancing, DPI tells govt. schools||With government schools in all districts barring Bengaluru set to resume classes for students from Classes 6 to 8 from Monday, finding space to ensure that social distancing norms are being followed has become a priority. Heads of government schools have been instructed to use libraries, staff rooms, laboratories and auditoriums as classrooms. Shortage of classrooms has always been a problem in government schools, where often students of different grades sit in the same room. However, officials admitted that this practice will have to be discontinued in the wake of COVID-10. Many schools are refurbishing their classrooms by dipping into their existing funds and mobilising funds through the School Development Monitoring Committee. According to DPI’s data for the 2018-2019 academic year, there are as many as 2.08 lakh classrooms in 43,492 government primary schools. Of these, 65% of the classrooms are in good condition. Meanwhile, in as many as 4,696 government high schools, only 49% of the total 23,318 classrooms are in good condition. According to the department’s data, besides the regular classrooms, there are 8,163 rooms that are available in the school campuses. V. Anbu Jumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said he had instructed district level officers at a video conference last week to ask school headmasters to utilise all spaces on school campuses. “We will also send senior officials of our departments to inspect schools and to ensure that they are following all the SOPs,” he said. H.K. Manjunath, president, Karnataka State High School Assistant Masters’ Association, said that in addition to the areas listed by the department, headmasters are considering using corridors of schools and open spaces within the compound walls in rural areas. “In schools where the student strength is high, teachers are planning to write to department officials to allow them to conduct classes in batches. Some government schools have more than 60 students per section and it is impossible to find space. Schools want to run classes in batches once upper primary sections open. But by doing so, the working hours of teachers will be stretched, so we request the department to depute lower primary teachers to work in upper primary classes for the time being,” he said. Sulochana S., a domestic worker whose daughter studies in a government high school in North Bengaluru said, “The government should use the pandemic as an opportunity to improve infrastructure in our schools. It should ensure that student strength in each classroom remains below 30 even after the pandemic so that all of us can get individual attention.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ensure-social-distancing-dpi-tells-govt-schools/article33885281.ece
20 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Placement poor under Kaushalya Yojana in State’||The performance in terms of placement is poor in Karnataka under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), a demand-driven, placement-linked skill development scheme by the Union Ministry of Rural Development, said a report of the Karnataka Evaluation Authority (KEA). The KEA, which evaluated the performance of the scheme from 2014–15 to 2018–19, said the average placement rate during the five-year period had been 36.68%, “which is far below the minimum placement of 70% envisaged by the scheme guidelines and is also below the overall national placement rate”. The scheme is aimed at providing poor rural youth with knowledge, attitude, and skills required to access jobs in the formal sector, with regular monthly wages above the minimum wage. The scheme was being implemented by the Department of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and Livelihood. The project implementation agencies provide skill development training and placements. Many graduates Only 7,800 people in the State received training against the country’s figure of 2,37,931 in 2018–19, said the KEA report. The survey conducted from a sample of 2,687 beneficiaries across 12 districts revealed 39.77% of them were graduates, which implied that the scheme was benefiting the educated unemployed. Only 1.64% of the beneficiaries had no formal education. Less than 50% of the beneficiaries (48.83%) were in continuous employment for three months after training. The high performance districts under this parameter were Kodagu, Uttara Kannada, Mandya, and Bengaluru Urban and the low performers were Davangere, Bidar, Yadgir, and Bagalkot, the report said. About 70% of female and 63.42% of male beneficiaries had resigned from the placement/first job owing to low salary and inconvenient location of placement. Overall, only about 42% of the beneficiaries were continuously employed in the first year after training. The average monthly salary of placement job/other first job post training was Rs. 8,136.45, which was lower than even the minimum wage for unskilled labour, the study said. Though the most common aspiration of beneficiaries was to start their own business/home-based job (25.48%), DDU-GKY has no self-employment course. A majority (53.37%) of beneficiaries are currently unemployed, which raised questions on the sustainability of the employment provided under the scheme, the KEA said.Lack of informed choice of the trade to undergo training, low quality of counselling, restrictive selection of courses were other major reasons for low success of the scheme, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/placement-poor-under-kaushalya-yojana-in-state/article33885000.ece
20 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fridays for Future India comes out in support of Disha Ravi||Fridays for Future (FFF) India, the Indian Chapter of the international climate strike movement started by Swedish environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg came out in support of Disha Ravi, 22, in a series of tweets. This is the first statement issued by the student-led organisation since Ms. Ravi was arrested by the Delhi Police on February 13. “Disha has been an integral part of this movement. Not only has she been voicing out environment concerns in India but strived for the equality and representation of the country’s most affected and marginalized groups in the global climate movement’s narrative,” said FFF India. Another tweet read: “As fellow volunteers, we wouldn’t stand back to say that she is one of the finest amongst us all. If there is one thing her activism has taught us, it is to raise our voices peacefully and respectfully for those at stake, to ensure justice for everyone.” Climate action The organisation underscored the importance of ‘climate action’. “We may be imperfect in our efforts but we are not afraid to try. We will continue to learn, grow and stand fearlessly for the truth, like Disha always does,” it added. Citizens and activists also rallied around Ms. Ravi and once again spoke out against the “illegal and disproportionate response of the government in targeting young activists.”. At an interaction organised jointly by the National Alliance of People’s Movements, Coalition for Environmental Justice in India and People’s Union for Civil Liberties here on Friday, activists expressed concern over the government’s authoritarian actions and criminalising dissent. Two kinds of attacks Vocalist T.M. Krishna, who was part of the event, said that there were two kinds of attacks on young people – one to tell them to ‘shut up and stay at home’ and the other involved ‘poisoning their minds with what is taught so that they can’t think freely’.  Freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest and assembly are non-negotiable human rights. These must be a fundamental part of any democracy. #StandWith DishaRavi Greta Thunberg on Twitter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fridays-for-future-india-comes-out-in-support-of-disha-ravi/article33885256.ece
20 February 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||KRRS conventions to lend momentum to farmers’ struggle||In a bid to lend momentum in Karnataka to farmers’ struggle against the Centre’s new farm laws, all factions of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) are set to come together to hold farmers’ conventions in different places from March 20. Announcing this at a press conference here on Friday, KRRS leader Chukki Nanjundaswamy said the KRRS and the Hasiru Sene would organise district-level farmers’ conventions in several places starting from Shivamogga on March 20 in the first phase. The conventions are being held to create awareness among not only farmers, but also the general public about the “negative impact” of three major laws ushered in by the Centre on the agricultural sector, she said. Expressing concern over urban consumers’ indifference to the three laws as well as farmers’ protests, she said the laws would actually impact food security which would affect consumers. “These laws will make us lose our rights on food as corporates will start controlling our food choices,” Ms. Nanjundaswamy said. The conventions would be held in Haveri on March 21 and Belagavi on March 22, she said. Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait and national secretary Yudhvir Singh would participate in these conventions, she noted. She expressed dissatisfaction that the Centre was yet to respond to farmers’ struggle on the outskirts of Delhi, though 130 farmers had died during the protest. “This only goes to say that it is the right time to strengthen farmers’ movement and also unite all factions of the KRRS,” she said. Support to Disha Farmers’ leaders at the press meet also took exception to the arrest of climate change activist Disha Ravi by the Delhi police for disseminating social media toolkit related on farmers’ protest. Green shawls as gift In a bid to connect with north Indian farmers who are protesting against the Centre’s three new farm laws on Delhi’s outskirts, Karnataka farmers will gift them the trademark ‘green shawls’ in a symbolic gesture. “This is a campaign being taken up by the KRRS to bring farmers in north India close to their southern counterparts. In this campaign, which is expected to be launched in a week, we will appeal to individual farmers in Karnataka to courier a green shawl as a gift to protesting farmers on Delhi’s outskirts,” Ms. Nanjundaswamy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/krrs-conventions-to-lend-momentum-to-farmers-struggle/article33885004.ece

They have planned a full-day dharna by executive committee members at all centres on February 22 and a daylong strike on March 30. They will also be holding a series of other forms of protests till March 30. UFOERN in a press release said that employees of NABARD, which was carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by replacing three of its departments to give focus to agriculture and rural development in 1982, were getting all benefits on a par with RBI employees. However, from the last seven years, pension regulations of the RBI have undergone several revisions with the approval of the Department of Financial Services, Union Ministry of Finance. But the DFS is yet to approve the same revisions for NABARD employees and is creating a disparity between the employees who had opted for NABARD and who had stayed back in the RBI. The officers, employees, and the retired employees want the following proposals and settlements in their favour which were already implemented for RBI employees: full pension after 20 years of service; calculation of pension based on last pay drawn or the average emoluments for the last 10 months, whichever is more beneficial; revision of pension with each wage revision; and reopening of pension option one last time and giving another option to those employees who could not opt for pension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dharna-planned-over-pension-related-issues/article33885001.ece

20 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Proposal on power tariff hike opposed||While Mangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (MESCOM) has proposed a hike in power tariff by an average of Rs. 1.67 per unit, consumers, elected representatives, and representatives of farmers and industry bodies on Friday asked the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) to retain or reduce the present tariff as people were yet to recover from the impacts of COVID-19. During a public hearing on power tariff revision by the KERC, chaired by its chairman Shambu Dayal Meena, MESCOM MD Prashant Kumar Mishra said the annual revenue requirement of MESCOM for 2021-22 has been estimated at Rs. 5,119.61 crore, which includes Rs. 3,513.24 crore towards power purchase and Rs. 779.59 crore for operation and maintenance. With revenue from charges (earnings) estimated to be Rs. 4,176.35 crore, there will be a shortfall of Rs. 943.26 crore. To bridge this revenue gap, MESCOM has proposed an average hike of Rs. 1.67 per unit, he said. Apart from taking up works to supply quality power, MESCOM is taking steps for the recovery of outstanding amounts from the State government and other agencies, he said. Objecting to the proposed hike, Sathyanaranaya Udupa from the Udupi district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh said that if MESCOM was really concerned about consumers, it would not have proposed any hike in power tariff. “The present tariff came into effect four months ago. MESCOM has declared a profit of Rs. 43 crore. It should not have sought a rise in tariff during this COVID-19 situation,” he said. He also said MESCOM should take steps for the recovery of the outstanding amount of Rs. 1,009 crore from the government and lessen the power tariff burden on consumers. MLA for Thirthahalli Araga Jnanendra said that people do not have high hopes of MESCOM, especially in areas such as Sagar, Thirthahalli, and Hosanagar, where power supply is available for barely four hours a day. He said MESCOM had failed to make use of the funds available under the Centre’s en Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana for rural electrification. Srinivas S. Kamath and B.A. Nazeer, from the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the neighbouring State of Kerala had retained the tariff of 2018-19 and had not increased it for 2019-20 in light of COVID-19. The power tariff for industries in Kerala is Rs. 5.75 per unit, as against Rs. 7.45 in Karnataka. “This steep rate is leading to the closure of many small-scale industries,” Mr. Kamath said. Asking MESCOM to take steps to further improve the complaint redressal system, Mr. Meena directed Mr. Mishra to take up, on a pilot basis, the metering of irrigation pumpsets in a substation area and access the power consumed. Mr. Meena said KERC was randomly looking at the quality of works of KPTCL and other ESCOMS. He reprimanded an officer overlooking the finances of MESCOM for giving a false picture to the MESCOM MD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proposal-on-power-tariff-hike-opposed/article33885426.ece

Speaking after inaugurating a job mela at the Dasara Exhibition Grounds here, the Minister said the pandemic-induced job losses were not only confined to the State but across the country. But, in recent days, many companies have started hiring, offering job positions to the unemployed youth. The job scenario in the State has improved, he said, adding that the situation was limping back to normalcy after the pandemic badly impacted the life and economy since last year. “The companies are coming up with new job offers, showing progress in the job market and the youth should make best use of the opportunities,” he advised. Mr. Hebbar said his department was bringing new reforms and changes in the existing laws for the protection of workers and their rights. A large number of youth thronged the Dasara exhibition grounds since Friday morning aspiring for the jobs at the mela which was organised under the support of the district administration, the District Employment Exchange, the Department of Industrial Training and Employment, Skill Development, and the Department of Labour. As many as 110 companies participated in the mela and the organisers said the companies gave offers based on the candidates’ educational qualification and skills. S.A. Ramdas, MLA, who initiated the job fair, said he had come across many youth losing their jobs during the pandemic. Skills During his tour of his constituency as part of “K.R. Kshetra Yatra,” he learnt youth in many households in the constituency had either no jobs or lost jobs, prompting him to hold the mela. He said those who haven’t got jobs at the mela need not have to worry as requisite skills would be imparted to them to make them “job-ready” soon. On the occasion, the Minister handed over job offers in a symbolic way to some candidates. Yathindra Siddaramaiah, MLA, MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajiv, Karnataka Exhibition Authority Chairman Hemanth Kumar Gowda and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/job-scenario-improving-says-hebbar/article33884995.ece

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Vaccine acceptance low among well-informed people in Karnataka||Vaccine hesitancy in Karnataka is high among those who are more informed. State health officials said they have noticed that the percentage of field level health workers (such as ANMs, ASHAs, anganwadi workers and anganwadi helpers at village level) who have taken the vaccine is the highest in the State at 71%. In comparison, only 54% of medical officers (doctors) and 56% of paramedical staff have been vaccinated so far. Of the 29,478 registered field level workers, 20,838 have taken the jab. Among the 17,172 village level workers, the figure is 12,041, according to data from COWIN portal dashboard. A mere 8% of eligible medical officers have taken the second dose. In contrast, 22% field level workers and 39% village level workers have been completely vaccinated (taken both doses). “The more informed healthcare workers are, the less convinced they are about COVID-19 vaccines. We have noticed that hesitancy is high among specialists and super specialists whereas ASHA and anganwadi workers are not reluctant to take the shot. We are trying to address this issue,” said Arundathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission. S. Sachidananda, Vice Chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), who conducted an orientation programme for over 1,000 doctors and specialists from medical colleges on vaccine hesitancy, said it had been observed that non-medical staff were easily convinced in centres where the doctors were convinced. “The overall vaccine coverage is around 51%. If this happens during this phase of vaccination for healthcare workers, we are worried what will happen when the vaccine is rolled out for the general public,” he said. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said doctors consider themselves to be well-informed and better equipped to protect themselves against COVID-19. “They have a lot of information about clinical trials, and they do not want to take less efficacious vaccines. Most of them want to wait for market authorised/full registration vaccines. As of now, COVID-19 vaccines in the country are authorised only for emergency use,” he said. V. Ravi, TAC member and former senior professor and head of neurovirology at NIMHANS, attributed this trend to misinformation campaigns on social media. “Vaccine hesitancy is because our healthcare workers are relying on social media and not on evidence. There are only two ways to get immunity: get infected and recover, or get vaccinated,” he said. Even those who are infected should get vaccinated as the available data shows that the antibody levels fall by six months after infection. All vaccine trials included infected people and no side-effects were observed, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccine-acceptance-low-among-well-informed-people-in-karnataka/article33885265.ece

Manjunath Prasad stressed on the importance of strict vigil and enforcement of protocols, especially wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Addressing BBMP health officials on Friday, he said that while nearly 6,000 cases a day were being reported in Kerala, there was a spike in cases in as many as 21 districts in Maharashtra, with South African and Brazilian variants also being detected there. The State government had directed the BBMP to send samples with CT values below 20 (excessive viral load) for genome sequencing to NIMHANS to ascertain the virus variant. “Some districts in neighbouring States have imposed a lockdown to check the spread. There is no room for complacency. We must ensure all protocols are followed, especially in closed environments such as hotels, theatres, cinema halls, marriage halls, and at various functions,” he said. Mr. Prasad added that the government had directed the BBMP to keep vigil till March-end to ensure there is no second wave in the city. In this regard, no personnel deployed for COVID-19 duty will be relieved. He stressed on the targeted testing of those with symptoms and comorbid conditions. The death audit has shown that the two main factors for deaths caused by COVID-19 are age and comorbid conditions that led to complications. He instructed health officials to ensure that private hospitals report deaths within the prescribed time frame. The BBMP had swiftly contained the cluster outbreak in Kaval Byrasandra and Bilekahalli. “We share a border with Maharashtra and Kerala, where the second wave has been reported. It is necessary for us to be vigilant,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/step-up-vigilance-enforcement-of-protocols/article33885269.ece

For the third phase of COVID-19 vaccinations, citizens who are above 50 years and those below 50 years with comorbid conditions will be able to submit details and register on an app. Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, addressing BBMP’s health officials on Friday, said the civic body should focus on slum areas and identify beneficiaries from lower socio-economic groups. ‘Health interventions’ “Identification of beneficiaries will help BBMP with health interventions that may be required, apart from upgrading the existing health infrastructure,” he said. Stating that the app will automatically capture data of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes as and when beneficiaries are tested, he said such a detailed survey has not been taken up in any other city, and nearly 2,500 tabs were being provided by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. for the same. “Since we will not be able to cover all citizens, there is an option for beneficiaries to upload their details on the website. Later, similar to the Pulse Polio survey, a door-to-door survey will be undertaken,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/app-for-survey-of-beneficiaries-during-3rd-phase-of-vaccination/article33885266.ece

The litigants, who are arguing cases on their own, will have to produce a hard or soft copy of their petition at the entrance, through Gate Number 5, to enter the premises, but they need to seek an appointment from the Registrar (Judicial) by email to enter the premises to carry out rectifications in the petitions, stated a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by the High Court by withdrawing earlier SOPs issued in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the production of a certificate from advocates in the prescribed format is not required for litigants to enter the court premises in the benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi. Any person found with the symptoms of COVID-19 at the entry points would be denied entry, and those violating the norms of maintaining physical distancing and wearing of face masks would be removed from the court premises by the authorities concerned. A separate SOP has been issued for courts in all other districts and in Bengaluru by partially relaxing earlier norms. The new SOP states that the modification has been done based on the present status of the COVID-19 situation, and it would be reviewed in the first week of March.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/relaxation-in-norms-for-litigants/article33885275.ece

Earlier a video of the construction work emerged on social media. It shows workers simultaneously doing cement plastering and applying paint on the walls of the building. Youth Congress workers alleged that the plastering and painting were being done at the same time in order to inaugurate the structure before the Election Commission announced dates for the Assembly polls. The building is being constructed at Rs. 70 lakh from the MLA fund of U. Prathibha. Youth Congress members alleged that no inspection had been carried out by authorities concerned to ensure the quality of construction. After the plastering work, the wall should be left to cure for at least seven days while keeping the cement wet in order to improve strength and hardness.

Mr. Ajikumar was suspended for his failure to execute an order of the Collector.

However, centuries-old trees on patta land reserved to the government were not allowed to be felled. “As there were ambiguities in the order, we had requested the government to make a clarification and directed village officers not to adopt any steps till getting the clarification,” Ms. Abdulla said.

20 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Independent films given a short shrift?||Are independent filmmakers being sidelined is a debate that crops up every time the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) happens and it is no different this time too. While opinions differ about the participation of independent films in the IFFK, there, however, seems to be consensus about the need for the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy (KSCA), the organisers of the festival, to do more handholding for independent filmmakers.  New section Award-winning independent filmmaker Bijukumar Damodaran, popularly known as Dr. Biju, is unsparing while accusing the existing KSCA council of progressively converting the IFFK’s character by taking it to the camp of mainstream cinema at the cost of independent cinema in the last five years. “In fact, the IFFK had been forced to screen movies that it initially ignored only after they found acceptance in other festivals. That too was made possible only after the introduction of a new section called Festival Kaleidoscope for screening Malayalam films featured in other festivals. Biriyaani , which featured in this edition of the IFFK, was one such movie to benefit from it,” Dr. Biju added.  Ajoy Chandran, secretary of KSCA, however, sought to drive home the point that the Academy had little say in the selection of films. “Such complaints should be raised with the jury. Besides, the fact that two films of independent filmmaker Don Palathara is being screened at this year’s festival alone debunks the theory of sidelining independent cinema,” he said. Sajin Baabu, director of Biriyaani , said he had no complaint about his film, which was featured at several film festivals across the world, being initially overlooked at the IFFK. Busan and Teheran “But there is no doubt that the IFFK should offer more handholding to independent movie makers just the way festivals at Busan and Teheran promoted their cinema. Busan film festival started around the same time as IFFK and it was since then that South Korean movies became a rage across the world,” the filmmaker added. K.P. Sreekrishnan, secretary of the Movement for Independent Cinema, the second general body meet of which will be held in Kochi on Saturday, accused the KSCA of working against its mandate of maintaining a balance between independent and commercial cinema by overlooking the aesthetics of independent filmmaking. He also demanded the introduction of a concept called ‘Kerala Première’ in the section Malayalam Cinema Today at the IFFK. However, Sibi Malayil, executive committee member of KSCA, said it was impractical for two reasons. “One, filmmakers cannot be asked to delay the theatrical release of their movies till December when the IFFK is held. Also no guarantee can be given to any filmmaker about the selection of their films,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/independent-films-given-a-short-shrift/article33884965.ece
20 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A chronicle of memories||“What does one do with all these memories?” ruminates Lena Dearna, the protagonist of the Mexican film Birdwatching featured in the International Competition segment of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK). Yet, it is to preserve those memories that she sets out to make a film. Diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, 68-year-old suave and urbane author and academic Lena obsesses over documenting her life visually to trace back her memories and life and ropes in Andrea to do it for her. Thus begins a deep emotional bonding between the two that threatens to take off on a wrong footing as Andrea needs much convincing to take up the eerie assignment. ‘Disorienting’ The movie could be disorienting for large parts as a life is being chronicled through a camera. However, the emotional quotient is not lost at any point, thanks perhaps to the personal connect of debutant filmmaker Andrea Martínez Crowther to the story as her own mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Following the gradual collapse of an otherwise cultured and well organised Lena into misery turns a painful experience for her chronicler Andrea who has to deal with her own demons over her troubled relationship with her mother. Before she realises it, Lena becomes a motherly figure to her and Andrea makes up for the absence of her daughter Rita away in Canada. As Lena is moved into a care home to spend her last days, Andrea appears before the camera to wrap up the movie, one that Lena will never get to watch. And she breaks down, realising how she has ended up discovering herself while chronicling Lena. Evocative images, soothing background score and above all the stellar performance by Bea Aaronson as Lena in all her complexities makes Birdwatching a poignant watch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-chronicle-of-memories/article33885408.ece
20 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kochi Corpn. to issue municipal bond||With the cash-strapped Kochi Corporation deciding in favour of issuing a municipal bond as an additional source of funds, the civic agency will approach the State government to determine the feasibility of a government guarantee for the bond. Approaching the government for a guarantee is a preliminary step in a long process. The Corporation’s credit rating will have to be determined and improved. Since the civic body did not have a register of its assets yet, one would have to be made, and the books of accounts would have to be cleared, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. If the government agrees to a guarantee, the Corporation’s finance standing committee will begin discussions to take the plan forward. “The Union Budget for this financial year encourages municipal bonds and is offering subsidies on them,” said Mr. Anilkumar. While some local self-governments in the country have issued bonds, this will be a first for the State. The Mayor suggested at the council meeting on Friday that with the funds raised by the bond, the Corporation could consider a detailed town planning scheme, possibly covering around eight to ten divisions between Banerji Road and Cheranalloor. A plan can be considered for the underdeveloped areas falling within those divisions, including islands such as Thanthonni Thuruth.  Suitable agency A suitable agency will have to prepare a design for such a scheme, that can incorporate plans for parks, roads and housing. The concept of a municipal bond had been floated in the Corporation’s budget for the 2018-19 financial year, said United Democratic Front (UDF) councillor V.K. Minimol. It was intended to pay the civic body’s share for the Smart Cities project, but the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the opposition then did not allow the process to move forward, she said. “The viability of value capture financing as a source of funding should also be considered,” she said, adding that the Opposition backed the idea of a municipal bond despite the risk involved. A municipal bond is a debt instrument on which interest will have to be paid. The idea of issuing a bond had been presented before the council as a suggestion from the finance standing committee and the Mayor. “But with the Corporation’s liabilities, getting a good credit rating might be difficult,” said UDF councillor Henry Austin, adding that no clear plan was presented to the council on what the funds from a municipal bond would be used for.

20 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||GIS mapping for property tax assessment||The Kochi Corporation will invite a tender for GIS mapping of the buildings in the city for a complete and accurate assessment of property tax owed to the local body. “The property tax estimates are determined on the basis of the bill collectors’ handbooks. The estimates need to be clarified and a proper assessment done using a GIS-based system followed by verification on the ground,” Mayor M. Anilkumar said at a special council meeting convened on Friday to discuss the civic agency’s financial situation before the budget is presented on Saturday. Opposition councillors shot down a proposal to get GIS mapping done by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS). The society’s proposal had been presented before the previous council, which had shelved it. Fresh tenders will now be invited to execute the project. “The property tax demand for the current financial year is at an under-estimated figure of Rs. 71 crore, including arrears. Tax needs to be assessed systematically based on assessment registers and not the bill collectors’ handbooks,” Mr. Anilkumar said. Furore in council Opposition councillors raised a furore at the meeting over a statement of liabilities, accrued over several years, presented before the council. The total liability stands at Rs. 243.28 crore as per the statement, a figure that the councillors contested. Pending payments include Rs. 60 crore due to contractors and a whopping Rs. 119 crore due to the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) for public taps. The charges due to the KWA were grossly over-estimated since the corporation was being charged for more public taps than those in use and the issue would have to be resolved after a joint inspection with the KWA, councillors said. An amount of Rs. 15.81 crore was listed as land acquisition charges and court decrees. The corporation continues to incur acquisition charges for the land at Brahmapuram. For the corporation’s new under-construction office building, Rs. 9.12 crore is pending to the contractor as per a court decree, according to the statement presented in the council. The contractor had gone to court demanding payment for elements that had been excluded from the cost estimate for the building, said UDF councillor V. K. Minimol. “The statement presented to the council made no mention of the amount owed to the corporation as GST compensation. The statement appears to be an attempt to indicate that these liabilities were a creation of the past councils,” said Opposition leader Antony Kureethara. With councillors being sceptical about the total liability, the figures will be examined by the Finance Standing Committee.

The programme is to replace the conventional lighting systems with energy-efficient LED lights and the project is being implemented jointly by Kerala State Electricity Board and Kerala Energy Management Centre. KSEB sources said that the Thrikkakara municipal area, which is one of the largest electricity sections in the State, has around 37,000 consumers and more than 3,200 LED lighting systems have been supplied to consumers in the section so far. The LED lighting systems are now supplied through the metre readers. The consumers are informed of their choice to go in for LED lighting systems costing Rs. 65 apiece through a short service message on their registered mobile number. The metre readers bring the LED systems to the consumers. An official of the electricity board said that the lighting systems were supplied in keeping with the COVID-19 protocol as nobody was asked to come to the KSEB section offices to collect them. One of the key features of the LED system is that the customers get branded 9 W LED bulbs at a discounted price of Rs. 65 in comparison with the higher market price. KSEB has made arrangements to collect CFLs and incandescent bulbs for safe disposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thrikkakara-to-switch-to-filament-free-mode/article33885405.ece

Six such individuals were stopped at the airport in a similar manner, said a release from the District Medical Officer. “Most COVID-19 positive travellers have been from other districts. The District Surveillance Units from the other districts informs us here that a COVID-19 positive person is travelling in violation of the directions issued by health workers,” said District Surveillance Officer Dr. Sreedevi. “They are stopped at the airport after we receive an alert here. People do not seem to be aware that this is a violation under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” she said. People who have tested positive for the virus must strictly avoid contact with other people and those who violate such norms will be penalised, said the release from the District Medical Officer. People with fever, cough or cold must avoid public interactions and public transport, and must get tested. Symptomatic persons have been treating symptoms on their own without getting tested, leading to an increase in the number of cases, the release noted. All unnecessary travel and gatherings are to be avoided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-positive-traveller-intercepted-at-airport/article33885396.ece

20 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cargo transporters want KMB to do more||Even as Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) is readying to charter a vessel to invigorate coastal shipping, many port officials and entrepreneurs in the field say the agency has much to do to shift cargo movement to the approximately 550-km-long coastal waterway that the State has. The shift of cargo to waterway transport could bring about lesser transportation cost, higher energy efficiency, and subsequently negligible carbon footprint as compared to the highly polluting and accident-prone road transport, they claim. “The prospects of coastal shipping will improve once the Vizhinjam port is completed. The Azheekkal port will further improve its potential. One needs a proactive KMB to ensure that vested interests, especially lorry operators who ferry cargo at present, do not play spoilsport,” says a senior official of the Ports Department. ‘Lack of support’ There have been incidents of cargo operators selling off their ships for want of adequate support from the government and the KMB, says A.M. James, general secretary of Kerala Maritime Organisation (KMO) that has ship and barge operators as its members. Even the existing fleet of vessels of different operators are shoddily under-utilised due to inadequate patronage from stakeholders who continue to rely on lorries. The KMB that began functioning in 2018 must spearhead policies and other steps that will energise the coastal shipping sector. “Kerala must learn from countries like Bangladesh that rely heavily on ferrying cargo through waterways. For a start, the government must, in a phased manner, impose curbs on transport of fuel and hazardous chemicals through the State’s narrow and congested roads and highways. This in itself will enable at least 20% utilisation of the potential of Kerala’s coastal and inland waterways,” he adds. In Gujarat T.P. Salimkumar, the newly appointed CEO of KMB, says Kerala’s coastline and 18 minor ports along it offer more potential than that of Gujarat. “Their maritime board was formed way back in 1980s and the turnover is in the range of crores of rupees. At present, goods are transported from Kerala’s hinterland to Kochi port through congested roads. This can be avoided if waterways are relied on. The KMB can do much, by utilising dredgers, other machinery and also skilled personnel that the departments concerned have,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cargo-transporters-want-kmb-to-do-more/article33885403.ece

Mathew, Chairman of the Kerala Maritime Board (KMB), has said. The board will acquire 500 acres in Azheekal to develop the port, while dredging to ensure 7 m depth is nearing completion. Similarly, capital dredging that was done as part of Sagaramala project was over in Beypore. The revenue during the past nine months was Rs. 100 crore, which was much more than that during the pre-2018 period when the board did not exist. In addition, over 150 ships carried out their crew change, bunkering etc., at Vizhinjam since July 2020, he said. On the controversy over Prakash Iyer, a member of KMB stepping down, Mr. Mathew said that this occurred after his resignation was sought. “He tainted the image of the board and of the government, thus hampering its functioning.” The board’s vice chairperson had stepped down earlier. Mr. Iyer said that the board’s functioning was marred by strife between stakeholders - especially with employees who managed port and allied matters prior to the KMB’s formation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mini-ports-being-developed-kmb-chief/article33885404.ece

20 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A different picture of new-age Brazil||Not long into the Brazilian film Memory House comes a moment where cattle is slaughtered with a captive bolt gun because it has aged, affecting its productivity. Watching it through his visor, it suddenly dawns on Cristovam, a dairy worker from the the hinterlands of the Brazilian South, that he is as dispensable as the dead cattle. After all, he was forced to take a pay cut by the company, which he had served for over two decades because the management was sure that a Black, old man like him, away from his roots, had little options.  Memory House by João Paulo Miranda Maria featured in the competition segment of the IFFK paints a different picture of the new age Brazil. Instead, there is the north-south divide and the simmering xenophobia and racism that marks it. With its disturbing imagery, smattering of dialogues, and extensive use of silence, Memory House is not for those viewers looking for instant gratification or an adrenaline rush.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-different-picture-of-new-age-brazil/article33885525.ece

Addressing the media in connection with his Aishwarya Kerala Yatra, he alleged that Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma had discussed the project with company representatives in New York. The project using 400 advanced deep-sea vessels and five mother ships would indulge in highly exploitative fishing off the coast, destroying the State fisheries sector. “The government has inked a contract handing over our sea and fisheries sector to the MNC. The Rs. 5,000-crore project was signed at ASCEND 2020, a global investors meet, in Kochi,” he said. He said the project also required upgrade of harbours and construction of new facilities in compliance with European Union standards along with seafood processing plants and advanced boat building and repair yards. “Right now the MNCs have targeted the marine wealth in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean and if we allow them to loot our seas, the traditional fishers will be left jobless.” He alleged that the government had not discussed the project with coalition partners or the Opposition. “They made this move without consulting any stakeholders in the sector and we suspect a conspiracy behind this. The government even amended the fisheries policy to suit the terms and conditions of the contract and we suspect large-scale corruption.” Mr. Chennithala said EMCC International (India) Private Limited, a subsidiary of EMCC Global Consortium, was formed only two years ago with a capital of Rs. 10 lakh. Rubbishes charges Meanwhile, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma rubbished the allegations as baseless adding that the department had no plans to permit deep-sea trawlers. “The Fisheries Department and the LDF government will not take any steps affecting the lives of traditional fishers. The department has not signed any contract and Mr. Chennithala is trying to mislead fishers and make controversies,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chennithala-govt-inked-pact-with-us-firm-for-trawling/article33884974.ece

Earlier, inspections were held for two months, and over 500 kg of banned items were seized from various parts of the city in just two days. Subsequently, plastic carry bags, disposable containers, and PVC flexes had disappeared from the city. Supermarkets stopped providing carry bags for free and started supplying cloth bags to encourage the public to carry own bags. The initiative did not go unopposed, as merchants sought time to do away with disposable materials in stock, but their plea was turned down. Interestingly, to cater to the demand for cloth carry bags, the Kudumbashree had opened several bag making units and shops selling steel utensils to replace disposable ones. However, the drive could not be taken forward thanks to the pandemic. Accordingly, Kudumbashree bag units switched to mask making. And, disposable containers and pouches made a comeback after home delivery of food became popular. The authorities did not ban the use of disposable items, as it was the need of the hour. At the same time, the health wing of the corporation, too busy handling the pandemic situation, had no time for plastic ban implementation. With no more inspections, and campaigners taking a break, several merchants went back to the plastic days. “We have noticed that banned items are being stocked and used in the city taking advantage of the pandemic situation,” Corporation Secretary K.U. Bini said. Now, the health wing has decided to undo the damage. “Unchecked use of single-use plastic can cause health and environmental issues. Besides, it adds to the huge pile of waste that we have to handle every day,” Ms. Bini said, justifying the decision. She also warned that those found carrying, stocking, or selling banned materials would be punished with fine, besides shutting down the erring enterprises and taking legal action against them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-corpn-to-resume-drive-against-single-use-plastic/article33884904.ece

There was a difference between a public speech and a statement, he said. On Wednesday, he had courted controversy by stating that minority communalism was a bigger threat to society. However, on Thursday, he had retracted saying that majority communalism was more dangerous. Mr. Vijayaraghavan alleged that the UDF was plotting to spread violence ahead of the Assembly elections.

One national and four State awards he won underline that fact, but he lived his life away from the limelight, letting his music speak. Kottukapally was not the among the most prolific of composers, but he came up with some splendid music in a career spanning over three decades. He worked almost exclusively in art-house cinema and many of his films went on to win national and international claim. Those films include Dweepa, Hasina and Gulabi Talkies (Kannada), Aadum Koothu (Tamil), Kamli (Telugu), Bhavam, Margam, Oridam, Kathavasheshan and Kutty Srank and Aadaminte Makan (Malayalam), which fetched him the national award in 2011. He was often the first choice for some of India's acclaimed directors, such as Girish Kasaravalli, Shaji N. Karun and T.V. Chandran. FTII product They preferred to work with Kottukapally because few composers understood cinema as well as he did. That is not surprising, though. For, he had learnt direction from the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. “I don't think you could find anybody else like Kottukapally in Indian cinema,” Pradeep Nair, director of Oridam, told The Hindu . “Since he studied direction and scriptwriting from India's premier film institute, he knew precisely what the director needed.” You would have expected a graduate of the Pune institute to make films, rather than making music. He had shot several ad films, though. “I remember watching one of the ads he shot for a jewellery shop in Kottayam, where he hailed from, and it was so very well made,” recalled Pradeep. “That used to be then screened at cinemas and it was extremely popular. For some of those ads, he had worked with A.R. Rahman, who was just starting out at that time.” Kottukapally had plans to direct feature films, too. “He had finished writing scripts for three or four films,” said Pradeep. “I had read them and they had the potential to become good films. He really wanted to direct a film.” That was not to be. His music, however, enriched many a film.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/his-background-music-enriched-many-a-film/article33884983.ece

All units with more than 10 cows will have to be registered in two weeks. According to officials, the registration process is part of the government’s efforts to prepare a comprehensive data bank on functional units and support the submission of various dairy welfare projects. The survey is in progress across the State, they said. Four categories Registration will be made under four categories based on the number of cows in each unit. Units having 10 to 20 cows will be included in the first category. Those rearing 20 to 50 cows will be part of the second category. Dairy farms with 50 to 100 cows will be brought under the third category. Farms with 100 or more cows will be listed under the fourth category.

Two dozen-odd staff working in the restaurant ran out to safety as the fire broke out on the kitchen side on the ground floor of the three-storey building around 11.40 a.m. There were no customers at the restaurant then. The flames soon spread to the other parts of the restaurant before engulfing the entire building. The fire gutted an adjacent restaurant named Arabian Grill too. Fire and Rescue Services personnel reached the spot in five minutes and started fighting the blaze. They could prevent a potential blast as they removed 13 gas cylinders from near the kitchen. The firemen also guarded the generator and an electric transformer adjacent to the building from a potential explosion. A joint examination by the officers of the Electrical Inspectorate and Fire and Rescue Services unit found that all electrical circuits were intact.  Exhaust fan An exhaust fan in the restaurant’s kitchen was suspected to have burned from overheating, and thus sparked off the fire. The thin plywood and aluminium panelling on the walls and the ceiling fuelled the fire. In less than half-an-hour, the entire furniture and the kitchen on the ground floor of the restaurant had reduced to ashes. District Fire Officer Arun Bhaskar said the interior work, including the false ceiling and wall panels, had helped the fire spread quickly. “The interior and exterior beautifications done on such commercial buildings are actually a big compromise on fire safety,” Mr. Bhaskar said. When the beautification materials inside will fuel the fire, the cladding material outside will contain the smoke within the building. “Exhausts are usually closed for interior decoration. The exterior cladding work on concrete structure is often dangerous from a fire safety point of view,” said Mr. Bhaskar. Traffic along the Stadium Bypass Road was diverted for a couple of hours. Owned by Mohammed Riyas, Open Grill is known to be the most popular of Noor Jehan’s chain of restaurants in Palakkad town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/popular-restaurant-gutted-by-mid-day-blaze/article33885492.ece

Kerala Rapid Transit Limited (KRTL), the special purpose vehicle set up to execute the project in 35.12 km in the two key cities, has been given the nod to forward the revised detailed project report (DPR) to the Centre. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had submitted the DPR in December 2017 as per the revised Metro Policy-2017 of the Centre. It was approved by the KRTL board on October 19, 2020 and the Cabinet early this month. As per a Government Order issued by the Public Works Department, the Light Metro along the 21.8-km corridor from Pallipuram to Karamana in the State capital will now cost Rs. 4,673 crore on completion and the 13.3-km Medical College to Meenchandha stretch in Kozhikode Rs. 2,773 crore. The contribution of the State is Rs. 2,187 crore, including land cost, spread over a period of five years. FAR to be enhanced For transit oriented development, the DPR has recommended enhancing the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) along the metro corridor from 2.5 to 4. In the case of value capture finance, property tax along the corridor will be increased by 50%. Further an increase of 2% in land registration charges on either side of the corridor has also been proposed. As part of the PPP component of the Metro policy, automatic fare collection system and lifts and escalators will be provided at Rs. 213 crore. Linear induction motor (LIM) propulsion technology has been proposed for the rolling stock. Implementation A unified metropolitan transport authority (UMTA) will be set up for efficient implementation by combining various modes of transport with the MRTS. The revised fare for up to two km is Rs. 13, two to five km Rs. 25, 5 to 12 km Rs. 38, 12-21 km Rs. 51, and Rs. 63 for above 21 km. The DPR will be submitted to the Centre next week for approval, sources said.

The event was held over videoconference. Union Minister of State for Power, New and Renewable Energy and Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship R. K. Singh, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, and senior officials of the Union Ministry of Power and the Department of Power in the State, and POWERGRID officials attended the function. The Pugalur-Thrissur HVDC system that cost Rs. 5,070 crore, is part of the Raigarh-Pugalur-Thrissur 6,000 MW HVDC system and enables transfer of 2,000 MW to Kerala through the HVDC station at Madakkathara, Thrissur.  The state-of-the-art Voltage Source Convertor (VSC) technology has been brought to the country for the first time by POWERGRID through this project. The VSC technology significantly reduces land requirement compared to conventional HVDC systems and is particularly suitable for Kerala, where land is scarce. It also facilitates development of smart grid and improves system resilience under various operating conditions. A unique feature of this project is the combination of overhead line and underground conductor for transmission of power. The POWERGRID optimised the right of way requirement through innovative tower design and use of cable. Major HVDC equipment such as interface transformers and IGBT-based power converters, AC equipment such as gas insulated substation, switchgear, controls and relay panels have been supplied by factories in the country, thereby giving a major boost to the Make in India programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pm-opens-pugalur-thrissur-direct-connect-line/article33884952.ece

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||‘Creative freedom restricted by cloaking it in religion’||Award-winning filmmaker Jayaraj has been a genre hopper of sorts. From outright crowd-pleasers like Johnnie Walker and Thilakkam to the ambitious ‘Navarasa’ series, the filmmaker has swung between extremes while being pilloried for his alleged affinity towards right wing politics. Attending the Kochi leg of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) where Haasyam , his penultimate work in the ‘Navarasa’ series, was screened in the International Competition section, Jayaraj talks about his works and the present climate of fear hampering creative freedom. Do you think filmmaking is being straitjacketed by the prevailing political climate? There is a sense of fear that wasn’t there in the past. One has to think before doing anything. The creative freedom is being restricted by cloaking it in religion, which is the biggest tragedy of the supposedly progressive times. I try to steer away from potentially controversial things, which in itself is a lack of creative freedom. With the ambitious ‘Navarasa’ series nearing completion with only one more film left to be made, is there a sense of emptiness? Which was the most challenging work? That is something I ask myself. It is the same feeling as a sprinter who has breached the record and is left with nothing more to achieve. I will be content if I am able to finish that series. It has to be Karunam as it featured an aged couple in a restricted space. Apart from Karunam in the ‘Navarasa’ series, Deshadanam was my other major experiment and and both were well received and successful financially as well. You were often accused of being a right wing camp follower. Did you ever feel restricted creatively by that labelling? I have been accused of different things at different times. I could be called the most rebellious Leftist for making a film like 4 the People while I am stamped a right winger to this day for making Paithrukam . What are your plans for the next movie, Sringara , the last one in the ‘Navarasa’ series? I am still undecided as it has many shades. I even spoke with MT sir [M.T. Vasudevan Nair] on what constitutes the right interpretation of Sringara. I had a somewhat similar dilemma in the making of Haasyam , which also has many shades before I decided on black humour.

The sequel to Drishyam has to live up to the stature of one of the best thrillers in Malayalam cinema and Georgekutty, its protagonist, to that of a man whose brain is always one step ahead of the police’s.  Drishyam 2 takes off six years from the time Georgekutty (Mohanlal), a cable television operator, outsmarted the police investigating the murder of Varun Prabhakar, his daughter’s classmate who gets accidentally killed by her. Georgekutty is now a theatre owner who dreams of making a film based on a story he has written. His elder daughter Anju (Ansiba) is still recovering from the trauma, while the younger daughter Anu (Esther) is now a slightly rebellious teenager. The entire family, more so his wife Rani (Meena), is leading their lives with one eye behind their backs, with the fear of the police catching up. Georgekutty’s new-found prosperity has set tongues wagging among the local populace. Many now believe that he has actually committed the crime. The police are still looking for leads to solve the case. Director Jeethu Joseph takes things slow in the first half, which was borderline boring in the previous film too. Some life is injected into the flagging script by an intelligent interval twist. Even when we are reminded of the everydayness of Georgekutty, there is an invincible aura around him which tells us that he has made arrangements for any eventuality. Now, that is a problem which any sequel to such a film will face. Jeethu does manage to break that aura later, with the slow unravelling of Georgekutty’s plans. A few new elements are brought in, which blend seamlessly with the original thread. The intensity of the final one hour of glorious twists and turns contributed much to the success of the first part. There was something organic about how it all tied together in the end, but here even when things remain unpredictable for most parts, it is being achieved using a few conveniently created characters and a slightly contrived set-up with loopholes. Having said that, it is no easy task to flesh out a script like this from a case which was as good as closed.   Despite its negatives, it still is a decent companion piece to its much celebrated prequel. S.R.

Ms. Surendran hoped the Governor would "censure" the government, cancel the “illegal appointments” and counsel the administration to give the rank holders their jobs. The rank holders thanked Mr. Khan for listening to their woes. Later, Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan indicated that the government was conducive to talks. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the government had not closed the door on anybody. Law Minister A.K. Balan challenged Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala to promise the agitators that the UDF would provide jobs for all persons named on the PSC rank lists. The Opposition was misleading the youth, he said. The CPI(M) also expressed concern that outside elements could infiltrate the protest to foment trouble to create antipathy against the government. Meanwhile, the jobseekers intensified their 25-day agitation in front of the Secretariat. National medal-winning athletes turned cartwheels on the road. Elsewhere, activists of the Youth Congress and Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) marched in support of the strikers. In Kozhikode, the police used water cannons to disperse a BJYM march. Youth Congress workers attempted to storm the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in Kalady in protest against the alleged nepotism in appointments. All India Congress Committee general secretary Tariq Anwar visited the agitating Congress legislators Shafi Parambil and K.S. Sabarinathan. He called on Kerala Students Union workers injured in police action here on Thursday. Kerla Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappaly Ramachandran said the CPI(M)’s willingness for talks was insincere and a stopgap.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-open-to-talks-cm-tells-party/article33884985.ece

20 February 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. gives nod for expansion of GGH||Government General Hospital(GGH) in Anantapur is going to get a significant infrastructural expansion with the addition of 7 lakh square feet of built-up area to the existing 8 lakh square feet, for which the State government has given its nod and tenders are likely to be invited soon. This expansion will increase the total in-patient bed capacity from the current 500 to 1,200 in the teaching hospital. Simultaneously, this expansion will also facilitate an increase in the number of Post-Graduate seats in the Government Medical College from the current 100 to 150/200 in a phased manner in different specialities. For the expansion to take place, seven government buildings along with the land around the buildings would be handed over to the Directorate of Medical Education, which was decided this week at a meeting with the Chief Secretary in Amaravati. Estimated cost The District Administration has estimated Rs. 52 crore expenditure for getting new buildings constructed for the offices of different departments (who surrender their buildings and land) at an alternative location. Pandemic exposes lacunae in facilities The expansion of the hospital was on cards for several years (almost a decade), but a lack of political will and differences of opinion among leaders about the location of new buildings had put the project on the back-burner. But now, the State government asked the District Collector to prepare proposals and submit them after the pandemic exposed the lack of facilities in hospitals. The expansion project will be taken up around the existing hospital building, for which 12 acres and 49 cents of land with buildings belonging to the Fire Department, Anantapur Municipal Corporation (Guest House), Irrigation Department, Roads and Building, Nehru Bala Bhavan, Police Command Control, and Forest Department would be handed over. District Collector Gandham Chandrudu told The Hindu that as per the proposal, these seven departments would be allocated 5.6 acres in Tungabhadra Project’s High-Level Canal (HLC) office. Until the buildings are constructed, the departments will function from the offices in AP Tribal Welfare Residential School Seva Sadan (AP Dairy), veterinary office new building in Sai Nagar, Archaeology Department new building near DRDA Office and Girijan Bhavan and Red Cross Bhavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-gives-nod-for-expansion-of-ggh/article33884763.ece

He alleged that many others, who were not TDP members, had filed nominations on TDP symbol. “Now even to give a B-Form, we do not know who those people are, and they might withdraw nominations on March 2 or 3 enabling only the ruling party candidates to be there in the fray,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-candidates-not-allowed-to-file-nominations/article33884765.ece

20 February 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Worries rise as jumbos stray close to Chennai NH||Tension gripped several villages along the Puttur-Chennai NH-716 on Friday night with two wild elephants straying close to human habitations and the fields along the road. The duo had a couple of days ago attacked two farmers near Narayanavanam hill, injuring them critically. A large number of public stood on the NH to prevent the jumbos to cross into the otherside at Paramesa Mangalam village on the outskirts of Puttur. Around 7.00 p.m., the elephants emerged into a paddy field from nearby hillocks. Farmers rushed to the spot to drive them away, but in vain. Seeing the elephants charging at the crowds, forest personnel deployed forest watchers and elephant-trackers to divert their attention. Forest Range Officer (Puttur) K. Subramanyam told The Hindu that in order to monitor the movement of the elephants, forest personnel were posted along the possible entry points connected to the NH. Traffic halted At 8.30 p.m., the forest personnel stopped the traffic on the NH for a brief while seeing the elephants coming closer to cross the zone, and the situation relented later as the duo confined itself to the fields. The farmers were sought to abandon night vigils in Nagari and Puttur areas temporarily. A three-member group crossed into Chittoor from Pernambat in Tamilnadu in January, and entered the plain areas of Puttur and Nagari through Karveti Nagaram range. Though the officials made efforts to drive back the elephants into TN forests, it did not materialize.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/worries-rise-as-jumbos-stray-close-to-chennai-nh/article33884769.ece

20 February 2021||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Film shootings resume in City of Destiny with a bang||After a lull due to the COVID-19, film locations in the city of destiny are abuzz with activity. Several movie production units have been busy shooting in the city for the last two months. Visakhapatnam has been one of the most sought after film destinations for many film makers. A number of movies from the bygone era, including ‘Maro Charithra’ starring Kamal Hassan, Chiranjeevi’s ‘Abhilasha,’ Balakrishna’s ‘Narasimha Naidu’ till the recent Sai Dharam Tej starrer ‘Solo Brathuke So Better’, showcased the beauty of Vizag. After being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, film shootings, which were completely stopped for nearly 10 months, have now resumed with a bang. Actor Sundeep Kishan starrer ‘Rowdy Baby’ is being canned at Visalakshi Nagar, Bheemili and many other locations since December 2020. The fight sequences of actor Ravi Teja’s upcoming flick ‘Khiladi’ was shot at Vizag Port last week. Actor Karthikeya and Lavanya Tripathi’s ‘Chavu Kaburu Challaga’ is being filmed at Rama Krishna Beach for the last couple of days. Similarly, Director Ajay Bhupathi is filming some of the scenes for his ‘Maha Samudram’, starring Sharwanand, in the city. It is a big relief for a number of people working as managers, unit van operators, crane operators, technicians and fighters (body builders), from the city, who are dependent on the film industry. “Yes it was a very tough phase due to lack of work. But thanks to the seniors in the industry, we have received essentials and support even during the lockdown. Now, we are back to work again since November,” said S. Ramesh, who works as an Assistant Manager. K. Anjaneyalu alias Anji from Visakhapatnam, a van operator, assists director of photography during the shoots. Expressing happiness with the resumption of film shootings, he said there has been continuous activity for the last 45 days. According to Mr. Anjaneyalu, shooting in Visakhapatnam has been a sentiment for many actors and directors. “Many directors believe that filming at least one scene in the city will make the movie a grand success,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/film-shootings-resume-in-vizag-with-a-bang/article33885551.ece

He had put these processes in Sushuta Samhitha, which was later translated into Arabic and English. “This will be an inspiration for all the medical college students and faculty to excel in their fields. He is a source of solace for all patients as in India we had the ayurvedic way of treating any kind of diseases or ailments.

20 February 2021||Nivedita Ganguly,ANDHRA PRADESH||Over 130 species recorded from Vizag in Great Backyard Bird Count||More than 270 species of birds were recorded from the State this year during the four-day annual event of The Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC) and Campus Bird Count (CBC) held during this week. Organised every year in February for four days, the GBBC and CBC India is coordinated by the Bird Count India Collective. Interestingly, this year Visakhapatnam district reported more than 130 species of birds, taking the district to the third position on species diversity next to Chittoor and East Godavari. Five species were recorded for the first time from the district. These are ruff, pin-tailed snipe, pied harrier, Palla’s gull and lesser black-backed gull. This time, a city-based wildlife NGO, Wildlife Conservation Through Research and Education (WCTRE), collaborated with Bird Count India and coordinated the event in the district. “Compared to 2020 results where 99 species were recorded in the district, this year the diversity recorded has increased to 134. The district is a hotspot for over 30 migratory avian species and our neighbourhood holds an importance in these birds’ migratory life. Hence it is of utmost importance for the common man to come forward and contribute in protecting them,” said V. Bhagyasree of Wildlife Conservation Through Research and Education (WCTRE). Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC) India is the Indian implementation of the global Great Backyard Bird Count. Birders in India have participated in the GBBC since the event went worldwide in 2013. The data is collated at eBird, a global online platform, for documenting and maintaining observations of birds. It is housed in Cornell University’s Laboratory of Ornithology. These annual snapshots of bird populations provide crucial information on a variety of important questions, including “how birds are distributed across the country, how they are affected by changes in habitat and weather, and whether populations and distributions might be changing from year to year.” In the district, GBBC was conducted in locations such as Meghadri Gedda reservoir, Podugupalem lake, Kambalakonda Wildlife Sanctuary and Campus Bird Counts were done in Andhra University, GITAM University and Indira Gandhi Zoological Park. With active participation from the members of WCTRE, Vizag Birdwatcher’s Society and nature enthusiasts, the event was a huge success.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/over-130-species-recorded-from-vizag-in-great-backyard-bird-count/article33885567.ece

However, now at the time of curing, tobacco growers are a happier lot as bright grade accounts for a majority of the crop this year in contrast to the previous year when low grade varieties flooded the market, leading to first-of-its-kind intervention in the market by the Markfed to bailout the growers. Going by the present trend at the auction platforms in Karnataka, where it is a kharif crop, farmers expect a premium price for F1 and F2 grade varieties of tobacco this year. The price for bright grade varieties went up to Rs. 250 per kg in the neighbouring State during this month in view of the shortage in the region, Tobacco Board sources said. The farmers also see an improved demand for tobacco following the ‘v-shaped’ recovery of the global economy after the coronavirus-driven slump last year and closure of market during the lockdown. Demand for average price Though the grade outturn is highly encouraging, there has been a fall in productivity by a couple of millions of kg of the produce following the unseasonal rains. “We want the crop regulator to ensure an average price of Rs. 175 per kg for the reduced crop for us to break even,” says Tobacco Farmers Association leader from Kandukur T. Ramanaiah. Anticipating a fall in demand for tobacco in the wake of the pandemic, the Tobacco Board had reduced the crop size in the Southern Black Soil(SBS) and Southern Light Soil(SLS) regions to 69 million kg as against 83.8 million kg in the previous year. Bright grade is expected to account for 60% of this year's total crop size, Medium and low grades are expected to be 20% each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/better-grade-out-turn-brings-cheer-among-tobacco-growers/article33884772.ece

20 February 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tirumala chock-a-block with devotees||A large number of pilgrims took part in Ratha Sapthami celebrations at Tirumala on Friday. Even though, the Tirumala Tirupati Devashtanams (TTD) had provided just around 50,000 ‘darshan’ tickets on the festival day in adherence to the COVID guidelines, the turnout was far beyond expectations. The occasion to witness seven processions of the Lord in a single day might have also prompted pilgrims to visit Tirumala. Majority of them wore face masks and had hand sanitisers. However, they didn’t adhere to physical distancing norm during processions. The festival took off to a ceremonial start with the procession of Suryaprabha Vahanam before the break of dawn and culminated with Chandraprabha Vahanam in the night with periodical ‘vahanams’ in between. A large number of devotees, who had converged at the north-west corner of the hill temple, went into raptures as soon as the rays touched divine feet of the deity mounted atop the golden Suryaprabha Vahanam. The air was electrified with the chorus recitals of verses by Vedic students and rhythmic chanting of ‘govinda namam’ by the assembled devotees. It was a sight to behold as thousands of devotees offered ‘haratis’ to the deity from the place where they stood. The day was also marked with the processions of Chinna Sesha, Garuda, Hanumanta, Kalpavriksha and Sarva Bhoopala Vahanams besides Chakrasnanam in ekantham. The TTD Annadanam personnel had a tough time in ensuring uninterrupted supply of food packets to the devotees while the health workers laboured in maintaining hygiene. Ambulance services were kept ready at all the four corners of the hill temple to meet any kind of exigencies and mobile medical teams were pressed into service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tirumala-chock-a-block-with-devotees/article33885474.ece
20 February 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Video on distribution of ‘Tirumala laddu’ to voters kicks up a row||In a video that went viral on Thursday, bags purportedly containing the ‘Tirumala laddu’ were distributed as election sops among the voters in a village in Chandragiri mandal of Chittoor district. The viewers expressed shock on two counts – first, for misusing the sacred ‘prasadam’ as an emotional tool to allure voters, and, secondly, for using the ration delivery vehicles for distributing the ‘prasadam’ at the doorstep of voters. The incident reportedly happened in Thondawada panchayat, where the voter slips were allegedly distributed along with the cloth bags containing the ‘prasadam’. Calling themselves as ‘Srivari devotees’ in the video, Uma Reddy and Sridhar Reddy, residents of the panchayat, flayed the ruling party leaders for “playing with the religious sentiments of the devout and misusing the official machinery for their political gain.” When contacted by the media, Chandragiri tahsildar G.C. Venkateswarlu said he was in the know of the incident, and added that the issue would be probed. ‘Stooping to a new low’ Staff Reporter in Vijayawada writes: Reacting to the incident, TDP national general secretary and MLC N. Lokesh accused the YSRCP leaders of stooping so low as to use the sacred ‘laddu’ for seeking votes in the panchayat elections. In a statement, he alleged that a large number of ‘laddus’ were distributed along with the voter slips in Thondawada panchayat. “It is now evident that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his party leaders have no respect for the people as well as the Lord,” Mr. Lokesh alleged. The State Election Commission (SEC) should disqualify the YSRCP-backed candidates for offering ‘Tirumala laddu’ as inducement for the voters, he said, and demanded that cases be booked for violation of the Model Code of Conduct.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/video-of-distribution-of-tirumala-laddu-to-voters-kicks-up-a-row/article33884869.ece

The incident happened late on Thursday in Kandada panchayat of Yerpedu mandal when Mr. Reddy was returning home after canvassing for his wife Devakamma. Miscreants reportedly waylaid and tried to stab him close to his home. Even as he raised an alarm, they fled in the cover of darkness. The victim sustained a deep slash and bleeding injuries near the elbow. Though Mr. Radha Reddy’s family owed its allegiance to the ruling party, he reportedly decided to pit his wife as a rebel candidate against Sridevi, who is supported by the party. In a complaint lodged with Yerpedu police, the family said the perpetrators were the henchmen of the rival candidate’s husband.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/miscreants-make-bid-on-the-life-of-sarpanch-aspirants-spouse/article33885475.ece

20 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP, TDP stoking up VSP row only to defame BJP: Veerraju||Alleging that the government had a direct or an indirect role in the attacks on temples, BJP State president Somu Veerraju said on Friday that it was only under tremendous pressure that a special investigation was launched to probe such instances. Addressing the media along with party Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao and State party general secretary S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy here, Mr. Veerraju also accused the Christian missionaries of resorting to religious conversions. ‘Religious conversions’ “The Christian missionaries are, in fact, trying to create an atmosphere where they can fulfil their agenda with ease,” Mr. Veerraju alleged. He accused the YSRCP and the TDP of taking up the cudgels against privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) only to divert the people’s attention from the BJP’s efforts to bring to book those involved in the temple attacks, and to achieve the larger goal of defaming the BJP-led Central government. “The Centre has not yet made a final statement on disinvestment of its stake in the VSP. But the YSRCP and the TDP have unleashed a false propaganda on the issue as part of their political agenda,” Mr. Veerraju alleged. Pointing out that leaders of only the YSRCP and the TDP were allowed to go to Ramateertham temple where the idol of Lord Rama was desecrated, he said it was a clear case of isolation of the BJP by the two regional parties. Besides, permission was deliberately rejected for the ‘Rath Yatra’ the BJP had proposed to take out from Kapilateertham to Ramateertham to highlight the “government’s antipathy towards the Hindu religion,” he alleged. “It is due to the fear of the emergence of the BJP-JSP alliance as a strong alternative to them in the general elections that the YSRC and the TDP are playing all sorts of tricks, one of which is to provoke the employees of the VSP, to derive political mileage,” Mr. Veerraju alleged. “We have apprised our leadership of the sentiments associated with the VSP. We will continue to strive to protect it. The attacks on temples have also been taken to the notice of the Centre. People should realise the machinations of the YSRC and the TDP,” Mr. Veerraju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-tdp-stoking-up-vsp-row-only-to-defame-bjp-veerraju/article33884698.ece
20 February 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||School education commission orders closure of 80 D.Ed colleges||The Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission has ordered the closure of 80 Diploma in Elementary Education (D.Ed) colleges that are allegedly functioning in violation of the norms set by the government. The commission, headed by Chairman R. Kantha Rao, which met here on Friday, also recommended action against 100 more institutions that were allegedly operating without proper buildings, infrastructure, staff, and students. Teams, under the supervision of commission vice-chairman Vijaya Sarada Reddy and members V. Narayana Reddy, B. Eswaraiah, D.V.R.K. Prasad and C.A.V. Prasad, scrutinised the documents and educational certificates of the staff and students of the D.Ed colleges. They found several lapses in the functioning of the institutions, the members observed. The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) had given permission for 860 D.Ed colleges. The State Council for Education, Research and Training (SCERT) had given affiliation for the institutions in the State. The Regional Joint Directors (RJDs) of the Director of School Education have to conduct periodical inspections and verify the staff, labs, teaching and other facilities in the colleges. “Each college can admit 50 to 150 students, depending on the facilities. D.Ed qualified candidates will get Secondary Grade Teacher (SGT) certificates, and they can teach from Classes 1 to 8 in the private, aided and government schools,” Prof. Narayana Reddy said. Notices served “We served notices on all the 860 colleges and directed them to appear before the commission with relevant documents. However, many institutions failed to produce the documents and other particulars as per government norms,” said Mr. Prasad. ‘Quality will suffer’ “If there is no quality in teachers and if they pass out with poor knowledge, it will impact the students severely in schools, and the quality of education will come down. The commission has taken the matter seriously,” Mr. Prasad said. “In the first phase, we verified the documents of about 200 colleges. Scrutiny is being done in the remaining institutions. The commission ordered closure of 80 institutions as they are running without proper amenities, and action has been recommended against 100 more colleges,” Mr. Eswaraiah said. “The commission will summon the managements of the remaining institutions too. A detailed inquiry will be conducted on the functioning of the D.Ed colleges, as poor teacher education system will impact lakhs of students,” Prof. Narayana Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/school-education-commission-orders-closure-of-80-ded-colleges/article33885247.ece

This was in line with the UFBU’s clarion call to its 10 lakh members, comprising employees and officers working in banks across the country, to take up a prolonged agitation against the government’s move to privatise two public sector banks along with IDBI Bank. The leaders, who addressed the gatherings, said banks and insurance companies deal with people’s money and privatising them meant handing over people’s money to vested interests. “Bad loans and Non-Performing Assets(NPAs) have been increasing year after year because of corporate defaulters. Instead of taking tough action against them, the government wants to whitewash the balance sheets by shifting bad loans to the ‘bad banks’ to be created for the purpose This will only benefit the corporate defaulters as they will repurchase their assets from these banks at a throwaway price. It is also to remove all the bad loans from public glare and silently write them off,” they said. They said a strike would be observed also on March 15 and 16 to oppose not only the privatisation of banks but also disinvestment in LIC and sale of public sector undertakings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/privatisation-of-public-sector-banks-staff-stage-protest/article33884774.ece

The counting centres should be “sterilised” so that no outsiders were permitted, and care should be taken to ensure that information about trends was not leaked, he said. “Recounting has to be done only in close cases, and not in respect of double-digit margins.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Venugopala Rao said the hiring of consultants to assist the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management in making the Initial Public Offer in LIC and the under-valuation of its actual value were highly objectionable. He pointed out that the LIC achieved unparalleled growth, and the number of its policyholders (40 crore) was the world’s largest. It had a phenomenal asset base of Rs. 32 lakh crore, he said. The sale of the Central government’s stake in LIC was detrimental to the country’s economic self-reliance and the interests of its policyholders, he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centres-move-to-divest-stake-in-lic-opposed/article33885480.ece

In a statement on Friday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said the owners had parted with their land to the VSP with the hope that their children would have a bright future. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on the other hand, has put forth the proposal to sell away the lands. The aim is only to benefit his party leaders,” the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council alleged. “The hidden agenda is to sell the lands through the Central government and, thereby, avoid bad name for the YSRCP,” he alleged. The Chief Minister’s ultimate plan was to get possession of the lands through his benamis, the TDP leader alleged. “The steel plant lands have a high market value of more than Rs. 3 crore per acre. Any benefit from the lands should go to the residents and not to the CM’s benamis,” he said. The main demand of the people of the Port City was that the Chief Minister should talk to the Centre and stop privatisation of the steel plant, he said. Alleging that Mr. Jagan and Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy were “co-conspirators” in the issue, the TDP leader said, “Aurobindo and Hetero companies are also party to the secret deal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/yanamala-faults-jagans-proposal-to-sell-vsp-lands/article33885478.ece

20 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Alarm over sewerage work near Charminar||Hyderabad’s iconic landmark Charminar faces one more vibration test as the Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board is relaying the botched pipeline near the monument. “We are replacing the eight-inch pipeline with an 18-inch pipeline to take the sewerage load. The older pipeline was getting frequently blocked leading to flooding in the area,” said a HMWSSB official supervising the work near the Laad Bazaar stretch. The sewerage line has been repaired a few months earlier on the south-western side of the monument due to water stagnation problem. The civic body has deployed an earthmover-powered pneumatic drill to tear the cobblestone flooring and the six-inch reinforced concrete base to reach the old pipeline buried five feet below ground. When the pipeline was laid earlier, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) raised an alarm over the proximity of the earthen work to the stone-and-limestone Charminar built nearly 430 years ago. The ASI officials said the seepage from pipeline and capillary action of limestone will prove disastrous for the long-term structural stability of the monument. ‘To clear blockage’ “We are doing it over a 240-metre stretch that will begin at the Charminar PS and end near Moti Galli. The older pipeline was getting blocked and we had to clean it every three days. With the new 450-mm pipeline the problem will be solved,” said a Water Board official. The Charminar PS is yards from the base of Charminar. “The permission for the work has been secured by the civic body to carry out the work,” said the official setting a one-month deadline for finishing the work. When contacted, ASI officials said they were unaware of the work near the nationally protected monument and the nature of permission secured by the civic body. The pipeline work has again upended the business of shopkeepers at Laad Bazaar. “There is no planning. They finished the work during Deepavali 2019. We have to suffer losses again as visitors don’t like to walk in these conditions,” said Inayatullah, who runs a cloth store in the area. “We used to dangle our feet and sit in the shop. They have laid so many layers of road that now the shop and the road level are the same,” the shopkeeper said. “The vibration from the drill can be felt even nearly 20 feet away. This will pose a threat to not just Charminar but also the Shahi Jilu Khana Kaman which is in a dilapidated condition due to neglect and encroachments,” said Sibghat Khan, an architecture student. According to a study, a pneumatic drill creates a mean of 116 decibel (dB) and peak of 130 dB noise levels that matches the effect of a jet taking off from an aircraft carrier. What such constant noise and vibration can do to a 430-year-old monument is anybody’s guess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/alarm-over-sewerage-work-near-charminar/article33885369.ece
20 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||PIL petition over ‘landgrab’ withdrawn||Unable to answer queries raised by the High Court, a PIL petitioner withdrew his petition which sought an inquiry into alleged grabbing of government lands by some private persons on Hyderabad outskirts. The petition was filed by Panjala Suresh Goud of Bibinagar of Yadadri Bhongir district stating that seven private persons were illegally occupying government lands. He wanted the court to save Army people, farmers and innocent persons from the hands of those land grabbers by ordering for an inquiry into the issue. When the petitioner’s counsel Rapolu Bhaskar began presenting his contentions, Chief Justice Hima Kohli asked him how can it be a public interest litigation when relief was being sought against specific private individuals. “It becomes a personal interest litigation” if one targets specific persons by filing a PIL plea, the CJ observed. Replying to a query from the bench, counsel said the petitioner was a victim of the seven respondents. It cannot be a PIL petition in that case, the CJ observed. Struggling to explain the petitioner’s status on that point, counsel sought a week’s time assuring that he would present satisfactory reply afterwards. The CJ made it clear to lawyer Bhaskar that the court would be compelled to impose costs on the petitioner if he had filed the plea in the backdrop of having and disputes with the respondents. The plea would be valid if he had no disputes with the respondents and espoused the cause of others suffering in their hands, the bench said. Counsel tried to explain that 1,500 acres of government land was being illegally occupied and several people were suffering in their hands. However, the CJ insisted to know if the petitioner was directly or indirectly had any disputes with the respondents. “Don’t go around the bush. You are expecting roving and fishing inquiry by the court,” the CJ remarked. She observed that if any persons were aggrieved by the action of the respondents, they could approach the court concerned and seek a solution. Finally, the bench dismissed the plea as lawyer Bhaskar withdrew the plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pil-petition-over-landgrab-withdrawn/article33885379.ece

But, the low prevalence — of immune-escape ‘E484K’ mutation and the ‘N501Y’ mutation with higher transmission rate — could also be simply because not enough sequencing has been done. “More coronavirus genomes need to be sequenced across the country to accurately identify the emergence of these two and any other new variants,” asserted CSIR-CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra on Friday. CCMB scientists led by Dr. Mishra, having genome sequenced over 5,000 coronavirus variants so far, have also found that a few novel variants are spreading more in some states. “We now have emerging evidence that ‘N440K’ is spreading a lot more in southern states. Closer surveillance is needed to understand its spread properly. Accurate and timely detection of new variants that may show greater infectivity or worse clinical symptoms, including immune escape, will be important to preempt disastrous consequences,” he said. The CCMB director and his team consisting of Surabhi Srivastava, Sofia Banu, Priya Singh, Divya Tej Sowpati have just published a paper titled ‘SARS-CoV-2 genomics – an Indian perspective on sequencing viral variants’, presenting an exhaustive analysis of the coronavirus variants and how they have evolved over the course of the pandemic in the country. Variants discovered In this paper, the scientists explain how different coronavirus variants gained prevalence and one of the variants ‘A3i’ had mutations that were predicted to make its spread slower. It was overtaken by the globally prevalent ‘A2a’ variant, carrying the ‘D614G’ mutation, by June 2020. The ‘A2a’ variant has remained in global dominance for the major part of last year. This paper documents the spike mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2, showcasing the ones that have emerged with high prevalence, which have implications in COVID-19 surveillance and management, vaccines, therapeutics, and the emergence of reinfections. “We need to have a focused approach towards monitoring the virus mutations. India has not been sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates to full capacity, having deposited only about 6,400 genomes so far. The Indian government’s initiative of INSACOG, which aims to sequence 5% of all positive cases, should soon address this,” observed co-corresponding author Divya Tej Sowpati.  The takeaway of this comprehensive work is that due to the natural process of mutation, variants will keep emerging. Hence, the best way to control the potential damage is to exercise extensive genome surveillance and take measures to prevent the spread of new variants as and when detected. “While vaccines may be very helpful, the social vaccine of face masks, hand-hygiene and physical distance is the most effective weapon we have against this pandemic,” adds Dr. Mishra. “Lesser spread of the virus also decreases the scope for emergence and accumulation of harmful mutants,” pointed out lead author Surabhi Srivastava.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/enhanced-genome-studies-can-check-new-mutations/article33885364.ece
20 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS fight in MLC elections may be limited||In the continuation of the election season in Telangana, six erstwhile big districts will see yet another fight between the ruling party and the opposition through the Graduate MLC polls for two constituencies. However, the fight by the ruling party is likely to be limited to the Nalgonda-Khammam-Warangal Graduates constituency as the party doesn’t seem to be in the mood to nominate its candidate for the Hyderabad-Mahabubnagar-Rangareddy constituency so far for political reasons. The Nalgonda-Khammam-Warangal seat will witness a tough fight between Rythu Bandhu Samiti chairman and sitting TRS candidate Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, and Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) candidate Prof. M. Kodandaram though Congress nominee and former MLC Ramulu Naik and BJP candidate G. Premender Reddy are also prominent candidates. Several Independents are also in the fray and noted names among them include Naveen, also known as Teenmar Mallanna and Rani Rudrama Devi. Vijaya Saradhi Reddy, backed by the Communist parties, is also trying his luck. The elections assume significance as voters see Mr. Rajeshwar Reddy as a representative of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao given his proximity to him. He is way ahead of others in campaigning and touring the constituency for the last six months. The entry of Mr. Kodandaram has given a momentum to the campaign as he is seen as a symbol of anti-KCR groups in Telangana. P. Srisail Reddy, member of the TJS Political Affairs Committee, says voters are convinced that only Prof. Kodandaram can fight the TRS. “So, we have a head-start here and will end up winning as youngsters are fed up with the TRS government,” he claims. There is likely to be a division in votes as all the Independent candidates have influence among some sections apart from the BJP that is expecting huge support, particularly among the first-time voters. Ramulu Naik is depending on voters from his community apart from the traditional Congress supporters. This division is what TRS wants to cash in on. “We have substantial base in these districts with the MLAs and Ministers having a sway over the region,” says a senior TRS leader. Going by the high voltage campaign of the TRS, it looks like the ruling party doesn’t want Prof. Kodandaram to win at any cost as it would be seen as a negative vote against the Chief Minister. Lacking intensity Comparatively, the Hyderabad-Mahabubnagar-Rangareddy constituency lacks the intensity in the fight with the ruling TRS not so keen on the contest. Luck has not been in its favour here despite winning several elections across the State. So far, the TRS has not shown any intentions either to select a candidate though names of young leaders like Marri Rajashekhar Reddy, former Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan and Varkatam Jagannath Reddy cropped up. Interestingly, TRS has 36 MLAs covering this Graduate constituency. Mr. Rajashekhar Reddy, considered close to TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao, has been active in the party despite his narrow defeat to A. Revanth Reddy of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections from Malkajgiri constituency. He was keen on the contest given his wide connections through his educational institutions. Mr. Jagannath Reddy from Makthal too had been claiming the nomination after he joined from the BJP. Whether the absence of TRS benefit BJP candidate and sitting MLC N. Ramchander Rao or the Congress candidate G. Chinna Reddy is to be seen. Another top contender is former MLC K. Nageshwar, who represented the constituency earlier. The TRS is likely to extend its support to him, sources say, though unofficially.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ruling-partys-fight-in-mlc-elections-may-be-restricted/article33885390.ece
20 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sudden showers take capital by surprise||A sudden spell of rain enveloped several parts of the city on Friday evening, in a repeat of Thursday night’s occurrence. The temperature, which remained relatively low since morning on Friday, suddenly plummeted towards 4.30-5 p.m., sending the city into shivering paroxysms. Within no time, the skies opened up, and unexpected downpour caught the citizens unawares, sending them scurrying for cover. Roads were flooded and vehicles were stranded, giving commuters a difficult time. Several locations in Charminar, Malakpet, L.B.Nagar, Amberpet, Goshamahal, Jubilee Hills, Secunderabad, Malkajgiri, Kapra, and Khairatabad circles saw showers of varying intensities for about half an hour. Charminar received the highest rainfall at 11.5 mm, while areas such as L.B.Nagar, Karwan, Mehdipatnam, and Malakpet received about 10 mm of rain. Malkajgiri received about 9 mm, followed by Secunderabad at 7 mm. Sudden showers had swept southern and eastern parts of the city on Thursday night too, starting around 11.30 p.m. to 12 a.m. Areas such as L.B.Nagar and Saroornagar received around 16 mm of rain while Karwan, Santhosh Nagar, Hayatnagar, Malakpet, Goshamahal, and other areas recorded 10 to 13 mm of rainfall within about half hour. The Met department has attributed the sudden rain spell to the upper air circulation in north coastal Andhra Pradesh and surrounding areas, at a height of 1.5 to 3.1 km. Dry weather is predicted for the coming two days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sudden-rain-takes-city-by-surprise/article33885371.ece
20 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Full quantum PFC loan likely by March-end||The State power utilities are hopeful of receiving the full quantum of the sanctioned loan from the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) before the end of the financial year. The PFC has sanctioned Rs. 14,868 crore for the current fiscal, of which Rs. 10,395 crore has been released till the end of the third quarter ending December 31. The State, however, did not receive the full quantum of the sanctioned loan amount since the last four years, barring 2018-19. According to available information, the releases to Telangana were Rs. 8,367 crore against the sanctioned Rs. 15,991 crore in 2017-18 and Rs. 14,313 crore was released in 2019-20 against the sanctioned loan of Rs. 21,506 crore. The year 2018-19 however, saw release of Rs. 16,742 crore, more than Rs. 2,500 crore higher than the sanctioned amount of Rs. 14,229 crore. The State is among the top beneficiaries of the PFC in the form of loans accounting to almost 20% of the total loans sanctioned by the corporation during the period. Officials attributed the delays in release of loan amounts to the long gestation periods of the projects taken up in the State spanning four to five years. “Since projects have long gestation periods, releases will be made accordingly depending on claims submitted on progress of ongoing works,” a senior official told The Hindu . Moreover, the loans were not restricted to major projects like Yadadri and funds were being raised for certain components of Kaleshwaram project too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/full-quantum-pfc-loan-likely-by-march-end/article33885382.ece

Accused Shyam Bheem Rao Solanki (22), who gained acquaintance with the boy’s parents after promising them a job in Mumbai, was arrested and remanded to judicial custody. Police said on February 7, Solanki and Bhogiram met the boy’s parents and stayed with them at Nampally railway station. The next day, they shifted to the footpath of Gandhi Bhavan metro station when Solanki lured the boy with chocolates and abducted him when his parents went to a hotel in search of work. They had migrated from Bidar in Karnataka in search of livelihood. When the parents returned, their two daughters informed that the boy went with Solani and had not returned. When they questioned Bhogiram, he expressed ignorance, Joint Commissioner of Police (Central Zone) P. Viswa Prasad said on Friday. “They started looking for the boy, but in vain. The next day, they approached Abids Road police and lodged a complaint,” he said. Based on their complaint, a case was registered and teams were formed to rescue the boy. Mr. Viswa Prasad said Solanki, with the boy in tow, boarded Danapur Express from Secunderabad railway station and got down at Sevagram in Maharashtra. “The teams analysed footage from hundreds of CCTV cameras from Gandhi Bhavan Metro Station, Afzalgunj to Malegaon town” Mr. Viswa Prasad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kidnapped-infant-rescued-from-maharashtra/article33885386.ece

Demanding the statue at the same spot, BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar and other leaders addressed a large gathering to mark Shivaji’s birth anniversary. They expressed their strong resolve to go ahead with the installation and name the place `Shivaji Chowk’. The meeting was organised by BJP, Bajrang Dal, Viswa Hindu Parishad, Shiv Sena, Hindu Vahini and Goraksha Samiti. Mr. Sanjay criticised the State government for not organising the Shivaji Jayanti officially and alleged that the fear of losing votes of one community is the reason behind it. A ‘Maha Harati’ was also held as part of the Shivaji birth anniversary there. Former minister M. Babu Mohan and other leaders of BJP and Bajrang Dal were present on the occasion. The BJP State president said they would not fear the TRS Government in the State and would install the Shivaji statue in the area soon. “We will install Shivaji statues in every locality in Telangana in the coming days. Opposing installation of a statue of a patriot is uncalled for,” Mr. Sanjay said and sought to know would the government given permission only to install Babar’s statues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bharatiya-janata-party-demands-reinstallation-of-shivaji-statue/article33885380.ece

Uttam Kumar Reddy has asked the party cadre to focus on winning both the MLC seats of Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda and Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahabubnagar Graduates constituencies. Exuding confidence that both the candidates, Ramulu Naik and G. Chinna Reddy, will win the elections given their clean image, Mr. Reddy reminded that they were the true warriors of the Telangana movement. He was speaking at a review meeting with leaders of TPCC, DCC, Assembly, Town and Mandal office bearers of the party through a video conference. Congress candidates — former minister G. Chinna Reddy (Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahabubnagar) and ex-MLC Ramulu Naik (Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda) — also participated in the review meeting. He said that present MLCs Palla Rajeshwar Reddy of TRS and Ramchandar Rao of BJP did nothing for their Graduates’ constituencies during the last six years. They miserably failed to represent their constituents, especially employees, professionals and jobless youth. He said Rajeshwar Reddy, who is re-contesting from Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda constituency, utilised his post to turn his educational institutions into a university. The TPCC chief then directed party leaders to convince voters that only Congress candidates could represent their problems in an aggressive and fruitful manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-should-win-both-mlc-seats-uttam/article33885393.ece

20 February 2021||KHAN JAMALPUR,TELANGANA||A temple ‘constructed’ by Shivaji on inter-state border||It was about three kilometres from the Mumbai National Highway about 70 kilometres from the district headquarters of Sangareddy. Although the village is near the highway bordering Karnataka, development has not touched the village. Green lush fields are visible on the outskirts of the village. Adjacent to the fields stand an old temple with Goddess Tulja Bhavani. It was stated that though the temple was constructed in about 1,000 yards, the premises of the temple was in about four acres. A huge trench with rock formation on either side was visible around the premises. At some places it collapsed/ dismantled and covered with sand and mud. The temple was constructed with black stone and locals claim that the stone was not locally available. They say that such stone was available only in Maharashtra and it might have been brought from there. “Our elders used to tell us that the temple was constructed by Shivaji Maharaj when he fought with Moghuls. It was stated he had constructed this temple of Tulja Bhavani to offer special prayers and as a hideout as he used to wage gorilla war, which he was famous for. We were also informed by forefathers that the temple was constructed well before the construction of Tulja Bhavani temple in Maharashtra,” said Jaipal Reddy, a villager. The temple is also having a rock structured well with water at a depth of about 15 metres. The villagers used the water for their fields in the past. Exactly, opposite that temple was constructed one more temple, smaller in size, in which statue of a warrior with sword in hand was installed. The villagers said that it was the statue of Shivaji Maharaj. However, none on the village is able to tell exactly who constructed these temples and when. The villagers collected donations and restored the temple as the temple reached a dilapidated stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-temple-constructed-by-shivaji-on-inter-state-border/article33885511.ece

He decided to marry off his daughter Samreen Begum a few months ago. He owns some 2.37 acres of land and his wife Banu Bi owned 1.3 acres. When they tried to sell the land to meet the marriage expenses, they could not sell it as it was shown in Part B of revenue records and that they are Wakf lands. Worried by the delay in performing marriage and the hurdles in selling their land, Banu Bi passed away about one-and-a-half month ago. “She died due to the mental agony,” Mr. Osman Ali lamented. The case of Kaukunti Anveerappa is not much different. Mr. Anveerappa also belongs to the same village and his family owns some 42 acres of land. Even they could not sell their lands to meet emergency expenditures for the same reason as Mr. Osman Ali. The villagers say that for past two years family functions, including marriages, in some 10 families in the village were either postponed or cancelled as they are unable to sell their lands. “I bought these lands in 2004 and got it registered. Many people in the village have been able to sell and buy land and get it registered in their name. We did not face any problems till 2018. During the exercise of purification of land records taken up by the State government our lands were shifted to Part B and shown as Wakf land and since then our problems began as no transactions are allowed on Part B lands,” Mr. Osman Ali explained. “We have made several rounds of Tahslidar’s office, RDO’s office and Collectorate to get our problem addressed. But, our repeated appeals have failed. Some 140 families are affected. We have presented our case before Revenue Court and now before the Special Court. But our problem has not been resolved,” Mr. Anveerappa told The Hindu . Though a delegation of Congress leaders, led by CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, held a meeting in the village to highlight the issue, they have failed to do get the authorities to move. “During purification of land records, these lands were mentioned in Part B and the villagers are suffering for the past two years unable to sell their lands. The case is pending with Special Court and a judgment is expected shortly,” said a revenue official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ban-on-land-sale-holds-up-marriages/article33885512.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Into a darker zone||The best thing about Netflix’s first Telugu anthology film, which has four directors tapping into power dynamics in relationships, is the varied shades of its women — victims of abuse, power hungry, driven by envy… When they take control of a situation and steer things around, you get a social commentary, besides the complexities of relationships. Some stories work, others fall short. Ramula: The orchid garland Tharun Bhascker’s Ramula is a dark comedy that makes us laugh aloud while being aware of the harsh reality of a situation. In rural Telangana, Ram Chander (Naveen Kumar Betiganti) tells his lady love Ramula (Saanve Megghana) that it’s all over. “Brakkapp!” (break up), he yells, oblivious to her tears, and our laughs. A politician’s son, he thinks he’s stylish and confuses lust and love. We see Ramula’s feistiness and vulnerability, juxtaposed with the duality of Swaroopa (Lakshmi Manchu), a politician seething at the treatment meted out to her in the political world governed by men. When the two women cross paths, their body languages indicate how things can take a turn. And yet, it shakes us up. Meera: The mind games Nandini Reddy shows us what she can do when she moves away from family dramas. Her Meera (Amala Paul) is a ravishingly beautiful mother of two, carrying her third child, wedded to a wealthy, older man. The bungalow is a witness to the sinister happenings in Meera’s life.  Meera deserves a deeper discussion in the way it addresses insecurities in marriage as well as the yearning of a young woman, perhaps at a later date when revealing plot points wouldn’t be spoilers. xLife: Into the future This film is a make-believe possibility of a dystopian world in the near future. The nerdy-looking Sanjith Hegde playing the founder of xLife can get on our nerves easily. He cares a damn about the lesser mortals on whom he has a control over, with the help of sophisticated virtual reality. Shruti Haasan is the damsel in distress in a set up from which not just she, even viewers, feel trapped. Pinky: Remnants of the past Sankalp Reddy’s film is a relationship drama involving two couples. One wants to be loved, another struggles to shake off the past… and some more. Instead of a linear story that clearly outlines the relationship dynamics, Sankalp chooses the trickier path of slowly revealing how the four characters are tied up against each other. Eesha, Satyadev, Srinivas Avasarala and Ashima Narwal try and do their best but the film itself feels incomplete.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||What it takes to turn the tables||First time director Vijay Kanakamedala wants us to pause and pay attention to a fictional story inspired by several real-life incidents. What happens when someone is falsely accused of murder and driven to the edge by police brutality? This brings up memories of the Tamil film Visaranai but more importantly, of true incidents of police brutality that made headlines. Vijay doesn’t stop there. He throws light on the possibility of the victim taking the perpetrator to task using IPC Section 211.  Naandhi captures the journey of Surya Prakash (Allari Naresh) as he is systematically broken down by police officer Kishore (Harish Uttaman) but despite all that’s stacked against him, holds on to some hope, with resilience. The film does a balance between being cerebral and mainstream friendly. Naandhi marks the arrival of Vijay Kanakamedala as a director with promise and reinforces how good an actor Naresh is. This will go down as one of his career-best performances.

The Congress aims to collect at least 50 lakh ‘gamosas’ with anti-CAA messages and names of donors to be displayed at the memorial it has promised to build after coming to power in Assam. “I demand a complete rollback of CAA as a responsible citizen,” said Mukul Chandra Saikia, a former RSS member and educationist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ex-rss-man-joins-drive-for-anti-caa-memorial/article33885358.ece
20 February 2021||JAIPUR,||Farm laws are against middle class, says Pilot||Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Friday said the Centre’s agriculture sector laws were not just anti-farmer, but were also against the middle class and the youth. The farmers agitating against the statutes were not begging but fighting for their rights as an important segment in the democratic set-up, he said. Mr. Pilot, along with 15 Congress MLAs, addressed a huge farmers’ rally organised in Kotkhawda area of Chaksu tehsil, near Jaipur, with a call for immediate repeal of the controversial laws. The legislators included Niwai MLA Prashant Bairwa, who had extended support to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the political crisis in July last year. The rally, organised by Chaksu MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, sent across the message of Mr. Pilot’s political influence with the presence of thousands of people of the region dominated by Dalit, Jat and Meena communities. Large cut-outs of Mr. Pilot and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi were put up at the venue. Mr. Pilot, who was sacked as Deputy Chief Minister during the turmoil created by his rebellion, said his party would compel the BJP-led government at the Centre to withdraw the farm laws. A three-point resolution passed on the occasion demanded repeal of the legislations, enactment of a law to ensure minimum support prices for crops and the rollback of the hike in fuel prices. This was first major rally of farmers organised after the recent visit of Mr. Gandhi to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farm-laws-are-against-middle-class-says-pilot/article33885354.ece

A “salt train”, which transported salt from the pans to a nearby refinery, will also be restarted. Chief Secretary Niranjan Arya said here on Friday that the Sambhar Lake, which formed part of the desert circuit in the Centre’s Swadesh Darshan Scheme, had an immense potential for tourism. In addition to the migratory birds, the natural process of salt getting deposited in the lake could be displayed to the tourists, he said.  Protection of birds New destinations around the lake, including salt museum, caravan park, bicycle track and gardens, are set to attract a large number of tourists to the region. Mr. Arya said a constant monitoring for protection of migratory birds would be ensured at the lake, where the mass death of birds had occurred in 2019 because of avian botulism. The illegal salt production in the lake will be stopped through action against unauthorised borewells and pipelines laid in the region, while encroachments on the land will be removed with the help of police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/new-tourist-points-to-be-identified-at-sambhar-lake/article33885352.ece

Hemant Nagrale, Maharashtra Director General of Police, said, “After investigation in the case, it was found that there was criminal negligence on the part of two nurses, Shubhangi Sathavane and Smita Ambildhuke. Further investigations are on.” The nurses have been charged under Section 304(2) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. The complaint was filed by Sub-divisional police officer Arun Waykar from Sakoli. The babies, aged between one and three months, died due to suffocation after smoke engulfed the building. Investigation found that the two accused were not seated at the nurses’ station, but outside the unit. Vasant Jadhav, Bhandara Superintendent of Police, said, “Both nurses have approached the court for anticipatory bail.

20 February 2021||Pune,||6,112 fresh cases in Maharashtra||In its highest single-day jump since December last year, Maharashtra reported 6,112 new COVID-19 cases on Friday. The Health Department said no new virus strains were detected in the samples tested from Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara districts. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope and ministers Bacchu Kadu and Rajendra Shingne are among the latest to test positive for the virus. With the latest spike, the State’s active case tally stands at 44,765 and total case tally at 20,87,632. Mumbai city, along with Pune, Nagpur and Amravati districts, recorded the maximum cases, contributing to nearly 40% of the surge. Forty-four fatalities pushed the total death toll to 51,713. With just 2,159 patients discharged in the last 24 hours, the cumulative recoveries stand at 19,89,963. The State’s recovery rate has dipped to 95.32%, and the case fatality rate is 2.48%. “Of 1,55,88,324 laboratory samples tested thus far, 20,87,632 (with the case positivity rate down to 13.39%) have returned positive, with over 67,000 samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate. Four samples each from Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara have been tested so far at Pune’s B.J. Medical College. “According to the test report, no change has been found in the virus in these districts like the new strain found in Britain, South Africa or Brazil. Twelve samples from Pune have also been tested and no change in genetic sequence has been found,” Dr. Awate said. Authorities said further investigations were under way and more samples from Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal districts have been sent to the National Institute of Virology and the National Institute of Cell Science in Pune for genetic testing. A detailed report is expected by next week. In its highest case surge in over two months, Pune reported more than 1,000 new cases to take its total case tally to 3,98,407. A single death was reported as the death toll reached 8,020. However, as per district authorities, the toll has crossed 9,150, while the active case tally has crossed 5,300. 823 cases in Mumbai Mumbai reported 823 cases, taking its total case tally to 3,17,310, of which 5,162 are active. Five fatalities saw the city’s death toll reach 11,437. Amid the surge, Mayor Kishori Pednekar quashed rumours of the city going under a strict lockdown.

Mr. Thackeray was speaking during the 391st birth anniversary celebrations of the Maratha warrior king at his birthplace, Fort Shivneri in Pune. He said, “We should take inspiration from Chhatrapati Shivaji’s life and exhibit the same determination in combating the pandemic.” Mr. Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar offered floral tributes to the busts of the king and his mother Jijabai. The CM said people need to adhere to COVID-19 regulations amid a surge in cases. “Shivaji fought battles to establish ‘Swaraj’. We are fighting a battle against the novel coronavirus and our only shield is the face mask. We must not forget that,” Mr. Thackeray said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/face-mask-only-shield-against-covid-19-cm/article33884933.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. ready for talks on Iran deal||The Biden administration has said that it will participate in talks with Iran with a view to reinstate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the ‘Iran nuclear deal’, which has been unravelling since the U.S.’s departure from the deal in 2018. “The United States would accept an invitation from the European Union high representative to attend a meeting of the P5+1 and Iran to discuss a diplomatic way forward on Iran’s nuclear program,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday. In 2018, Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the JCPOA, an agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, which lifted longstanding international sanctions against Iran in exchange for Tehran scuttling its nuclear programme. The U.S. had reinstated ramped up sanctions against Iran as part of what it called a ‘maximum pressure campaign’, after leaving the deal. Also on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterparts from the U.K., France and Germany (’the E3’) that the U.S. is prepared to talk to Iran and was prepared to re-enter the JCPOA if Iran also returned to compliance with it. “The Ministers affirmed strong interest in continuing their consultations and coordination, including with China and Russia, on this key security issue, recognising the role of the High Representative of the European Union as Coordinator of the Joint Commission,” a joint statement released after the meeting read. The Biden administration sent a letter to the UN Security Council withdrawing letters from the Trump administration that had attempted to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran via a ‘snapback’ process (the Trump move was not recognised by other members of the then Security Council). Travel restrictions within the U.S. on Iran’s UN diplomats were also eased, a State Department official told reporters on a briefing call on Thursday. “So essentially, returning to the status quo of the last few years before the last administration,” the official said. Iran has threatened to partially stop International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections next week if other parties to the JCPOA do not meet their commitments under the deal — a move the West cautioned against. “The E3 and the United States are united in underlining the dangerous nature of a decision to limit IAEA access, and urge Iran to consider the consequences of such grave action, particularly at this time of renewed diplomatic opportunity,” the statement from Thursday’s Ministers’ meeting said. “We are the ones who have kept this agreement alive in recent years, and now it’s about supporting the United States in taking the road back into the agreement,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters in Paris, according to the Associated Press. “The measures that have been taken in Tehran and may be taken in the coming days are anything but helpful. They endanger the Americans’ path back into this agreement. The more pressure that is exerted, the more politically difficult it will be to find a solution,” he said. Talks between the West and Tehran have not been announced as of this writing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-ready-for-talks-on-iran-deal/article33884667.ece
20 February 2021||MULLAITIVU,||Northern Tamils sceptical ahead of ‘another Geneva session’||In the nearly 12 years since her husband surrendered to the Sri Lankan Army, E. Sumathra has seen many sessions of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva come and go. Half a dozen resolutions on Sri Lanka have been adopted since, but she is no closer to finding out where he is. Ahead of the 46th session of the Council beginning next week, the Sri Lankan government, Tamil polity, civil society, and diaspora groups are frantically lobbying member countries, hoping for different outcomes. But Ms. Sumathra is not waiting with bated breath. “We are used like trophies every time, and nothing that comes out of these sessions alters our reality,” she says. She was seated at a concrete shelter by the sea, shining in a lavish blue-green shade under the afternoon sun, last weekend. Along with her are groups of women, from both the Tamil and Muslim community residing in the district, all gathered for a campaign on caring better for the environment. “Families of forcibly disappeared persons have been agitating since the war ended [in 2009], but some of our politicians and diaspora organisations have split our struggle. Today, we are all in different groups with no prospect for truth or justice,” says the 36-year-old. So far, none of the past UN resolutions or governmental mechanisms has delivered a convincing outcome for many like her. Although the UN human rights chief, in her latest Sri Lanka report, called for an International Criminal Court probe into alleged war crimes committed by different warring actors, as well as sanctions, Ms. Sumathra is unable to feel hopeful. The new, likely contested, resolution in the coming session is “just another” one, in her view. Sri Lanka’s long civil war played out across the Tamil-majority north and east, but Mullaitivu bore the brunt of its gruesome end. According to UN estimates, some 40,000 civilians were trapped and killed in the final battle between the armed forces and the separatist LTTE, at the Nandikadal lagoon here in May 2009. The Rajapaksa administration in power then and now — except from 2015 to 2019 — has repeatedly denied the number of civilian casualties, deeming it an “exaggeration”. The numbers may be contested, but survivors’ suffering is hard to miss, following death and destruction all around. Districts in the former war zone are among the poorest in the country. Neither appropriate development, nor adequate jobs have come their way. Mullaitivu district remains militarised, with even traffic checkpoints run by armed military men. Domestic mechanism Months after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected President in late 2019, Sri Lanka said it would withdraw from the existing UN resolution on post-war accountability and reconciliation. It has instead proposed a domestic mechanism that Tamils have even less faith in, compared to international ones. “If you look at the Tamil people here, we did not get a solution through the armed struggle that lasted 30 years. We have not got a solution in the decade after that, either. Meanwhile, our people are struggling in poverty, as livelihoods are destroyed and the youth are jobless,” says Ganeswaran Selvamani, a counsellor who has worked with war-affected families. In addition to coping with the trauma of the past, they face “enormous hardships” today, she says, referring to numerous conflicts over land — some of it still held by the military — destruction of old Hindu temples based on “archaeological” claims, growing concerns of narcotics penetrating villages, and a rise in teen marriages and pregnancies. “The worst of all the problems are in Mullaitivu, maybe that is why even the coronavirus fears us, we have that level of immunity,” Ms. Selvamani says, barely hiding her sarcasm. Women, at the forefront of protests to reclaim land, demanding answers about their missing loved ones, or against predatory microfinance-induced debt, have an especially hard time, with nothing but their resilience to count on. “I don’t know if anyone speaks of women’s problems in Geneva. The continuous assault on our livelihoods is affecting women disproportionately,” says Prasanna Sujatha, a pre-school teacher, speaking of families in which women are sole earners. The going has never been easy, but the heightened fear after the Rajapaksas’ return to power is stark. It is in this climate that thousands of Tamil-speaking people recently took out a mass rally from Pothuvil in the eastern Ampara district to Polihandy in Jaffna (titled ‘P2P’), demanding the rights of Tamil and Muslim minorities. Some in Mullaittivu are agnostic about the outcome of the march but see it as a necessary assertion of the minorities’ rights. “When our basic right to bury our dead is refused, I feel even more for Tamils who have suffered so much during and after the war. The rally has made me hopeful about the two minority communities coming together,” says M. Jenusa, an activist. There is “no other way to take on majoritarianism,” says a history teacher, asking not to be named. “Whether it was the rally or this Geneva session, it is about retaining what little we have. We don’t expect major gains,” he says. Few people in the district seem dewy-eyed about the Human Rights Council delivering big outcomes or lasting solutions. But with the space for negotiation shrinking further within the country, they see no other option. Considering the geopolitical interests that dominate such forums, they realise that any positive outcome is more incidental than intentional. “Whether Geneva delivers or not, people are certain that this government will not. That is why we pursue international mechanisms despite all the limitations,” says Shanthi Sriskantharajah, a former MP from the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/northern-tamils-sceptical-ahead-of-another-geneva-session/article33884679.ece
20 February 2021||London,||Biden vows action on climate at G7 debut||Joe Biden makes his presidential debut at the G7 on Friday as America’s partners re-focus their collective heft on pandemic recovery and climate change after the psychodramas of the Trump era. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, this year’s chair of the club of wealthy nations, will convene the virtual talks at 1400 GMT, vowing to free up any surplus coronavirus vaccines for poorer countries at a future date. White House officials said Mr. Biden would pledge $4 billion (€4.6 billion) in U.S. aid to the UN’s Covax programme to buy vaccines for global distribution. The European Union plans to double its own Covax funding to €1 billion, an EU source said. But French President Emmanuel Macron demanded richer nations go further by transferring 3-5% of their existing stock to Africa. “It’s an unprecedented acceleration of global inequality and it’s politically unsustainable too because it’s paving the way for a war of influence over vaccines,” he told the Financial Times, as Russia and China step up free or low-cost distribution of their own jabs. British junior foreign minister James Cleverly said the government’s “first duty is to protect our own people”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-vows-action-on-climate-at-g7-debut/article33884670.ece
20 February 2021||Washington,||Transatlantic alliance is back, says Biden||President Joe Biden declared the “transatlantic alliance is back” on Friday in a powerful speech seeking to reestablish the U.S. as leader of the West against what he called a global assault on democracy. The address to the annual Munich Security Conference — held by video link — dovetailed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s welcoming of a return to “multi-lateralism” after the confrontational years of Mr. Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump.  “I’m sending a clear message to the world: America is back. The transatlantic alliance is back,” he said from the White House. “The United States is determined, determined to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, earn back our position of trusted leadership,” he said.  Mr. Biden said he was not seeking a return to “the rigid blocs of the Cold War”, but warned about the threats posed by Russia and China. “The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponises corruption to try and undermine our system of governance,” he said. Similarly, U.S. partners should stand together against “the Chinese government’s economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/transatlantic-alliance-is-back-says-biden/article33885230.ece

News of her death came as police and soldiers arrested about 50 people in the northern town of Myitkyina, a human rights activist said, after breaking up a procession carrying banners of detained government leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, who had just turned 20, had been on life support since being taken to hospital on February 9, after she was hit by what doctors said a live bullet at a protest in the capital, Naypyitaw.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||When the mountains had a meltdown||The Rishiganga river looks like an idyllic brook from the balcony of Gyan Singh Rana’s two-storey house. The former headman of the village of Raini, who is in his nineties, has a stunning panoramic view of cliffs, glaciers, mountains, and the two Himalayan rivers — the Rishiganga and the Dhauliganga. In all these years of gazing at this view, Rana says he has seen the river flood from glacier melt only thrice. “But I’ve never seen anything of this sort,” he says referring to the avalanche of February 7 in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand that he watched in disbelief. “It was a blast, like something exploded in the mountains around me, and unlike the sound of big rocks of ice crashing.” Pushpa, another resident of the village, was tending to her cattle when the disaster struck. “I really thought I’d die,” she says. “There was a huge cloud of dust. For a long time, I couldn’t see anything. I was suddenly knocked off my feet by the wind. I somehow got up and untied the cattle.” The residents of Raini number less than 300, according to the 2011 Census. They aren’t strangers to the vagaries of glaciers. Ranjit Singh Rana, the village headman and Gyan Singh Rana’s son, says villagers in the region frequently go to the forests that are part of the Nandadevi Biosphere Reserve, home to some of the most imposing glaciers in the Himalayas. “We go there to collect herbs for cooking. From there we can see icy peaks. They break, they grow, they recede and sometimes flood. But the recent event was simply extraordinary,” he says. The sentiment is the same among all the villagers: they are familiar with the mountains and their moods and they have seen tragedies before, but the Sunday landslide that killed 62, smashed two hydroelectric power plants, and swept away everything in its wake have them shaken and worried. After the 2013 floods in the State, this tragedy has once again put the spotlight on the model of development in the fragile region, where the environment may not be able to sustain massive projects of development, as scientists have warned time and again. A trail of destruction On that fateful Sunday, a mass of rock, around half a kilometre wide according to satellite-based estimates, detached from a hanging glacier on a mountain called Raunthi. This massive lump fell vertically for about two km and then pulverised into a large cloud of dust and debris. Within minutes, a mix of ice, stone, sand and water coalesced into an estimated 25 million cubic metres of slurry, rolled down the Raunthi stream, and slammed into the Rishiganga river. Part of this mass of dust has dammed the Rishiganga’s natural flow. The rest hurtled down, past the Rana residence, and crashed into the Dhauliganga river that meets the Rishiganga. The force of the landslide was so great, recounts Rana, that it slammed against a cliff and travelled for a few hundred metres upstream, against gravity. Then it made a ferocious descent down to the Dhauliganga engulfing five residents of Raini village in its fury and at least 62 workers at the Tapovan-Vishnugadh hydropower plant, eight km downstream. Labourers were busy in construction work at the 520 MW power plant which was delayed by many years. When the avalanche came, it trapped several of those who were working on the barrages as well as those inside one of the tunnels used to divert the natural flow of the Dhauliganga. The Tapovan site is now a vast expanse of grey slush. Workmen are attempting a drainage on an industrial scale. The site is teeming with bulldozers, excavators and all manner of heavy machinery. The task is to unclog the mulch and debris that have blocked most of the tunnel and find survivors, if any, though hope of this has faded. It is still not clear how much of the two km tunnel has been obstructed. Ten days since the disaster, only about a tenth of it has been accessed by the machines. All the bodies that have been recovered so far are from this stretch. However, the barrages that failed to stop the onslaught of mud remain standing. Some workmen at the site point out that had it not been for the walls of the triple-gated barrage, more mud would have rolled further downstream. All that remains is a pipe Unlike in Tapovan, eight km upstream, there is simply no trace of the Rishiganga hydropower project except for a torn metal pipe. A 60-metre bridge that used to connect the two banks of the Rishiganga has been obliterated. The bridge allowed people to cross over from Tapovan onto the road that eventually snakes up to the China border. It connected two halves of the Raini village — one where the Ranas live and the other housing several residents, some of whom as children joined their parents in the iconic Chipko movement of the 1970s. Defence personnel, members of the Border Roads Organisation, and the Indo Tibetan Border Police troop down this half of the village fixing cable and communication lines. “We are sitting ducks for China,” one of them remarks. With the bridge gone, a manually operated trolley that can ferry one person at a time and requires four to strain and heave it serves as a mode of transportation. It is also being used to carry goods including vegetables, medical supplies, sanitary pads, and packaged food. The other option is to walk several kilometres down and gingerly cross a temporary bridge built by the army after the disaster. “We are hoping that a new bridge will be ready this month,” says an officer of the Border Roads Organisation. But there is less certainty on whether the Rishiganga project will surface again. The ill-fated plant The 13.2 MW Rishiganga power plant that was designed to generate electricity with the force of the Rishiganga waters had a tumultuous history. In 2011, nearly 15 years after plans to first install a power plant at the site were drawn, Rakesh Mehra, the Ludhiana-based owner of the plant, was in Raini to witness a trial run. He was killed by a falling boulder on site. Disputes then began in his extended family over control of his businesses, including of the plant. Tragedy struck again in 2016 when a flood destroyed the plant rendering it unworkable. Ultimately, the ownership of the plant passed on to the Kundan Group in 2018. “Mehra was a good man. He had developed the plant involving the villagers. There was a lot of support for the project as it was going to provide electricity to the villages in the vicinity,” says Deepak, a resident of the nearby Peng village. “But the company that took over after Mehra died was different. It expanded the project and in the process, destroyed a Kali temple that was located near the dam site.” The villagers strongly opposed what the company did. There were also disputes involving ownership of the land. “The company blocked access to our grazing pastures and did not compensate us for the use of our land,” Deepak says. “This project is cursed.” In 2019, residents of the village petitioned the Uttarakhand High Court for the environmental damage that was caused due to the use of explosives in the construction of the power projects. Silt and debris continue to cascade down the Rishiganga but other concerns loom. Teams of scientists and police personnel, who have trekked up the mountain near the vicinity of the glaciers, have identified a lake that’s about 350 m long. This, too, is Rishiganga water that has been dammed by the debris from the day of the disaster. Though the water from the lake is gradually emptying, many in the village fear it may not be quick enough before the rains. “What if the river floods and we see a gush of water along with the debris? What will happen to the villages and the dams below,” asks Ramesh Singh, a resident of Joshimath who lives uphill of Raini for a few months. “The climate here is warmer than usual. Last year, the snow was falling on the highway during February. This year has been unusually warm,” he says. The Rishiganga project was among the several hydropower projects that had applied to secure carbon credits under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in early 2012. This was when hydropower projects were seen as competitors to solar power projects. However with the enormous challenges involved in setting up hydropower plants in the Himalayan region, the risks from natural calamities, and the falling price of solar power, there are now doubts about the future of hydropower plants and their viability as an alternative to fossil fuel-based sources of energy. Development and local constraints Atul Sati is a prominent political activist based in Joshimath, the tehsil that encompasses Raini and Tapovan. Sati, who is associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), had been involved with movements for the independent statehood of Uttarakhand. He has been questioning the developmental models in the State for years. In his two-storey house that also doubles up as a workplace, there is no electricity for long stretches. In the darkness he points to a sequence of electric bulbs from a window that are from a substation of the Vishnuprayag hydropower project on the Alaknanda river downstream. “That power plant is located right here in Uttarakhand but the power it generates is for other States including Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. It is not for us. There is darkness here, the people who work for the plant are from here, but the benefits are routed out of here,” he claims. When the Uttarakhand government entered into agreements with private companies to develop power plants, it allowed them to produce and sell power to anyone. Only 12% of the power produced is to be provided compulsorily to Uttarakhand. While hydropower is the mainstay of electricity power generation in the State, Uttarakhand did not really need large hydropower projects such as the Tapovan plant, says Sati. The needs of large parts of the State can be met with smaller projects that are no more than 5 MW, he says. “The promise of carving out Uttarakhand from Uttar Pradesh was precisely that the geography and the challenges posed by the environment here are unique and so all development here must be framed respecting local constraints,” he says. Sati recounts the story of a tunnelling accident in 2009, again involving the construction of the Tapovan-Vishnugadh power project, to demonstrate how there is little accountability for excavation projects. Geologists Piyoosh Rautela of the Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre, Government of Uttarakhand, and M.P.S. Bisht of Garhwal University wrote about the same incident in a 2010 article in the scientific journal Current Science . Larsen and Toubro (L&T), the infrastructure company, employed a tunnel boring machine (TBM), a huge drilling apparatus that is used as an alternative to blasting mountains with explosives, to excavate an eight km tunnel. The head race tunnel, through which the natural flow of the river is diverted, was located in a geologically fragile area below Joshimath. On Christmas eve in 2009, the TBM, located nearly a kilometre below the ground, ended up puncturing a water-bearing aquifer about three km inward of the left bank of the Alaknanda near Shelong village. “The site was more than a kilometre below the surface, somewhere below Auli, according to the project authorities. The water discharge was reportedly between 700 and 800 litres/sec. The aquifer discharge was about 60-70 million litres daily, enough to sustain 2-3 million people,” Rautela and Bisht wrote. The caving-in after the collision damaged the TBM. In 2016, L&T washed its hands off the project and NTPC, the project developers, commissioned the Hindustan Construction Company to fix the machine. Geologists R.K. Goel and Bhawani Singh wrote in a research paper on Himalayan tunnels that the TBM was finally made operational after a second excavation tunnel was bored through. Sati said that after a brief recovery, the machine failed again. The challenge with tunnel boring in the Himalayas is that these mountains are relatively younger and have several regions that are tectonically active. “Faced with cost and time constraints, detailed investigations before selecting a tunnel alignment are often compromised, resulting in encountering disturbed geological conditions. It is essential that detailed exploration work is carried out before the start of the project and exploration ahead of the face is undertaken on a continuous basis,” they wrote in their article. Vulnerable mountains The vulnerability of the Himalayas to flash floods, landslides and earthquakes was brought home in 2013 when floods killed at least 6,000 people, destroyed hydropower projects and plunged the State into darkness for days. Following that disaster, the Supreme Court constituted a committee, led by Ravi Chopra, founder and director of the People’s Science Institute, Dehradun, to assess the role of hydroelectric projects in causing environmental degradation in the Himalayas and in causing the floods of Uttarakhand in 2013. In its April 2014 report, the committee singled out para-glacial zones (regions higher than 2,000 m from sea level) and valleys north of the Main Central Thrust (MCT), a geological fault where the Indian Plate has pushed under the Eurasian Plate along the Himalayas, as “ disaster-prone areas.” The committee recommended that hydroelectric projects not be built in these valleys. These recommendations were accepted by the Union Environment Ministry and placed before the Supreme Court in December 2014. The apex court recommended that 24 proposed projects be stayed but no decisions were taken on ongoing projects such as the Tapovan-Vishnugadh and on the Rishiganga. The committee also recommended installing a flood warning system. Chardham challenges “Last Sunday’s tragic disaster has confirmed our fears and warnings. Hundreds of crores spent in the last 7 years for constructing these dangerous dams have ended up with the loss of over 200 persons, domestic animals and destruction of national property,” Ravi Chopra wrote in a letter to the Supreme Court on February 13. This, however, was also written in the context of another ongoing project called the Char Dham Pariyojana, which is a 900-km-long road widening project connecting major pilgrimage spots in Uttarakhand. The drive from Dehradun, at the foothills of the Himalayas, up to places such as Kedarnath and Badrinath is as much replete with beautiful views of valleys, Himalayan rivers and glacial peaks as it is with swarms of JCB excavators, muck dumping sites, scaffoldings, half-erected pillars to support a future railway line, and frequent roadblocks. Large amounts of rock are being cut to widen stretches of the road. After protests by several environmental groups against the Char Dham Pariyojana construction project, which is not a single Rs. 12,000-crore project but consists of 53 small projects that are handled by separate contractors and companies, the Supreme Court constituted a committee, again headed by Chopra, to suggest measures by which the project could be executed with minimal environmental damage. There was dissent within the committee on the matter of the appropriate width of the new roads. Chopra and two other members opined that the roads be no wider than 7m of tarred surface. A majority of the committee members suggested a 12m tarred surface width. Making the roads 12m wide, argued Chopra and the two members, would result in further assault of the mountains. They said that this was also in contravention of the standing recommendations of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways that hill roads, particularly above the MCT, should not be no more than 5.5m wide. The Supreme Court is yet to take a view on the matter. “There are numerous instances where the roads have been identified by experts as being prone to destabilisation and landslides. Disaster resilience is more critical than simply wide highways. Slope stabilisation works so far have been most inadequate as evident from the frequent failures and road closures. Excessive tree-felling, indiscriminate disposal of road construction and landslides debris have endangered downhill slopes and polluted rivers,” Chopra noted in his letter. “In the case of Himalayan development we are all like the proverbial blind men identifying the elephant,” Kalachand Sain, Director, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, told The Hindu . In the aftermath of the latest disaster, five of Sain’s colleagues drove and then took a helicopter to survey the glacier to ascertain the causes of the damage. “This is a difficult terrain to study. Even today we cannot forecast an earthquake or an avalanche in the region with the required accuracy. Scientists can assess potential risks. The government must live up to its promises of providing infrastructure and services. But when something goes wrong, we all collectively suffer,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/when-the-mountains-had-a-meltdown/article33884666.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||A verdict that has ended a long silence||The acquittal of Priya Ramani, a journalist, on a complaint of criminal defamation by former Union Minister M.J. Akbar has come as a vindication to a long line of women who have not been taken seriously earlier when they have alleged sexual harassment. Many an allegation has often remained unvoiced for fear of ridicule, shaming, or on grounds of sheer financial necessity. There have also been those who feel that anything short of rape or outraging a woman’s modesty is not actionable. That long silence has now been broken by this verdict. A powerful man’s predatory past has caught up with him, when a not-so-powerful victim chose to come forward with her story and even at the risk of imprisonment, turned down suggestions of a compromise and persisted with telling her truth. The story begins in December 1993 when the very term sexual harassment was rather unknown. Ms. Ramani, then 23, was being interviewed for a job by the then 43-year-old celebrity editor, at 7 in the evening, in a five-star hotel, the Oberoi, in Mumbai. Rather than having a meeting in the lobby that she was expecting, she was surprised to be called up to the man’s room. She says, “It was more date, less interview. You offered me a drink from the mini bar (I refused, you drank vodka), we sat on a small table for two that overlooked the Queen’s Necklace (how romantic!) and you sang me old Hindi songs after inquiring after my musical preferences. You thought you were irresistible. The bed, a scary interview accompaniment, was already turned down for the night. Come sit here, you said at one point, gesturing to a tiny space near you. I’m fine, I replied with a strained smile. I escaped that night, you hired me, I worked for you for many months even though I swore I would never be in a room alone with you again.” This account from her article dated October 12, 2017 in Vogue India (https://bit.ly/3jZYWLe), did not name Mr. Akbar, who since June 2016, was a Minister of State, in the Ministry of External Affairs. However, on October 8, 2018 Ms. Ramani put out on Twitter “ I began this piece with my MJ Akbar story. Never named him because he didn’t ‘do’ anything. Lots of women have worse stories about this predator maybe they’ll share.” A media storm followed which forced Mr. Akbar to resign his position as a Minister on October 17. 2018. The next day, he filed a criminal complaint for defamation against Ms. Ramani for her article and her tweets. Defamation and the defence The law of criminal defamation is premised on a person’s right to a reputation. Making or publishing “any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person”, is criminal defamation. Mr. Akbar alleged that Ms. Ramani’s allegations, “by their very tone and tenor, are ex facie defamatory and had not only damaged the complainant’s goodwill and reputation in his social circles and on the political stage, which was established after years of toil and hard work but also had affected the personal reputation of complainant in the community, friends and colleagues, thereby caused him irreparable loss and tremendous distress.” Ms. Ramani premised her defence on the First Exception to Section 499 which postulates that “It is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it be for the public good that the imputation should be made or published.” She also relied upon the Ninth Exception which says that , “It is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another provided that the imputation be made in good faith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other person, or for the public good.” For public good, witnesses The Third Exception was also pressed into service saying: “It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion whatever respecting the conduct of any person touching any public question, and respecting his character, so far as his character appears in that conduct ....” Thus Ms. Ramani’s lawyers, led by Rebecca John, “plead[ed] truth as her defence, made in good faith, in public interest, and for public good”. They “also contended that [the] complainant is not a man of stellar and impeccable reputation and [the] accused did not defame him by publishing the tweets and article”. What seems to have turned the case is the testimony of witnesses produced by Ms. Ramani in her defence. Her friend, Niloufer Venkataraman, corroborated that Ms. Ramani had narrated the incident to her soon after it had occurred. The journalist, Ghazala Wahab, who had also worked with Mr. Akbar at a later point of time, narrated her own horrifically detailed experience of harassment by him. Relying on these witnesses, the court accepted the “defence of the accused that she disclosed the truth regarding the incident of sexual harassment against her at the Oberoi Hotel, Bombay in December 1993 on the basis of testimony of accused DW1 and its corroboration by the testimony of DW2 Niloufer Venkatraman. The Court also accepts the contention of the accused that the complainant is not a man of stellar reputation on the basis of testimony of accused DW1 and testimony of DW3 Ghazala Wahab.” The judgment has thus ruled that Ms. Ramani spoke the truth, and that Mr. Akbar had a pre-existing tarnished reputation which had been exposed for the public good. Other cases Many have wondered why the acquittal on a charge of defamation by a victim of sexual harassment is being celebrated when the alleged perpetrator has faced no criminal prosecution at all. The answer is that this judgment shines like a good deed in a naughty world when contrasted against a series of cases where the legal process has failed to bring closure and justice to women complainants. In the Mathura rape case of 1978, the Supreme Court’s acquittal of the policeman, Tukaram, earned it a stinging rebuke from legal scholars that “consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true”. A decade later, in 1988, IAS officer Rupan Deol Bajaj prosecuted Punjab’s super-policeman K.P.S. Gill, for outraging her modesty. Mr. Gill’s conviction was maintained right up to the Supreme Court but he was released on probation and suffered no imprisonment. Two years later, in 1990, S.P.S. Rathore, another senior policeman in the neighbouring State of Haryana, tried to force himself on a 14-year-old tennis player. When the girl and her family complained to the authorities, a targeted pattern of vengeance and harassment followed which lead to her death by suicide. Nevertheless, even after a prolonged uproar, in 2016, Mr. Rathore got away in the Supreme Court, with a six-month term of imprisonment already undergone, in view of his advanced age. The founder-editor of a magazine, Tarun Tejpal’s trial for an alleged digital rape, in 2013, of his subordinate in a hotel lift, is still pending trial in a court in Goa. By rarely visiting retribution upon the perpetrators, the legal process has hitherto yielded little in terms of relief to the victim. Against all odds, the sight of Ms. Ramani and Ms. Rebecca John triumphing in court may come to be a defining image in India’s long walk towards respecting female sexual autonomy. Many more women will now be emboldened to resist harassment at the workplace and elsewhere. Hopefully a few men are now deterred from trading power and position to secure sexual favours. Mr. Akbar may yet file an appeal and the wheels of justice may yet be kept grinding, but Ms. Ramani today stands tall and vindicated.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Too many IITs, unrealistic expectations||Without question, the Indian Institutes of Technology, or the IITs, are the crown jewels of Indian higher education. They are world-renowned for the quality of their graduates and for their academic programmes in a range of fields in technology and engineering — and in the past decade, in research and innovation through research parks as well. They are among the few Indian higher education institutions that do reasonably well in the global rankings. However, for the past decade or so, and according to current plans, the IIT “system” has expanded beyond its capacity to maintain its high standards and is in danger of sinking into mediocrity. The recent decision of the University Grants Commission to permit select IITs under the ‘Institutions of Eminence’ category to set up campuses abroad could further weaken these already stretched institutions. It is time to rethink the changing role and mandate of IITs in order to ensure that quality and focus are maintained — and by prioritising the needs of India, but with a 21st century twist. What the IITs are, are not The original five IITs were established in the 1950s and early 1960s (https://bit.ly/3kfq9K9). Four had a foreign collaborator: IIT Bombay (the Soviet Union), IIT Madras (Germany), IIT Kanpur (the United States), and IIT Delhi (the United Kingdom). Currently, there are 23 IITs. After setting up IIT Delhi in 1961, it took another 34 years to establish the sixth IIT in Guwahati (1994). Since then, 17 more IITs have been established, including several that resulted from upgrading existing institutions. Funded generously by the central government, the IITs focused exclusively on technology and engineering. They later added the humanities and social sciences — but these programmes were modest until the 2020 National Education Policy emphasised the IITs should focus more on “holistic and multidisciplinary education”. According to data available with the Council of Indian Institutes of Technology, the IITs are small institutions with average student enrolments in the five older IITs of around 10,000. Some of the newer ones remain quite small, with fewer than 400 students. The older IITs have faculties of around 1,000, while some of the new ones, such as those in Palakkad and Jammu, employ 100 or so. Further, most of the IITs suffer from a severe shortage of professors. For example, IIT Dhanbad is approved to hire 781 instructors but only 301 positions were filled as of January 2021. Offerings, students, faculty The IITs are not universities; they have neither the range of disciplines nor the size that characterise universities worldwide. The IITs started as undergraduate institutions; they gradually added small post-graduate programmes, but some are now adding significant post-graduate offerings. IIT-Bombay’s student enrolment, for example, was 58% post-graduate during 2019-20 (https://bit.ly/3pxUZyp). The IITs were, and are, self-consciously elite institutions aiming at the highest international academic standards — a tradition which, in our view, is important but increasingly difficult to maintain. It is not surprising that IITs graduates are so successful — the schools may be the most selective institutions in the world. Around 7,00,000 students sit for the national engineering entrance examination for the IITs and several other elite institutions each year and a vast majority of them target the 16,000-plus seats available in the 23 IITs. According to an answer provided in Lok Sabha by the Minister of Human Resource Development, in February 2020, dropout rates at the IITs are infinitesimal and declining, from 2.25% in 2015-16 to 0.68% in 2019-20. Similarly, the IITs have traditionally attracted high quality faculty, where most have doctorates from the most respected western universities. Top quality professors have been attracted to the IITs because of the quality of the students, the chance to work with the best academic minds in India, and a commitment to India’s development. While salaries do not compare well on the international market, working and living conditions on the older IIT campuses are comfortable. In recent years, however, things began to change. The IITs could not attract a sufficient number of young faculty to fill vacancies resulting from retirements. The emerging IT and related industries in India offered much more attractive salaries and exciting work opportunities, and many were lured to universities and industry in other countries. At the same time, the government dramatically expanded the number of IITs, spreading them around the country. Most of the new IITs are located in smaller towns such as Mandi (Himachal Pradesh), Palakkad (Kerala), Dharwad (Karnataka), and others. While it is important to provide educational opportunities outside the major metropolitan areas, top institutions are seldom located far away from urban amenities. There is no doubt a sufficient number of excellent students to attend all of the IITs, but there are not now, nor will there be in the future enough top-quality faculty to staff all of the new institutes, especially those in mofussil locations. Facilities and infrastructure are unlikely to be “world class.” It is, thus, inevitable that quality will decline and the “IIT brand” diluted. This would be very unfortunate for India, since the IITs are without doubt India’s most recognisable and respected academic institutions.  Another area is the lack of correlation between the local needs and IITs. Most of the IITs and other prominent “Institutes of National Importance” are ‘academic enclaves’ with little connection with their regions. Only a few State governments are effectively utilising the presence of IITs in the local milieu through knowledge sharing networks involving universities, colleges and schools, and local industries and firms. Similarly, there are few community outreach programmes. Such an approach could prevent disruption, such as that occurring in Goa, where local groups are resisting locating a new IIT in their region. What needs to be done While excellent engineering/STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) institutions are needed, they all do not have to be IITs. Perhaps 10 to 12 “real” IITs located near major cities are practical for India. Some of the newly established institutes can be renamed and provided with sufficient resources to produce high quality graduates and good research. A more limited “IIT system” needs to be funded at “world class” levels and staffed by “world class” faculty, perhaps with some recruited from top universities internationally. Recent decision to liberalise the recruitment rules to attract more foreign faculty is a good step in the right direction. Further, the IITs need to pay attention to internationalisation beyond sending their brightest graduates abroad and recruiting Indians with foreign PhDs; starting overseas branches is a bad idea, but in-depth collaboration with the best global universities, and hiring foreign faculty, perhaps as visiting scholars, would yield excellent results, and further build the IITs international brand. IIT Bombay-Monash Research Academy, and University of Queensland-IIT Delhi Academy of Research (UQIDAR), are promising examples. The IITs need robust policies to attract international students. And, of course, adequate and sustained funding is mandatory — both from government and from the philanthropy of tremendously successful IIT graduates at home and abroad. It would be tragic for India’s “jewel in the academic crown” to be diminished. And overexpansion will inevitably mean exactly that. Philip G.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Defamation as crime||Some judicial verdicts acquire emblematic significance far beyond the outcome of a particular case. The acquittal of journalist Priya Ramani of the charge of defaming M.J. Akbar, a former Union Minister, journalist and author, has protected and preserved the space for women who have found their voice in recent times to speak out about their experience of sexual harassment in the workplace. A conviction in this case would have had disastrous consequences for the many courageous women who have come out with disturbing revelations about the extent to which a large number of professions and fields in the country have been unsafe. Be it the media, as in this case, or any other domain, the reality that many women suffer in silence in the face of harassment, especially in the early stages of their career, has been brought to the fore by the new-found space and freedom to share their experiences, even if it be after many years. Mr. Akbar’s case was rooted in the claim that he had a ‘stellar reputation’ as a highly respected journalist and an accomplished writer. However, the court found the testimony of Ms. Ramani and Ghazala Wahab, another journalist who testified in her defence, to be credible and detailed enough to question the reputation that he was so strenuously trying to uphold. A welcome feature of the judgment is that the court was receptive to the defence that Ms. Ramani’s claims were true and made for the public good. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ravindra Kumar Pandey, has placed the case in the correct perspective by noting that a woman cannot be punished for criminal defamation when she raises her voice against sexual harassment because “the right of reputation cannot be protected at the cost of the right of life and dignity of [the] woman”. He has taken note of the unequal equations of power between the harasser and victim in most situations. Given that it may result in loss of dignity and self-confidence at that time, the court underscored that “a woman has a right to put her grievance at any platform of her choice and even after decades”. It may appear to be a sweeping statement that opens up the possibility of incidents from the distant past to be raked up, to the detriment of anyone’s reputation. However, the court places it in the context of the need for women to have freedom, equality, equal opportunity and social protection, if they were to excel in an atmosphere in which their workforce participation is undesirably low. In this backdrop, it is unfortunate that criminal defamation still survives in the statute book, thanks to a 2016 Supreme Court verdict upholding it. A criminal prosecution is quicker and less expensive, making it a handy tool to silence one’s critics and detractors. The time may have come to decriminalise defamation so that those who suffer injury to their reputation are left only with a civil remedy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/defamation-as-crime/article33884654.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Formula failure||Sometimes, a defeat is more significant than a victory. The ruling Congress party’s emphatic win in the recent civic elections in Punjab is amplified by the poor performance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its former ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The results will inevitably be read as an outcome of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. The Centre’s new farm laws, and its attitude towards the farmers who have been protesting for months against the laws, were prominently raised by the Congress against the BJP during the canvassing. The BJP tried to defend the farm laws but its leaders and workers faced heavy backlash on the ground, and it is clear that the party failed to convince the voters. The Congress, which may be on the back foot for unkept election promises of 2017, could find popular approval largely due to the support it extended to the farmers. The BJP’s oldest alliance partner, the Shiromani Akali Dal’s decision to end its coalition with the National Democratic Alliance amid the farmers’ protests was an attempt to regain its alienated voter base. The result, however, makes it clear that it may not be an easy task ahead of the Assembly elections, due in early 2022, for the BJP or SAD. And the political ripples of the farm agitation are spreading beyond Punjab. The Centre’s hope that the agitating farmers will disperse out of fatigue, and in the face of police measures, appears to have been too optimistic. The Delhi police miserably failed to prevent violence by certain farmer groups on Republic Day and later started haunting civil society activists on flimsy grounds. Criminalising dissent has been a familiar component of the BJP toolkit, but the endurance of that strategy is on test as political costs accrue for the party. The Jannayak Janta Party, which counts the Jat community as its support base, and the BJP share power in Haryana after bitterly fighting each other in elections; in western Uttar Pradesh, a sharp polarisation on religious lines had brought sections of the community closer to the party in recent years. The BJP raised a new band of leaders from the community based entirely on vituperative communal rhetoric. With the farming community now turning against the BJP, and even reaching out to Muslims, the formulaic toolkit of cow and communalism has been interrupted. The BJP called a meeting of Jat leaders in Delhi to mend the situation. If the situation continues, the BJP could face reverses in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election. It will be able to recover lost ground only by being more accommodative to the livelihood concerns of the Jat community and not by heightening the polarising rhetoric.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/formula-failure/article33884655.ece
20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. said to likely file appeal against Cairn arbitration award||The Centre is likely to file an appeal against the $1.4 billion international arbitration award won by Cairn Energy in a tax dispute, even as the issue did not figure during two-days of talks the Finance Secretary held with the company officials to look for a resolution, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Soon after the second meeting in as many days between Cairn CEO Simon Thomson and Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey ended, a person informed of the development said the government intends to defend its sovereign right in taxation and will file an appeal against an international tribunal ordering India to return $1.4 billion to the British firm. Cairn remained tight-lipped on the parleys it has initiated with an aim to avert having to take legal recourse to recover the amount including through seizure of Indian assets overseas. “Constructive dialogue is continuing,” Mr. Thomson said after the meeting on Friday. He did not elaborate. Cairn has indicated it could seize overseas assets such as aircraft and ships if New Delhi fails to comply with the arbitration award and return the value of the shares sold, dividend seized and tax refund withheld by the income tax department to recover part of the tax demand it had raised using retrospective legislation. The first person said the government, however, has kept open the possibility of a resolution within Indian laws. The options include Cairn opting for the Vivad se Vishwas scheme, which gives relief on interest and penalty if the principal tax demand is paid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-said-to-likely-file-appeal-against-cairn-arbitration-award/article33884646.ece
20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘New PSE policy envisages at most 4 strategic-sector firms’||The new public sector enterprises policy envisages that the strategic sectors have limited number of players restricting it to maximum four public sector enterprises of a holding nature, a top official said on Friday. Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) Secretary Sailesh said the remaining enterprises would be rationalised in terms of mergers, amalgamations and privatisation if feasible. As part of the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that there would be a maximum of four public sector companies in strategic sectors, and state-owned firms in other segments would eventually be privatised. The DPE Secretary was addressing a webinar organised by PHDCCI. Mr. Sailesh said, “We need to build our capabilities and emphasise our domestic production for global and domestic outreach at a globally competitive cost. “We need to ensure that the desired results are achieved in the collaborative effect of the private sector to enhance wealth, improve R&D, and growth of the economy,” he added. The Secretary also said that with the announcements of the new PSU policy, the government wished to have a strong and impactful public sector in a strategic sector. “MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) have the potential in the sectors such as defence, infrastructure, manufacturing, power, petroleum, coal, mining, ports, airports, and many more, which will help to create better running of government assets,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/new-pse-policy-envisages-at-most-4-strategic-sector-firms/article33884649.ece
20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Developing global framework can help build trust in tech’||Facebook India’s vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan on Friday pitched for developing a global framework, with India taking the lead, to help build and sustain people’s trust in technology. He, however, added that the move towards rules and regulations should be in a way not to stifle innovation. “The very fact that the Internet means that you’re connecting people from around the world, means that as we think about the governance framework…it will be helpful if India takes the leadership role,” Mr. Mohan said. He was speaking at the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum 2021. Kris Gopalakrishnana, chairman, Axilor Ventures and co-founder of Infosys, said the trust in technology is more important than ever, especially for disadvantaged sections “Digital Divide has widened, and lots of people have not been able to work or earn a living because of lack of access... We need a framework for the ecosystem to look at how we increase trust in technology.” Roopa Kudva, partner and MD, Omidyar Network India, said that trust was really the backbone of digital economy. When individuals trust the Internet, they would participate more freely, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/developing-global-framework-can-help-build-trust-in-tech/article33884636.ece
20 February 2021||Washington,||Indian IT workers to benefit from U.S. immigration bill||In a major move that will benefit thousands of Indian IT professionals in America, the Biden administration has introduced an immigration bill in Congress, which, among other things, proposes to eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based green cards. The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 proposes a pathway to citizenship to 11 million undocumented workers, elimination of per-country quota for employment-based green cards and work authorisation for dependents of H-1B foreign workers. The bicameral immigration bill, if passed by both the chambers of the Congress — House of Representatives and the Senate — and signed into law by the President, would bring citizenship to millions of foreign nationals, including undocumented workers and those who came to the country legally. Those waiting for a green card for more than 10 years would get the legal permanent residency immediately as they would be exempted from the visa cap. Indian IT professionals waiting for more than a decade now, and whose number runs into thousands, are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries . Authors of the bill, Senator Bob Menendez and Congresswoman Linda Sanchez, said the bill establishes a vision of immigration reform that is expansive and inclusive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/indian-it-workers-to-benefit-from-us-immigration-bill/article33884640.ece

The Swedish firm has bought a 47,833 sq. m. plot in Noida, U.P., for Rs. 850 crore for developing an IKEA-anchored retail destination. “Ingka Centres has today taken its first step to expand into India with a major land acquisition in India,” the company said in a statement. “The total volume of investment into the project is planned to be close to Rs. 5,500 crore [over €600 million]. The development is expected to create more jobs, support infrastructure development and growth of the organised retail and home-furnishings sector in the region.” A tweet from the official handle of the Noida Authority CEO said the investment would happen over the next seven years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ikea-operator-ingka-to-invest-rs-5500-cr-in-india/article33884638.ece

20 February 2021||Bengaluru,||The domestic grind resumes||The ICC T20 World Cup and the race to book a World Test Championship final spot are the highlights of India’s 2021 men’s cricket calendar. The one-day format is low on the totem pole, evidenced by the fact that the Indian team will feature in only six ODIs for the rest of the year (three against England next month, and three against South Africa in September). In these circumstances, the Vijay Hazare Trophy dips in significance. The BCCI opted to hold the 50-over tournament in preference to the Ranji Trophy in this truncated domestic season. As a result, the Ranji Trophy will not be held for the first time since its inception in 1934. The 38-team Vijay Hazare Trophy, which commences on Saturday, does offer one immediate reward. Outstanding performances could lead to a national team berth for the ODIs against England. The teams are split into six groups — six each in the Groups A to E, and eight in the Plate Group. The Elite Group matches will be held in Surat, Indore, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Kolkata, while the Plate Group fixtures will take place in Chennai.  Defending champion Karnataka, missing the services of K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Manish Pandey and K. Gowtham, faces a tough task in Group C. The side has a new skipper in R. Samarth, who has taken over from Karun Nair. Tamil Nadu, led by Dinesh Karthik, will fancy its chances after having won the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy a few weeks ago. Batsman Shahrukh Khan, who was signed by Punjab Kings for Rs. 5.25 crore at the IPL auction on Thursday, will hope to find big runs. Left-arm pacer T. Natarajan will miss the action, having been rested to stay fresh for the upcoming limited-over matches against England. Shreyas Iyer, who sat out of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy due to a shoulder injury, will lead Mumbai, while Prithvi Shaw will serve as his deputy.  Southpaw Shikhar Dhawan is a familiar face in the Delhi squad. Former India Under-19 World Cup-winning captain Unmukt Chand returns to represent Delhi after spending a season with Uttarakhand. All-rounder Krunal Pandya, who had to leave the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy bio-bubble due to the demise of his father, is back to lead Baroda. The likes of Chetan Sakariya (Saurashtra), Lukman Meriwala (Baroda), Mohammed Azharuddeen (Kerala) and Sheldon Jackson (Puducherry) — uncapped players who found favour at the IPL auction — will hope to add to their growing white-ball reputation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-domestic-grind-resumes/article33884788.ece
20 February 2021||Melbourne,||Medvedev cruises past Tsitsipas, meets Djokovic||Russia’s Daniil Medvedev overpowered Stefanos Tsitsipas on Friday to make his first Australian Open final, where he will bid to stop World No. 1 Novak Djokovic from clinching an unprecedented ninth title. The fourth seed proved far too strong for Greece’s Tsitsipas, crushing him 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 in front of more than 7,000 noisy fans at Rod Laver Arena to extend his win streak to 20. Unbeaten run The 25-year-old, ultra-confident on the back of his unbeaten run, which includes three titles, has been knocking on the door of Grand Slam success for some time, but is yet to win a title. To finally get over the line, on Sunday he must beat top seed Djokovic, who has won all eight finals he has played at Melbourne Park. Medvedev came into the showdown boasting a 5-1 edge in their head-to-heads and a frosty relationship stemming from Shanghai in 2019, when the popular Greek blasted his slugfest playing style as “boring”. Fifth seed Tsitsipas was back on court after a stunning five-set upset of 20-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal, but it was an energy-sapping four-hour epic and he appeared to feel the effects. Finishing trouble Earlier, the second-seeded pair of Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka won the women’s doubles defeating third-seeded combine of Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic. Sabalenka, the 22-year-old from Belarus, was the dominant player on court as she and Mertens of Belgium, the U.S. Open doubles champions in 2019, combined for a 6-2, 6-3 win. Sabalenka and Mertens wasted three championship-points in the last game. But, Sabalenka forced a fourth championship-point and clinched the title when Siniakova sent a backhand wide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/medvedev-cruises-past-tsitsipas-meets-djokovic/article33884746.ece
20 February 2021||Bengaluru,||‘It’s a great honour to lead Karnataka’||Having been dropped from the Karnataka team for last season’s Vijay Hazare Trophy and the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy earlier this year, it seemed like R. Samarth’s white-ball career had hit a dead end. Out of nowhere, Samarth was back in favour, being named the Karnataka captain for the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy. The reliable, calm, opening batsman takes over from Karun Nair, who has struggled for form. Manish Pandey, another captaincy candidate, is out with an injury. Samarth is thrilled to be back in the scheme of things. “It is a great honour to lead Karnataka. Most of us have played together from our junior cricket days, so we understand each other well. “I’m looking forward to it (captaincy),” the 28-year-old said, on the eve of Karnataka’s tournament opener against Uttar Pradesh. Karnataka, the defending champion, enters the tournament without K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal (both with the Indian Test team), K. Gowtham (Indian team net bowler) and Pandey (injury). “Obviously, it is a huge boost when they are in a team. But over the past few years, most of them have been a part of the national set up and unavailable for domestic matches. “When they are available to play for Karnataka, we see it as a bonus. In their absence, we fall back on our bench strength,” Samarth said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-a-great-honour-to-lead-karnataka/article33885241.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||ATKMB outplays East Bengal||ATK Mohun Bagan cemented its position on top of the current Indian Super League by convincingly outplaying its traditional rival SC East Bengal 3-1 at the Fatorda Stadium on Friday. Mohun Bagan tallied 39 points from 18 outings to take another step closer to claiming the League winner’s shield. ATKMB produced a blitz of attacks in the first quarter of the action pinning East Bengal back to defending for a great part. The Mariners utilised the early advantage to garner the lead which came off its most prolific striker Roy Krishna in the 15th minute. The Fijian forward showed his class latching on to a long 60-yard pass from his defensive colleague Tiri, who floated the ball from the Mohun Bagan box, and produced a fantastic solo finishing. 13th goal This was Krishna’s 13th goal of the tournament which definitely helped Mohun Bagan position itself for another successful finishing. East Bengal tried to regroup with its mercurial forward Bright Enobakhare producing some magic in the middle of the park. The Nigerian was spectacular with his skills on a few occasions but that could not provide the reward East Bengal was looking for. Equaliser East Bengal managed the equaliser in the 41st minute but it was Bagan defender Tiri who nodded his attempted clearance on a long throw from Raju Gaekwad into his own goal. Bagan, which beat East Bengal 2-0 in the first phase, unleashed its true self after the break as it relaunched its bid to regain the lead. Bagan kept mounting the pressure on East Bengal with a multi-pronged onslaught and the latter’s defence yielded to the pressure in the 72nd minute. David Williams produced the finish when Krishna set him up with a nice assist on top of the East Bengal box. Bagan took the match past East Bengal’s reach in the 89th minute when Krishna came in the provider’s role once again to help substitute Javi Hernandez nod home a spectacular goal.  The result:   ATK Mohun Bagan 3 (Roy Krishna 15, David Williams 72, Javi Hernandez 89) bt SC East Bengal (Tiri 41-og).

20 February 2021||CHANDIGARH,||No clear favourite for title: Sharath||“This year, there is no clear favourite (for the National title). No one knows how well others are playing.” These words from nine-time champion Sharath Kamal aptly summed up the scenario on the eve of the National table tennis championship on Friday.  Looking leaner and fitter due to his training regimen in the last 11 months, Sharath said he was ready to chase a 10th title in the championship that has remained very special to him. Speaking to The Hindu at the Tau Devi Lal Indoor Stadium, Panchkula, Sharath said, “Playing for the National title is different from any other title. Over the years, I have enjoyed the challenges. Apart from the younger players coming for autographs, photographs and tips to improve their game, I think my presence helped the sport in a small measure. “But this year, I don’t consider myself as the favourite. G. Sathiyan (seeded two) is hungry to win his first, Harmeet Desai is keen to retain the title, comeback-man Soumyajit Ghosh wants to prove a point and the young brigade, led by Manav Thakkar, is determined to make the most of this platform. So expect some very good contests,” he said. Testing ground With this championship providing the testing ground for members of the Indian squad bound for Doha to play four important tournaments, the players are sure to give off their best. The squad comprising Sharath, Sathiyan, Harmeet, A. Amalraj, Manika Batra, Sutirtha Mukherjee, Reeth Rishya and Archana Kamath will take part in the WTT Contenders (March 3-6), WTT Star Contenders (March 8-13), World Singles (March 14-17) and Asian Olympic Qualifiers (March 18-20). As things stand, Indians look almost certain to seal two Olympic spots each section by March 20. Even if they fall short of making the ‘cut’ in the qualifying events, the high world rankings of Sharath (32nd), Sathiyan (37th) and Manika (63rd) could play a role in helping them to qualify. Sharath also hopes to make the Olympic mixed doubles draw in the company of Manika Batra. “We have a good chance and we assess our prospects in Doha,” said Sharath who, along with Manika, claimed the bronze in the 2018 Asian Games.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-clear-favourite-for-title-sharath/article33884652.ece
20 February 2021||Chennai,||‘Profitable day for CSK’||Chennai Super Kings CEO K.S. Viswanathan is pleased with the way Thursday’s auction panned out. He told The Hindu on Friday, “We had certain goals and we fulfilled them. I am happy. The franchise is happy.” Both boxes ticked Going into the auction, CSK needed two off-spinning all-rounders one international and one domestic, and Viswanathan said both the boxes were ticked. He said, “Glenn Maxwell’s name came first. We went up to Rs. 14 crore for him. But then we stopped because we needed money for a domestic off-spinning all-rounder.” Then Moeen Ali’s name came up and after a hectic round of bidding CSK bought the English all-rounder for Rs. 7 crore. “We had only one overseas slot and Moeen fitted our requirements. He is a good striker of the ball and is flexible with his batting order. And then he is a capable off-spinner,” said Viswanathan. The CSK CEO said he always knew K. Gowtham was going to be an expensive buy. “Our captain M.S. Dhoni had given us the names of Gowtham [first] and Jalaj Saxena as domestic off-spinners. Gowtham’s name came first. We went all out for him because we needed such a cricketer.” Viswanathan added, “Yes, we paid Rs. 9.25 crore for Gowtham. But now we have the flexibility of having one international and one domestic off-spinning all-rounder. We could play either one of them according to the team’s requirement.”  Talking about CSK’s surprise buy of Cheteshwar Pujara, Viswanathan said, “It was out of respect for his contribution for India. He is such a committed performer. And we believe someone who is so technically sound can adapt to any format.” Tamil Nadu’s promising opener C. Hari Nishanth was roped in by CSK at his base price of Rs. 20 lakh. Overall, Viswanathan said it was a profitable day for CSK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/profitable-day-for-csk/article33885300.ece
20 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Football coach Fousiya passes away||With the untimely death of M. Fousiya, Kerala has lost one of its finest football coaches and Kozhikode a smiling presence at the city’s sports events. Her long battle with cancer came to an end early on Friday morning. She was 51. Few women have dedicated their lives to football the way Fousiya has and fewer have done as selflessly. Passion for the sport She single-handedly created a successful football team at the GVHS School at Nadakkavu and produced Indian and State players. She did that out of passion. She rarely was recognised for her work. She never had a regular job, and that had worried her. She, however, didn't allow her disappointments to come in the way of identifying fresh talent in women’s football. The game has come a long way in Kerala since the time she had struggled to get girls interested in the game. Today, the city is home to the Indian Women's League champion. Something like that was what she would have hoped for when she decided to coach young girls nearly two decades ago. She had spoken of her dreams to The Hindu way back in 2012. To take up sport as a carer wasn't easy for a girl coming from a conservative family. But, she persevered. She never got the recognition she deserved, though.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/football-coach-fousiya-passes-away/article33884938.ece
20 February 2021||BERLIN,||Man United and Tottenham win big||Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United took a big step toward the last 16 of the Europa League with a 4-0 “away” win over Real Sociedad. The first leg was played in Turin on Thursday, one of a number of games relocated away from their original venues. Portugal’s Benfica had to host Arsenal in Rome, where Bukayo Saka’s away goal put the Premier League side in a good position with a 1-1 draw. Tottenham defeated Austrian team Wolfsberg 4-1 in Budapest while Villarreal beat Salzburg 2-0. Hoffenheim forward Munas Dabbur scored two goals, set up another, and then missed a penalty before Molde came back from two goals down to draw 3-3. Flying high Fernandes had Sociedad’s defence to thank for his first goal in the 27th, when two defenders collided with their own goalkeeper, leaving him free to score into an empty net. He then finished off a quick counterattack to make it 2-0 in the 57th. Fernandes let Marcus Rashford’s pass go behind him to Daniel James, then received the ball back and fired inside the right post. Rashford added the third in 64th and James completed the scoring. Gareth Bale reminded his detractors of his qualities as he scored one goal and set up another for Tottenham. The Wales forward, back at Tottenham on loan from Real Madrid to the end of the season, cut the ball back for Son Heung-min to open the scoring in the 13th, before he illustrated why Madrid paid Tottenham a record transfer fee for his services in 2013. Bale outpaced Jonathan Scherzer to reach it, then stopped to leave the Wolfsberg defender sprawling, before curling a powerful shot past goalkeeper Alexander Kofler with his left boot.  The results (last 32, first legs):   Dynamo Kiev 1 (Buyalskiy 62) drew with Club Brugge 1 (Mechele 67); Olympiakos 4 (Bouchalakis 9, M’Vila 37, El Arabi 45+2, Masouras 83) bt PSV Eindhoven 2 (Zahavi 14, 40); Young Boys 4 (Fassnacht 3, Siebatcheu 19, 89, Meschack 44) bt Bayer Leverkusen 3 (Schick 49, 52, Diaby 68).

Wolfsberg 1 (Liendl 55-pen) lost to Tottenham Hotspur 4 (Son 13, Bale 28, Lucas 34, Vinicius 88); Lille 1 (Weah 72) lost to Ajax 2 (Tadic 87-pen, Brobbey 89); Maccabi Tel Aviv 0 lost to Shakhtar Donetsk 2 (Alan Patrick 31, Tete 90+3).   Granada 2 (Herrera 19, Kenedy 21) bt Napoli 0; Molde 3 (Ellingsen 41, Ulland-Andersen 71, Fofana 75) drew with Hoffenheim 3 (Dabbur 8, 28, Baumgartner 45+4); Salzburg 0 lost to Villarreal 2 (Alcacer 41, Nino 71); Antwerp 3 (Avenatti 45, Refaelov 45+8, Hongla 66) lost to Rangers 4 (Aribo 38, Barisic 59-pen, 90-pen, Kent 83); Benfica 1 (Pizzi 55-pen) drew with Arsenal 1 (Saka 57).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/man-united-and-tottenham-win-big/article33884789.ece

20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||AITA president assures best support||The president of the All India Tennis Association (AITA), Anil Jain, assured 100% support from the national federation and pleaded the players to give their 100%, in an interaction with them at the end of the High Performance training camp for girls at the DLTA Complex here on Friday. Unable to join the players at the venue owing to other commitments, the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, Anil Jain said, “You are the future of the country. Only you can put Indian tennis on the world stage”. To find solution Explaining that the national federation was planning to set up the National tennis centre and support about 30 players, the AITA president said that every effort would be made to address all the problems of Indian tennis and find solutions. Commending Ankita Raina’s doubles triumph in a WTA event in Melbourne earlier in the day, Anil Jain told the girls in a virtual meeting, “you can be like Ankita and Sania Mirza. You can go further ahead”. The intense training over a fortnight was followed by a tournament on a league-cum- knockout basis, in which Akanksha Nitture beat Jagmeet Kaur 6-3, 6-3 in the final. The national coach Zeeshan Ali congratulated the players for their effort and announced that the champion would get a wild card entry into the main draw in one of the ITF women’s tournaments scheduled in March. Thanking coaches Summing up the experience on behalf of the players, Reshma Maruri, who beat Kashish Bhatia for the third place, thanked the coaches Zeeshan, Namita Bal and Shivika Burman. “We lost Akhtar Ali, a great legend. But, Zeeshan sir came back quickly for the camp. We are grateful for his commitment and devotion,” said Reshma, lauding Akhtar’s son Zeeshan. All the players and coaches were unanimous in their appreciation of physio Anand Dubey for taking good care of the players. On behalf of the AITA, the CEO Akhouri Bishwadeep hoped that the national federation would be able to generate more resources in the near future, to provide the best possible support for the players through the national tennis centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aita-president-assures-best-support/article33884886.ece
20 February 2021||CHENNAI,||TN State volleyball association stages protest||The Tamil Nadu State Volleyball Association (TNSVA) staged a protest here on Friday to highlight the “undemocratic, anti-sporting and unscrupulous attitude” of the Tamil Nadu Olympics Association (TNOA). Several representatives, including the president and secretary of various District Associations, took part in the protest. The reason for TNSVA’s protest was that TNOA hadn’t given affiliation to the State Association and had recently formed a committee to select the sub-junior boys’ and girls’ teams for the Nationals to be held at Vellore from Feb. 24 to 28. All this didn’t go down well with the TNSVA. Pon Goutham Sigamani, president, TNSVA, said: “We met N. Ramachandran (TNOA president) and requested him to give us affiliation, but nothing has moved.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tn-state-volleyball-association-stages-protest/article33885282.ece

20 February 2021||KOLKATA,||Gokulam blunts Arrows||Gokulam Kerala FC posted a convincing 4-0 win over Indian Arrows in the Hero I-League on Friday. Gokulam’s fourth victory helped it jump to fourth with 13 points from eight matches.  Gokulam’s first penalty was saved by Arrows custodian Aahaan Prakash in the 40th minute. However, it tasted success after the change of ends. Emil Benny netted the first goal off a loose ball after Sharif Mohammed’s shot was blocked by Aahaan in the 47th minute. Arrows conceded another penalty and Dennis Antwi scored from the spot three minutes later. Substitutes Lalromawia and Ronald Singh found the target towards the close. NEROCA FC kept its hopes alive for a top-six finish by recording a 2-0 victory of Sudeva Delhi FC. Judah Garcia and substitute Songpu Singsit were the scorers. NEROCA gathered eight points from as many matches to be 10th. Sudeva is eighth with nine points from eight outings.

I am so proud of us. Your fighting spirit is great,” said Ankita about her 19-year-old partner. The 28-year-old had earlier won the $125,000 WTA crown with Karman Kaur Thandi at Dubai in 2018.

The city would also be his base for the upcoming IPL, as he was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore. “I was hopeful of getting picked by one of the franchises as I had a decent Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament,” Azharuddeen told The Hindu over phone. “To play at the IPL has been a dream for me. And I am delighted that I would be playing for RCB, as the team’s captain Virat Kohli is the cricketer I admire most.” The wicketkeeper-batsman, who had attracted attention after his 54-ball 137 n.o. against Mumbai at the Mushtaq Ali tournament last month, said he also had great regard for another RCB superstar, A.B. de Villiers. “And I am glad that my Kerala teammate Sachin Baby has also been bought by RCB,” the 26-year-old said. “At the moment I am focused on the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day tournament.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dream-come-true-for-rcb-pick-azharuddeen/article33884885.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Inexplicable bhava||The Nayanmars have shown that it is possible to establish direct connection with God through bhakti, service and love to Siva. In a discourse, Sri R. Asokan drew attention to Sekkizhar’s deft portrayal of the spontaneous, unique and out-of-the world devotional experience of Kannappan Nayanar. It is clear that Sekkizhar enters Kannappan’s spirit of service and selfless bhakti when he relates this episode. Kannappan is born in the family of hunters and is known as Thinnan. He grows up imbibing the way of life of the hunters. At a young age, the mantle of headship falls on him and he rises to the occasion. Once, his hunting expedition leads him to a hill. He is hungry and thirsty and looks around for water. He sees the Lord’s image on top of the hill and is drawn to it. He is overwhelmed with emotions of love and compassion towards the Lord who is the embodiment of compassion. But to Kannappan the Lord is all alone and hungry and this thought guides his actions. As he climbs the hill, he is breathless but in his eagerness to see the Lord, he does not care about such physical discomforts. He cooks the meat, makes sure that it tastes good, before offering it to Him. Then he sees blood in one eye of the Lord and feels sad. His state of mind is focused only in giving immediate relief to God. He does not think that God who takes care of the entire creation can take care of Himself. He searches for some medicine and finding none, he decides to offer his own eye. The blood flow stops and he is elated. But he finds the other eye also has blood and this time he does not think twice and is ready to offer his other eye. It is the inexplicable bhava that makes a true devotee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/inexplicable-bhava/article33884733.ece
20 February 2021||Kuala Lumpur,||India’s football WC qualifiers postponed||India’s 2022 FIFA World Cup 2023 Asian Cup qualifying round matches, which were scheduled to be played next month, have been postponed to June due to coronavirus-related travel and quarantine restrictions. The second round of qualification matches have not been held since November 2019 due to COVID-19. In November last year, the AFC had said that the matches will be held in March and June this year without specifying the exact dates. The Asian Football Confederation announced on Friday that the majority of Asia’s 2022 World Cup qualifying matches in March will be postponed to May and June — with a few exceptions that include Japan, Australia and Saudi Arabia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indias-wc-qualifiers-postponed/article33884791.ece
20 February 2021||MUMBAI,||BCCI tweaks Vijay Hazare Trophy format||The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has accepted the objections raised by State associations and modified the qualification format for the Vijay Hazare Trophy knockouts. As a result, the winner of the Plate Group will not get a direct entry into the quarterfinals of the inter-State one-day championship, which starts on Saturday.  The Hindu understands that the Vijay Hazare Trophy will see the topper in each of the five groups qualify for the knockouts along with three other teams from the combined points table. The eighth-placed team in the rankings after the league stage will face the winner of the Plate Group in an Eliminator for a quarterfinal berth. The pre-quarterfinal is scheduled for March 7, the first day of the knockouts, the venue for which is yet to be announced. For the Mushtaq Ali Trophy, seven teams from the Elite league had qualified for the quarterfinals along with the winner of the Plate Group. This prompted State associations of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh to write to the BCCI, suggesting an alteration to the format. The associations had claimed that the Plate team results in a dilution of the knockouts, a point that has been raised by various experts as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-tweaks-format/article33884792.ece

He felt like the “loneliest guy in the world” after a string of failures with the bat. In a conversation with former England player Mark Nicholas on his ‘Not Just Cricket’ podcast, Kohli said he went through a tough phase during that particularly difficult tour. “It’s not a great feeling to wake up knowing that you won’t be able to score runs and I think all batsmen have felt that at some stage, that you are not in control of anything at all,” he said. “You just don’t understand how to get over it. That was a phase when I literally couldn’t do anything to overturn things...,” he said. Kohli remembered feeling alone despite the fact that there were supportive people in his life. He said professional help was what he needed. Mental health issues should not be overlooked as they can destroy a person’s career. Players need “Someone whom you can go to at any stage, have a conversation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-calls-for-mental-health-support/article33884743.ece

The two clubs had inked a deal last month. “We are aiming to improve our quality of football with knowledge transfer from Sevilla on training, use of technology, tactics etc.,” Manchanda said. “Travel and exchanges between the clubs are certainly possibilities. But COVID-19 has made it challenging. We have to wait and watch.” Maria Cruz said that India had become Sevilla’s “No.1 objective” among foreign projects and that the terms of the engagement with FCBU would be finalised soon. “For the short term we will do virtual clinics involving technical staff at both clubs,” he said. “By the end of March, we should have a good idea of the roadmap.” FCBU, which currently plays in the I-League second division, also announced that it would finish work on two football pitches in Whitefield, near ITPL, by the end of the year. LaLiga India managing director Jose Antonio Cachaza, who was present on the occasion, said that a LaLiga team would visit India in the near future and play an ISL team in a friendly match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fcbu-sevilla-set-to-partner-for-five-years/article33884992.ece

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||A treasure chest of food||I met Udit Maheshwari while scooping up some delicious keema with a crispy paratha at the cafeteria in Triveni a few years ago. Udit was the chef in charge there, and I remember how sublime the keema-paratha was. I am happy to know that he is still wielding his magic spatula. Udit now runs a delivery outfit called Pitaara Kitchen. And it has some delightful dishes, as I discovered last week. The menu would gladden any food lover’s heart. It has a mix of regional cuisines, and has zeroed in on some of the most loved dishes from across the country — but with a makeover. For instance, if you like gattey ki sabzi — which I do — you will be surprised to find that the gattey, a steamed lentil cake, has a soft and mildly sweet core. Udit stuffs it with some paneer and khoya , and that gives it an entirely new taste. But let’s start at the beginning. Udit and his wife Subha are the brains and hands behind Pitaara Kitchen (Ph no: 8882015225, website: pitaarakitchen.in). It is based in Chirag Dilli and delivers to places within a 10 km range. The packaging is secure and reassuring, and the food is sublime! I enjoyed not just the Govind gattey (Rs. 435) poached in a yoghurt and onion curry, but also the Keralan fish tikka (Rs 800), sole fish fried with a mix of masalas. The fish was firm and had been well coated with herbs and spices — mustard, whole coriander, black pepper, curry leaves and kasuri methi . I loved the kuku paka chicken (Rs. 580) — juicy pieces of chicken in a delightfully creamy sauce prepared with coconut milk and tomatoes, and flavoured with, among other ingredients, fennel and cardamom. Equally enjoyable was the wild mushroom stew (Rs. 420). The mushroom had soaked in the flavours of the curry, cooked with coconut milk and vinegar. His accompaniments are innovative, too. He has a Bandel cheese mini kulcha (Rs. 280): the strong cheese of Bengal is kneaded into kulcha dough, cooked in a tandoor and then served with kasundi butter and spicy tomato chutney. There are appams to go with the stews, and different kinds of breads — tandoori, Malabari parottas, bajra roti, sattu roti, pumpkin seed and green chilli pesto naan , and many more. The dish that didn’t appeal to me was the Beliraam saag meat. I found the meat too fatty and the saag over-pureed. The kale channe ke kabab may appeal to vegetarians but left me yearning for the real thing. But the Etti masala prawn (cooked with onions, dried green peppercorn and cracked black peppercorn, Rs. 520) was superb. I had that with a bacon and Kalimpong cheese mini kulcha (Rs. 470) and when I bundled up a succulent piece of prawn with the plump naan , it gave me the kind of joy that the Triveni keema-paratha did. Pitaara does have keema pao (Rs. 390) on the menu, and a host of other interesting dishes such as pulled pork samosa (Rs. 470), tamarind vegetable moilee (Rs. 320) and Bhopali chicken rezala (Rs. 600). I am not surprised that the outlet is called Pitaara. The word means a box: and this indeed is a treasure chest.

To become a street-walker? I don’t want to hear those words from your lips anymore. Just to be safe, I am going to cut out all risky words in this message and replace them with fruits and vegetables. After all, no one can accuse us of talking about fruits and vegetables. Now, do not ask brinjals (questions, child, listen properly!) Why must you know the truth? Just accept what you’re told, and keep nodding your head, good child! Go sit at your desk and study hard. Not Biology because it shows diagrams of mango and chikoo systems, so turn your eyes away. Not Chemistry too because what if they find chemical equations in your books? You could make pineapples or other combustible things? History is the worst (unless it is the re-heated version). Lies! Wars are not started by power-hungry tyrants but by ignorant youngsters like you, who demand freedom, (sorry, replace with cabbage) through protests (replace with coconuts). Don’t you dare engage in coconutting for cabbage. And treat all books with suspicion, my child. Don’t trust anyone or talk to anyone, even in private room or Zoom — anywhere. See that 22-year-old cucumber for example, environmental (one of the worst words of all) activist, apprehended for pro-potato talks (because you should not mention the ungrateful, tractor-driving growers of that tuber). Her picture is going viral with a dog. Photoshopped! A German shepherd dog too — not even made in India — made in Canada, for sure! You must shun dogs too. See how that young cucumber with the German shepherd onion is being attacked on social media. It will be you next! Talking of social media, I hope you have no accounts on that foreign platform with the blue bird. They were recently forced to block thousands of accounts of tomatoes who coconutted in support of the potatoes. I hope you are not tweeting around on that, using measuring-tape and pliers (I heard toolkits too are banned now, be careful!) Now, study hard, ask no brinjals, keep your head bowed low. Do not be like your young green leafy friends who dream of free speech as a birthright. Delusional! What will they ask for next? Their irresponsible parents’ fault! You just block your ears, eyes, mouth, conscience. Conscience is for cauliflowers only. It is a crime, isn’t it child? Child? Didn’t you hear me — why don’t you speak?

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Inside Rajasthan’s hidden studios||Avaz Mohammed claims he made the first lac button in 1968; “then everyone copied it”. The 74-year-old father of four girls, two boys, and a black cat that races around the house faster than his grandchildren with their handhelds, has worked with designer Rina Dhaka, while his son with Manish Malhotra. His designs and colourways go beyond the Jaipur market and have a contemporary appeal: a bangle with one end twisted into a snake head; a speckled choker, primary colours mixed into a black base; beads twined into balls or fashioned into barrel shapes.   Tools of the trade   “I am the seventh generation doing this work,” he says, having trained his children to take the craft forward. We sit on the floor in his home and studio near Jaipur’s Jantar Mantar as he explains the way lacquer is made: 250 grams of resin from the cheed ka ped (pine), half a kilo lac from the peepal , budh , beri (the cheapest), or kusum (the most expensive) trees, and one kilo soapstone powder. The lac itself is an insect secretion found on the tree. “A lot of what you see in the market is just resin and soapstone,” he says, as he praises his daughter, who teaches other women the trade. “Indira ji [late prime minister Indira Gandhi] came to one of my exhibitions,” he shares, showing a four-inch thick album with pictures of his work, dignitaries, and a thank you note from the Prince of Wales. The conversation traverses many areas and takes us through time. “ Abhi biryani mangva deta hoon [I’ll order some biryani now],” he says, gesturing to one of his family members who are hovering around with water, milky ‘North Indian’ coffee, sweets and mixture. The generosity of spirit is humbling. Especially when his wife, Anwar Jahan, tells me, “The lockdown was almost a year of starvation for us.” But they are not billing me for the biryani , their time or the use of their tools: the bhatti with coals to soften the sticks of lac, the wooden hatta to flatten the warm plasticine-like mixture, the patti to cut the lac. I am invited into their home, their lives, to experience the way they work, to play with the lac, creating what I want. Mohammed talks of going to Milan in 2017, with the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. “ Wahan bahut kadr karte hain craft ka [they hold craft in high regard there],” he says, remembering how the people who watched him work later used the lac disks to make oversize pendants and masks. In the Pink City, post pandemic, orders are trickling in. He is now making lac balls filled with gulal (pink colour) for Holi — a transient expression of his craft that will still bring joy to many.  Culture karma  The experience has been organised by Jaipur-based Rajasthan Studio, which works to connect craftspeople with customers — “those with passion to those with an interest”, as Kartik Gaggar, who founded the brand in January 2019, says. Currently, they do 27 experiences across Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur, with Kota and Bikaner up next, spread across craft forms like blue pottery, miniature painting, and puppet making (which is my first experience of the day). There are 103 forms of craft to be explored across the state, so Rajasthan is an obvious place to start. “We are a destination management company, where the artist is the hero,” says Gaggar, who is hoping to grow the brand pan India. The highest priced experiences, at Rs. 6,000, are m eenakari and fresco painting; some like sandalwood art are at Rs. 3,500; while many like writing on rice grains are at Rs. 2,500. Each is meant for a small group, usually no larger than four people. Gaggar believes the future of travel will be about learning, experiencing, and exploring. And with Indians being their mainstay — before the lockdown and after — it is all the more reason to put karigars and the Indian craft story in the spotlight.  Craft drive  Gaggar is a chartered accountant who has worked in consulting, and experimented with organising experiential trips within Mumbai. Later, his training in PricewaterhouseCoopers taught him processes, so he spent three-and-a-half years studying the market worldwide. The turning point that solidified his method was when he and his wife took a trip to Seattle and a rower who had won an Olympic gold showed them the city through its waterways. Back in Jaipur, where his family is from, he began documenting specific craft forms, beginning with information found on Google. “The deeper I go, the more I feel I don’t know anything,” he says, adding that in time the company aims to look at museum records and those kept by royal families. From the craftspeople he has learnt patience, making the experiences as slow as possible. “Across the world, there is no blueprint of how to sell folk art,” he says. His vision meshes with that of puppeteer Pappuji, whom I’d visited earlier — that the craftsperson does not have to stand on the street peddling his wares. As Pappujichisels the jaw of the raja puppet and smooths the edges off the face of the rani , he asks that people come to his house to buy rather than visit a shop. “ Issi se kala aage badhega [only with this will the craft grow],” says Sumitra, his wife, as she rips up a sari to make the leheriya-gota clothes of the puppets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/inside-rajasthans-hidden-studios/article33885210.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Meet me in the multiverse||As 2021 dawned, I had announced on social media that, inspired by Ms Kangana Ranaut’s tweet, my New Year resolution would be to “penetrate like X-ray into any subject”. Admittedly, I am not as intrepid as the multifarious Ms Ranaut but one can always try. And as part of my brave attempts to enact an X-ray, I am penetrating these days into the esoteric subject of parallel universes. ‘Is there another ‘you’ out there?’ a 2016 article in Forbes had asked provocatively. Ah, if they had only thought to ask us Indians. Five years on, we can emphatically say yes, there is another ‘you’, ‘me’, ‘him’, ‘her’ and ‘them’ out there. And not one alternative version, but possibly many, each with its own histories, actions and outcomes. Physicists say the multiverse is an exciting possibility, but Indians know it as an even more thrilling reality. Take Munawar Faruqui, for instance. All those silly libtards and clicktivists went on and on about why he had been arrested for a joke he did not crack. What they didn’t understand was that he was actually arrested for a joke he well might have cracked in another avatar in another universe. For that, he needed to be arrested here. This was as clear as Delhi’s air to the police but was wilfully ignored by the commentators. As far back as 2019, a former business editor had indicated these possibilities. When people had worried that a high unemployment rate meant more people without jobs, he had explained that it actually meant more people looking for jobs. You see how this works? If in India, poverty rates rise, in Atmanirbhar Bharat, it’s really a sign of “more people looking for money”. A writer mailed me some weeks ago, saying that a contact on his LinkedIn page had written a furious post asking what farmers had to do with food production when he could get all he needed in his neighbourhood supermarket. I had to agree — my in-depth research had already shown me that in the alt-verse, farmers do anything but farm. They just protest and use irrigation pumps to waste the taxpayer’s money. Only in a different world, that often features in the speeches of presidents and prime ministers, do farmers morph into annadatas . Women and sanitation workers, farmers and stand-up comics, actors and cricketers all inhabit these multiple realities. In one, they are devis , in another they get their feet washed, in a third they get raped or beaten up, in a fourth they tweet in unison about current affairs, in a fifth they are ignorant of all current affairs and “unable to comment”. Only andolan-jeevis seem to be  boringly uni-dimensional creatures. Now, I have a request for the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. Given our lawmakers have to contend with all these multiple realities, one can imagine how hard it must be to keep switching tack — to “put on a face to meet the faces that you meet,” as Eliot famously said. For example, here you are going hammer and tongs at evil anti-national farmers and embedding the streets with spikes to keep them at bay. And then one of them bursts into tears and gets the nation crying. What does one do? One responds with tears. Could the Ministry please place a tiny bottle of glycerin on all the benches in Parliament? Any lawmaker who needs to quickly get emotional should be able to do so without straining their tear ducts and our credulity. And in case there are any acting awards to be handed out, Ms Ranaut knows all about it. In a recent tweet, she sharply pointed out that instead of asking her about Oscars, one needs to ask “how many National or Padma awards Meryl Streep has”. Now the literal-minded might think a National Award is only for Indian actors, but Ms Ranaut knows that just like FIRs issued for jokes not cracked, awards can be handed out for films not made. Entering into the spirit of things, the zeitgeist if you will, I humbly insist that this column be treated as fully written and published in this and every other universe. Because if I have not written it, then the chances of my offending someone can only get proportionately higher.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||JLF at a 3D Diggi Palace||“Someone once described the Jaipur Literature Festival [JLF] as Monsoon Wedding meets the Hay Festival,” William Dalrymple tells me over a call from New Delhi. “Anyone who enjoys the Monsoon Wedding side of it — the colour, the spectacle and the crowds — will obviously miss that. But I think there have been compensations in the astonishing quality of the [300] speakers this year: Noam Chomsky, Malala Yousafzai, Joseph Stiglitz, Mark Haddon, Jonathan Safran Foer, Robert Macfarlane, Philip Pullman… for free! In the West, any one of them would be a $50 ticket,” says the writer, historian, and festival director (a title he shares with publisher Namita Gokhale). We are discussing the 14th edition of the ‘greatest literary show on Earth’ going digital. Pre-pandemic, the annual bibliophiles’ pilgrimage had seen the Pink City come alive — with hotels booked months in advance, students camping out at railway stations, and visitors scrambling between jam-packed sessions and book signings. Evenings had buzzed with performances, special tours, and exclusive dinners. But 2021 is seeing the 10-day festival exchanging the physical grounds of the Diggi Palace for a 3D rendition of it.  Lessons from television “The biggest challenge was how to capture the essence of JLF,” says Sanjoy K Roy, festival producer and managing director of Teamwork Arts, an entertainment company. For starters, they’ve tried to keep it as visual as possible. “We have the entrance of the Diggi Palace pictured on our website’s landing page. Enter it to choose between sessions on the front lawn or the Durbar Hall, and 3D renditions will show you the path [to your destination]. Once there, you will enter the screen box where the sessions happen.” While some will be recorded live — such as conversations with satirist Craig Brown and art critic Ranjit Hoskote — other sessions will be on Zoom and a few will be pre-recorded. Guests can also choose to hear applause by clicking on a button. “The idea is to give as close an experience as possible to Diggi,” adds Roy. The last few months were spent navigating the online space, and putting into practice the learnings they had taken away from the “series of digital conversations” — such as JLF Brave New World (April) — that they had organised in 2020. “[We had to tackle questions like] how do we reach people? How do we manage the algorithms that all the social media channels put out? How do we get good data from the people who visit? We’ve been able to convert all of that learning and use it for JLF, to target our audience better,” says Roy, adding that in many ways, they also went back to their roots in television “because it is really about creating hundreds of hours of programming”. What about virtual reality, which music festivals such as Burning Man had used last year? “Teamwork Arts did that for Fables of the Earth, an exhibition and sale held last August as a fundraiser for artists and artisans. But for most audiences, negotiating VR is not necessarily easy,” he says, adding that they have tried to make the festival as phone-friendly as possible, “because 70% of the audience will access JLF on their phones”. Roy is certain JLF’s future will include digital events. “I don’t think we’re getting out of the digital aspect of it. For example, on the front lawn, on an average there used to be about 14,000 people. Today, an average session has 29,000 to 32,000 people online. You can’t beat the statistics anymore.”       The Harvard class  Meanwhile, for Dalrymple, the absence of the physical — which takes away concerns of travel, accommodation and the like — has meant he’s been able to onboard speakers that he’s been trying forever to get. “Even by usual JLF standards, these are incredible names,” he says. “Just take the Harvard crew. Vincent Brown, who was the finalist in The Cundill History Prixe for his amazing book [ Tacky’s Revolt: The Story of an Atlantic Slave War ]; Michael Sandel, who probably has the highest profile of all the Harvard professors with his amazing TV presentations on law and ethics; and Michael Puett [who teaches Chinese history and anthropology], the single most popular professor at Harvard.”  From February 19-28.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The ‘Work Experience Girl’||What is it like to shoot a live-action film with the world’s most famous cat and mouse? For actor Pallavi Sharda, it was unlike anything she had worked on earlier as the film had to be shot a couple of times over to help meld the traditional-style animation with the live-action scenes. So technically, the titular characters were not even there. She cheekily jokes, “Tom and Jerry were super divas, they wouldn’t even come to set.” Looking laid-back and camera-ready during a video interview with The Hindu Weekend from her home in Melbourne, Sharda is eager for the world to watch the nostalgia-filled Tom & Jerry feature, now in theatres across India. Taking place in New York City, the film sees Sharda’s character, Preeta Mehta, and her fiancé Ben (Colin Jost, Saturday Night Live ) set to marry in a high-society spectacle. The venue, a luxury hotel, is also where the iconic cartoon frenemies have set up residence. Therefore chaos, comedy and camaraderie ensue, in equal measure. Those close to Sharda have dubbed her the ‘Work Experience Girl’. “I’ve been an ‘experience junkie’ all my life and I’m addicted to achieving what seems impossible. When you’re a performer, you’re free to get to the archetype of that emotion,” observes the actor, who has starred in films such as Hawaizaada , Begum Jaan and Besharam . For her first job, she worked in a bookstore. While she fast-tracked her university degree, she made sure she worked during every break: she even clerked as a lawyer, and was an RJ in community radio in Australia. The different roles cemented her ambition as an actor and her ‘leap of faith’ move to Mumbai. Family album In a recent interview with NDTV , Sharda, 30, revealed how her father was the “most excited” when she was cast in the live-action adaptation, for her parents (both IIT alumni) used to watch the show on a projector on campus. At the audition, she read for the wedding scene. “[I was] yelling at Ben about the fact that we are sitting on elephants. It was very easy for me to play an irritated Indian bride; we’ve all seen them or had a friend who’s been stressed in those moments,” she explains. Playing someone who is the “dignified woman of the diaspora” was important to her. “Preeta’s educated well — if you’re an immigrant family in Australia, the US or the UK, there’s a big emphasis on that.” The topic of fashion makes Sharda brighten up. For her interview, the #LovedClothesLast believer has opted for a two-piece pineapple-dotted ensemble that she has owned since 2016. For the film, a “Sabyasachi lehenga was chosen to reflect the high-society wedding look. Because Preeta is Punjabi, I ensured kaleera bangles were used. I wanted those who understood the significance to appreciate that time and effort had been put into this.” Meanwhile… Sharda has been busy right through the pandemic. As soon as the lockdowns had lifted across Australia, she took on a role in a Coronavirus comedy series, Retrograde, which was filmed in a video-conferencing style. “Though the Australian film industry is small and fewer films get made, the quality of scripting and the technicians are first rate. That’s why people love working here, myself included!” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-work-experience-girl/article33885202.ece

Pointing to our architecture, temples, festivals and spices, he makes a case for bringing grand visions to life. The second chapter of Valaya’s Bursa couture line is once again an ode to the Ottoman Empire because, as he puts it, he likes carrying forward a theme across two seasons to tell a complete story. This spring-summer line is made of lightweight organza and silk, with antiquated metals, gota, silk threads and intricate embroidery on lehengas, saris, sherwanis and blouses. Faux leather and velvet patches are engineered to fit seamlessly into the design. The campaign was styled by his 22-year-old daughter Hoorvi Valaya (an upcoming stylist and presumably future custodian of the brand) who no doubt introduced contemporary elements such as belts and a heavily detailed couture headband to the collection. And the highlight of Bursa is Emrooz (‘today’ in Persian), a bejewelled border carefully sewn into several pieces of the collection.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The OTT revolution: only getting started||Last month, Master , the Tamil behemoth starring Vijay Setupathi and Thalapathy Vijay, ended the dry spell at local cinemas, opening to houseful shows and taking back an impressive Rs. 50 crore on the first day. What went contrary to the usual script, however, was that it headed to Amazon Prime Video just two weeks later. “I think Master going to an OTT platform is the real sign of the times to come,” says film critic Baradwaj Rangan. “It is proof that a movie can do extraordinary business in theatres and move [almost immediately] to streaming.” Meanwhile, Drishyam 2 , the sequel to Mohanlal’s acclaimed 2015 crime drama, opted for a direct to digital release and is out now on Amazon Prime Video. This is significant in a country where, pre-pandemic, every film, without exception, would first go to the cinemas. Then 2020 turned things on its head. And as the country shut down, OTT in India began to come of age. Subscriptions went up — it hit 29 million last July, registering a 31% growth in just four months, according to resource centre India Brand Equity Foundation — and viewers expanded beyond millennials and metros (rural India clocked 65% of content consumption, says think tank Broadband India Forum). The ecosystem also saw the launch of portals dedicated to vernacular content, such as Aha (Telugu), Reeldrama (Assamese), Planet Marathi and LetsFlix (Marathi, Bhojpuri, etc), Koode and Neestream (Malayalam), Talkies (Tulu, Konkani and Kannada), and CityShor (Gujarati). “What we’re seeing now is the first phase of OTT growth; the pandemic just fast-tracked the conversion,” believes Ajit Thakur, CEO of Aha, which launched last February. The ‘original’ battle Today, there are over 40 OTT platforms in India. And they are wooing audiences like never before — from releasing an unprecedented number of original shows to acquiring licenses for direct-to-digital premieres, including Bollywood films such as Gulabo Sitabo , Shakuntala Devi and Coolie No 1 . At TechSparks 2020, Gaurav Gandhi, Director and Country General Manager, Amazon Prime Video India, stated that “to say OTT isn’t mainstream is incorrect. It is really, really deep; it is not a metro thing”. He added that their digital releases were watched in 4,000 cities and towns within the first week of streaming. Like me, most viewers didn’t turn to streaming just because of a lack of outdoor entertainment; good content was the draw. I cheered Sushmita Sen’s solid comeback in Aarya and Anushka Sharma striking gold with her debut web production, Paatal Lok. While crime, drama and comedy still top the charts — think Special Ops , Asur , and the Mirzapur franchise for example — the last few months have also seen a slew of refreshing surprises. Shows like Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story and the Malayalam drama The Great Indian Kitchen not only made for great couch viewing, but did so with layered storylines and fresh faces. “Some of the best storytelling in 2020 was on OTT,” says film critic and founder of the digital platform, Film Companion, Anupama Chopra. A stamp of approval for original content came in November, when Netflix’s acclaimed Delhi Crime won the International Emmy for Best Drama Series. Rise of the regional The biggest gain of the OTT boom is the rise of the vernacular. Audiencesin places like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala have always preferred to watch content in their own languages — and the trend intensified in 2020. New players are now delivering content rooted in local sensibilities. Koode, a Malayalam OTT that launched in December 2020, aims to “identify new and existing creators, set up infrastructure for them, and help them make a better product”, explains founder Radhakrishnan Ramachandran. Its 1,500 titles have touched 5,000 downloads in just two months. Across the border, in Karnataka, Regal Talkies (launched last August) wants to acquire films that never made it to the theatre owing to lack of funding or marketing expertise. “Sometimes, standard theatres require you to deposit lakhs of rupees in advance to exhibit your film [which many producers can’t afford],” says Sudhakar Mani, CEO. For others such as Pallav Parikh of Gujarati platform CityShor, it means green-lighting stories and projects that a bigger entity may not take up. “We were actually the first to release a Gujarati web series that was two hours long,” he says, while Kuheli Dasgupta, co-founder of Assamese OTT Reeldrama, adds that she hopes to help catapult regional talent that barely gets a seat at the mainstream table. Of course, multi-language platforms are stepping up too. Netflix, for example, is working towards adding more content in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. Besides getting set to release its first Telugu anthology, Pitta Kathalu, it is also following up its first Tamil film anthology, Paava Kadhaigal (2020), with Navarasa , a nine-film anthology. “With subtitles and dubs, the language barrier is lowering,” says Srishti Behl Arya, Director-International Original Film, Netflix, which launched a Hindi user interface in 2020. Meanwhile, at Amazon Prime Video, the success of Originals such as Pudham Puttu Kalai and Unpaused has reinforced their belief that “there is great appetite for well-told stories that resonate locally”, according to Gandhi, who adds, “Our direct-to-digital films in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam received close to 50% viewership from customers outside the home states, thus hugely expanding the audience base for these films.”  Betting on content While the interest in vernacular is heartening, will regional platforms be able to sustain themselves, I wonder? Going by the comments on Play Store things aren’t seamless yet — glitches while casting to TV is a common complaint. “We may not be able to compete against the financial capabilities [of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video], but we understand better how a regional film may perform on the field,” believes Mani. An example is The Great Indian Kitchen , which didn’t have any luck with the major players before making its way to Neestream. Another ace up their sleeves: having a strong audience base outside the country. The other day a friend in the UK told me that he (and all his expat Malayalee friends) had signed up for Neestream just so they could watch The Great Indian Kitchen ! One movie in, and they are searching for more local content. Anna MM Vetticad, journalist and author of The Adventures of an Intrepid Film Critic , says, “To compete with the multi-language platforms in the market, one possible strategy language-specific platforms could adopt to extend their reach beyond traditional speakers of these languages is to have a pay-per-view option to cash in on pan-India sleeper hits like The Great Indian Kitchen. Unless piracy kills them, there is no reason why well-strategised language-specific OTT platforms with sufficient quality content will not survive, considering that language-specific TV channels have survived for so long.” The availability of diverse and compelling content will have a domino effect too. “All these walls between states and industries are falling,” says Chopra. “I am as likely to watch a Malayalam or Tamil film today, as I am to watch any other and that’s very exciting for me.” So, could this also mean that content will finally reign over star power? It may be too soon for predictions, she cautions. “But star power isn’t as entrenched in OTT as it is in the movie business,” she agrees. Shows like Paatal Lok and Scam 1992 that rode on lesser-known faces are an indication of this change.

The ecosystem also saw the launch of portals dedicated to vernacular content, such as Aha (Telugu), Reeldrama (Assamese), Planet Marathi and LetsFlix (Marathi, Bhojpuri, etc), Koode and Neestream (Malayalam), Talkies (Tulu, Konkani and Kannada), and CityShor (Gujarati). “What we’re seeing now is the first phase of OTT growth; the pandemic just fast-tracked the conversion,” believes Ajit Thakur, CEO of Aha, which launched last February. The ‘original’ battle Today, there are over 40 OTT platforms in India. And they are wooing audiences like never before — from releasing an unprecedented number of original shows to acquiring licenses for direct-to-digital premieres, including Bollywood films such as Gulabo Sitabo , Shakuntala Devi and Coolie No 1 . At TechSparks 2020, Gaurav Gandhi, Director and Country General Manager, Amazon Prime Video India, stated that “to say OTT isn’t mainstream is incorrect. It is really, really deep; it is not a metro thing”. He added that their digital releases were watched in 4,000 cities and towns within the first week of streaming. Like me, most viewers didn’t turn to streaming just because of a lack of outdoor entertainment; good content was the draw. I cheered Sushmita Sen’s solid comeback in Aarya and Anushka Sharma striking gold with her debut web production, Paatal Lok. While crime, drama and comedy still top the charts — think Special Ops , Asur , and the Mirzapur franchise for example — the last few months have also seen a slew of refreshing surprises. Shows like Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story and the Malayalam drama The Great Indian Kitchen not only made for great couch viewing, but did so with layered storylines and fresh faces. “Some of the best storytelling in 2020 was on OTT,” says film critic and founder of the digital platform, Film Companion, Anupama Chopra. A stamp of approval for original content came in November, when Netflix’s acclaimed Delhi Crime won the International Emmy for Best Drama Series. Rise of the regional The biggest gain of the OTT boom is the rise of the vernacular. Audiencesin places like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala have always preferred to watch content in their own languages — and the trend intensified in 2020. New players are now delivering content rooted in local sensibilities. Koode, a Malayalam OTT that launched in December 2020, aims to “identify new and existing creators, set up infrastructure for them, and help them make a better product”, explains founder Radhakrishnan Ramachandran. Its 1,500 titles have touched 5,000 downloads in just two months. Across the border, in Karnataka, Regal Talkies (launched last August) wants to acquire films that never made it to the theatre owing to lack of funding or marketing expertise. “Sometimes, standard theatres require you to deposit lakhs of rupees in advance to exhibit your film [which many producers can’t afford],” says Sudhakar Mani, CEO. For others such as Pallav Parikh of Gujarati platform CityShor, it means green-lighting stories and projects that a bigger entity may not take up. “We were actually the first to release a Gujarati web series that was two hours long,” he says, while Kuheli Dasgupta, co-founder of Assamese OTT Reeldrama, adds that she hopes to help catapult regional talent that barely gets a seat at the mainstream table. Of course, multi-language platforms are stepping up too. Netflix, for example, is working towards adding more content in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. Besides getting set to release its first Telugu anthology, Pitta Kathalu, it is also following up its first Tamil film anthology, Paava Kadhaigal (2020), with Navarasa , a nine-film anthology. “With subtitles and dubs, the language barrier is lowering,” says Srishti Behl Arya, Director-International Original Film, Netflix, which launched a Hindi user interface in 2020. Meanwhile, at Amazon Prime Video, the success of Originals such as Pudham Puttu Kalai and Unpaused has reinforced their belief that “there is great appetite for well-told stories that resonate locally”, according to Gandhi, who adds, “Our direct-to-digital films in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam received close to 50% viewership from customers outside the home states, thus hugely expanding the audience base for these films.”  Betting on content While the interest in vernacular is heartening, will regional platforms be able to sustain themselves, I wonder? Going by the comments on Play Store things aren’t seamless yet — glitches while casting to TV is a common complaint. “We may not be able to compete against the financial capabilities [of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video], but we understand better how a regional film may perform on the field,” believes Mani. An example is The Great Indian Kitchen , which didn’t have any luck with the major players before making its way to Neestream. Another ace up their sleeves: having a strong audience base outside the country. The other day a friend in the UK told me that he (and all his expat Malayalee friends) had signed up for Neestream just so they could watch The Great Indian Kitchen ! One movie in, and they are searching for more local content. Anna MM Vetticad, journalist and author of The Adventures of an Intrepid Film Critic , says, “To compete with the multi-language platforms in the market, one possible strategy language-specific platforms could adopt to extend their reach beyond traditional speakers of these languages is to have a pay-per-view option to cash in on pan-India sleeper hits like The Great Indian Kitchen. Unless piracy kills them, there is no reason why well-strategised language-specific OTT platforms with sufficient quality content will not survive, considering that language-specific TV channels have survived for so long.” The availability of diverse and compelling content will have a domino effect too. “All these walls between states and industries are falling,” says Chopra. “I am as likely to watch a Malayalam or Tamil film today, as I am to watch any other and that’s very exciting for me.” So, could this also mean that content will finally reign over star power? It may be too soon for predictions, she cautions. “But star power isn’t as entrenched in OTT as it is in the movie business,” she agrees. Shows like Paatal Lok and Scam 1992 that rode on lesser-known faces are an indication of this change.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The economic impacts on realty||The economic contraction of 23.9% in Q1 FY’21 was among the worst in the history of independent India. The COVID-19 outbreak had shattered the economy and disturbed raw material supply chains, EXIM, and investments. The predictions for the future were grim in Q1 FY’21 and it looked like the recovery would take a few years. However, the second quarter ushered in a flush of optimism for businesses, the government, and financial markets which resulted in the contraction to reduce significantly to 7.5% in Q2 FY’21. This was better than the global average of the contraction of 12.4%, according to an analysis of 49 economies by the State Bank of India. The manufacturing Purchase Manager Index (PMI) was above 50 for the fourth consecutive month as per the data released for Q2 FY’21; the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) reached 89.2 in November 2020, only 11 points lower than pre-Covid-19 levels. Growth in other areas such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and corporate bond market inflows point to strong investor faith in the Indian economy’s resilience. Road to recovery This recovery statement has been buoyed by the Government of India’s frequent policy interventions since the outbreak of the pandemic and the lockdown in the country in March 2020. Infusion of nearly Rs. 20 lakh crore (10% of India’s GDP) through the various stimulus packages kept the economy going. Regeneration of demand by a focus on new employment schemes for the formal sector workforce also helped economic recovery. The unemployment levels are currently on a decline with an unemployment rate at 6.7% for September, lower than the pre-COVID-19 level of 7.6% in February. A 100% credit guarantee to stressed sectors and production-linked incentives to the tune of Rs. 1.46 lakh crore provided a fillip to the manufacturing sector and paved the way for long-term economic benefits. Most market experts have corrected their forecasts positively. While the Indian economy is likely to contract in FY’21, the revised data is encouraging, with a predicted growth in the range of -6.4% to -10.6%. The threat of the new strain of the virus and subsequent lockdowns, as witnessed in Europe, may alter the path of recovery if India is impacted. The resilience witnessed so far, and the efforts deployed in containing the virus and reviving the economy, may suffer. The sooner the vaccine is available and the fear of further contagion is allayed, the smoother will be the road to recovery.   Impact on the sector The office, residential and warehousing segments have already depicted signs of recovery. The second half of 2020 witnessed revival in many sectors as the pandemic induced lockdowns were relaxed in phases. The commercial office sector is expected to record a new supply of around 32 million sq.ft. and a net-absorption of 24 million. sq.ft. in 2020. The residential segment has shown a strong recovery in the second half of the year, with nearly 85,000 units launched across the top seven cities — recording a 2X growth over 1H 2020. Sales during the second half were recorded at nearly 80,400 units — almost 40% more than the 1H 2020. Despite the stress created by the pandemic, the trend of sales exceeding new launches continued in 2020 as well. The residential real estate segment seems to have bottomed out now. Logistics and warehousing have kept the nation’s economy and lifeline active during the lockdown and was critical in ensuring the supplies of essentials across the country. Demand for warehousing has been on the rise, and with many large global corporates evaluating to completely or partially shift their production base from China to India, warehousing requirements are likely to rise further. 2021 looks to be a promising year for traditional real estate asset classes including commercial office and residential, and also new-age ones such as warehousing and data centres. Coworking requirements may also rise once the vaccine is available to the larger masses. Macro growth drivers Rapid urbanisation amidst improving infrastructure has enabled India’s growth over the years. The government plans to invest nearly US$ 1.4 trillion in the next five years. This is expected to unlock the potential of many areas and new micro-markets for further economic activities, and also attract foreign investments. The major impetus provided through the stimulus packages for industrial development, particularly among the MSMEs (micro small, and medium enterprises) and the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign is expected to set the foundation of future growth. The real estate sector has already benefited from the multiple reforms introduced in the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has dampened growth, but the sector has nevertheless proved its resilience. Rising employment in the future is expected to further the demand for real estate across all asset classes. The record-low interest rates and rising per capita income have provided an affordability ratio of 26% — the lowest in the last two decades. Consolidation among developers wherein the most capable ones with a consistent track record of execution, fiscal discipline, transparency, and corporate governance, will gain the majority of the market share and thrive. The ability to scale up and adapt to the changing market forces through investments in research and advisory will help to fortify the sector in the coming years. Having said this, it remains to be seen as to how the Government tackles the vaccination of a large nation like India. 2020’s housing recovery The year 2020 was a tough and unprecedented year for the Indian residential real estate sector. However, the government appropriately stimulated the economy and the sector. Developers and other stakeholders of the Indian residential realty sector also adjusted to the changing market conditions. The year clocked 1.28 lakh unit launches for 2020, a 46% decline from 2019, and 1.38 lakh unit sales, a 47% decline from 2019. While the unsold inventory declined only 2% from the previous year, it registered a 19% decline from the previous peak of 2016. The residential market seems to have bottomed out in 2020 and is looking up for the next year. Impact on prices While business activity improved in the second half of 2020, prices remained largely stable across the top seven cities of India as compared to the previous year. Considering that Q2 CY2020 was a watershed quarter, developers were looking to make up for the lost time as the cities opened up post the lockdown imposed in March end. At this stage, the homebuyers had several properties to choose from and any price hike would have been detrimental for moving inventory. Despite nearly 85,350 units added across the top cities in H2 CY 2020, and only 80,400 units being sold in the same period, unsold inventory declined by 1% from the end of Q1 CY2020 to Q4 CY2020. Developers wisely chose to spur demand by keeping the prices range-bound in a year of crisis like none seen before. Though prices largely remained stable across these cities when compared to the previous year, developers incentivised buyers by offering discounts, freebies, and waivers due to which the sales improved post the opening up of the lockdown. The series of repo rate reductions initiated by the government also improved the loan affordability for buyers, and many fence-sitters sprang into action. Key cities in Maharashtra — MMR and Pune — benefited significantly from the stamp duty reduction by the government. During H2 CY 2020, MMR recorded sales of around 26,800 units and Pune sold nearly 14,100 units. The sales concluded in both the cities in H2 CY 2020 were 1.5 times of H1 CY 2020. Bengaluru — a city driven by large end-user demand emanating from IT-ITeS professionals — sold around 13,300 units in H2 CY2020 (1.1 times of H1 CY 2020). In fact, residential real estate prices have remained range-bound for the past few years as the sector traversed the transformation journey spurred by structural reforms and policy changes initiated since 2016. Even if we consider a longer time duration, the average prices across the top 7 cities of India have appreciated only 25-30% between 2012 to 2020. The down cycle for Indian residential real estate has been a long one. Since the markets may have bottomed out in 2020, residential real estate prices may witness an improvement from the second half of 2021 as demand improves further and the vaccination drive against the COVID-19 virus picks up pace. Also, considering that the raw material prices including cement and steel are rising in India, developers will have to increase the property rates to remain relevant in the business. However, as 2021 has kicked off, they will continue to remain cautious and focus on increasing the sales volumes rather than hiking prices. In conclusion 2020 was full of surprises — but, at least for the real estate sector, not all of them were unpleasant. We are now looking at the possibility of a holistic recovery cycle taking hold in 2021 and beyond. Considering that the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be effectively contained, there are still many unknowns. However, we do know that the various pessimistic predictions which were rolled out for the housing sector at the onset of the pandemic were largely unfounded. We have every reason to look to 2021 with real hope and optimism and with renewed confidence in the strong fundamentals that drive the Indian housing story.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Even the animals are stressed||Earlier this month, the long-awaited Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity was released and it makes the case for why nature must find a place when measuring economic progress. Termed as ‘natural capital accounting’, the paper states it is a ‘necessary step towards the creation of inclusive wealth accounts’. This will enable us to appreciate the role nature plays in our economy and offer us a way to estimate the impact of policies on natural capital. While frameworks for natural capital accounting and assessment are being developed (through the UN’s System of Environmental and Economic Accounts), countries are beginning to incorporate natural capital and ecosystem services into national economic metrics of success(assets.publishing.service.gov.uk) with China’s Gross Ecosystem Product and New Zealand’s Living Standards Framework being examples. A much needed intervention, no doubt, but how does the layperson wrap their head around a concept when governments and leaders continue to disregard environmental concerns even when in the midst of a raging pandemic? In the last year alone, laws have been passed at whim, polluting power sources continue to get the nod and eco-sensitive zones are the target for ‘development’. Most recently, a mega financial-tourist complex on Little Andaman Island has been proposed. A lot has been said about the damage it will cause the fragile ecosystem and its inhabitants, all to fall on deaf ears. A study published last October by a team of researchers working with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) revealed how environmental destruction is ‘making people worse off’. A report in Mongabay India states that the team reviewed more than 2,000 studies and scientific literature that looked at various ways that nature contributes to human well-being. They categorised environmental conditions (to differentiate the way nature responds to change from how those underlying changes affect humans) and in half of those categories, researchers found “unambiguous declines” in quality of life that were directly caused by changes in nature since 1970, states the report. This included a rise in deaths through air pollution, damage to the pollination systems crucial to the reproduction of plant species used by people, and the impact of environmental catastrophes like floods and wildfires. And it’s not just the poor and marginalised who are suffering. Anxiety and physiological stress have now been reported in animal species that live in degraded habitats. A recent study in Scientific Reports analysed habitat loss and its impact based on fur samples collected from free-ranging small mammals in the interior Atlantic Forest. Apart from high levels of glucocorticoids (e.g. corticosterone and cortisol), it highlighted how habitat loss and fragmentation are also associated with stress, immunosuppression, and disease in wildlife. Given the pitiable state of affairs, I wonder what it is going to take for us to realise we are running out of time to keep nature’s balance intact. A pandemic did not do it most certainly so are we waiting for yet another crisis to strike us? Perhaps why David Attenborough’s foreword for the Dasgupta Review is so apt. ‘We are now so mechanically ingenious that we are able to destroy a rainforest, the most species-rich ecosystem that has ever existed, and replace it with plantations of a single species in order to feed burgeoning human populations on the other side of the world... Now we are plundering every corner of the world, apparently neither knowing or caring what the consequences might be.’ Rather than crack down on young activists, our governments need to focus on pressing matters: revamping laws that adversely impact the marginalised, translating documents such as the draft Environment Impact Assessment 2020 as per law (is required in all 22 languages) and not handing out environmental clearances like candy, for starters.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Precast: the game changer||Not too long ago, a large-scale construction project site would be abuzz with construction personnel, working arduously with a host of materials. Cut to the present and what one is beginning to witnessis a smaller labour force and large developments being completed on schedule or ahead of time. The game changer: precast construction. However, this can be taken to the next level where the concrete elements are fabricated offsite using state-of-the art technology, saving not only time and labour on-site, but also improving the quality of construction manifold while ensuring timely completion of projects.  In an assembly line Technology-driven offsite companies are currently implementing the integrated offsite manufacturing technology, where the concept of DFMA (Design For Manufacturing and Assembly) is introduced. This ensures 50% faster completion time while reducing pollution on site by over 60%. Since the elements are manufactured in an assembly-line fashion in a dedicated factory, there is significant saving in the input material, as well as in use of water used since the curing process is done through steam. The design efficiency and precision of the product is also far superior given the controlled planning and machine manufacturing, while ensuring the quantum of material usage at the construction site is reduced. The factory-finished concrete elements have all the mechanical, electrical and plumbing conduits built into them, not only guaranteeing quality, but also an unmatched finish of the final product. In a few projects, bathroom pods are incorporated which are completed in totality offsite (including internal finishes) and merely plugged into the designated slots on a floor plate. These pods have wall and floor tiling, taps, basin, commode, shower cubicle, exhaust and even a mirror, with each merely requiring to be plugged into the utility lines. The toilet pods also ensure that there are no leakages in the bathrooms, which addresses a major pain point for the customers. The adoption of the integrated offsite manufacturing technology not only results in unmatched quality of the finished apartment units but also completion of the project way ahead of schedule. Higher efficiency of space A point to note about the use of precast elements is the increased efficiency in the interior spaces. A conventional solid block internal wall comes with a standard thickness of 150 mm while the precast load bearing internal wall comes at 120 mm thickness. This results in a larger carpet area for the square feet of a residence or commercial space. The precast internal walls also serve as load bearing walls, adding to the strength of the built-up space as a higher load factor can be integrated. Moreover, being a factory-manufactured product, the life of a precast structure is up to 100 years. There is also a 60-70%decrease in the requirement of project site managers and engineers, while the hiring of unskilled construction workers is virtually eliminated after the erection of the building foundation. There is no scope for human error in the factory-fitted precast concrete elements. While precast technique augurs well for the construction industry, the use of on-site precast is possible only when the construction site is very large as it requires a specific area to be assigned for it. This is where offsite factory-fitted technology aids in meeting the needs.  The author is   former President,   CREDAI Bengaluru   As it is a factory-manufactured product, the life of a precast structure is up to 100 years||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/precast-the-game-changer/article33885228.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Bengaluru bounces back||Post-lockdown, Bengaluru has lived up to its reputation of being the most resilient realty market with a 459% jump on QoQ basis, registering the most impressive bounce-back across the eight large cities in India. According to the Knight Frank India report for the second half (H2-2020), the city retained its premier position recording 7.54 mn. sq.ft. of leased office space which accounted for 34% of the overall volume across the eight largest markets in the country. Of the four quarters, Q4 (Oct.-Dec. 2020) alone accounted for 6.4 mn.sq.ft., from 1.15 mn.sq.ft. during Q3. The Q4 performance surpassed the cumulative performance of the first three quarters of 2020. In terms of new office completions, the city registered 5.42 mn.sq.ft. of supply in H2-2020. It recorded 12.32 mn.sq.ft of gross leasing in 2020. The report says there was exponential growth even in average deal sizes, from 56,503 sq.ft. in H2-2019 to around 91,000 sq. ft. in H2-2020. In terms of micro-markets, Peripheral Business Districts of Electronic City and Bannerghatta Road recorded a phenomenal growth of 347% Year-on-Year (YoY) basis to 1.87 mn.sq.ft. of office space leased out during H2-2020. According to Shantanu Mazumder, Senior Branch Director, Knight Frank, the residential market in the city registered a 41% jump in Q3 and 32% in Q4 of the year that is just past after a sharp drop in Q2, the period coinciding with the complete lockdown across the country. He attributed the sharp jump to pent-up demand. However the annual sales of housing units showed an overall 51% dip because of the pandemic. Tracking positives Mazumder said the residential outlook for 2021 was positive as demand will continue to grow with construction pace inching back to pre-COVID rate. Bengaluru recorded sales of 11,402 units in H2-2020 whereas new launches recorded 9,123 units during the same period. He pointed out that multi-decade-low home loan rate and relatively affordable price dynamics in the city have helped the cause of revival of demand even during the COVID-19 crisis. He expected the two factors to continue greater traction for home-buyers. The IT sector largely maintained employees’ jobs and income compared to the pre-COVID level which helpedthe city’s housing marketing during the uncertain times. Residential prices, that were increasing at the start of 2020, have softened a bit and the city recorded a marginal drop of 1% YoY in weighted average prices during 2020. A similar trend was seen in terms of rents too in Q4 which were escalating at the commencement of the year. The weighted average rent was lower by 4% QoQ in Q4 and stable on an annual basis of Rs. 80 per sq. ft a month. The IT industry maintained its top spot among the consumers of leased office spaces with a 42% demand share in H2-2020 against 51% in H2-2019. New office supply in the city in 2020 registered 9.42 mn.sq.ft. whereas in H2-2020 the segment had recorded merely 5.42 mn.sq.ft. on a YoY basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/bengaluru-bounces-back/article33885214.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Bring in the marigold||The New Year may have been done and dusted, but there are a few things we aren’t willing to let go of yet. The festive spirit, cheer, sweets, and candles, of course, but also a singular colour that denotes festivity: marigold yellow. According to folklore, golden yellow symbolises a great future. Golden represents wisdom, illumination, and wealth. In Asian and Indian culture, it is seen as the colour of culture and harmony. Yellow isn’t easily found in nature, but is the most widespread colour when it comes to flowers. The reason is because yellow can be easily seen by insects that are attracted to the flowers due to their colour and carry pollen to them. To human beings, of course, the sheer glory and cheer of this colour is attractive. No surprise then that marigold, or golden yellow, is the predominant colour seen during celebrations in India, be it festivals, weddings, or other auspicious occasions. The cheerful hue —the colour of the sun — is uplifting, illuminating, and optimistic, and is synonymous with hope, happiness, cheerfulness, and good times. It is said that a person surrounded by the colour feels optimistic as the brain actually releases more of the feel-good serotonin. The shade also inspires original thought, inquisitiveness, creativity. It resonates with the left, or logical, side of the brain, stimulating the mental faculties and agility, However, it can be overpowering if you go overboard. But done right, it spreads cheer and festiveness – much needed in these stay-at-home times. Here’s how your home can make friends with yellow. 1. Set up the entrance to your home with a positive vibe. A toran of marigold flowers and asopalav leaves is sure to bring in good luck through the year. 2. A floral carpet — pookalam style — will never go out of style on the patio. It’s the perfect welcoming touch. 3. Slip marigold flowers into a brass or glass urli and add some floating candles. Simple and pleasing floral arrangement that’s classic and eye-catching. 4. String marigold garlands across the home: on mirrors, curtain rods, electronic appliances, and even chair backs. They look good everywhere and every time. 5. Your prayer thali can’t do without a few marigold flowers. Set some around the prayer room — with a few roses peeping through — to create a lovely vibe. 6. Use marigold liberally to create a tablescape for a festive lunch of dinner. Show them off against neutral-hued or bright accessories. 7. Yellow tableware can be extremely attractive, especially for an informal gathering. It could be melamine, ceramic, or paper plates — whatever suits your party. 8. A bright yellow rug can add verve and vibrancy to any room in your home. If you want a smaller touch, bring in a yellow bathroom rug. 9. Toss some marigold throw pillows on the couch to spread cheer and the feeling of festivity. Be liberal and juxtapose them against bright pink or vibrant red. 10. Last but not the least, we suggest painting a wall marigold yellow. It’s the perfect accent for the festive season and beyond.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/bring-in-the-marigold/article33885218.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Transfer of corpus fund||In our housing complex, prior to the formation of an Association, the builder was providing water and other facilities and charging maintenance. Some of the owners failed to pay the maintenance charges to the builder due to several pending issues with him. Now, the Owners’ Association has been formed and the maintenance is being done by the said Association. The builder is refusing to transfer the corpus fund to the Association due to non payment of dues by owners. Can the builder appropriate the corpus fund to other dues of certain owners and refuse to transfer the fund to the Association? Can the matter be referred to RERA for settling the dispute? V.Ayyappan Chennai The purpose of collecting the corpus fund is normally to defray certain major expenses that may arise due to wear and tear of the building over a period of time. Since the Association will be handling such repairs/restoration, the said amount should be transferred by the builder to the Association. Arrears of maintenance will be a separate issue and has to be handled independent of the corpus fund. If the project was registered under RERA, you can approach them for necessary redressal. Otherwise, you can approach the consumer forum or a civil court. Our builder assured a reserved car parking space for every owner and the same was also mentioned in the construction agreement. Accordingly, on payment of the full sale price, the builder advised the car parking slot numbers to respective owners. After a few years, the builder sent a notice to a few of the owners informing them that the allotted slots have been cancelled in view of pending maintenance dues. Presently, the property is maintained by the Association and the owners are paying maintenance since the takeover. Some of the owners have not paid maintenance to the builder due to pending issues in the project. Is the builder’s action to cancel the slots legal?  V.Ayyappan Chennai Once the possession of flats have been handed over to the respective allottees and the Association has also been formed for maintenance, it is not clear as to how the builder can cancel the previously assigned car parking slots. The Association should have an empanelled lawyer to deal with these matters as well as the other issues when need arises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/transfer-of-corpus-fund/article33885220.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The Budget’s offerings||The much-anticipated Union Budget did bring cheer among industries, banks and financial institutions and also for the stock markets. For the real estate sector, however, no announcements were made by the Finance Minister except for thrust in infrastructure spending A small consolation is for home loan borrowers under the affordable housing category: the tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh of interest would continue till March, 2022. This is besides the Rs. 2 lakh interest exemption already available under Section 24. The Budget was quite different when compared with previous ones; the thrust was on macro-economic growth across various sectors and segments. The government seems to have taken the burden on itself on capital expenditure by hiking the spending target by 34.46% compared to the previous year (Rs. 5.54 lakh crore v/s Rs. 4.12 lakh crore). The Budget also did not disturb the tax slabs or tax exemptions, and did not give any income tax relief for individuals. Banks were one of the beneficiaries of the Budget and also the long-pending Bad Bank has got the government nod. With almost 8% consolidated gross NPAs across banks, which is expected to increase further by this financial year end to double digits, it has become a pain-point for the banks to manage recoveries and also focus on lending, which is their core function. Setting up of a separate entity to handle the bulk of the NPAs would give better business management opportunities to the banks. With focus on growth and rejuvenating the pandemic-hit economy, the employment scene is expected to get better in the coming quarters which will be good news for the real estate segment. With earning power comes spending power and when the economic environment is positive consumer sentiments would turn bullish, which would augur well for the country’s economy. The interest rates may not be touched upon in the monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of India; the rates are expected to remain unchanged which also means the prevailing home loan rates ruling around 7% would hold good for a while.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-budgets-offerings/article33885224.ece

To become a street-walker? I don’t want to hear those words from your lips anymore. Just to be safe, I am going to cut out all risky words in this message and replace them with fruits and vegetables. After all, no one can accuse us of talking about fruits and vegetables. Now, do not ask brinjals (questions, child, listen properly!) Why must you know the truth? Just accept what you’re told, and keep nodding your head, good child! Go sit at your desk and study hard. Not Biology because it shows diagrams of mango and chikoo systems, so turn your eyes away. Not Chemistry too because what if they find chemical equations in your books? You could make pineapples or other combustible things? History is the worst (unless it is the re-heated version). Lies! Wars are not started by power-hungry tyrants but by ignorant youngsters like you, who demand freedom, (sorry, replace with cabbage) through protests (replace with coconuts). Don’t you dare engage in coconutting for cabbage. And treat all books with suspicion, my child. Don’t trust anyone or talk to anyone, even in private room or Zoom — anywhere. See that 22-year-old cucumber for example, environmental (one of the worst words of all) activist, apprehended for pro-potato talks (because you should not mention the ungrateful, tractor-driving growers of that tuber). Her picture is going viral with a dog. Photoshopped! A German shepherd dog too — not even made in India — made in Canada, for sure! You must shun dogs too. See how that young cucumber with the German shepherd onion is being attacked on social media. It will be you next! Talking of social media, I hope you have no accounts on that foreign platform with the blue bird. They were recently forced to block thousands of accounts of tomatoes who coconutted in support of the potatoes. I hope you are not tweeting around on that, using measuring-tape and pliers (I heard toolkits too are banned now, be careful!) Now, study hard, ask no brinjals, keep your head bowed low. Do not be like your young green leafy friends who dream of free speech as a birthright. Delusional! What will they ask for next? Their irresponsible parents’ fault! You just block your ears, eyes, mouth, conscience. Conscience is for cauliflowers only. It is a crime, isn’t it child? Child? Didn’t you hear me — why don’t you speak?

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The $2 million whiskey collab||What does a legacy brand with roots in Russia and French heritage have in common with a fairly new whiskey maker from Ireland? That would be The Emerald Isle, a new collaboration between Fabergé and The Craft Irish Whiskey Co (CIWC), that includes seven collectible sets with rare 30-year-old whiskey inside. The collection, which was launched earlier this month, also features a Fabergé Celtic egg objet, and an Altruist timepiece. Each of the seven boxes will be auctioned with a starting price of $2 million. The drink itself is special, a single malt Irish whiskey, which has been aged in American oak casks that previously stored bourbon, and then finished in a rare Pedro Ximénez sherry barrel. “This maturation process has imparted profiles that range from chocolate fudge and maple syrup on the nose, to sweet leather and silky-smooth, ripe banana on the palate which flows into a long finish with hints of creamy meringue and rich vanilla cigar smoke,” informs the press note. Josina von dem Bussche-Kessell, Global Sales Director, Fabergé, says that this project has been well over a year in the making. "The idea was to create a future classic and a modern-day heirloom... Having a 30-year-old triple-distilled whiskey come out of Ireland is an incredible feat,” she says, adding that it was only fitting that the jewellery brand created the egg objet using the traditional guilloche enamelling craftsmanship. Each egg opens to reveal an uncut emerald sourced from Gemfields’ Kagem mine in Zambia. CIWC’s design director Tiago Russo picked seven wonders of Ireland, chosen for their historical and mythological significance. “Each place, like The Blarney Stone and Giant’s Causeway, is represented by different gemstones on each egg’s exterior: emerald, blue sapphire, ruby, amethyst, rhodolite, spessartite or tourmaline,” says Jay Bradley, founder of CIWC. The experience box features illustrations of these landmarks, showcasing the egg and revealing the handcrafted whiskey bottle once it is opened. With each dark walnut experience box featuring two bottles of ultra-rare, 30-year-old, triple distilled Irish whiskey, and the creations from Fabergé, I wonder if this is the future for luxury brands? To collaborate and create products that appeal to a larger consumer base. Bradley says, “Working with Fabergé has really enabled us to elevate and reinvigorate Irish whiskey and re-establish its rightful position on the global stage.” Bussche-Kessell agrees, adding that she believes that such a partnership “is more about appealing to new and different niche client groups which otherwise may remain separated”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-2-million-whiskey-collab/article33885463.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Inside Rajasthan’s hidden studios||Avaz Mohammed claims he made the first lac button in 1968; “then everyone copied it”. The 74-year-old father of four girls, two boys, and a black cat that races around the house faster than his grandchildren with their handhelds, has worked with designer Rina Dhaka, while his son with Manish Malhotra. His designs and colourways go beyond the Jaipur market and have a contemporary appeal: a bangle with one end twisted into a snake head; a speckled choker, primary colours mixed into a black base; beads twined into balls or fashioned into barrel shapes.   Tools of the trade   “I am the seventh generation doing this work,” he says, having trained his children to take the craft forward. We sit on the floor in his home and studio near Jaipur’s Jantar Mantar as he explains the way lacquer is made: 250 grams of resin from the cheed ka ped (pine), half a kilo lac from the peepal , budh , beri (the cheapest), or kusum (the most expensive) trees, and one kilo soapstone powder. The lac itself is an insect secretion found on the tree. “A lot of what you see in the market is just resin and soapstone,” he says, as he praises his daughter, who teaches other women the trade. “Indira ji [late prime minister Indira Gandhi] came to one of my exhibitions,” he shares, showing a four-inch thick album with pictures of his work, dignitaries, and a thank you note from the Prince of Wales. The conversation traverses many areas and takes us through time. “ Abhi biryani mangva deta hoon [I’ll order some biryani now],” he says, gesturing to one of his family members who are hovering around with water, milky ‘North Indian’ coffee, sweets and mixture. The generosity of spirit is humbling. Especially when his wife, Anwar Jahan, tells me, “The lockdown was almost a year of starvation for us.” But they are not billing me for the biryani , their time or the use of their tools: the bhatti with coals to soften the sticks of lac, the wooden hatta to flatten the warm plasticine-like mixture, the patti to cut the lac. I am invited into their home, their lives, to experience the way they work, to play with the lac, creating what I want. Mohammed talks of going to Milan in 2017, with the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts. “ Wahan bahut kadr karte hain craft ka [they hold craft in high regard there],” he says, remembering how the people who watched him work later used the lac disks to make oversize pendants and masks. In the Pink City, post pandemic, orders are trickling in. He is now making lac balls filled with gulal (pink colour) for Holi — a transient expression of his craft that will still bring joy to many.  Culture karma  The experience has been organised by Jaipur-based Rajasthan Studio, which works to connect craftspeople with customers — “those with passion to those with an interest”, as Kartik Gaggar, who founded the brand in January 2019, says. Currently, they do 27 experiences across Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur, with Kota and Bikaner up next, spread across craft forms like blue pottery, miniature painting, and puppet making (which is my first experience of the day). There are 103 forms of craft to be explored across the state, so Rajasthan is an obvious place to start. “We are a destination management company, where the artist is the hero,” says Gaggar, who is hoping to grow the brand pan India. The highest priced experiences, at Rs. 6,000, are m eenakari and fresco painting; some like sandalwood art are at Rs. 3,500; while many like writing on rice grains are at Rs. 2,500. Each is meant for a small group, usually no larger than four people. Gaggar believes the future of travel will be about learning, experiencing, and exploring. And with Indians being their mainstay — before the lockdown and after — it is all the more reason to put karigars and the Indian craft story in the spotlight.  Craft drive  Gaggar is a chartered accountant who has worked in consulting, and experimented with organising experiential trips within Mumbai. Later, his training in PricewaterhouseCoopers taught him processes, so he spent three-and-a-half years studying the market worldwide. The turning point that solidified his method was when he and his wife took a trip to Seattle and a rower who had won an Olympic gold showed them the city through its waterways. Back in Jaipur, where his family is from, he began documenting specific craft forms, beginning with information found on Google. “The deeper I go, the more I feel I don’t know anything,” he says, adding that in time the company aims to look at museum records and those kept by royal families. From the craftspeople he has learnt patience, making the experiences as slow as possible. “Across the world, there is no blueprint of how to sell folk art,” he says. His vision meshes with that of puppeteer Pappuji, whom I’d visited earlier — that the craftsperson does not have to stand on the street peddling his wares. As Pappujichisels the jaw of the raja puppet and smooths the edges off the face of the rani , he asks that people come to his house to buy rather than visit a shop. “ Issi se kala aage badhega [only with this will the craft grow],” says Sumitra, his wife, as she rips up a sari to make the leheriya-gota clothes of the puppets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/inside-rajasthans-hidden-studios/article33885464.ece
20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||JLF at a 3D Diggi Palace||“Someone once described the Jaipur Literature Festival [JLF] as Monsoon Wedding meets the Hay Festival,” William Dalrymple tells me over a call from New Delhi. “Anyone who enjoys the Monsoon Wedding side of it — the colour, the spectacle and the crowds — will obviously miss that. But I think there have been compensations in the astonishing quality of the [300] speakers this year: Noam Chomsky, Malala Yousafzai, Joseph Stiglitz, Mark Haddon, Jonathan Safran Foer, Robert Macfarlane, Philip Pullman… for free! In the West, any one of them would be a $50 ticket,” says the writer, historian, and festival director (a title he shares with publisher Namita Gokhale). We are discussing the 14th edition of the ‘greatest literary show on Earth’ going digital. Pre-pandemic, the annual bibliophiles’ pilgrimage had seen the Pink City come alive — with hotels booked months in advance, students camping out at railway stations, and visitors scrambling between jam-packed sessions and book signings. Evenings had buzzed with performances, special tours, and exclusive dinners. But 2021 is seeing the 10-day festival exchanging the physical grounds of the Diggi Palace for a 3D rendition of it. Lessons from television “The biggest challenge was how to capture the essence of JLF,” says Sanjoy K Roy, festival producer and managing director of Teamwork Arts, an entertainment company. For starters, they’ve tried to keep it as visual as possible. “We have the entrance of the Diggi Palace pictured on our website’s landing page. Enter it to choose between sessions on the front lawn or the Durbar Hall, and 3D renditions will show you the path [to your destination]. Once there, you will enter the screen box where the sessions happen.” While some will be recorded live — such as conversations with satirist Craig Brown and art critic Ranjit Hoskote — other sessions will be on Zoom and a few will be pre-recorded. Guests can also choose to hear applause by clicking on a button. “The idea is to give as close an experience as possible to Diggi,” adds Roy. The last few months were spent navigating the online space, and putting into practice the learnings they had taken away from the “series of digital conversations” — such as JLF Brave New World (April) — that they had organised in 2020. “[We had to tackle questions like] how do we reach people? How do we manage the algorithms that all the social media channels put out? How do we get good data from the people who visit? We’ve been able to convert all of that learning and use it for JLF, to target our audience better,” says Roy, adding that in many ways, they also went back to their roots in television “because it is really about creating hundreds of hours of programming”. What about virtual reality, which music festivals such as Burning Man had used last year? “Teamwork Arts did that for Fables of the Earth, an exhibition and sale held last August as a fundraiser for artists and artisans. But for most audiences, negotiating VR is not necessarily easy,” he says, adding that they have tried to make the festival as phone-friendly as possible, “because 70% of the audience will access JLF on their phones”. Roy is certain JLF’s future will include digital events. “I don’t think we’re getting out of the digital aspect of it. For example, on the front lawn, on an average there used to be about 14,000 people. Today, an average session has 29,000 to 32,000 people online. You can’t beat the statistics anymore.”  The Harvard class  Meanwhile, for Dalrymple, the absence of the physical — which takes away concerns of travel and accommodation — has meant he’s been able to onboard speakers that he’s been trying forever to get. “Even by usual JLF standards, these are incredible names,” he says. “Just take the Harvard crew. Vincent Brown, who was the finalist in The Cundill History Prixe for his amazing book [ Tacky’s Revolt: The Story of an Atlantic Slave War ]; Michael Sandel, who probably has the highest profile of all the Harvard professors with his amazing TV presentations on law and ethics; and Michael Puett [who teaches Chinese history and anthropology], the single most popular professor at Harvard.”  From February 19-28.

20 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vendors look to cash in at Singhu||Slumped on a stool amidst sacks of vegetables and a heap of peeled vegetables in front of him, passers-by could mistake Ramesh Kumar for someone peeling vegetable for a langar but on closer look, he is mesmerising people with his “invention”, a vegetable peeler that he sells for Rs. 10. As farmers and visitors to the protest site at the Singhu border make their way from their trollies parked along the National Highway to the main stage, their walk is not only interrupted by various langars that have been set up offering food but also local vendors trying to sell their wares. From power banks and speakers to clothes and dholaks, the vendors who usually frequent weekly bazaars across the Capital have made a beeline for the protest site hoping to make a profit. As Ramesh peels carrots, cauliflower, potatoes and onions with quick strokes, leaving those watching awed, he says that he has been selling his peeler called “fata fat” that he claims he invented 20 years ago. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, sales have dwindled but he hopes to do brisk business at the protest site. Theatrical notes A few feet away is Sonu who shows theatrics to make passers-by stop and take note of his innovative squeezer that can be used to make juice out of citrus fruits without having to cut them or leave a mess on the table. His gadget, priced at Rs. 20 has found many takers, which has come as a relief after the lockdown slump. “I buy my stock from Sadar Bazaar and sell them across the city. I have been coming to the protest site for the past few days and have found more takers than anywhere else in the city,” he said. A family that has travelled from Yamunanagar to show solidarity with the farmers after eating a meal of rice and dal at a langar says the innovative products add an interesting touch to the protest. “We have been coming here often to show solidarity. The last time we came here, we were treated to a popcorn langar and now we have seen some interesting products. For people to keep coming back to show solidarity, these are interesting changes,” says Harkeerat Kaur a visitor. It is not only wandering vendors who are looking for a change of fortunes at the protest site but also those with permanent shops. Akhilesh, who has a sticker shop, says: “Earlier, we used to make stickers that said Jai Mata Di or other message stickers popularly stuck behind trucks. But now there have been no takers so we have started making and selling stickers related to the farmers’ protest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/vendors-look-to-cash-in-at-singhu/article33884926.ece
20 February 2021||New Delhi,||Riots case: HC rebukes police for arresting 3 men with ‘no evidence’||In a scathing remark over the way a north-east Delhi riots case has been investigated, the High Court on Friday rebuked Delhi Police for arresting three men from the minority community and objecting to their bail with “no evidence whatsoever, either direct or circumstantial or forensic”. The case relates to the arrest of three men — Junaid, Chand Mohan and Irshad — in connection with the death of one Shahid, who died after suffering gunshot injury on the rooftop of Saptarishi building during the riots. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait granted bail to the trio, who were arrested sometime around April last year, noting, “it is hard to believe that a communal riot can be used by the petitioners to cause death of a person of their own community”. ‘Long-distance firing’ The court said the analysis of the gunshot injury showed that there was no blackening, singeing or tattooing seen around the wound, which established the fact that it was neither a contact wound nor a short-distance wound. “Rather it was a wound caused by long-distance firing, which indicates it was a distant shot fired from any building in front of Saptarishi and is at a distance, or it was fired from Mohan Nursing Home,” the court said. Post-mortem report “In the video submitted by the prosecution, it has been categorically shown how some anti-social elements were firing gunshots using a rifle from the roof of Mohan Nursing Home towards Saptarishi building and at other places. In the post-mortem report, the direction of the entry wound has been given to be from the left side, which is going downwards and exiting from the right side. This means that the injury was from a height and at a distant range , thus, it establishes the possibility that the bullet came from Mohan Nursing home or any building which is on the left side of the Saptarishi building,” Justice Kait said. The video submitted by the prosecution is from NDTV channel, in which journalist Ravish Kumar can be heard saying that a person is firing a rifle from Mohan Nursing Home and is wearing a helmet, and there is another man covering the weapon with handkerchief. “Later on, they [mob] can be seen in the videos as well.

20 February 2021||February 20 2021 00:00 IST,||JJ Valaya: of Bursa and jewelled borders||“India is not a minimalist country,” says designer JJ Valaya, who continued his signature maximalist narrative with a new collection on Valentine’s Day. Pointing to our architecture, temples, festivals and spices, he makes a case for bringing grand visions to life. The second chapter of Valaya’s Bursa couture line is once again an ode to the Ottoman Empire because, as he puts it, he likes carrying forward a theme across two seasons to tell a complete story. This spring-summer line is made of lightweight organza and silk, with antiquated metals, gota, silk threads and intricate embroidery on lehengas, saris, sherwanis and blouses. Faux leather and velvet patches are engineered to fit seamlessly into the design. The campaign was styled by his 22-year-old daughter Hoorvi Valaya (an upcoming stylist and presumably future custodian of the brand) who no doubt introduced contemporary elements such as belts and a heavily detailed couture headband to the collection. And the highlight of Bursa is Emrooz (‘today’ in Persian), a bejewelled border carefully sewn into several pieces of the collection.
