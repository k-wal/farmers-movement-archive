05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||One in five Indians exposed to novel coronavirus: sero-survey||Nearly one in five Indians had been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus until December 2020, the third round of the serological survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found. This is roughly a three-fold increase since August and a 30-fold increase since May, when previous rounds of the survey were conducted. “The message is that a large proportion of the population remains vulnerable. Vaccines are necessary and there can be no complacency with regards to masks, social distancing and hand hygiene,” Dr. Balram Bhargava, Director-General, ICMR, told a press briefing on Thursday. The survey sampled people from 70 districts in 21 States. The overall prevalence in the population was 21.5%, which averaged over India’s population indicated that about 270 million may have been exposed to the virus. India has so far confirmed a little over 10 million infections — or 27 cases to each confirmed case of infection. In the previous survey, there were 26 to 31 undetected cases for every confirmed case. India is showing a declining number in fresh infections since September, with only around 12,899 new infections added on Thursday, and 1.6 lakh active cases. Experts, however, have previously noted that serosurveys don’t capture the extent of the spread, and other modelling studies have shown that as much as 50% of the population may have been exposed. In the previous survey, only 5.2% of those sampled in rural areas showed antibodies. It has jumped to 19% in the latest survey. There was a sharp rise across urban and non-urban slum areas, too. In urban slums, it was 31%, nearly twice as much as the previous survey findings of 16%. In “urban non slums” the prevalence this time was 26% compared with 9% in the second survey. About 19.9% of adults sampled in the 18-44 years age group had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as did 25% of children/teenagers (10-17 years), and 23% in those over 45 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-in-five-indians-exposed-to-novel-coronavirus-sero-survey/article33754890.ece
05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi police to probe ‘international conspiracy’ to defame India||The Delhi police cyber cell has registered an FIR and will investigate an “international conspiracy” to defame the country, a senior police officer said on Thursday. The officer said a Twitter handle had shared a “toolkit” document, but deleted it later. It was apparently created by an allegedly pro-Khalistan organisation Poetic Justice Foundation, he said. “We have not named anybody in the FIR. It’s only against the creators of the toolkit and Delhi police will be investigating that,” said Praveer Ranjan, Special Commissioner of Police. He said the FIR was registered under IPC Sections 124A (sedition), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). It appeared that there was a plan to wage a social, cultural and economic war against India. “We are monitoring social media in connection with the Kisan agitation. In the process, we have identified more than 300 SM [social media] handles pushing hateful and malicious content,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-police-to-probe-international-conspiracy-to-defame-india/article33754895.ece
05 February 2021||Bengaluru/Hubballi,||Suburban rail gets Rs. 300 crore Central budgetary allocation||The 148.17-km suburban rail network for Bengaluru received a budgetary allocation of Rs. 300 crore from the Centre towards its implementation. Chief PRO of South Western Railways (SWR) E. Vijaya told reporters in Hubballi on Thursday that the funding has been mentioned in the Northern Railway section of the pink book, which gives details of the budgetary grants. An equivalent amount of Rs. 300 crore, for the joint venture between the Ministry of Railways and the State, was also expected from the Karnataka government, she said. According to a senior official of the Rail Infrastructure Development Company Karnataka Ltd. (K-RIDE), the agency implementing suburban rail project, the allocation has been made under equity infusion into State joint ventures. “A total of Rs. 800 crore has been made available. A majority of the funds will go to the suburban project in the city and the Haryana orbital rail project. There are other projects too . We expect around Rs. 300 crore from the Central government and same amount of allocation from the State government,” the official said. He added that the total of Rs. 600 crore will give an impetus to the project in the first year of implementation. “In a month, we will float tenders for civil works. We have finalised consultancy tenders on design, land acquisition, station planning, geo-technical survey and investigation and utility mapping. Negotiations are on with international agencies to fund the project.” Activists, too, hailed the budgetary support. “An equal contribution from the State government will give a big push for the project that has been pending for years. All that we need is more conviction in implementing the project for the benefit of general public,” said rail activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar. As per the plan, in the first phase, K-RIDE will take up two corridors for construction, Baiyappanahalli to Banaswadi (corridor 2) and Heelalige to Rajankunte (corridor 4). The total grants to South Western Railway in the 2021-22 budget has increased by Rs. 536 crores, which is 20% more compared to the grants allocated in the previous budget(2020-21), said SWR Chief PRO E. Vijaya. SWR received Rs. 3,244 crore grants, the highest so far for the railway zone. Together with Rs. 1,233 crore expected as deposit from the Government of Karnataka towards new lines, road over bridges, and road under bridges, the budgetary allocation would be Rs. 4,467 crores, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/suburban-rail-gets-rs-300-crore-central-budgetary-allocation/article33755409.ece
05 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||HC upholds SEC’s decision to conduct panchayat polls on basis of 2019 rolls||A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C. Praveen Kumar, on Thursday dismissed a couple of writ petitions filed challenging the State Election Commission (SEC)’s decision to conduct gram panchayat elections on the basis of 2019 electoral rolls. They observed that since the elections were already notified under Section 11 of AP Panchayat Raj Act, the conduct of elections on the basis of previously updated electoral rolls was permitted under the law. Chief Justice Goswami said he would not go into the question of who (SEC or the State government) is responsible for not updating the electoral rolls at this juncture. Advocate-General S. Sriram said the State has a narrative that the electoral rolls could not be updated due to non-compliance of SEC with Sec.11 of the above Act, to which the court answered that it has no finding to render on the issue. It may be noted that State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar, while announcing the election schedule earlier this month, stated that the commission was forced to adopt the 2019 electoral rolls due to the Panchayat Raj Department's failure to update the old ones. As a consequence, nearly 3.60 lakh, youth who attained 18 years as on January 1, 2021 would be losing the right to vote. Aggrieved with this, Dhulipalla Akhila, a student from Nambur in Guntur district, and another one filed writ petitions in the High Court praying for directions to the SEC to suspend the election notification. Their argument was that 3.60 lakh youth would not be able to cast their votes, which is a right envisaged under Article 326 of the Constitution. But, during Thursday's hearing, the court refused to interfere with the election process at this stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/plan-to-conduct-polls-with-2019-rolls-upheld/article33754832.ece
05 February 2021||NEw Delhi,||For affluent, EPF is not nest egg but goose that lays golden eggs||More than 1.23 lakh “high net worth individuals” (HNIs) deposited more than Rs. 62,500 crore into their Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) accounts in 2018-19 alone, and the largest EPF account has a staggering Rs. 103 crore balance, sources in the Department of Revenue said on Thursday, defending the Budget move to tax the income on employees’ PF contributions over Rs. 2.5 lakh a year. “Since any tax exemption is provided through taxpayers’ money, it was unfair to allow a small group of HNIs to misuse a welfare facility and earn wrongfully tax-free income as assured interest return,” an official said, stressing that the step was intended to enforce the principle of equity among contributors. Of an estimated 4.5 crore EPF accounts, the source said about 0.27% members had an average corpus of Rs. 5.92 crore and so were earning over Rs. 50 lakh a year as “tax-free assured interest”.  Mandatory for staff EPF accounts are mandatory for employees earning up to Rs. 15,000 a month in firms with over 20 workers, with 12% of the basic pay and dearness allowance deducted as employees’ contribution and another 12% remitted by the employer. The government had capped the contributions by employers into employee welfare schemes like the EPF or the National Pension Scheme or a superannuation plan, at Rs. 7.5 lakh a year, in last year’s Budget.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/for-affluent-epf-is-not-nest-egg-but-goose-that-lays-golden-eggs/article33754894.ece
05 February 2021||Bengaluru,||K. Prathapchandra Shetty resigns as Council Chairman||K. Prathapchandra Shetty quit as Chairman of the Legislative Council on Thursday, after reading out a nine-page resignation letter in which he said the recent “untoward incidents” in the House “hold a mirror to the system”, and seeking an apology from the people of Karnataka. A motion to remove Mr. Shetty had been tabled in the Council and it was set to be taken up for discussion. However, he chose to quit and submitted his resignation to Deputy Chairman M.K. Pranesh. Senior JD(S) member Basavaraj Horatti is set to be elected as new Chairman. Mr. Shetty, a four-time MLA and a three-time MLC, was unanimously elected to the post in December, 2018 during the Congress-JD(S) coalition government. However, the JD(S) and BJP recently came to an understanding to dislodge Mr. Shetty. Uproarious scenes BJP member M.K. Pranesh was elected Deputy Chairman, with JD(S) help. The number game had led to uproarious scenes in the House on December 15, 2020, when the late S.L. Dharme Gowda, then Deputy Chairman, sat on the seat of the Chairman when Mr. Shetty was not in the House. Mr. Shetty said in his letter that amidst the “political reality of the numerical strength of parties being the basis of most decisions”, a Chairman’s task of protecting Constitutional values was a “walk on the sword’s edge”. He was pained that some decisions he took in people's interest led to a question over the credibility of the Chair. “The Chairman’s post is a Constitutional post and if it is changed every time numbers change, it may become difficult to conduct the House well, in today’s political situation,” he said. Saying that he was pained by the situation leading to untoward incidents in the Council during his term as Chairman, Mr. Shetty said he considered it his “Rajadharma” to fight it legally when the credibility of the Chair was in question. Mr. Shetty further said he had submitted a report on the incidents that rocked the Council in December to the Governor and hoped he would take suitable action. Sources in BJP said that the Business Advisory Committee meeting on Friday will likely extend the Council session by two more days till Tuesday. The notification for Chairman’s election will likely be issued on Monday and election held on Tuesday, a senior BJP member said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/prathapchandra-shetty-resigns-as-council-chairman/article33755006.ece

05 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||State, HC must decide on shifting court to Kurnool: Law Minister||Union Minister for Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday that the Andhra Pradesh government and the State High Court would have to consult each other and come to a conclusion on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s proposal to shift the principal seat of the court to Kurnool. “However, the matter is sub-judice as it is in the High Court,” he added. In a written reply to Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao’s question on whether there was a proposal to shift the principal seat of the court to Rayalaseema, whether it was accepted by the Central government, and whether the Ministry of Law and Justice would recognise Kurnool as the judicial capital of the State if the High Court was established there, Mr. Prasad said there was indeed a proposal to shift the High Court out of Amaravati, but not for setting up Benches in other cities. “The shifting of the principal seat of the High Court is to be decided by the State government in consultation with the court, and no time frame is laid in such matters,” Mr. Prasad said. The High Court, with its principal seat in Amaravati, had been established under the A.P.

05 February 2021||JAIPUR,||NSUI funds drive for temple puts Cong. in a spot||A drive launched by the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress, in Rajasthan to collect funds for Ram temple construction in Ayodhya has put the ruling party in a difficult position. Senior Congress leaders have distanced themselves from the campaign saying there were no plans to collect donations for the purpose. The NSUI has begun its 15-day special drive from Rajasthan University’s Commerce College in Jaipur. Its State president Abhishek Choudhary said a token amount of one rupee would be taken from each student in schools, colleges and universities across the State. Mr. Choudhary said the campaign was aimed at exposing the BJP, “which had amassed huge amounts of money for the temple without any accountability”.  ‘Small amount sufficient’ An embarrassed Congress has found it difficult to counter the charge of playing to the people’s sentiments over the temple construction. State Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma said on Thursday that there was no need to donate crores of rupees and the contribution of small amounts was sufficient for people to show their faith. AICC treasurer Pawan Bansal, who was here to attend a party meeting, said the fund-raising wasn’t in consonance with the party’s stand. “We have no plans to collect funds for Ram temple,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nsui-funds-drive-for-temple-puts-cong-in-a-spot/article33755475.ece
05 February 2021||MYSURU,||Track electrification gets a boost||The fund allocation in the Union Budget for track electrification is significant in the Mysuru division and is expected to be completed in a time-bound manner as it is devoid of land acquisition issues that plagues launch of new lines. In Mysuru division, the Mysuru-Hassan section which further connects to Mangaluru has received Rs. 112.32 crore for 2021-22. This is a significant chunk and the authorities are confident of absorbing the amount as there are virtually no hurdles in drawing the overhead cables and powering them. The route length of the Mysuru-Hassan-Mangaluru stretch is 347 km and is set to be fully electrified as part of the Indian Railway’s shift to electric mode fully by 2024. The stretch also includes Hassan-Arsikere section. Chief PRO of South Western Railway C.E. Vijaya told media persons during a virtual press conference on Thursday that 11 routes has been identified for electrification in the budget for 2021-22. The Mysuru-Hassan-Mangaluru section with Rs. 112.32 crore has received the highest allocation while the other sections under SWR which have received funding for electrification include Mysuru-Chamarajanagar (61 km) for which Rs. 17.83 crore has been allotted. Similarly, the Kadur-Chikkamagaluru section, spanning a distance of 46 km, has received Rs. 5.89 crore. The other major routes across SWR identified for electrification include Hospet-Hubballi-Vasco da Gama section (346 km), which has been allocated Rs. 85 crore, the while Miraj-Londa section (189 km) has received Rs. 80.14 crore. The Birur-Talaguppa, Bengaluru-Omalur via Hosur (196 km), Hospet-Swamihalli, Chikbanavara-Hassan, Chikkjajur-Ballari and Bangarpet-Yelahanka are the other sections for which substantial sums have been allocated for electrification. While the SWR has completed 110 route km of electrification so far and 309 route km has been planned for the current year (2020-21), the target is stiff for 2021-22; for, the authorities have set a target of completing electrification of 849 route km coming under the SWR zone. On the track doubling issue, 105 km of track has been doubled during the current year and another 65 km is to be completed while the target is to complete 203 km of track doubling by 2021-22. Of the sanctioned projects including Mysuru-Kushalnagar railway line project as also other works across the State, Ms. Vijaya said the progress and the implementation hinges on land acquisition. Once the land acquisition process reaches an advanced stage then the Railways will make substantial allocation so as to complete the works, she added. The focus this year is to complete the works in progress rather than announce new projects which gets staggered due to land acquisition issues, said Ms. Vijaya. Also, the Railways which is set to close all unmanned level crossing gates with either road over bridges or road under bridges, has also decided to close even the manned level crossing gates by providing for RUB/ROB in a phase-wise manner. Road safety works, including level crossings has received Rs. 35 crore, ROB/RUB works have been allocated Rs. 174 crore.

Tanushree Pithrody, in Class IV then, performed 42 full-body revolutions in one minute at the Ammanni Ramanna Shetty Hall in Udupi. Thus, she broke the record used to be held by 13-year-old Mohammed Alsheikh of Palestine who performed 38 revolutions in a minute on February 8, 2017. Addressing presspersons in Udupi on Thursday, her father Uday Kumar, who is an electrical contractor, said that his daughter is confident of creating another new record now.

05 February 2021||New Delhi,||T.N. Governor declines to take call on Perarivalan||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit has refrained from taking a call on a plea for the early release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict A.G. Perarivalan. The Governor said the President of India was the “appropriate competent authority” to deal with Perarivalan’s request for freedom. “His Excellency the Governor of Tamil Nadu considered all the facts on record and after perusal of the relevant documents, recorded that the Honourable President of India is the appropriate competent authority to deal with the request for remittance vide his order dated January 25, 2021. The proposal received by the Central government will be processed in accordance with law,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) informed the Supreme Court in a short affidavit on Thursday. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao is scheduled to take up the case on February 9. The MHA affidavit highlighted that the case against Perarivalan concerned the assassination of none other than a former Prime Minister of India. Forty-three other people sustained serious injuries in the bomb explosion at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu in 1991. “Pertinently, the offence committed was pertaining to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India, by means of detonating a bomb which resulted in the killing of 18 innocent individuals and causing serious injuries to 43 other persons,” the MHA noted. On January 21, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Governor, had submitted that Perarivalan’s plea for early release would be considered in a week. Mr. Mehta’s statement in court at the time had come as relief for Perarivalan’s family and lawyers. In fact, the Tamil Nadu State Cabinet had, on September 9, 2018, recommended the Governor pardon all seven convicts in the assassination case, including Perarivalan, serving life imprisonment. The Governor, however, had not acted on the recommendation for over two years, prompting Perarivalan to approach the Supreme Court about the delay. Even the apex court had termed the Governor’s delay “extraordinary”. By not taking a decision on the pardon plea, the Governor is now on the same page as the Centre, which had opened a novel line of argument in the Supreme Court that pleas for pardon and release should go to the President instead of the Governor. The Centre had, for the first time, raised the point about the Tamil Nadu Governor’s power to grant remission to Perarivalan under Article 161 of the Constitution in November 2020. But senior advocate Sankaranarayanan and advocate Prabu Ramasubramanian, for Perarivalan, had countered that a convict was free to choose between the President and the Governor for pardon. They had, to this extent, referred to the Constitution Bench’s judgment in the Union of India versus Sriharan of December 2015, which said the “exercise of executive clemency” was “vested in the President or the Governor”. Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami expressed hope in the State Assembly that the Governor would take a favourable decision in view of the State government’s representation insisting on the release of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-governor-declines-to-take-call-on-perarivalan/article33754892.ece

Further inquiry into the allegation revealed rampant irregularities and corruption in the implementation of the housing projects in 10 gram panchayats. The examination of houses, their GPS position and the beneficiaries revealed that actually one house was built and money for two houses was withdrawn showing two beneficiaries. The investigating officers, in their preliminary investigation, found 323 such cases of single house-double beneficiaries in 10 gram panchayats. The exact amount of money misappropriated in the scam is yet to be estimated. Exercising his powers conferred under Karnataka Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules 1957, Mr. Gangwar took action and has also directed the suspended officers not to leave their headquarters without the permission of the competent authority. “Our action against the Panchayat Development Officers is interim and based on a preliminary inquiry report. The exact amount of money misappropriated is yet to be estimated in further investigation. We will then proceed for recovery. The presidents and vice-presidents of the gram panchayats who signed the gram panchayat meeting proceedings and the beneficiaries, apart from the Panchayat Development Officers, are involved in the scam. And, all of them have to be held responsible. So, the exact amount of misappropriation and recovery ratio will be decided after the completion of investigation,” Mr. Gangwar told The Hindu .  Inquiry has revealed that actually one house was built and money for two houses was withdrawn showing two beneficiaries but the amount misappropriated is yet to be established||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seven-pdos-suspended-for-housing-irregularities/article33755007.ece

05 February 2021||BENGALURU,||HAL planning to export light combat aircraft||Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) is actively looking for exports of the Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA) with countries in South East Asia and West Asia showing interest in buying it, HAL Chairman and Managing Director R. Madhavan said on Thursday. Each LCA MK1A jet would cost Rs. 306 crore. Giving a break-up of the Rs. 48,000-crore deal for 83 LCAs for the IAF, he said, “As far as the order is concerned, if you remove the tax part of it, it’s worth about Rs. 36,000 crore, out of which close to Rs. 6,000 crore directly goes to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), and as we are supplying ground support equipment and other things, another Rs. 3,000 crore is expected to go towards Indian partners.” Further, Rs. 2,200 crore is the exchange rate variation while the Customs and taxes came to around Rs. 7,000 crore, together making around Rs. 9,000 crore. Also, Rs. 11,000 crore would be used for ground support equipment, spares and training aids and manuals. “If you remove all this, the total order is about Rs. 25,000 crore,” Mr. Madhavan said. The cost of each LCA-MK1A was Rs. 309 crore and the trainer Rs. 280 crore which, Mr. Madhavan said, was a very competitive price. The indigenous content of the aircraft was about 52%. HAL was looking at ways to increase it to 65%. It would be offering the same version that was in service with the IAF to friendly foreign countries and at the same price. At Aero India, HAL received the Request For Proposal (RFP) from the IAF for the basic trainer aircraft HTT-40. The documents were handed over to Mr. Madhavan by Deputy Chief of the Air Force Air Marshal Sandeep Singh and V. L. Kantha Rao, Director General (Acquisition). The RFP is for 70 aircraft with additional clause for 38 more. The certification will be given against the requirements and production will take place at HAL’s two manufacturing units at Bengaluru and Nasik. Unmanned fighter HAL also announced an ambitious futuristic project for the development of an unmanned fighter jet, which would be controlled by a manned aircraft called ‘manned–unmanned’ teaming and be able to strike deep inside the enemy territory called Combat Air Teaming System (CATS). A senior HAL official termed the project the “dream and future of HAL”. It would consist of CATS Hunter, CATS Warrior and Alpha-S, all of which are unmanned systems and would be controlled by a manned mother aircraft, a fighter jet, being customised around a LCA and Jaguar aircraft. “We will be ready to fly it in four-five years time and have put in Rs. 400 crore of our own money on the CATS warrior.” The CATS warrior would be armed and be able to strike deep inside the enemy territory, while the mothership would be in the Indian territory. It would be powered by the HAL engine that was powering pilotless target aircraft Lakshya .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hal-planning-to-export-light-combat-aircraft/article33754837.ece
05 February 2021||New Delhi,||Lok Sabha sees repeated disruptions||The Lok Sabha witnessed repeated disruptions on Thursday as a united Opposition insisted on having a separate discussion on the farm laws instead of clubbing it with the motion thanking the President’s Address to a joint sitting of Parliament. The aggressive stance by the Congress-led Opposition exposed the differences with the Congress on breaking the deadlock, as the Rajya Sabha had agreed to club the issue of farm laws with the Motion of Thanks debate. Between adjournments, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla met the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi to break the deadlock. Before the proceedings for the day ended, the Lok Sabha managed to run the Zero Hour — when individual MPs can raise important issues — for about 40 minutes, without the participation of the Opposition MPs. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi kept up the pressure on the government by devising a common strategy with the floor leaders of like-minded parties to press for a separate debate on the farm bills. “It is absolutely essential”, he is learnt to have told Opposition leaders from Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), National Conference, Shiv Sena, Communist Party of India (CPI), CPI (Marxist), Aam Admi Party (AAP) and the All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). In the midst of sloganeering, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also introduced a bill to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. As soon as the Lok Sabha proceedings started at 4 p.m., Opposition members rushed to the Well of the House and started sloganeering. Senior leaders, including Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi party, Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and Kanimozhi and T.R. Baalu from the DMK, were seen displaying posters against the farm laws. Though Mr. Birla continued the Question Hour for nearly 15 minutes, he adjourned the House after Opposition refused to heed to his advice to return to their seats. When the House resumed at 5 p.m., BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi was on the Chair and asked the Law Minister to introduce his bill. Urging the Opposition members to return to their seats, Ms. Lekhi said MPs were making “a mockery of themselves”. Several MPs, including Dayanidhi Maran (DMK), Danish Ali (BSP) and Mahua Moitra (BSP), were seen wearing black masks that said “I stand with the farmers”. Nationalist Congress Party’s Supriya Sule had distributed them just before the House resumed at 5 p.m. After that the Lok Sabha was adjourned three times before resuming at 8.30 p.m. to run the Zero Hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lok-sabha-sees-repeated-disruptions/article33754848.ece
05 February 2021||New Delhi,||Rajpath revamp gets rolling||The government’s Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project began on Thursday with Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri performing a “ bhoomi pujan ” at India Gate, a Ministry statement said. After the construction of the new Parliament building began last month, the redevelopment of the avenue becomes the second part of the government’s larger Central Vista revamp project to begin. The avenue, which stretches from North and South Block till India Gate, and includes Rajpath and its lawns and Vijay Chowk, is three km long. “This was originally designed to be a grand processional pathway to the Viceroy’s House during the British Raj. It was appropriated by the people of India and their government at Independence...It is the most frequently visited place and important tourist attraction in Delhi. However, it lacks public amenities like toilets, pathways, designated vending zones, parking, proper lighting, signage etc.,” the Ministry said. The redevelopment project, which is scheduled to be completed in time for the Republic Day Parade in 2022, would include refurbishment of the landscaping, increasing green cover from 3.5 lakh square metres to 3.9 lakh square metres, and a new irrigation system, the statement said. Public amenities Public toilets, drinking water facilities and a vending area would be constructed at 10 spots along the avenue, it said. Underpasses at Janpath and a C-Hexagon crossing with Rajpath would be built, it said. Walkways and bridges over the canals, which would be refurbished, would be constructed to provide better connectivity with the parking and amenities at 12 locations, it said. For Republic Day celebrations, foldable seating arrangements would be made to replace the temporary structures that are installed and removed every year, it said. “The objective of the proposal is to make the Avenue an icon that truly befits New India. This will come out to be one of the best Central Vista Avenue[s] of the world,” the Ministry said. The project will cost Rs. 608 crore and it has been cleared by the Delhi Urban Art Commission, the Heritage Conservation Committee, the Central Vista Committee and the local body, the Ministry said. The project was awarded to Shapoorji Pallonji & Company Private Limited on January 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajpath-revamp-gets-rolling/article33754855.ece
05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Anti-drug campaign to be launched||The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry would launch a senior citizens’ helpline called Elderline, start an anti-drugs campaign with 13,000 youth volunteers and roll out the revamped Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for Scheduled Caste students in 2021-2022, a top official said on Thursday. Secretary of the Department of SJ&E R. Subrahmanyam said the allocation for the Ministry for the coming financial year was its highest-ever — Rs. 10,517.62 crore, 28% more than the outlay in the revised estimate of Rs. 8,207.56 crore for 2020-2021, he said. The overall allocation for the welfare of the SCs by all Ministries had increased by 51.65% from Rs. 83,256.62 crore in the 2020-2021 BE to Rs. 1,26,259.20 crore in the BE for 2021-2022, the Ministry said. Mr. Subrahmanyam said the 31 schemes of the department had been restructured into 19. He said contradictory and overlapping schemes were streamlined leading to improved synergy. Among the schemes mentioned by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was the Post Matric Scholarship scheme, for which Rs. 5,000 crore would be spent every year. Under the new model, 60% of the funds would be given by the Centre and 40% by the States. Mr. Subrahmanyam said the Centre would transfer its share into the accounts of the beneficiaries once the State’s share is transmitted. He said the department was in talks with the States for August 15 and January 26 as the two dates in a year for transferring the scholarship amounts. The department would be launching special schemes under the Senior Citizen Welfare Fund for helping start-ups that have come up with products and services for the elderly, the Ministry said. The Elderline would be launched to take distress calls and help senior citizens resolve their problems. The Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyan in 272 districts would be strengthened with 13,000 youth volunteers to spread the message of “say no to drugs”, the official said. Mr. Subrahmanyam said the project monitoring unit would be strengthened and physical inspections of all institutions funded by the department would be carried out. He said the unit had recently found that 280 institutions were ‘malfunctioning’ and grants had been stopped to 201 of them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anti-drug-campaign-to-be-launched/article33754864.ece
05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Health is not just about COVID-19’||India’s health expenditure programme is not just about COVID-19, just like spending after the 2004 tsunami could not have focused only on disaster management, Expenditure Secretary T.V. Somanathan told The Hindu , launching a strong defence against the criticism of the allocation for the health sector in the 2021-22 Budget. Responding to critiques citing a 137% hike in allocations for health and well-being by including spending on water and sanitation, Mr. Somanathan said even the World Health Organisation stressed that water and sanitation were crucial for basic healthcare. “In a normal year, India doesn’t suffer from COVID-19. It suffers from diarrhoea, malaria and dengue, with diarrhoeal diseases accounting for most of our child deaths. Lack of sewerage, stagnant water, non-disposal of solid and liquid waste, and absence of clean water are very major problems in Indian health in a non-pandemic year,” he said. “Our health expenditure programme is not a COVID-19 expenditure programme; the COVID-19 part is the Rs. 35,000 crore provided for vaccines. We are building health infrastructure for the future, not for 2020. In 2004, we had the tsunami, but you have not had a tsunami since. If you planned all your budgets on preventing a tsunami, everything that you would have spent since 2004 would have been wasted,” he said. The 137% hike mentioned in the Budget speech was also not an “apples vs mangoes” comparison, as it included last year’s water and sanitation spending, along with healthcare expenditure, he pointed out. While the Rs. 71,000 crore allocation for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was 10% higher than 2020-21, Mr. Somanathan said taking the Rs. 35,000 crore for the vaccine into account, it reflected a 56% hike. On vaccines Moreover, Rs. 13,192 crore had been granted to the States and local bodies for health on the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendation. “I heard someone say vaccine is not health. Maybe vaccine is space research, but I may be wrong. Then somebody questioned how can you count Finance Commission grants, but if the Commission gives a grant from Central revenues for health, in my book, that is health. It was not there last year,” he said. “There is also a provision for the Ministry of Ayush, which is up 40%, health research is up 25%, and drinking water is up 200%. It is not correct to assume that only doctors, nurses and medicines are health. So I would submit that this is not a fair criticism,” he said. The Rs. 35,000 crore allocation for vaccines could cover as many as 50 crore people at an estimated cost of Rs. 700 a person for administering both doses, but no decision had been made on the funding mechanism for vaccines beyond the three crore health workers in the first phase (whose cost the Centre is footing). “Hypothetically, if the whole cost was covered, it will vaccinate 50 crore out of a population of 130 crore. That would take us to 53 crore vaccinations, and it is possible we may have reached herd immunity, or maybe we would not. That is why the Finance Minister said we are committed to providing more if it is required,” Mr. Somanathan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-are-building-health-infrastructure-for-the-future/article33754883.ece
05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||In RS, Opposition observes silence for 194 dead farmers||Opposition parties on Thursday observed a two-minute silence in the Rajya Sabha to pay tributes to 194 farmers who died in the past few months during the farmers’ protest on the Delhi borders. Manoj K. Jha (Rashtriya Janata Dal), who opened the debate, accused the government of holding a monologue instead of a dialogue. The Delhi border was more fortified than India’s international borders, he said. “With folded hands, I request you to please understand the pain of farmers. In harsh winter, you stopped water supply and toilet facilities, dug trenches, put barbed wires, and installed spikes.” Mr. Jha hit out at the government for its alleged aversion to dissent. “The greatest act of patriotism is to speak about the well-being of the nation, and that does not mean that I should stand in the orchestra party of the government forever and always,” he said. Bihar ended minimum support price (MSP)-based crop procurement in 2006 and it now had only contractual labourers and not farmers. “Bihar has been turned into a labour-supply State. You want a Bihar model in Punjab and Haryana?” he asked. Deve Gowda’s plea Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda appealed to the government to resolve the issue amicably. He said the government could not end the protest by punishing farmers. In a nearly hour-long speech, Trinamool leader Derek O’ Brien alleged that the government had failed on all accounts. “In these times, we must be thankful for small freedoms like the freedom to speak without the mike being muted, like the freedom to speak without the video feed being censored, like the freedom to speak and express ourselves in this Council of States as per the rules without being dragged out by marshals,” he said. The first account of government failure was in upholding the sanctity of Parliament, he said referring to September last year, when the three farm rules were passed in the Rajya Sabha amid pandemonium. “How, in our small way, can we bow our heads to these 194 farmers who passed away? Sometimes words are not enough. So, me and my colleagues will stand in silence in tribute to the farmers who lost their lives,” he said. The entire Opposition, following, stood up as a tribute to the farmers who lost their lives in the movement. Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party said, “Adani’s application to change land use of 100 acres was pending with Haryana government. It was cleared in May, and in June, the farm ordinances were signed.” He asked if farmers were from an enemy country that Internet had been blocked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-rs-opposition-observes-silence-for-194-dead-farmers/article33754844.ece

On January 31, when 11 deaths of health care and frontline workers were reported following administration of Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine, nearly two-dozen scientists wrote to Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan and Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) V.G. Somani, urging them to urgently investigate them. They requested that findings of the causality assessment made by the AEFI Committee be made public. As on February 4, less than three weeks after COVID-19 vaccination began on January 16, there have been 16 deaths. In all these cases, the district or State officials have stated that the deaths were unrelated to the vaccine. But so far, no reports of the district, State and National AEFI Committeeshave been released. “Please place complete information on all deaths, severe and serious AEFIs in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and their investigation, in the public domain,” the letter states. Most of the 16 deaths in people in the 23 to 56 year age group so far have been ascribed to cardiovascular problems or stroke and the causal link to the vaccine has been ruled out in each case. Allaying the concerns raised by the scientists and others, Dr. N.K. Arora, Advisor to the National AEFI Committee told The Hindu that the Committee met on Monday and would again meet on Friday (February 5). “In causality assessment, deaths are of highest importance. Once causality assessment is done, we will put out the information in the public domain. Even if causality assessment is completed in one case, we will make the information available in the public domain,” he said. Dr. Arora also said, “The causality assessment by the National AEFI Committee will be on a rolling basis. This is because we want everyone to know if the vaccine caused the deaths.” ‘Establish cause’ “The sequence (death following vaccination) is not evidence of consequence,” said virologist Dr. Jacob John, one of the signatories. “Causality association is through exclusion. The time relationship of the deaths with vaccination should be explained, for which alternative cause should be established through investigation,” he added. “Only then can the vaccine be exonerated. If you can’t find any cause of death in a young person, then you have to attribute the cause of death to the vaccine. The vaccine as a biological cause is least likely to cause death. The adenovirus vector and the genetic material that helps in making the spike protein are unlikely to cause death. But other ingredients and the vaccine quality in the batches used in these situations should be investigated,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-death-reports-will-be-published-panel-adviser/article33754869.ece
05 February 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Nana Patole resigns||In a major political development, Maharashtra Assembly Speaker and senior Congress leader Nana Patole on Thursday submitted his resignation to the Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal. Mr. Patole is likely to be appointed as the next State Congress president. “I have submitted my resignation as per the directions from my leaders. I am free now and will be working for the party interests,” Mr. Patole said. When asked whether he would be the next State Congress chief, Mr. Patole said that he had not received any intimation regarding this, and irrespective of the post, he would start working to expand the party in Maharashtra. “I do not know whether I will be given the responsibility or not. I am a man of organisation. I have worked as the all-India head of the Congress’ farmers’ cell. At a time when farmers across the country are united against three farm laws, it will be my duty to strengthen the ongoing agitation,” he said. Mr. Patole had held a meeting with top Congress leaders three days ago, and since then it had been rumoured that he would be the new State Congress president. Sources within the Congress said that the announcement of a new State president would be made shortly. “State party in-charge H.K. Patil has submitted his report and the name will be announced shortly,” a senior party leader said. Disturbance in MVA Mr. Patole’s resignation, which is seen as part of the Congress’ internal restructuring, has created disturbance within the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra. Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar while speaking to reporters in Delhi said that the Assembly Speaker’s post was now open, hinting that the Congress would not get it back easily. Sources said that Mr. Pawar was not happy with the Congress’ decision to ask Mr. Patole to resign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-assembly-speaker-nana-patole-resigns/article33755079.ece
05 February 2021||New Delhi,||T.N. Governor on same page as Centre||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit has refrained from taking a call on a plea for the early release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict A.G. Perarivalan. He said the President of India was the “appropriate competent authority” to deal with Perarivalan’s request for freedom. “His Excellency the Governor of Tamil Nadu considered all the facts on record and after perusal of the relevant documents, recorded that the Honourable President of India is the appropriate competent authority to deal with the request for remittance vide his order dated January 25, 2021. The proposal received by the Central government will be processed in accordance with law,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) informed the Supreme Court in a short affidavit on Thursday. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao is scheduled to take up the case on February 9. MHA affidavit The MHA affidavit highlighted that the case against Perarivalan concerned the assassination of none other than a former Prime Minister of India. Forty-three other people sustained serious injuries in the bomb explosion at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu in 1991. On January 21, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Governor, had submitted that Perarivalan’s plea for early release would be considered in a week. Mr. Mehta’s statement in court at the time had come as relief for Perarivalan’s family and lawyers. By not taking a decision on the pardon plea, the Governor is now on the same page as the Centre, which had opened a novel line of argument in the Supreme Court that pleas for pardon and release should go to the President instead of the Governor. The Centre had, for the first time, raised the point about the Tamil Nadu Governor’s power to grant remission to Perarivalan under Article 161 of the Constitution in November 2020. But senior advocate Sankaranarayanan and advocate Prabu Ramasubramanian, for Perarivalan, had countered that a convict was free to choose between the President and the Governor for pardon. They had, to this extent, referred to the Constitution Bench’s judgment in the Union of India versus Sriharan of December 2015, which said the “exercise of executive clemency” was “vested in the President or the Governor”. The Tamil Nadu State Cabinet had, on September 9, 2018, recommended that the Governor pardon all seven convicts in the assassination case, including Perarivalan, serving life imprisonment. The Governor, however, had not acted on the recommendation for more than two years, prompting Perarivalan to approach the Supreme Court about the delay. Even the top court had termed the Governor’s delay “extraordinary”. Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswamiexpressed hope in the State Assembly that the Governor would take a favourable decision in view of the State government’s representation insisting on the release of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

05 February 2021||New Delhi,||Cabinet okays Bill on powers of Delhi L-G||The Union Home Ministry is all set to introduce legislation in the Budget session of Parliament to amend a 1991 Act pertaining to the powers and functions of the Delhi government and the Lieutenant-Governor (L-G). The proposed legislation received the Union Cabinet’s approval on Wednesday. The Bill is likely to clearly define the powers of the L-G and the Delhi government on the lines of the Supreme Court judgment of February 2019. It is likely to give more teeth to the LG’s office. A Supreme Court Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and Ashok Bhushan had, other than the question of services, given a unanimous verdict on the role of the two authorities. The services plea has been referred to a larger Bench of the court and the hearing is yet to conclude. In the February 14, 2019 verdict, the court upheld as “legal” the Ministry’s May 21 and July 23, 2015 notifications authorising the L-G to exercise powers in relation to services and directing the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) police not to take cognisance of offences against Central government officials. SC confirms HC findings The court confirmed the Delhi High Court’s finding that the ACB’s jurisdiction is confined to Delhi officials and statutory bodies and does not extend to Central government officials. Last year, the Ministry notified the rules for the newly created Union Territory of J&K, where it said that in case of difference of opinion between the L-G and a Minister when no agreement could be reached even after a month, the “decision of the Lieutenant-Governor shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Council of Ministers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cabinet-okays-bill-on-powers-of-delhi-l-g/article33754861.ece
05 February 2021||Thrissur,||Centre paying special attention to Kerala: Nadda||The United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) are two sides of the same coin and are corrupt and non-performing, Bharatiya Janata Party president J.P. Nadda has said. Addressing a public meeting at Thekkinkadu Maidan here on Thursday to kick-start the party’s campaign for the Assembly elections, Mr. Nadda said both fronts lacked vision and were facing ideological bankruptcy. The State machinery was steeped in corruption and law and order had taken a turn for the worse. Leaders of both fronts defamed the image of the State, he said. “If one has a passion for gold, other one has an interest in solar energy. And there is a shadow of women in both cases. The Speaker has brought shame for the post.” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was alleging witch-hunting by the Centre against his government. By questioning the Comptroller and Auditor General report, the LDF was unleashing attacks on constitutional institutions, he said. “The Modi government is giving special attention to Kerala,” Mr. Nadda said. He said the Centre has allotted Rs. 19,000 crore to reduce revenue deficit of the State. The country was witnessing the benefit of choosing the right person to power. Listing an array of fund allocation for Kerala, he said the Prime Minister had transferred Rs. 500 each for three months to 20 crore women in the country. Around 47 lakh people benefited in the State. Over two lakh women got free gas connection under the Ujjwala project and two lakh toilets were built in the State. Funds had been allocated for six mega projects for infrastructure development, he said. Mr. Nadda said the LDF government had messed up COVID-19 management in the State. “Initially they were tom-tomming the Kerala model. Now Kerala has half of the COVID burden in the country. Now the Kerala Health Minister says its is because of population density of the State.” Stressing that only the BJP stood with Ayyappa devotees, he alleged that the Congress back-stabbed them. “The Congress kept mum at the time of the issue. Now, the Congress says it will bring a resolution to end the Sabarimala issue.”   Sobha Surendran, State vice president who has been staying away from party functions, attended the functions on Thursday. Former Director General of Police Jacob Thomas joined the BJP on Thursday. He received membership from Mr. Nadda at a public meeting in Thrissur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-paying-special-attention-to-kerala/article33754828.ece

This is the third alliance after the ones led by the BJP and the Congress in Assam ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. “I met Akhil Gogoi at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital today [Thursday] and finalised the alliance. The formal announcement will be made soon,” AJP president Lurinjyoti Gogoi said. The AJP president was the general secretary of the All Assam Students’ Union, which had formed the party in September 2020 along with the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad. “The regional parties will fight together against the national and communal parties to form the next government,” he said. Gogoi under treatment Mr. Gogoi was arrested in December 2019 after the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that claimed at least five lives. He is undergoing treatment at the Guwahati hospital. The Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), ditched by the BJP, could join the AJP-RD alliance. “A decision on the alliance will be taken on or after February 15. The alliance will be with an anti-BJP force,” BPF leader Kampa Borgoyari said, admitting that his party was looking for a suitable ally. The BPF is also weighing the option of joining the Congress-led grand alliance whose constituents are the All India United Democratic Front led by perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal, three Left parties and the regional Anchalik Gana Morcha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ajp-jailed-activist-akhil-gogois-party-seal-pre-poll-pact/article33755230.ece
05 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Barricades prevent MPs from meeting farmers at Ghazipur||A delegation of 15 Opposition MPs on Thursday went to the Ghazipur border to see the situation at the farmers’ protest site, heavily barricaded by the Delhi Police, and meet those protesting against the three Central farm laws for more than two months. Shiromani Akali Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who coordinated the visit, said because of unprecedented barricading, they could not meet the farmers. Describing it as “the high-handedness of the government”, she said. “We are elected representatives who want to meet their own people, but we were not being allowed. We were made to alight 3 km before the border,” she told presspersons. She was accompanied by Supriya Sule of the the NCP, Kanimozhi and Tiruchi Siva of the DMK and Sougata Roy of the the Trinamool. Members of the National Conference, Rashtriya Loktrantik Party and the Indian Union Muslim League were also part of the delegation. Ms. Badal, who resigned from the Union Cabinet in September against the government decision to implement the farm laws, said the Lok Sabha Speaker was not allowing a discussion on the farmers’ protest. The purpose of the visit, she said, was to inform the Speaker about the situation at the protest site. “We are here to gather first-hand information so that we can discuss this issue [farmer protest] in Parliament.” She took on the Delhi Police for the heavy barricading that rendered any movement impossible. “It’s unprecedented. The fortification is like that at the Pakistan border,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/barricades-prevent-mps-from-meeting-farmers-at-ghazipur/article33754842.ece

In a press statement, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of farmer unions, said that the information compiled by them had put the number of missing persons at 21, and first information reports had been registered against 125 farmers. Legal help desks have been set up on every border. Action was constantly being taken in relation to all these cases, it said. The Morcha reiterated the demand for the immediate reinstatement of Internet services disrupted by the government. Various farm organisations are gearing up their efforts jointly and individually to ensure the success of the nationwide road block planned for February 6. Haryana Kisan Sabha vice-president Inderjit Singh said the farmers would appeal to people to not travel between noon and 3 p.m. on February 6, and express solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ struggle. He clarified that ambulances, women in labour, serious patients and any other emergency vehicles would be facilitated during the road block.  The ANI quoted BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait as saying that the “ chakka jam” (road blockade) will not take place in Delhi and those stuck in it would be given food and water. Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav said the blockade would be laid only on National and State Highways and for only three hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/21-protesters-missing-since-republic-day-farmer-unions/article33754845.ece

05 February 2021||S. Anil RadhakrishnanTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Vehicle registration down by 6.36%||Deviating from the compounded annual growth rate of above 10% for the past two decades, the growth of vehicle population in Kerala has decreased by 6.36% in 2020 over the previous year’s 10.7%. The number of newly registered vehicles in 2019-2020 was 8,49,200 in the State compared to 12,92,295 vehicles registered in 2018-2019. Of the new vehicles that hit the road, 65% were motorcycles (5,85,740), 22% four wheelers (1,91, 891), goods vehicles and autorickshaws 5% each, buses 1% and tractors, tillers and others 2%. The number of vehicles having valid registrations as on March 31, 2020 is 1,41,84,184 against 1,33,34,984 in the previous year. This for the first time since 2015-16 that the vehicle registrations have shown a decline. In 2015-16, the percentage increase over the previous year was 8. The growth was 8% in 2016-2017, 9% in 2017-2018 and 10.7% in 2018- 2019. The highest growth of vehicle population of 17% over the previous year was in 2012-2013. Kerala’s number of vehicles per 1,000 population as on March 2019 is 425 compared to the country’s 18 per 1,000 population, China’s 47 and United States’ 507 as per the World Development Indicators of 2015. Ernakulam has the highest district-wise growth of motor vehicles with 20,55,842 (14.49%) followed by Thiruvananthapuram (17,72,975; 12.49%). The lowest number of 2,35,759 vehicles is in Wayanad (1.66%). The two-wheeler registration as of September 2020 was 51,979 against 56,171 in the same period in 2019, a decline of 7.46%. During the same period, the number of three-wheelers registered in the State has also gone down from 2,600 to 1,182 — a decrease of 54.54%. “The decline in vehicle population is mainly due to the economic recession that has affected low income and middle income groups following the two successive floods in Kerala,” says highway engineering expert and former Natpac Director B.G. Sreedevi. Revenue goes up However, the revenue earned by the Kerala Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) through vehicle tax has gone up from Rs. 3,625.31 crore in 2018-2019 to Rs. 4,582.92 crore in 2019-2020, registering an increase of 26.41%.

The Assembly said its summons did no harm compared to the ‘draconian’ actions being taken by the Centre against some social media platforms. “The Delhi Assembly is not doing anything to Facebook compared to what Centre is doing with other platforms which is completely draconian in nature. This is a fanciful case here,” senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for the Assembly, submitted before a Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul.

05 February 2021||KOCHI,||‘Sorry Maria’: Malayalis have change of heart||The former tennis player and multiple Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova probably had no clue what hit her when the comments section of her her Facebook page was flooded with Malayalam comments a few years ago. The Russian-born would have had a feeling of déjà vu if she happened to scroll through her social media page on Thursday. For, Malayalis are at it again. Rihanna’s tweet If initially Ms. Sharapova was derided by Malayalis for being honest about not having ever heard about Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar, which they found disrespectful, they have gathered on her Facebook wall since Wednesday night apologising for their earlier act. The trigger seems to be a tweet by the former cricketer, known as ‘God of Cricket’ among his legions of fans, as part of identical tweets on India’s unity sent out by celebrities in response to international pop star Rihanna expressing solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ strike in India. The Malayalis who flocked to the ace tennis player’s social media page obviously did not like the cricketer’s latest stance, which they perceive to be pro-establishment. The comments in Malayalam range from outright funny to plain abusive of the cricketer, though the common thread running through them all seems to be an apology to the tennis star for deriding her previously for the sake of a man who has let them down. One user even posted the YouTube link of a song from Malayalam movie Devasuram, starring Mohanlal, which essentially depicts the hero seeking forgiveness for misunderstanding his father. Another user from Thrissur, while apologising for criticising her, even extends an invitation to attend the famed Thrissur Pooram. “Mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa,” went another comment while observing how the tennis star was right all along in not knowing a man who, he said, had no spine. Another sarcastically condescending comment appreciates ‘Little Maria’ for her ability to separate good from bad while lamenting that the “God” had turned out to be a cheat. “I am the sorry,” commented another Malayali from Doha who sought her forgiveness before offering her Shawarma and Kuzhimanthi, two Arabian delicacies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malayalis-flood-sharapovas-fb-page-this-time-to-apologise/article33755176.ece

Rajkumar, who was taken into custody on June 12, 2019, was kept in illegal detention at the Nedungandam police station till June 15 and brutally assaulted. Later, he was taken Idukki Taluk Hospital and Kottayam Medical College Hospital for treatment. The police officials had threatened Rajkumar not to reveal to the magistrate about the torture he underwent at the police custody. Rajkumar, who was send to judicial custody on June 20, died the next day, according to the CBI. Though the cause of his death was initially identified as pneumonia, a re-autopsy held revealed that he had sustained 22 injuries. New guidelines The Kerala High Court had issued a set of new guidelines asking the judicial officers to look for instances of custodial torture when the accused were produced before them. The court had to frame the guidelines as lack of diligence on the part of the judicial officer resulted in the injuries inflicted on the accused by the police escaping her attention, it was noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-charge-sheets-9-in-custodial-murder-case/article33755110.ece

Governor declines to take call on Perarivalan||“His Excellency the Governor of Tamil Nadu considered all the facts on record and after perusal of the relevant documents, recorded that the Honourable President of India is the appropriate competent authority to deal with the request for remittance vide his order dated January 25, 2021. The proposal received by the Central government will be processed in accordance with law,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) informed the Supreme Court in a short affidavit on Thursday. The MHA affidavit highlighted that the case against Perarivalan concerned the assassination of none other than a former Prime Minister of India. Forty-three other people sustained serious injuries in the bomb explosion at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu in 1991. “Pertinently, the offence committed was pertaining to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India, by means of detonating a bomb which resulted in the killing of 18 innocent individuals and causing serious injuries to 43 other persons,” the MHA noted. On January 21, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Governor, had submitted that Perarivalan’s plea for early release would be considered in a week. Mr. Mehta’s statement in court at the time had come as relief for Perarivalan’s family and lawyers. In fact, the Tamil Nadu State Cabinet had, on September 9, 2018, recommended the Governor pardon all seven convicts in the assassination case, including Perarivalan, serving life imprisonment. The Governor, however, had not acted on the recommendation for over two years, prompting Perarivalan to approach the Supreme Court about the delay. Even the apex court had termed the Governor’s delay “extraordinary”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tn-governor-declines-to-take-call-on-perarivalan/article33754839.ece
05 February 2021||Hassan/Bengaluru,||Probe into fraudulent transactions in Sringeri||A probe, led by Inspector General of Registration, has been instituted into suspicious financial transactions involving five people in Sringeri, announced Revenue Minister R. Ashok in the Legislative Assembly. “The report will be submitted in a month,” he informed the House. Earlier, the Sringeri taluk Sub-Registrar had flagged the issue of transfer of government money to private accounts and misuse of office for illegal transactions in his letter written on January 13 to the Chief Secretary. He had pointed out that it may not be a one-off case and needs a larger probe into possibly a larger network. H.S. Cheluvaraju, the Sub-Registrar, in his complaint to the Chief Secretary, had sought an investigation against B.G. Prasanna, resident of Sringeri, H.N. Kiran and P. Nethravathi, computer operators at the Sub-Registrar office in Sringeri, and two officials at the Sringeri taluk Treasury Office. The Sub-Registrar narrated several incidents that prompted him to suspect the transactions. Prasanna registered a document by paying a fee of Rs. 5.32 lakh through a challan from Canara Bank in Sringeri in October 2020. The Sub-Registrar received the success report as the amount was credited to Khajane-2 software of the Treasury Department. However, a few days later, when the officer reviewed the transactions of the whole month, he noticed that the particular transaction had failed. The money was not credited. When the officer brought this to the notice of the bank, another challan was produced to make the payment. “How could the money once credited to the treasury account return?” he wondered. Interestingly, when Prasanna had met the officer seeking appointment for the registration, he had said that he would be registering the property, whose guidance value was Rs. 18 lakh, at Rs. 25 lakh. However, later, he registered the document for Rs. 80 lakh, paying a higher fee. Upon verification, the Sub-Registrar noticed that ahead of the document registration, Prasanna’s bank account was credited with a huge sum from three persons in Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Cheluvaraju suspected that a huge network of people must behind these transactions. The officer also noticed suspicious financial transaction of Prasanna from an account in Bagalkot. He suspected the role Yamunappa, a native of Bagalkot, working as First Divisional Assistant at the Sub-Treasury in Sringeri. He suspected the role of the two computer operators in his office, appointed through an outsourcing agency. Kiran and Nethravathi get a monthly payment of Rs. 10,000. However, they have multiple bank accounts. A complaint was filed against them on charges of registering a government property in the name of their friend. “Both own properties disproportionate to known sources of income. I have written to the department recommending their dismissal,” he said. Besides, the officer noticed suspicious transactions related to documents registered in July 2020. He had consulted the Deputy Treasury Officer of Sringeri in this regard. However, there had been no proper enquiry into the transactions. Citing these issues, Mr. Cheluvaraju had also sought an enquiry into the officer in-charge of the Treasury Office in Sringeri those days. Earlier, when he was Sub-Registrar in T. Narasipur, he had complained to the government about similar developments in departments. “The government should probe the officers of Stamps and Registration, Treasury Department and Banks by the central crime branch and save the government money,” he wrote in the letter to the CS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-ordered-into-fraudulent-transactions-in-sringeri/article33755035.ece
05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Covaxin launch from tomorrow in Telangana||Covaxin in Telangana will be rolled out during COVID-19 vaccination for frontline workers from February 6 to 12. Employees of Municipality, Police, Panchayat Raj, and Revenue departments come under this category of non-healthcare frontline workers. The COVID immunisation drive was launched on January 16 by giving jabs to Healthcare Workers (HCW) from the State Health department. HCWs from private hospital were given the jabs from January 25. Alongside, mop-rounds were conducted for employees from the Health department who missed taking the vaccine. From January 16 to February 4, a total of 1,88,097 beneficiaries were vaccinated, and only Covishield was used for the vaccination. Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao said that they would roll out Covaxin during immunisation for the non-health frontline workers. Beneficiaries who take it have to sign a consent form. Currently, the Health department has around 2.7 lakh doses of Covaxin. There are around 1.87 lakh beneficiaries from Police, Municipality, Panchayat Raj and Revenue departments. Personnel from Central Armed Police Forces, including Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), National Security Guard (NSG), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), too, would be vaccinated from Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-launch-from-tomorrow/article33755491.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||‘One in five Indians exposed to coronavirus’||Experts, however, have previously noted that sero-surveys don’t capture the extent of the spread, and other modelling studies have shown that as much as 50% of the population may have been exposed. In the previous survey, only 5.2% of those sampled in rural areas showed antibodies. It has jumped to 19% in the latest survey. There was a sharp rise across urban and non-urban slum areas, too. In urban slums, it was 31%, nearly twice as much as the previous survey findings of 16%. In “urban non slums” the prevalence this time was 26% compared with 9% in the second survey. About 19.9% of adults sampled in the 18-44 years age group had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as did 25% of children/teenagers (10-17 years), and 23% in those over 45 years. By comparison, in the second survey, only 5.4% of children/teenagers, and 6.9% of those in the 18-44 years age group reported positive for antibodies. The latest sero-survey also separately sampled 7,171 healthcare workers and those who work in hospital settings. Nearly 26% of doctors and nurses have coronavirus antibodies, as did 25.4% of paramedical staff. “We are seeing that infection rates in rural areas, too, are catching up. Recent serosurveys in Delhi, Pune and Hyderabad all show high prevalence in urban settings. The spread is certainly slower in rural areas because of density but that doesn’t mean we are immune from future spikes and it would be wise to probably prioritise vaccination in the villages than cities. The survey also doesn’t account for the possibility of reinfection, or whether we will be more vulnerable to mutant strains,” said a senior epidemiologist who was involved in the survey.  Children not immune The higher prevalence among children or young adults, according to Dr. Samiran Panda, who heads ICMR’s epidemiology division, showed that it was no longer true, as earlier believed, that children or the young were better protected. “Several studies have now established this. They are much less likely to be severely sick but they can be infectious,” he told The Hindu . Another factor was that in the newest survey, the antibody test employed was specifically designed to check for antibodies produced against the spike protein. “This is more sensitive than the one used last time and therefore overall detection rates could be higher,” Dr. Panda said. The ICMR results presented on Thursday have not been formally published in a peer-reviewed journal, and it was only last week that the results of the second survey were published in Lancet Global Health .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/one-in-five-indians-exposed-to-coronavirus/article33754838.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||No nest egg, EPF is goose that lays golden eggs||EPF accounts are mandatory for employees earning up to Rs. 15,000 a month in firms with over 20 workers, with 12% of the basic pay and dearness allowance deducted as employees’ contribution and another 12% remitted by the employer. The government had capped the contributions by employers into employee welfare schemes like the EPF or the National Pension Scheme or a superannuation plan, at Rs. 7.5 lakh a year, in last year’s Budget. However, government as well as private sector employees are allowed to make voluntary contributions over and above the statutory deductions into the general provident fund (GPF) or EPF, respectively. On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that some people went to the extent of contributing Rs. 1 crore each month into such PF accounts. “What would be his salary? For him to get both tax concession and an assured income is not comparable with an employee who earns Rs. 2 lakh and gets 8% return,” she had pointed out. The top 20 HNIs have about Rs. 825 crore in their EPF accounts and the top 100 have over Rs. 2,000 crore, said the Revenue Department official quoted earlier. The largest EPF account has over Rs. 103 crore, followed by two accounts that have over Rs. 86 crore each. “The average normal EPF or GPF contributor would not be affected by the removal of this anomaly in the system prevailing over a long period of time,” the official said. While some tax experts have said this amendment may be applicable retrospectively for interest earned after April 1, 2021 on past contributions over Rs. 2.5 lakh, Revenue Department sources said it will apply prospectively. Central Board of Direct Taxes Chairperson P.C. Mody has told The Hindu that taxpayers will be required to include the annual income from contributions beyond Rs. 2.5 lakh into their PF accounts while filing their returns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-nest-egg-epf-is-goose-that-lays-golden-eggs/article33754840.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. has acknowledged farm reform steps: India||The U.S. has reacted to farmers’ protests in India, stating that it encourages dialogue and supports the right to peaceful protest. “We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy, and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same. We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue. In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India's markets and attract greater private sector investment,” a statement from the U.S. Embassy said. Access to information was fundamental to democracy, the U.S. said in reaction to the Haryana government temporarily shutting down mobile Internet services in several districts last week and earlier this week, stating law and order reasons. “We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the Internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy,” the statement said. MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India had noted the U.S. reaction. “It is important to see such comments in the context in which they were made and in their entirety,” Mr. Srivastava said. “As you can see, the U.S. State Department has acknowledged steps being taken by India towards agricultural reforms.” Protests must be viewed in the context of India’s “democratic ethos and polity”, Mr. Srivastava said. “India and the United States are both vibrant democracies with shared values. The incidents of violence and vandalism at the historic Red Fort on January 26 have evoked similar sentiments and reactions in India as did the incidents on the Capitol Hill on January 6 and are being addressed as per our respective local laws,” he said, adding that the Internet shutdown was in place temporarily to prevent “further violence”. To a question about allegations of North American Sikh separatist organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) getting involved in the farmers’ protest, Mr. Srivastava said the government had asked the U.S. government to investigate the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-differences-can-be-resolved-through-talks/article33754849.ece
05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Former IFS officers back India’s provision of MSP||A group of former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officers have released an open letter, asking the developed countries “not to be on the wrong side of history” in the backdrop of increasing international statements in favour of the farmers’ protest. “Sustainable agriculture demands that farmers adopt the latest technology to diversify their production, and the farm laws passed by the government is a step in this direction,” the former IFS officers said, while backing India’s provision of minimum support price (MSP), something criticised by the developed countries as an unfair practice. In the statement, the 20 signatories decried attempts to disrupt India’s sovereign prerogatives. “Obviously, you cannot have your cake and eat it too. The balance between market forces and food security/farmers’ welfare is a delicate one and it is the sovereign prerogative of governments to strike that balance,” they said. The signatories included Ajay Swarup, Mohan Kumar, Veena Sikri , Vishnu Prakash and J.S. Sapra. The statement has come in the backdrop of several international personalities, including celebrities, supporting the farmer unions’ agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-ifs-officers-back-indias-provision-of-msp/article33754867.ece

Interacting with the media via video conference, the Minister said Railways was being cautious so that it did not become the source of an increase in COVID-19 cases. “The fight against COVID-19 has not fully ended. Vaccination drive has gathered momentum and we hope we will soon win against COVID-19. Only post that will full operations be possible. However, currently 60% or 6,757 trains are operational,” he said.  Allocation for Bengal Replying to a query, Mr. Goyal noted that the railway budget allocation of Rs. 6,636 crore for West Bengal, which would soon go to the polls, was the highest ever earmarked for the State. “Projects there remain incomplete or are delayed because the State governments, first the Left Front government and now the TMC, have been unable to provide land. Projects that are 45 years old are pending in the State,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/60-of-pre-covid-19-trains-are-back-on-track/article33754870.ece

He said the FIR was registered under IPC Sections 124A (sedition), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). It appeared that there was a plan to wage a social, cultural and economic war against India. The police said the farmers may not be aware of forces guiding their actions and setting their agenda, but there were clear indicators that hostile “deep state actors” were either behind it or would join in to exploit the sentiments. The “toolkit”, the police said, had a section titled, “Prior action plan” about “digital strikes” to be conducted through hashtags on and before January 26, tweetstorms from January 23, physical action on January 26, and joining the farmers’ march into Delhi and back to the borders. “If you go by the unfolding of events, including the violence of January 26, it reveals a copycat execution of the action plan,” Mr. Ranjan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-police-to-probe-international-conspiracy/article33754822.ece

He said that several instances of violations of COVID appropriate behaviour by students have come to the attention like mixing in close proximity with other students without facial masks and leaving the isolation facility for departments before the mandatory 7-day period ends. He said three M.Sc. students from the School of Life Sciences tested positive in the last five days.

05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Get loan apps blocked, Telangana HC tells DGP||Telangana High Court on Thursday instructed the Director General of Police to take immediate steps to ensure the mobile phone loan apps were blocked. Hearing a PIL plea on the instances of some citizens ending their lives due to harassment by loan app operators, the HC instructed the DGP to approach the sources from where such apps are downloaded and get them blocked for further operations. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said the Police Commissioners of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda would have to file independent reports on such instances and the actions they had initiated to check illegal activities of the loan app operators. The status report to be filed by the DGP would cover all aspects of the loan apps like the reported exorbitant rates of interest being collected from borrowers and instances of suicide reported in different parts of the State. The petitioner Kalyan Dileep Sunkara, an advocate, stated that the loan operators were charging rate of interest ranging from 150% to 450% on weekly or fortnight basis. Those lending loans through such apps were accessing photos and details of the contacts of the borrower once the latter downloads the app. They would start harassing the borrowers by making repeated phone calls to repay the loan amount. They would defame the borrowers by contacting the borrowers’ friends and known persons having accessed their details through the mobile phones, the petitioner said. They were adopting unethical and illegal means to collect the loan amount by accessing personal photos and information of the borrowers. The petitioner sought a direction to ban all such mobile phone loan apps. The matter was posted to March 18 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/get-loan-apps-blocked-telangana-hc-tells-dgp/article33754821.ece
05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Film on Disha to go to larger Censor panel||The examining committee of Central Board of Film Certification has referred certification of Disha Encounter , a crime thriller film produced under the supervision of Ramgopal Verma to depict the ghastly rape and murder of vet Disha, to a larger revising committee as it could not come to a decision. The film whose posters and trailer were released last year and streamed on YouTube was set for release this month. But, Disha’s (name changed) parents approached the High Court saying the movie was turning out to be real time story of the incident that took place on November 26, 2019, on Hyderabad outskirts. The court directed the Centre represented by the Censor Board to act. In response to the directions, a four-member examining committee saw the movie but left the decision to a larger eight-member revising committee as it felt the contents were too sensitive for it to pass certification. The date, time and place of examination of the film will be intimated later. The producers were meanwhile asked to furnish 15 copies of synopsis and songs of the film. They were also asked to ensure that the print of the film was the same as that was shown to the examining committee and no alteration was carried out. The controversy over the film was raised after Disha’s parents raised objections that they were not consulted when it was sought to be produced. Already in pain over the loss of their daughter, they were further being “dragged to roads”. They claimed the storyline was very close to real episode. They did not agree with the contention of producers that the film was aimed to bring awareness among public. However, the film producer Natti Kumar told The Hindu that they were only bringing out whatever was in public domain. It was a modest attempt to see that no one dared raising hand on women after seeing the film. The idea was to send a strong message that “human animals” were still present in society and beware against them. He alleged that hurdles to the film were deliberately set up to target Ramgopal Verma. The film was directed by Anand Verma and has Srikanth, Sonia and Praveen Raj as the main star cast. Four youths who were accused of raping and murdering the woman were killed in an alleged encounter. In that sense the film was titled Disha Encounter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/film-on-disha-to-go-to-larger-censor-panel/article33754824.ece

Bhagavan at the City Civil Court Complex here on Thursday. The accused, Meera Raghavendra, confronted Prof. Bhagavan as he was leaving after attending a hearing in a metropolitan court and threw ink on his face. She accused him of criticising Hinduism and said she was ready to face any action for her action. A gunman and a police constable escorted the writer out of the premises. After a video clip of the attack started circulating on social media, Ms. Meera announced on Twitter that she had “taught him a lesson”. Prof. Bhagavan later filed a complaint with the Halasuru Gate police, based on which an FIR was registered against the lawyer. She was booked for wrongful restraint, assault and criminal intimidation. A few months ago, Ms. Meera had filed a private complaint against Prof. Bhagavan for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The writer’s lawyer, Surya Mukundaraj, said his client would also file complaints against Ms. Meera before the Bar Council and the Advocates Association. Mr. Mukundaraj said: “Attacking Prof. Bhagavan on the court premises despite the presence of security shows that it was a premeditated act and there was a deep-rooted conspiracy that needed a detailed investigation.” In the past, Prof. Bhagavan was provided security after he received threats to his life for his views on Hindu scriptures, notably on Lord Rama and the Bhagavad Gita, and a police case was registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. More recently, the Public Library Book Selection Committee withdrew its recommendation to purchase writer Prof. Bhagavan’s 2018 book “Rama Mandira Eke Beda?” (Why there should be no Rama Mandira) after it was criticised by the right-wing on social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/advocate-booked-for-throwing-ink-on-bhagavan-incident-occurred-when-the-writer-was-leaving-after-attending-a-hearing/article33754833.ece

05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco takes digital route for ease of business||The never-ending complaint of electricity users has been the delay in getting new connections. People constructing a house have always had problems getting new connections. Local officials of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Company (Tangedco) would cite some reason or the other for not giving new connections. The common reasons are shortage of meters, non-availability of underground power cables and delay in getting permission for cutting the road. As a step towards ease of doing business for customers, Tangedco has launched an automation and streamlining procedure to assign new services for both domestic (low tension) as well as industrial consumers (high tension) without much human intervention. Good response Encouraged by the success of the online payment system and in view of the complaints of corruption, the power utility has rolled out an online system to make the process of getting new service connections hassle-free for customers. A senior official of Tangedco said that although it was launched last year before the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become fully functional only from January this year. Customers can visit https://nsc.tnebltd.gov.in/ nsconline/ to apply for new connections. The online system also has the facility to flag delays and provide feedback about the services rendered. Applicants can get details of the status of the application, time frame to get electricity connections (within 30 days as per the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission) and the guidelines to fill up the application forms, he added. The official said completion certificate was not necessary for residential buildings  of up to 12 m in height not exceeding three dwelling units or 750 sq m. For all other types of low-tension connections, the certificate is mandatory. Consumer activist T. Sadagopan, while welcoming Tangedco’s latest customer-friendly initiative, said many were unaware of such a facility being available. He rued that Tangedco had failed to conduct the quarterly voluntary consumer organisations meeting, which would be held at the office of every Superintendent Engineer. ‘Awareness needed’ Officials should take steps to create awareness of the availability of such a facility by issuing pamphlets, putting up display boards at the local electricity offices and sending messages on social media and through local residents welfare association groups. Several consumer and social activists want to highlight the role of licensed electrical contractors in getting new connections. The senior electricity official said this issue had been taken into consideration in the new system, under which the role of the licensed electricity contractor ended with giving the test certificate. The senior electricity official said steps had been taken to implement the online system efficiently with review meetings being held every week. The Chairman and Managing Director had been chairing a monthly meeting with all chief engineers and superintending engineers to prevent delays in giving new connections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-takes-digital-route-for-ease-of-business/article33755442.ece
05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Highway projects progressing at slow pace’||Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Thursday told Parliament that 29 National Highway projects covering 683 km and costing Rs. 10,992 crore was progressing at a slow pace in Tamil Nadu. In a written reply in the Lok Sabha to a question by Dravica Munnetra Kazhagam MP S. Gnanathiraviam, the Minister said the projects were delayed mainly due to land acquisition, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poor performance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, overbridge and underbridge issues with the Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors, etc. According to Mr. Gadkari, some of the projects that were moving at a slower pace included widening the existing two-lane Salem-Tirupathur-Vaniyambadi road to a four-lane one, works on the Kaliyakkavilai-Kanniyakumari and the Kollam-Thirumangalam stretch, widening and strengthening the Natham-Kottampatti section, four-laning the Chettikulam to Natham section, among others. As many as 29 projects were supposed to be completed between 2017 and 2020. In order to ensure the timely completion of the projects and their subsequent maintenance, regular meetings were being held with project developers, State governments and contractors, the Union Minister said. “Regular review meetings are held by the Ministry and the National Highways Authority of India [NHAI] with the regional officers, concessionaires and contractors to make the construction of these projects hassle-free. To expedite its completion, various steps are also being taken, including streamlining of the land acquisition and environmental clearances, exit for equity investors, premium rescheduling, close coordination with other Ministries and revamping of the dispute resolution mechanism,” the Union Minister added. To another question by Congress MP Manickam Tagore, Mr. Gadkari said the repair and rectification work for a total of 19 National Highway stretches in Tamil Nadu, which were damaged due to the recent rains, had also been undertaken. The cost of repair for eight stretches was approximately Rs. 9.75 crore. There was no cost implication for repairing the remaining 11 stretches as it was within the purview of the contractors and concessionaires, the Union Minister added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/highway-projects-progressing-at-slow-pace-in-state-minister/article33754998.ece

Sectors requiring constant attention for patients — cancer care for instance — came under fire. However, specialists worked hard, coming up with innovations despite the limitations to care for their patients and protect them from fresh infections. On Thursday, Apollo Hospitals decided to recognise this effort and celebrate the work put in by patients, cancer survivors and doctors. A number of cancer survivors and medical specialists were brought together at the cancer awareness programme on the occasion of World Cancer Day at Apollo Proton Cancer Centre, Taramani, in the city on Thursday. The objective of the event was to encourage all agencies involved and show appreciation to all in the process of treatment and care. All those present were asked to leave their hand print on a canvas to express gratitude to every single person involved. Prathap C. Reddy, chairman, Apollo Hospitals, after taking the pledge, initiated the campaign by leaving his hand print on a canvas sheet. He announced Apollo Hospitals’ decision to adopt a village in Chittoor district and help patients there access the best oncology diagnosis and care that was possible.

05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. seeks to curtail time limit for probing co-op fraud||The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday tabled a Bill in the Assembly to reduce the time limit for completing an inquiry, inspection or investigation in connection with cases of fraud or misappropriation at cooperative societies. The Bill, introduced by Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju, said, “The government considers these time limits too long, and in the interests of the societies, fraud or misappropriation should be unearthed expeditiously and recovery of losses expedited.” Sections 81 and 82 of the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1983, provide three months for completion of an inquiry, inspection or investigation. They also provide for an extension of time by six months in the aggregate, as may be permitted by the next high authority. The Bill seeks to reduce these time lines to one month and three months respectively. Section 87 provides for six months for completion of the surcharge action and a further extension of six months in the aggregate, as may be permitted by the next high authority. Here too, the Bill seeks to reduce these time lines to three months and three months respectively. The Bill also seeks to amend the Act so as to refer to the Registrar the disputes between the society and the liquidator of another registered society or between the liquidators of two registered societies. Earlier, only disputes between the society and any other registered society could be referred to the Registrar. The Bill is on the lines of Section 84 of the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam tabled a Bill to replace an ordinance promulgated earlier to amend the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, 1930, and other relevant Acts to ban wagering or betting in cyberspace. It also seeks to make “certain modifications” to the ordinance. Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani introduced two Bills to replace ordinances promulgated earlier to extend the term of office of Special Officers of certain rural and urban local bodies, for six months, up to June 30.

Paulraj can hardly keep the excitement out of their voice while speaking about interacting virtually with Joe Root, captain of the England cricket team, and Sam Curran, who is one of the star players for Chennai Super Kings. “When I told my friends and family about speaking to them, many didn’t believe me. It truly was an opportunity I will cherish,” says Monisha. As part of an interaction organised by the British Deputy High Commission in Chennai recently, Monisha and Paulraj shared on video call with the cricketers their experience of being part of the winning team at the Street Child Cricket World Cup at Lord’s in 2019. Joe Root, from his hotel quarantine in Chennai ahead of the Test series which begins on Friday, and Sam Curran, who was at his home in the U.K., asked the young cricketers how they felt after winning the Street Child World Cup. They also spoke about how much they loved visiting India. “I didn’t even think I would be able to speak to State-level cricketers, but I was overjoyed at being able to interact with both. They spoke to us like we were friends and I loved chatting about the sport,” says Paulraj. For Paulraj, playing cricket at Lord’s was a dream come true. “We didn’t just play, we were also the champions.” Monisha’s and Paulraj’s interest in and passion for the sport was encouraged by Karunalaya, an NGO working with street and working children.

05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||12,494 more persons inoculated in State||A total of 12,494 persons — 10,391 healthcare workers and 2,103 frontline workers — received COVID-19 vaccines in Tamil Nadu on Thursday. Of them, 10,184 healthcare workers and 2,101 frontline workers received Covishield, while 207 healthcare workers and two frontline workers received Covaxin. As many as 1,45,650 persons have been vaccinated thus far. The vaccination was conducted at 564 session sites. The day’s total capacity was 81,600. Harmander Singh, Additional Chief Secretary to the Government, Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department, and S. Divyadharshini, Joint Commissioner of Health, Greater Chennai Corporation, received vaccination at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Noting that there were 664 urban local bodies in the State, Mr. Singh appealed to all frontline workers to get vaccinated. In the Greater Chennai Corporation, 1.5 lakh employees were registered. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan told reporters that 5.62 lakh staff members of the Health Department had registered themselves for vaccination on the Co-WIN portal. “However, some of them have registered in two places. So, roughly, we are expecting around 4.75 lakh beneficiaries. So far, 2.62 lakh frontline workers have been registered, of whom 1.54 lakh are attached to the Police Department and 1.06 lakh to the Municipal Administration and Revenue Departments,” he said. He pointed out there was “unnecessary hesitation” among many persons in the priority groups. “There is no need for such hesitation... Vaccines are very important. A city in Brazil that had 76% herd immunity is witnessing cases again. We are not satisfied that the cases are around 500 a day in Tamil Nadu. We have reduced the case load from 7,000 to 500 in Tamil Nadu and the number of deaths to less than five a day. But the cases have remained in the range of 500 in the last 10 days,” he said. The Health Secretary said the State had sought advance permission from the Centre to start vaccination of the elderly. He said many elderly persons were willing to get vaccinated. “Persons in the priority groups should make use of the next one week. They will have no priority when the vaccination begins for the general public. Frontline workers can register up to February 7,” he said. “We have increased the number of session sites from 166 to 440 and will increase it further, if needed. But the centres should be utilised,” he said. He hoped that the State’s present vaccination coverage of 25% would improve to 50%. “The Centre is reviewing the vaccination coverage. We have not got the permission to open registration for persons aged above 50 on the Co-WIN portal,” he said. “We have written to the Centre to include those who are on the frontline, such as journalists, the judiciary and teachers,” he said. Meanwhile, in Villupuram district, to build confidence, Collector A. Annadurai and senior officials took Covishield jabs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/12494-more-persons-inoculated-in-state/article33755427.ece

05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No room for complacency as State still has clusters: Health Secy.||As fresh infections fell under 500 for the first time in eight months on Thursday, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said there should be no room for complacency as COVID-19 clusters from marriages, family functions and travel had surfaced in some parts of the State. “We do not want complacency as we still have marriage and function-based clusters in districts such as Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Tiruchi and a cluster due to travel in Tiruvannamalai,” he said. In a communication to Collectors and the Commissioner of the Greater Chennai Corporation, he said Coimbatore and Chennai and neighbouring districts showed an increase from the previous day’s count, on and off, while the average for the week did not show any major change. This, he said, might be a pointer to individuals attending functions like marriages, birthdays, political meetings, funerals and closed-door activities in gated communities, contracting the infection and creating localised clusters that could explode if not attended to immediately. He asked officials to keep monitoring adherence to norms as masks were not being worn in most public places. Herd immunity concepts had taken a beating after the sudden rise of cases in a city in Brazil, he added. Coordinated works He urged officials to intensify inter-departmental works, aimed at suppressing transmission of the virus further. “Each of the 500 cases reported in a day has the potential to spread to others if not tracked and treated and the person’s contacts traced,” he said. He noted that vaccine acceptance levels were poor among health and frontline workers, compared to the number of persons registered. He asked them to hold district taskforce meetings, review the progress and plan innovatively to increase vaccine acceptance.

Muraleedharan on Thursday said 12 Indian fishermen and 62 boats were currently in Sri Lankan custody and efforts were on to secure their release, .In a reply to queries raised by Rajya Sabha member Vaiko, Mr. Muraleedharan said in 2020, 74 Indian fishermen were arrested and 11 boats were confiscated by the Sri Lankan authorities. With sustained diplomatic efforts the Centre secured the release of all these fishermen, he said. In January 2021, 12 Indian fishermen were arrested and two boats confiscated by the Sri Lankan authorities and consular access and legal assistance had been provided to them by the Indian High Commission in Colombo and the Consulate in Jaffna, he said. The government had been taking up the issue at high levels through diplomatic channels. “Following the 2+2 initiative in November 2016, when the Foreign and Fisheries Ministers of the two countries met in New Delhi, a bilateral Joint Working Group (JWG) mechanism and meeting of the Ministers for Fisheries of the two countries was institutionalised to address the fishermen issues. On December 30, 2020, the 4th Round of JWG talks was held between the two governments where the entire gamut of issues related to fishermen were discussed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/12-fishermen-in-sri-lankan-custody-mea/article33754995.ece
05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC reserves verdict in Minister’s wealth case||The Madras High Court on Thursday reserved its orders on a writ petition filed in 2013 accusing Milk and Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji of having amassed wealth disproportionate to his known source of income ever since he held the post of vice-president of Tiruthangal Town Panchayat (now a Municipality) in Virudhunagar district in 1996. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha deferred their verdict after senior counsel I. Subramanian and M. Ajmal Khan, representing the Minister, urged the court to close the case and give a quietus to the issue since the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) had conducted a detailed inquiry and given a clean chit to the Minister. On June 12, 2018 the judges had directed the DVAC to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegation by appointing an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer in the rank of Superintendent of Police and to file periodic reports before the court in sealed covers. They said such an inquiry was essential in public interest and in the interest of purity of administration. After filing a series of status reports, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan, in December 2019, informed the court that the DVAC had submitted a negative report to the Vigilance Commissioner on July 27, 2019. The then Vigilance Commissioner Mohan Pyare forwarded the report to the government which, in turn, decided to drop all further proceedings on August 10, 2019. Expressing surprise over the DVAC having conducted a full-fledged investigation in the guise of a preliminary inquiry and without registering a First Information Report (FIR) against the Minister, Justice Sathyanarayanan wondered whether examination of 90 witnesses and collection of 94 documents could be termed as a preliminary inquiry. He also pointed out that the DVAC had submitted a 63-page inquiry report along with supporting documents running to over 700 pages. He went on to state that it was not a case where the DVAC did not find any substance at all. In fact, the DVAC had found the Minister to have possessed assets disproportionate to known sources of his income. Yet, it chose not to prosecute him because the difference between known sources of income and the value of the assets was less than 10 per cent. Stating that the scope of a preliminary inquiry was restricted to find out whether a complaint had made out commission of a cognisable offence or not, the judge asked how the DVAC could go to the extent of according the benefit of 10% permissible variation as per the 1977 Supreme Court judgment in Krishnanand Agnihotri’s case and decide not to prosecute the Minister. Possibly, such a conclusion could be reached after registering a FIR and conducting a full-fledged investigation, but definitely not at the stage of preliminary inquiry, the judge said. In reply, Mr. Khan said ordering a full-fledged investigation at this stage would be a futile exercise when the DVAC had already found that there was no need to prosecute. He also said it was the second time that the DVAC had conducted a preliminary inquiry against the Minister and the government had decided to drop all further proceedings. A similar exercise had been carried out in 2014 too but not satisfied with it, the court had ordered for yet another inquiry in 2018. “Keeping this case pending for nine years itself is a punishment,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-reserves-verdict-in-ministers-wealth-case/article33754975.ece

05 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Decide on age relaxation for differently abled candidates: High court||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed its Registry to take a decision within three months on the issue of amending the judicial service rules for providing age relaxation to physically challenged candidates while recruiting judicial officers. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the direction while disposing of a writ petition filed by Madurai-based advocate V. Packiaraj who had lost the chance of participating in the last recruitment process. His counsel M. Purushothaman brought it to the notice of the court that the petitioner was afflicted with poliomyelitis. Due to his family’s economic and social backwardness, he could complete his law degree only at the age of 35 and then started practice. Stating that he got married thereafter and now had two children, the petitioner, in his affidavit, stated that he could not practise effectively as a lawyer because his mobility had been curbed and he could not move from one court hall to another swiftly. Therefore, he decided to apply to join the State judicial service but his application got rejected during the last recruitment process because he had exceeded the age limit of 40 years by 26 days, the petitioner said and insisted upon granting age relaxation. Since the recruitment process was already over, Mr. Purushothaman insisted on providing age relaxations at least during future recruitments. Advocate B. Vijay, representing the Registrar General, said the issue was already under consideration. He said that the previous Chief Justice of the High Court had referred the issue to the court’s recruitment committee, comprising top judges, which in turn had asked the rules committee to consider the issue of amending the service rules appropriately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decide-on-age-relaxation-for-differently-abled-candidates-high-court/article33755562.ece

Stalin on Thursday said it was unfair on the part of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to attribute motives to his party for questioning Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s delay in acting on the Cabinet decision for releasing seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. (The Governor has since passed the issue to the President). “You [Cabinet] also adopted a resolution in support of their release. Did you do that for political mileage?” he asked. Mr. Stalin said the DMK never opposed the resolution or questioned the government for doing it. “We just ask why the Governor has failed to act on the Cabinet resolution. It is unfair on the part of the Chief Minister to attribute motive. Let us see how long you are going to speak like that. This is your last chance to address the Assembly as the Chief Minister,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-asks-cm-not-to-attribute-motive-to-dmk/article33754999.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy accepted a request made by Advocate General Vijay Narayan to grant more time for the government to collate the details. The judges were informed that a previous Division Bench had already passed interim orders restraining universities from declaring ‘all pass’ without conducting the examinations. The interim orders were passed on public interest litigation petitions filed by former Anna University vice-chancellor E. Balagurusamy and advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan challenging the government’s decision to cancel the arrear examinations and declare all students to have passed those examinations on the basis of internal assessment. On Thursday, Mr. Adityan’s counsel claimed that some universities had declared the results without conducting the examinations. However, the judges said that they would examine the issue when the matter gets heard next. Chief Justice also made it clear that it is for academicians to take a call on such issues since courts were not expert bodies. He also insisted that the issue must be resolved at the earliest since it related to the career of the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-adjourns-cases-against-arrear-exams-cancellation/article33755451.ece

Deepak challenging the validity of Tamil Nadu Puratchi Thalaivi Dr. J. Jayalalithaa Memorial Foundation Act of 2020, enacted for converting her residence, ‘Veda Nilayam’, into a memorial. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy agreed with Advocate-General Vijay Narayan that the petitioner may not have, prima facie, made out strong grounds for declaring the law invalid. However, they questioned as to how many memorials the government would keep establishing by acquiring private buildings and occupying public spaces. Referring to the mausoleums established for former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai, [M.G. Ramachandran], Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi at the Marina beach in Chennai, the Chief Justice asked: “Have you already exhausted Marina?” In reply, the A-G informed the court that only a small portion of the beach had been utilised for mausoleums. “We do not mean disrespect to anyone,” the Chief Justice clarified and said that the rate at which the government had been establishing memorials would someday lead to a situation when memorials might be established even for Deputy Chief Ministers and so on. Later, the judges asked senior counsel AR.L. Sundaresan and advocate S.L. Sudarsanam, representing Mr. Deepak, to first pursue a writ petition which he had filed before a single judge challenging the acquisition proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/are-so-many-memorials-necessary/article33754953.ece

If so, people must guard themselves by staying away from the spot and should not try to douse the flames by pouring water, which could aggravate the situation. Only the foam used by fire personnel would control the fire. They also demonstrated the use of gunny bags in times of fire accidents.

Under a government scheme, free laptops are given to students studying in government and aided schools and colleges. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi ordered the notice in the petition filed by Kaudeen of Pudukkottai. In his petition, he said that as per a government order issued in 2011, the laptops were procured and supplied to students. But the laptops were not given to Plus Two students of 2017-2018 batch. “It is unfortunate, since the students need the laptops to attend online classes in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

05 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||A day of unusual petitions at HC Bench||Change the English spelling of ‘Tamil Nadu’ to ‘Tahmizhl Naadu’ or ‘Thamizhl Naadu’, pass a government order to announce Lord Murugan as Tamil God, and print the image of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on the Indian currency: these were some of the unusual demands made by public interest litigation petitions heard by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi were taken by surprise over the relief sought in the petitions. In his petition, M. Selva Kumar of Thoothukudi district sought a change in the English spelling of Tamil Nadu. He laid emphasis on the Tamil letter ‘zha’ and said that the English spelling of ‘Tamil Nadu’ must be changed in official communications. The judges observed that though they found some force in the request, they did not wish to get into the discretion of the administration. The court asked the State government to look into the representation and consider it within a period of eight weeks by taking into account the relevant materials on the uniqueness of the word ‘zha’. The judges dismissed the PIL petition that sought the direction to announce Lord Murugan as Tamil God. Hearing the petition filed by G. Thirumurugan of Ramanathapuram district, the judges said that they were not inclined to entertain the petition. Even the relief to consider the representation could not be granted, the court said. The judges observed that the preamble to the Constitution emphasised on the secular nature of the country. The petitioner might have a justifiable reason to refer to Lord Murugan as Tamil God and it was for him to do so. However, it was not feasible for the State. Tamil language was enriched by literary works and many works in praise of gods contributed to the language, they said. The judges disposed of the petition filed by K.K. Ramesh of Madurai who sought a direction to print the image of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on the Indian currency. The judges asked the Centre to consider the representation. The contribution made by Netaji to the nation was unparalleled and one could not ignore his sacrifice, the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-day-of-unusual-petitions-at-hc/article33754974.ece

The appointments being made now should be mentioned as ‘made on a temporary basis,’ the court said. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi passed the order in the petition filed by advocate G.V. Vairam Santhosh of Madurai. He said that an additional strength of 1,335 posts of Medical Officers to the Mini Clinics were made to the already approved 665 posts. He complained that they were being recruited via walk-in interviews. The petitioner said that no reservation policy was followed and when a large number of the candidates were involved, the recruitment should be made through the Medical Recruitment Board. The petitioner had earlier challenged the recruitment of nurse and healthcare staff to the Mini Clinics on similar grounds. The State submitted that the appointments were being made on a temporary basis in view of the COVID-19 situation. The reservation policy would be followed as far as possible, the State told the court. Taking note of the submissions, the judges said that if at all the clinics were to continue for a longer time, then the decision to recruit for a longer time basis should be made in advance and regular recruitment procedure has to be followed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/follow-reservation-policy-as-far-as-possible-says-hc/article33755554.ece

05 February 2021||Paramakudi,TAMIL NADU||Reject Palaniswami as well as AIADMK, Stalin tells voters||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday called upon voters in Tamil Nadu to not only reject Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, but also the AIADMK in the Assembly election. At a public meeting as part of his election outreach programme ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin’ (Stalin in your constituency) at Thelichathanallur, near Paramakudi, the DMK leader said he had taken a pledge to retrieve the State from the present rulers, who, according to him, had to be taught a lesson. On Karunanidhi samadhi Accusing the AIADMK government and Mr. Palaniswami of denying space to bury his father and former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi near the ‘samadhi’ of DMK founder C.N. Annadurai on the Marina, Mr. Stalin recalled the favourable verdict obtained from the Madras High Court. In an emotional tone, he said that he was upset with the manner in which the AIADMK leaders had dealt with the death of a person “who had lived for the State and the people”. Describing Karunanidhi as an institution, he said that ‘Kalaignar’ had given innumerable welfare programmes to the State, whereas those holding the reins of the government now were interested only in enhancing their wealth, he charged. New meaning The Kazhagam (the DMK party), Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar were like “Mata, Pita, Guru and Deivam”, he said. The DMK president assured the people that he would definitely redress the grievances of the masses in the first 100 days and give a new meaning to the lives of the common man. The AIADMK and the BJP had done nothing for fishermen from Ramanathapuram district, who were facing issues with the Sri Lankan Navy personnel. “Fearing that the BJP may pull down the corrupt [AIADMK] government, the Chief Minister is more interested in dancing to the tunes of the Centre,” he claimed. The DMK, he said, would give a new lease of life to the fisherfolk from May 2021 and appealed to the people to vote him and his party to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reject-palaniswami-as-well-as-aiadmk-stalin-tells-voters/article33754964.ece

05 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘New Act implemented in a hurry’||Minister for Revenue M.O.H.F. Shahjahan has questioned the urgency shown by the Lieutenant Governor to implement the new Motor Vehicles Act. “When several State governments... even Tamil Nadu have not implemented the Act due to provision for hefty fine, there was no necessity to rush through its implementation in the Union Territory. As a Minister (he also holds Transport portfolio) I have not seen the file. The normal practice is to consult and get the concurrence of the Minister concerned before issuing a notification. Here, the rules were broken in implementing an act itself,” Mr. Shahjahan told The Hindu . After representations from public and legislators against enforcing the law, the government on Wednesday directed the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police to go slow on imposing fines. Educate and encourage When asked why they were opposing helmets as it concerns personal safety, the Minister said, “We genuinely wanted people to wear helmets not just because its an order from the court.” “We want people to wear headgear as it concerns the safety of a person. But when there is opposition from the people itself, we cannot thrust it on them all of a sudden. We need to educate and encourage them to wear helmets. No law can be thrust upon a person against the person’s wish,” the Minister added. Mr. Shahjahan said realising that there was opposition towards implementing the legislation, the BJP too had sent a written appeal to the Lt. Governor, Kiran Bedi to withhold the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-act-implemented-in-a-hurry/article33755628.ece
05 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Govt. must repeal farm laws, says Agri Minister||The Centre should immediately repeal the three farm laws to save the farmers and the country, Minister for Agriculture R. Kamalakannan said on Thursday. Mr. Kamalakannan, who is also into farming, in a statement said if the legislation are implemented the situation in the country would be contrary to what the government claimed. Majority of the farmers are small and marginal, and they produce very little surplus for the market. Several of them raise crops after borrowing money from lenders. Therefore, they are compelled to sell the crop immediately after the harvest. To ensure remunerative prices, the government fixed the Minimum Support Price before the cropping season, he said. The farmer could sell the produce through auction at the regulated market for a better price. The Food Corporation of India procures the produce from markets for distribution to weaker sections of people through PDS outlets, he said. “Once the laws are implemented, the MSP will be done away with and private players will procure the products at a cheaper price. They will hoard the items to create artificial scarcity,” said Mr. Kamalakannan. ‘No direct purchase’ The corporates would not buy the products directly from the farmers. They would certainly employ middlemen for procurement, he said. “In the end, the farmers will become poorer, there will be famine due to scarcity, middlemen will continue to exploit them and the PDS system in the country will be destroyed. The laws are the idea of people hailing from Gujarat in the government. People from Gujarat are good in business,” he said. The Minister said even now farmers had the freedom to sell their produce outside the markets to a licensed person. The provision had not been enforced properly, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-must-repeal-farm-laws-says-agri-minister/article33755626.ece

05 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Classical music India’s biggest contribution to mankind’||Kiran Seth, academician and SPIC MACAY founder, has stressed on the importance of preserving and perpetuating the classical music heritage which, in opening up a near-yogic path to connect with the inner self, remains India’s biggest contribution to mankind. In an interactive discussion hosted by Aurodhan on the theme ‘Save the tiger and maybe also the Rudra Veena’, Mr. Seth pointed out that while the West had given society so much in the outward tangible domain — cell phones, the Internet, cars, planes, air conditioners, etc., — that made lives easier, India’s gift to humankind was in the intangible domain that contributed to making our lives fuller and more meaningful. Mr. Seth said both traditions engaged in different paths in their pursuit of truth — the East in an experiential manner and the West through an experimental method. However, because its results take time to show, belief in the experiential processes that allowed access to an inner domain, which is deep, abstract, subtle and mystical, suffered in an age ruled by instant gratification, he added. Mr. Seth recalled that when Ustad Asad Ali Khan passed away a few years ago, “it suddenly struck me that future generations would not possibly hear the Rudra Veena played in the majestic ‘ Khandarvani ’ style that he had mastered”. The Rudra Veena and many other instruments, and multiple art forms in the country, were fast disappearing, and very little was being done about this, he added. “India’s biggest contribution to humankind is that it has developed different forms of ‘ Yog ’, different methods of connecting with the inner self. The knowledge and wisdom of these techniques is slowly getting lost. They are either mutating into something with a totally different world view to ensure their survival or are dying a slow death, like the Rudra Veena,” he said. Later, during an interaction with the audience, Mr. Seth explained the efforts of SPIC MACAY to propagate cultural heritage and pass on the torch to a newer generation. The “Workshop Demonstration” (WMD) model, where a young artist travelled to remote schools to speak and perform art, was one of the most successful outreach modes of SPIC MACAY, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/classical-music-indias-biggest-contribution-to-mankind/article33755634.ece
05 February 2021||Pudukottai,TAMIL NADU||Central team begins inspection of crop damage in delta region||An inter-ministerial Central team on Thursday began a two-day inspection of crops damaged by the unseasonal rains in January in the State. The team, split into two, fanned out to the delta and southern districts to get a first-hand account of the damage caused to crops. One of the groups landed in Tiruchi and proceeded to Pudukottai district to begin the exercise on Thursday morning. The team, comprising of Rananjay Singh, Regional Officer, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Shubham Garg, Assistant Director, Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power and Paul Pandian, Fisheries Development Commissioner, Fisheries Department went to Kalamavur village in Viralimalai panchayat union where they inspected the damaged paddy crop. The team was accompanied by V. Dhakshinamoorthi, Director of Agriculture, Pudukottai Collector P. Uma Maheswari and other officials during the inspection. The team thereafter went to Melur village in Annavasal block where they inspected the corn crop which had suffered damage and later went to Adhanakottai village in Pudukottai block where they inspected damaged tapioca crop. The team members heard in detail from the farmers and officials about the extent of damage caused to crops in the district. According to a press release issued by the district administration, 40,669 hectares of paddy crops; 169 hectares of corn crops; 2,238 hectares of groundnut; 150 hectares of sesame, 35 hectares of cotton and other crops were damaged in the district due to the heavy rains in January. Thanjavur Farmers in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts have urged the Central team to recommend adequate compensation for the loss of crop suffered by them during this samba season. Stating that the standing crop that was ready for harvest was badly affected by the heavy downpour resulting in lodging of crop, they pointed out that even panicles began sprouting on the fields. Harvesting the paddy became difficult due to the wet condition of the fields and the machines took additional hours to complete the harvest, they claimed. This had increased the cost where farmers had already spent more than Rs. 25,000 per acre to raise the crop, they pointed out. The Central Team inspected crop damages at Kavalipatti and Thippiyakudi in Thiruvonam block, Nambivayal in Pattukottai block and Thuraiyur in Thanjavur block in Thanjavur district and at Sithambur in Needamangalam block and Karikottai and Savalakaran hamlets in Mannargudi block in Tiruvarur district on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-team-begins-inspection-of-crop-damage-in-delta-region/article33754943.ece

The youth was thrashed after being accused of stealing money from a friend’s house. As a video clip of the blindfolded youth being attacked by a few persons went viral on social media, triggering outrage, the victim reportedly attempted to end his life. He was later admitted to the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital. Rahul, 22, a labourer of Poondi near Ammapettai, and his friends used to transport sand from watercourses in the Ammapettai region. A sum of Rs. 30,000 was reported missing from the house of one of his friends, Lakshmanan of Konur, on February 1. Mr. Lakshmanan and his friends suspected that Mr. Rahul, who used to frequent the former’s house, had stolen the money, and questioned him about it. While doing so, they blindfolded him with a piece of cloth and attacked him with wooden logs, despite his repeated pleas to be let off. In the video clip circulated on social media platforms, the victim is held against a tree and pinned to the ground while being beaten up repeatedly. The incident was apparently recorded on a mobile phone by a friend of Mr. Lakshmanan. On Wednesday, Mr. Rahul reportedly attempted to end his life, and was rushed to the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, where he is convalescing. Meanwhile, on information from the Medical College Hospital police about the suicide attempt, the Ammapettai police obtained a written complaint from Mr. Rahul at the hospital. They are said to be interrogating Mr. Lakshmanan’s friends Vikki, Rajadurai, Parthiban and Sarath of Konur. Since Mr. Rahul is a Dalit, the Ammapettai police have registered a case under Section 307 of the IPC, read with Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and Sections 147, 148, 294(b), 373 and 374 of the IPC, against six persons, including Mr. Lakshmanan, his father Karnan and two non-Dalits.

05 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||MP raises Defence land issue in Lok Sabha||Tiruchi Member of Parliament Su. Thirunavukkarasar has urged the Defence Minister to take action for the early transfer of a piece of land belonging to the Ministry to enable the completion of the incomplete road overbridge (ROB) near the railway junction in Tiruchi. In a statement issued here, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar said he had raised the issue under Rule 377 in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday pointing out that this was one of the long-pending infrastructure development projects in Tiruchi. The first stage of the ROB, being built in two stages, has almost been completed but for the vital Chennai arm due to the delay in transfer of about 0.66 acres of the Defence land to the State Highways Department. Because of this, the second phase of the project too could not be taken up, he said. The State government, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar pointed out, had identified an alternative land in the adjacent Tamil Nadu Special Police Battalion to be given in exchange. The government had also issued a no objection certificate for the land transfer, he said and urged the Defence Minister to take appropriate action for the land transfer. District Collector S.S ivarasu, while speaking to reporters on Tuesday, had hoped to get the clearance from the Defence Ministry within a month. The Highways Department had recently called for tenders to complete the remaining portion of the incomplete ROB near the railway junction in the city hoping to get the Defence land required for the project soon. The original contract for the project was terminated by the department due to the delay in getting the Defence land sought for the first phase of project by the Highways Department. Construction of the ROB remains suspended for more than two years now. Ninety percent of the first stage of the project has been completed but for the Chennai arm of the bridge, which needs to be connected to a new approach road to be laid across the Defence land. The Chennai arm is the final segment of the first stage of the two-stage project. Only upon completion of the first stage of the project, the old narrow bridge could be dismantled for construction of second stage of project. The first stage of the bridge was scheduled to be completed by February 2017 and the second by 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-raises-defence-land-issue-in-lok-sabha/article33755698.ece

05 February 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Central team assesses damage to drinking water supply systems||A three-member Central team inspected badly damaged drinking water supply systems in the district on Thursday to assess the quantum of damage caused by the recent floods in the Tamirabharani, the drinking water source for three southern districts. During its 20-minute-long stay at Seevalaperi on the Tamirabharani watercourse near Palayamkottai, the team, comprising Ashutosh Agnihotri, Ministry of Home Affairs, Manoharan, Director, Directorate of Oilseed Development, Ministry of Agriculture, Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Hyderabad, and Mahesh Kumar, Deputy Director, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, inspected the TWAD Board’s infiltration wells damaged in recent floods, which were repaired later. Before leaving for Thoothukudi district to assess crop damage, the team received a detailed report from Collector V. Vishnu on the damages caused by the recent rains and consequent flood in the Tamirabharani to crop, drinking water facilities, infrastructures and private properties like houses. Though the district experienced its worst floods in the Tamirabharani between January 11 and 14 after the 1992 deluge, the men and material deployed immediately and adequately by pooling in local resources ensured restoration of 50% of drinking water supply to the residents within 48 hours from the flood subsided. Of the 19 Combined Drinking Water Supply Systems in the district, 18 were affected badly with infiltration wells, supply pipes and pumps gravely damaged to completely hit the drinking water supply. “While drinking water supply to 50% of residents was restored within 48 hours by spending Rs. 8.86 crore, residents in other areas were given drinking water through tankers,” Mr. Vishnu said adding that another Rs. 32.50 lakh was required for restoring the 45-year-old Kovilpatti drinking water supply scheme benefitting five village panchayats in Maanur union. On the crop damage, he said that paddy cultivated on 163 hectares and pulses grown on 5,839.70 hectare were damaged in recent rains. In Thoothukudi, the team inspected the massive loss caused by the rains to rain-fed crops, mostly grown in Kayathar, Kovilpatti, Vilaathikulam and Pudhur taluks. “The district has lost the rain-fed crops grown on over 1 lakh hectare in the district,” Collector K. Senthil Raj told the visiting Central team and handed over comprehensive report on the damages to crops, infrastructure and drinking water supply systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-team-assesses-damage-to-drinking-water-supply-systems/article33755712.ece
05 February 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Regional cancer centre inaugurated||A regional cancer centre (RCC) was inaugurated at Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday. It has state-of-the-art facilities to treat cancer patients from Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar and Kanniyakumari districts, free of cost, if the treatment is done under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. “In Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari and Tenkasi districts, 50,173 cancer patients are under treatment as per government records and Tirunelveli alone has 19,872 cases in the last nine years,” says E. Vidhubala, psycho oncologist and research consultant, Nellai Cancer Care Centre, which has so far conducted 1,810 cancer screening camps to test 36,703 persons. The process for getting this facility started in 2013 after a steady surge in the number of cancer patients due to a range of reasons. Though the TVMCH sent a proposal to establish a RCC here in 2013 to the State government, no decision was taken. When the Tamil Nadu government, with the Union Government’s funding, announced in 2015 that RCC would be set up at Tirunelveli and Thanjavur Medical Colleges each at a cost of Rs. 15 crore, it was expected that the patients’ travel to Chennai or Thiruvananthapuram would come to an end. But, it was put in cold storage again. After a lot of effort, it materialised with the allocation of Rs. 40 crore for establishing centre with modern facilities such as Linear Accelerator and Advanced Cobalt Therapy. “In the cobalt therapy facility we had earlier, the radiation would affect the entire areas surrounding the affected area also. With this latest equipment, we can concentrate the radiation only at the affected areas that would minimize the side-effects to the maximum possible extent,” says Dr. Deivanayagam, Head, Department of Oncology, TVMCH. While the poor patients will receive all these treatments free of cost, others will have to pay Rs. 40,000 which would cost Rs. 75,000 in private hospitals and the modern cancer treatment costing Rs. 1.50 lakh would cost only Rs. 1 lakh at RCC, TVMCH. Since the RCC can make its treatment more effective by creating exclusive ward for cancer patients, proposal has been sent to the government for constructing a 2-storey building. “Each floor will have 100 beds to treat the patients more effectively,” Dr. Deivanayagam said. Dr. Vidhubala says the government should set in motion the process of identifying alternative livelihood for beedi rollers who are more prone to the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/regional-cancer-centre-inaugurated/article33755708.ece

05 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Operation to lure elephant into camp suffers a setback||Rivaldo, a 40-year-old elephant who was being coaxed to enter the Theppakadu Elephant Camp by Forest Department officials over the last three days, made his escape back into the forest on Thursday evening. The elephant was being shepherded by Forest Department officials towards Theppakadu from Tuesday. The animal was being led towards the camp with a trail of his favourite food — fruits and sugar cane. L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), said the elephant’s progress towards the camp was slow but steady till Thursday evening, and the animal had almost reached Masinagudi. There were doubts about whether Rivaldo would enter the MTR core area, where the elephant camp is located, as he had not been known to prominently use the habitat in the past. This was confirmed when the elephant, who was cooling off in a river with officials keeping watch nearby, suddenly made off in the opposite direction and escaped into a patch of forest. Despite efforts to track the elephant, Rivaldo managed to escape on Thursday evening, officials confirmed. K.K. Kaushal, Field Director at MTR, said such challenges were expected. “We are dealing with the largest land animal in the world. So, there were always going to be certain challenges that cropped up. Moreover, this method of not using force to walk the animal into captivity is being tested for the first time, which adds another variable to the operation,” Mr. Kaushal said. Search on Forest Department officials have started searching the surrounding areas in a bid to track down Rivaldo and lure him back on the path towards Theppakadu. However, other methods are also being considered to take the elephant into captivity, officials said. Meanwhile, the officials are also monitoring another wild elephant, Shankar, who escaped capture by crossing over into neighbouring Kerala after being involved in the death of three persons during accidental confrontations with humans in the Gudalur forest division last December. The elephant is said to have entered Tamil Nadu again. Two kumkis from MTR were being brought to the division and would be used in an attempt to capture the elephant and transport it to Theppakadu, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/setback-in-operations-to-lure-rivaldo-into-camp/article33754994.ece

It joins a list of over 30 villages across the district that have been declared free of illicit arrack, thanks to a drive launched by the district police, who adopting a carrot-and-stick policy. The police roped in women from the villages to monitor the flow of illicit arrack and persuaded bootleggers to give up their old ways or face criminal action. “The drive, aimed at making the villages arrack-free, has made a visible impact in over 30 villages. A rehabilitation plan has been chalked out to provide alternative employment to former prohibition offenders and to ensure that they don’t step back into a life of crime,” Superintendent of Police S. Radhakrishnan told The Hindu . “The police decided to rope in women in the villages to eradicate the social menace, as they understood the physical and mental toll it took on families,” he said. The women, along with the Village Vigilance Police Officers (VVPO), prevailed upon those taking to the distillation of liquor to mend their ways and make use of the government’s rehabilitation schemes, Mr. Radhakrishnan added. The police arranged the meetings and also offered support to them by dovetailing various welfare schemes. Notice boards were also erected in the villages to declare them ‘arrack-free.’ In the first phase, around 60 prohibition offenders were identified and the police, with the help of government officials, helped them set up small business. While law enforcement authorities continued with their sustained vigilance in the arrack-free villages, an intensive crackdown was simultaneously launched on bootleggers to curb illicit distillation. The police also invoked provisions of the Bootleggers Act against 24 arrack brewers and launched intensive raids.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drive-to-make-villupuram-villages-free-of-illicit-arrack/article33755633.ece

They marched to the Deputy Commissioner’s office in large numbers and shouted slogans against the government. They argued that the State government has taken a one-sided decision only by keeping expensive private schools in Bengaluru in mind. “The government should have consulted us before announcing the decision. If the government forces private schools to collect reduced fees, the managements will pay even lesser salaries. We are already suffering as we have not received salaries for over six months. Reduced salaries will put a huge burden on us,” they said. They also suggested that if the State government is serious about implementing the rule on reduced fees, then it should pay standardised salaries to all private teachers, irrespective of the fees collected by the managements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pvt-school-teachers-take-out-rally/article33755014.ece

He was speaking to science students of KLE Society’s Basava Prabhu Kore Degree College. “It is a commonly held belief that natural products are very good for the human body. But they are underutilised source of chemical diversity for drug discovery. However, bio-active compounds isolated natural sources have given rise to a wide range of human therapeutics,” he said. However, due to some problems, the field of traditional medicine and natural product research has not grown as expected. The important challenges are to isolating pure compounds from crude extracts and validation after experimentation.

A total of 3,14,907 healthcare workers have been vaccinated in Karnataka so far. State health officials said this wastage is far lower than the permissible wastage of 10% for the vaccine. As this is a new vaccine, an open vial policy is not applicable. The Centre has, in its vaccination guidelines issued to States, said that all openedvials should be used within four hours. If not, the opened vials should be discarded after hours or at the end of the session, the guidelines stated. State Deputy Director Rajani Nageshrao told The Hindu on Tuesday that the 6% wastage includes vials discarded four hours after opening and those damaged during transit and storage. “The extent of wastage changes every day. However, the daily average wastage has remained at 6% sofar,” she said. “We have clearly instructed vaccination officers to mark the date and time of opening each vial. Wastage is unavoidable as all open vials have to be discarded after four hours of opening or at the end of a session.” While 8,48,414 healthcare beneficiaries have registered for vaccination, the State has received 17,18,240 doses of the vaccines — 15,52,000 doses of Covishield and 1,66,240 doses of Covaxin. “We have worked out the allocation to districts keeping in mind the 10% permissible wastage and have sent 10% additional doses than the required number to mitigate such issues,” Dr. Rajani said. Explaining the process, she said, “In the morning, the vaccination officers usually wait for 10 people to arrive at the sites to start the vaccination. This is to ensure a vial gets fully consumed. But, as the day progresses, all the selected beneficiaries may not turn up. But we have to vaccinate those who come and vials have to be opened and discarded after four hours,” she said. Wastage formula The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has drawn up a formula to estimate the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses the States would need. “The ministry, in consultation with experts, has arrived at a Wastage Multiplication Factor of 1.1 for the COVID-19 vaccines. If 100 people have to be vaccinated, 111 doses are required as per this formula,” said Lokesh Alahari, sub-regional team leader, Karnataka, WHO India (National Polio Surveillance Project). Wastage is slightly higher in the case of Covaxin as each vial has 20 dosesunlike a Covishield vial that has 10 doses each. “If not more than five beneficiaries turn up within four hours, 15 doses in a Covaxin vial are wasted. Also, with many healthcare workers still reluctant to take Covaxin, the wastage of this vaccine is higher,” sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-vaccine-state-records-average-wastage-of-6/article33755030.ece
05 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Gang-rape probe: Govt. admits to lapses||Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday conceded lapses by his department in handling the gang rape of a minor in Sringeri and announced action against erring officials. He said he would consider it his moral responsibility to ensure the “perpetrators of the heinous crime are sent to the gallows”. Mr. Bommai announced the suspension of Station House Officer (SHO) of Sringeri police station, who allegedly delayed filing of the FIR for two days after the incident came to light. He also announced a probe by the zonal IGP into alleged lapses in the Home Department. “No one found conniving will be spared,” he said. The government would probe lapses by the Labour Department, since the survivor is a child labourer working at a stone crusher. He also announced that the government would take care of the girl, provide her security, rehabilitate her, and also give her a government job when she turns a major. “The case has affected me personally. I was in a dilemma as to what was my moral responsibility, to resign or to ensure stringent action against the accused. I have chosen the latter. I will resign if I am not able to do it,” he said. The Council took up a debate on the issue under Rule 68, which saw members cutting across party lines condemning the crime. Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil and senior member B.K. Hariprasad drew attention to some of the accused being members of organisations linked to the Sangh Parivar, including the BJP. A word Mr. Hariprasad used to indicate the Sangh Parivar caused commotion and was later expunged. Senior BJP member Ayanur Manjunath said there was no question of defending the accused and it would be wrong to associate an organisation for the heinous offence of an individual. All the three women members of the House also spoke and condemned the crime. Mr. Patil listed out lapses of various government departments in the case. He pointed out that the survivor, a 15-year-old girl, was employed in a stone crusher which amounts to child labour. “The girl has said she was abused over five months by nearly 35 to 40 men, of whom she has named 17. Not even all 17 men have been arrested yet,” he said. He added there was a delay of two days in registering the FIR in the case. Mr. Manjunath demanded that there be a cases against the crusher owner for employing child labour and for his complicity in the crime, since it seems to have happened at the worksite. The girl’s aunt, he said, has now emerged to have facilitated the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gang-rape-probe-govt-concedes-lapses/article33755215.ece

05 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Somanna, Khandre have heated argument over sanction of houses||Housing Minister V. Somanna’s statement about sanction of 17,000 houses for Bhalki constituency in Bidar under housing schemes of the State government and allocation of 43% of houses to “bogus beneficiaries” sparked off heated arguments between the Minister and Congress member Eshwar Khandre, who represents the constituency. In reply to Mr. Khandre’s charge about lack of progress in the Housing Department in the State, during the debate on the Governor’s address in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Somanna said the Congress leader got sanctioned 17,000 houses in one year during the previous Congress government and 43% of the beneficiaries were “fake”. Six panchayat development officers had been suspended and a probe was ordered to find irregularities in the execution of housing schemes in the constituency, he said. Mr. Somanna said that instead officials of the taluk, Mr. Khadre himself issued sanction orders for construction of houses. Mr. Khandre countered Mr. Somanna’s charges, and said the Minister was “manufacturing lies” and the government in advance mobilised funds and paid Rs. 200 crore for developers for construction of houses in Bengaluru. But the Housing Ministry has no money to pay the poor for the construction of houses, Mr. Khandre said. Irked over Mr. Khadre’s statement, Mr. Somanna stoutly denied the charges. Mr. Somanna said the Siddaramaiah-led government had decided to construct 18 lakh houses in the State with an estimate of Rs. 35,800 crore. But the Congress government released only Rs. 10,000 crore and there was shortage of funds over Rs. 20,000 crore. The former ChiefMinister Siddaramaiah took exception to Mr. Somanna’s statement and said more than three lakh houses were built during the Congress regime every year as against just two lakh houses during the last two years of the BJP government. Mr. Khandre challenged Mr. Somanna to conduct the probe into sanction of houses and said hewould quit membership of the House if proved guilty. Tempers cooled down when the Speaker appealed to both the Minister and Mr. Khandre to stop levelling charges against each other.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/somanna-khandre-have-heated-argument-over-sanction-of-houses/article33755223.ece
05 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State set to tweak aerospace policy to attract investments||Karnataka is set to make necessary changes to its aerospace policy to enable further investments in the sector. The proposed changes will be in line with the New Industrial Policy that was unveiled in 2020. The current aerospace policy, which was unveiled in February 2013 and runs up to 2023, was once modified in 2016 to attract investments in the maintenance, repair and overhaul segment. According to the government, the policy has so far yielded investments of Rs. 14,720 crore, generating employment for about 10,500 people in about 30 projects. Intense competition The changes also come at a time when Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, where defence corridors are proposed to be set up, are aggressively wooing investors in the aerospace and defence sectors. Karnataka already has about 2,000 manufacturers related to defence and aerospace. As much as 65% of the country’s export are from Karnataka and 67% of all helicopter and aircraft production takes place in the State. The Additional Chief Secretary, Industries and Commerce, Gaurav Gupta said the new industrial policy has identified aerospace and defence as focus sectors. “We are interested in the generation of jobs in the State, and will do what it takes. The policy has to be dynamic,” he said. New avenues The mega order that HAL received to produce 83 Tejas aircraft for the Indian Air Force at a cost of Rs. 48,000, he said, would bring investments and create jobs in the State. The opportunity also lies in the Indian government directing the substitution of $2.2 billion worth of import of spares and other items through local manufacturing. Prohibition of the import of 101 defence equipment would also spur indigenisation, he added. When asked if there was any threat of new investments going to new defence corridors, Mr. Gupta said that “the immense talent pool in Karnataka and friendly policy” will attract investment into State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-set-to-tweak-aerospace-policy-to-attract-investments/article33755032.ece

Also, with many healthcare workers still reluctant to take Covaxin, the wastage of this vaccine is higher,” a source said. Lokesh Alahari, sub-regional team leader, Karnataka, WHO India (National Polio Surveillance Project), said the permissible wastage in most vaccines administered under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) was 10%, except in BCG, Measles-Rubella (MR), and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccines. “About 50% wastage is allowed in BCG, given to newborns, and 25% is allowed in MR and JE vaccines as these have to be reconstituted before they are used. Reconstitution means mixing the dry powder form of a vaccine with a fluid called a diluent so that the vaccine can be injected. However, the Pentavalent vaccine can be used up to 28 days after opening, provided the expiry date has not passed and the vaccine is appropriately handled and stored,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covaxins-is-higher/article33755034.ece

As the petitioner had alleged that the chancellor had appointed Mr. Bettakote though his name was not recommended by the search committee, the court also directed the search committee to submit in sealed cover the names of the persons recommended by it for the post. A Division Bench passed the order on the petition filed by Sri Prasanna Vidya Ganapati Mahotsava Charitable Trust, Mysuru. The petitioner contended that the appoint of the Vice-Chancellor was contrary to the provisions of the Karnataka Rajya Dr. Gangubai Hangal Sangeetha Mattu Pradarshaka Kalegala Vishwavidyalaya Act, 2009, as Mr. Bettakote’s name was not among the three names recommended by the search committee.

05 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Coffee estates not excluded from SARFASEI Act||While declaring that the expression ‘agricultural land’ in the SARFAESI Act does not include lands on which plantation crops such as coffee are grown, the Karnataka High Court has held that the banks and other financial institutions can invoke provisions of the Act to recover loans borrowed by mortgaging coffee estates. “The expression ‘agricultural land’ in Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act does not include land on which plantation crops are grown namely, cardamom, coffee, pepper, rubber and tea as defined in Section 2(A)(25) of the Land Reforms Act,” the Court said while holding that coffee estates are not excluded from the application of the Act to recover borrowed money. A Division Bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice Nataraj Rangaswamy delivered the verdict while interpreting the expression ‘agriculture land’ under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002, commonly know as SARFAESI Act. “...the land on which plantation crops are raised (coffee in the instant case), if mortgaged or given by way of a security to a financial institution to obtain a credit facility, whether for an agricultural purpose or for a non-agricultural purpose, the said security could be enforced and Section 31(i) of SARFAESI Act [which excludes application of the Act any security interest created in agricultural land] does not apply to such land,” the Bench said. The land used for the purpose of growing plantation crops, though an agricultural land for all other purposes, nevertheless, is exempted from restrictions imposed on sale, mortgage, etc, which implies that it is not treated on par with the land on which non-plantation crops or other agricultural produce is grown, the Bench observed while analysing the expression ‘agriculture land’ in the Karnataka Land Reforms Act and the Karnataka Agricultural Income Tax Act, 1957. Hence, insofar as the State of Karnataka is concerned, having regard to Section 104 and Section 81 of the Land Reforms Act, lands on which the plantation crops are grown, being exempt from the restrictions pertaining to agricultural land, would not come within the scope and ambit of the ‘agricultural land’ under Section 31(i) of the SARFAESI Act, the Bench said. The revenue entries showing the lands under plantation to be agricultural in nature would not per se be a determinative factor, the Bench observed. The judgement was delivered in appeals between between U.M. Ramesh Rao, M/s Vijayadevan Coffee Estate, M/s Yellikudige Coffee Estate of Chikkamagaluru Vs Union Bank of India, and others on the issue whether banks can sell mortgaged coffee estates to realise borrowed money under the SARFASEI Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/coffee-estates-not-excluded-from-sarfasei-act/article33755210.ece

Vijaya said here on Thursday. Addressing a press conference, Ms. Vijaya said that South Western Railway received a record Rs. 3,244 crore grants which is the highest so far for the railway zone established in 2003. Together with Rs. 1,233 crore expected as deposit from the State government towards new lines, road overbridges and road underbridges, the budgetary allocation would be Rs. 4,467 crore, she said. Emphasising that focus is on completing the ongoing projects rather than taking up new ones, she said that as more grants have been allocated for the zone, they will be able to expedite the works and complete a few of them within the next financial year. There has been a 67% jump in allocation for works on level crossings and 25% increase in grants for passenger amenities when compared to the last year, she said. Giving comparative figures, she said that there has been an increase of 200% in allocations for signal and telecommunication works, 240% increase for other electrical works, 33% increase for machinery and plant and 17% increase for track renewals. Ms. Vijaya said that while the zone has completed 105 kilometres of track doubling so far, it planned to complete another 66 kilometres by March-end. The zone has set a target of 203 km of track doubling for 2021-22. She said that the zone planned to complete 309 km of electrification in two months in addition to the 110 km completed so far. The target for the next fiscal is 849 km. “South Western Railway is all set to complete two important projects — Yelahanka-Penukonda and Arsikere-Tumakuru track doubling projects by March 2022,” she said. Suburban rail To a query, Ms. Vijaya clarified that the allocation for the Bengaluru Suburban Rail project has been mentioned in the Pink Book. The Ministry of Railways has allocated Rs. 300 crore for the joint venture of the Ministry of Railways and the State government, which was being executed by KRIDE. An equivalent amount is also expected from the State government, she said. To a query, she said that the Hubballi-Chikjajur track doubling project has been allocated Rs. 336 crore and it will help in faster execution of work and completion in one and a half years. The Hosapete-Hubballi-Londa-Tinaighat-Vasco-da-Gama section doubling work has received Rs. 365 crore, she said. Ms. Vijaya said that hurdles in land acquisition has resulted in delay in taking up track doubling works on the Hubballi-Chikjajur section. However, in the Gadag-Wadi project, 615 hectares of land have been acquired so far out of the total 1,598 hectares required and the Railways has issued work orders for carrying out works where land has been provided. Good allocation She termed Rs. 50 crore sanctioned for the Belagavi-Dharwad via Kittur new line as a good amount in the first year of the project. “We require 335 hectares of land for the 73 kilometre route and have submitted the land requirement details to the State government,” she said. To another query, she said that work on the Shivamogga-Shikaripur-Ranebennur 103-km new line is going on at a fast pace. As land is being made available, tenders are being floated. The total cost of the project is Rs. 1,400 crore and in the present budget, Rs. 100 crore has been allocated, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/20-more-grants-for-south-western-railway-this-time/article33755028.ece
05 February 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Hike in fuel prices condemned||Condemning the hike in fuel prices, edible oil, soaring prices of essential commodities, subsidy cut on kerosene and stating that the Union Budget is nothing but a blueprint for privatisation, members of Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) staged a demonstration in Dharwad on Thursday. Staging the demonstration and raising slogans against the Union government, the protestors burnt the Union government in an effigy saying that the BJP-led NDA government is on a privatisation spree in the garb of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Addressing presspersons, district committee member of SUCI(C) Gangadhar Baidger said that at a time when the common people of the country are devastated by the economic crisis induced by an unscientific lockdown and post-lockdown restrictions, instead of mitigating their sufferings, the Union government is delivering blows one after the other. “The whole country was looking at the Budget with hope that it will get some relief. However, the Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is full of self-praise, doubtful data and fake claims about fiscal revival and development,” he said. Mr. Gangadhar said that in the garb of Atma Nirbhar Bharat, the Union government has laid out the blue print for privatisation of education, health, banking, insurance and other service sectors. He said that while claims are being made about increased allocations in health, education and infrastructure, they are not supported by data. He said that although 150 farmers have breathed their last during the more than two-month-old agitation on the borders of New Delhi, the ruling disposition is least bothered about their plight and there is nothing in the budget to prove that the government is sympathetic towards farm issues. “In reality, the claim about Atma Nirbhar Bharat is nothing but corporate dependent Bharat as it has been designed as per the wishes of the corporate sector,” he said. District committee members of SUCI(C) Laxman Jadagannavar, Mahdulata Goudar, Bhavanishankar, Bhuvana, Deepa, Sharanu Gonawar, Ramesh Hosamani and others took part in the agitation. A number of residents too joined the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hike-in-fuel-prices-condemned/article33755026.ece

05 February 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Road blockade tomorrow||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha will stage a rasta roko at Ram Mandir Circle here on Saturday, in response to a nation-wide call given by the morcha against anti-farmer, anti-labour policies of the Union government. Members of various pro-farmer, pro-Dalit, pro-labour, pro-woman, student and youth organisations will participate in the rasta roko under the aegis of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. CPI(M) leader M.B. Sajjan and All India Kisan Sabha leader Bheemashankar Madiyal, addressing presspersons here on Thursday, demanded that the Union government effect a complete repeal of the three contentious farm laws, as the 11th round of talks between agitating farmers and the government ended without any outcome. The cases filed against farmers leaders and journalists for reporting on the tractor rally should be withdrawn. The government should also release the tractors and vehicles of farmers seized during the agitation. Mr. Sajjan accused the government of barricading several places over the last week. Concertina wires have been used to cover vast stretches and at Tikri and Ghazipur, the police have also put up metal spikes on roads leading to the protest sites. Construction of cement slabs at various junctions has cut off access for farmers to portable toilets. Farmers at Singhu have said that water supply to the protest site has been hit for a week. The morcha will continue to protest till the farm laws are withdrawn, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/road-blockade-tomorrow/article33755022.ece
05 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||KEONICS Board gives approval to medium size IT Park in city||The move by Karnataka State Electronics Corporation Ltd. (KEONICS) to set up a medium size Information Technology Park at Kuntikana-Derebail in the city has taken a leap forward with the board giving approval to the proposal. Chairman of KEONICS Harikrishna Bantwal told The Hindu that following the approval of the board recently, KEONICS, on Wednesday, asked an agency to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the purpose. The agency authorities will inspect the project site on February 18 before finalising the report. It has been proposed to set up the park on 3.25 acres of land owned by KEONICS on public-private partnership (PPP) model. “An investor has shown interest in developing the park,” he said. The setting up of a medium size IT park, near the Software Technology Park of India (STPI) under the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, will help create employment opportunities and also ensure the growth of start-ups, he said. Innovation conclave Mr. Bantwal said that as a measure to promote investments in the Mangaluru region, a Mangaluru Innovation Conclave, will be organised in the city on February 24 under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel. KEONICS will support the conclave. Heads of information technology companies, start-ups, education institutions and representatives from different industry bodies and other sectors will be invited to it. Such a conclave will help showcase the strengths of Mangaluru to attract investment. Mr. Bantwal, who is the 38th chairman of KEONICS, said that KEONICS has also plans to develop a large electronics city in Mangaluru in memory of R.K. Baliga, who was the first chairman of KEONICS and who set up Electronics City in Bengaluru. Late Baliga hailed from Bantwal. It might require about 40 acres at one place. Efforts are on to take this initiative forward. When late Baliga founded Electronics City in Bengaluru in 1978, it was on 334 acres. Now, the area has doubled with Electronics City covering about 600 acres and providing employment to about four lakh people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/keonics-board-gives-approval-to-medium-size-it-park-in-city/article33755577.ece
05 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Deteriorating air quality triggers breathing-related illnesses||Mangaluru, once known for its clean air, has now been covered with dust thanks to several pending and ongoing infrastructure works across the city with the Air Quality Index (AQI) crossing the one hundred mark. AQI between 100-200 falls under moderate category as classified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) wherein people with lung diseases, asthma and heart diseases as well as children will feel difficulty in breathing. While AQI up to 50 is categorised “Good”, that between 50-100 is classified “Satisfactory”, meaning sensitive people will face minor breathing discomfort. As per data provided by private websites, accuweather.com and air-quality.com, AQI in Mangaluru is 107 and 139, respectively, while CPCB data for the day put Mangaluru AQI at 89, just two points less than Bengaluru (91), for Thursday. Particulate matters and fine particulate matters have predominantly contributed to deteriorating AQI in Mangaluru. Infrastructure works Abdul Rauf, a street vendor in the State Bank area, said that as the rainy seasons have ended, the area is covered with dust almost every day now due to incomplete and ongoing road and drainage works in the central parts of the city. As all Smart City-related works have come to a standstill, people are forced to inhale the dusty air, he regretted. Compulsory wearing of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has come as a breather for many, he quipped. Physicians in the city too agree that air quality is deteriorating as the days pass. Aditya Bharadwaj, a consulting physician with Indiana Hospitals, said that the number of patients approaching him with illness related to breathing problems, including cold, cough and allergy, has increased significantly these days. “It is almost the end of winter and the numbers should actually have come down,” he said. Srivatsa Bharadwaja, an Ayurveda Physician at Dattam Ayurdhama in the city, said that illness related to breathing problems will be there every year during winter. However, it is on a higher scale this year. Enhanced dust particles in the air is the main reason for allergic and other reactions, particularly with people having low immunity, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/deteriorating-air-quality-triggers-breathing-related-illnesses/article33755573.ece

Hindu temples, says VHP||Stating that the State government is trying to take over private Hindu temples in the State, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) said on Thursday that the government should withdraw a circular issued in this connection. Addressing presspersons here, zonal executive president, VHP, South Karnataka, M.B. Puranik, said that Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Department on November 24, 2020 wrote to the Deputy Commissioners reminding them of a circular issued by the department on August 3, 2015. This circular (issued in 2015) mentioned that the Assistant Commissioners should mandatorily get private temples registered under Section 53 of the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Acts of 2011. In its November letter, the department has sought details from the Deputy Commissioners on the action taken and a report on the number of such private temples registered in their respective districts, he said. After the government wrote the letter recently, the officials have begun issuing notices to private temples, he added. The VHP strongly opposes the process of issuing such notices, the circular issued by the then Congress government and the recent letter of the government based on the circular, he said. Mr. Puranik said that as per the notices issued to private temples, they will have to submit details of their immovable and movable assets, accounts and other details to the government. The notices have warned the temples that legal action will be taken if such temples did not furnish the details. “It is a conspiracy to control and take over private temples,” he said and added that many private temples have involved themselves in different social works, including mass feeding and imparting education. He said that the Minister for Endowment should take the issue seriously. And, the VHP is appealing to the government to withdraw the circular, he added.

05 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||CITU condemns cut in ICDS funding||Activists of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) staged a demonstration in the city on Thursday against the curtailing of allocation to the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) in the Union Budget. They said that the allocation has been curtailed by 30 per cent resulting in slashing of the funds by Rs. 1400 crore. This comes at a time when malnutrition was on the high among children resulting in stunted growth, according to CITU. It said the midday meals for children was integral to the ICDS programme and slashing the budgetary provisions for the flagship scheme would have long-term ramification. The CITU pointed out that a recent survey had indicated that malnutrition in the country had increased during the period 2014-19 while UNICEF has stated that 3 lakh children below the age of 5 years die of malnutrition and hunger. In all 8.88 crore children in India exhibit signs of stunted growth. ‘Unrecognised’ The budget also came under flak for not recognising the works of the anganwadi workers who, the CITU said, were at the forefront of the war against the pandemic. But the government has ‘insulted’ them by choosing to ignore their contributions and not announcing a hike in their salaries, according to CITU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citu-condemns-cut-in-icds-funding/article33755200.ece
05 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Cooperation, for renovation||The undergraduate boys hostel building of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) may soon see a new lease of life as the work on restoring the 60-year-old building on JLB Road, which accommodates 300-plus students, is expected to be launched soon. As the management of MMCRI has proposed to take up the work floor-wise of the multi-storey building, the third floor that houses the first-year MBBS students will be repaired first and later other floors would be restored. In this connection, the top floor had been vacated to make way for the works. The MMCRI had urged the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), Mysuru, to provide space for the first-year students in its students’ hostel on Mukthagangotri campus to facilitate the renovation work. MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj told The Hindu that the Vice-Chancellor, S. Vidyashankar, was requested for accommodating the college students for a period of one year until the works get over. “The MMCRI has agreed to reimburse the cost. The VC has told us that he would place the matter on concession before the governing council of the University. This will be a temporary arrangement and the University has been positive to our request,” he replied. Dr Nanjaraj said the work at the UG girls hostel and PG girls hostel had also been taken up. Since the works are being carried out in the rear portion of the buildings, the students need not have to vacate the building, he added. “The KSOU facility can accommodate about 70-plus students, on a three-sharing basis. Since both are the government institutions, we had requested the KSOU to consider accommodating the students with no other alternative available before the MMCRI. We have proposed to complete the works speedily, employing more workers, in about six to seven months,” the dean said. Minister’s visit In November last, Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar had visited the hostel building following media reports on the sorry state of the building. He had asked for immediate repair and directed his department officers/engineers to prepare an estimate for its complete renovation. The ceiling was leaking and flaking and the students had sought repair. A sum of Rs. 5 crore has been estimated to repair the hostel building, and allocation in the ensuing budget is expected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cooperation-for-renovation/article33755204.ece
05 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Rs. 2 cr. for road underbridge in Mysuru||The proposed underpass or road underbridge at the railway gate adjacent to the Crawford Hall has been allocated Rs. 2 crore in the budget. This is set to give a reprieve to the motorists using the stretch connecting to Bogadi Main Road. The movement of trains to Nanjangud and Chamarajanagar, apart from the shunting of rakes and engines at Ashokapuram, used to result in traffic hold-ups. The Mysuru-Chamarajanagar section has seven pairs of trains which means 14 services besides the movement of rakes which was a major irritant for public using the stretch due to frequent hold-ups. However, in pursuit of its policy to eliminate all manned and unmanned level crossing gates to increase safety, the railway authorities have released Rs. 2 crore for the works against the estimated cost of Rs. 2.5 crore. The RUB or the subway will be similar to the one existing on the parallel road from Saraswathipuram fire brigade leading to Maharaja’s College hostel. Major challenge However, the closure of the level crossing gate at Chamarajapuram station will be a major challenge given the clustered development on one side of the gate with dense human habitation apart from a statue installed opposite the level crossing gate by the local community. However, experts have questioned the cost estimates for the RUB near the Crawford Hall as it has a slew of roads converging at the junction from all directions besides the presence of giant banyan trees hugging the road near the Kukkarahalli Lake. Also, there are houses on one side which needs to be provided access while vehicles from Kantharaj Urs Road also converge at the Padma Circle opposite the Government Press. But other sources said the RUB per se will be the responsibility of the railways while the MCC has to bear the cost of the remaining portion of the works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-2-cr-for-road-underbridge-in-mysuru/article33755207.ece

Officers in different capacities in the Social Forestry wing and Chief Executive Officer of Yadgir Zilla Panchayat Shilpa Sharma have jointly made the efforts to choose the different varieties of saplings. At present, 89,000 saplings of different varities of Beech, Neem, Curry, Mahagoni, Syzygium cumini , Taapsee, Peltophorum, Caesalpinia pulcherrima , Shirasala, Melia Dubia, Sandalwood, Tamarind, Bangal and Pear, which are in different stages of growth, have been raised at a nursery centre in Hunsagi and Mallibhavi village near Surpur city. They have been provided with the necessary compost and water at the required quantum. “We will supply saplings under Raising of Seedlings for Public Distribution (RSPD) Scheme to farmers and the general public at subsidised rates to plant them in their non-agricultural land,” Range Forest Officer Somaraya D.G. told The Hindu . The department has also planned to take up a plantation drive along key roads through labour who have registered themselves in gram panchayats under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). “We have also planned to supply saplings to authorities to plant them on the premises of schools, hostels, hospitals, particularly primary health centres, and hillocks,” Mr. Somaraya said. Last year, the Social Forestry wing raised 40,000 saplings in Hunsagi and Surpur taluk. It was less compared to this year’s target as it was hit by insufficient rainfall. The Zilla Panchayat has planned to distribute saplings, under MGNREGA scheme, to be planted maintaining distance between two plants as specified on fields that are formed with bunds. “We will distribute saplings to farmers to take up plantation under the Badu Besaya Scheme to protect bunds from breaching and washing away during the rainy season. It will also help keep moisture in soil and recharge groundwater,” Ms. Shilpa Sharama told The Hindu .

It is building bigger lecture halls and constructing two new mega blocks of girls and boys hostels with each having 150 rooms. By the time admissions begins for 250 seats, the hostels would be ready, according to MMCRI sources. “The work on the six-storey hostel buildings near Sri Jayadeva Institute for Cardiovascular Sciences and Research on PKTB campus on KRS Road has begun and we hope to complete the construction in the next seven to eight months,” said MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj. Importantly, rooms in the new hostels come with attached restrooms, with better facilities for the students. And each room can comfortably accommodate three students. “There is no provision for two-sharing. Either it is single or three-sharing. In these hostels, the rooms come with three-sharing accommodation,” said Dr. Nanjaraj. MMCRI’s UG intake would have been increased to 250 by now but the MCI rejected its proposal earlier on the grounds that it doesn’t attend to 3,000-plus outpatients. Guidelines revised “With the coming up of the National Medical Commission in place of MCI, the guidelines for increasing the MBBS seats had been revised and the MMCRI stood a chance to get the approval for 250 intake since the hospitals attached to the college were attending to nearly 2,300 outpatients daily,” he explained. The OPD numbers were actually around 3,000 previously but the number dropped after the Jayadeva Hospital moved to its new campus on KRS Road from K.R. Hospital premises. The Jayadeva outpatients were added to the hospitals’ outpatients list. “The number of patients availing outpatient services was actually more than 3,000 but the number was not reflected in the records since patients coming to utilise the services repeatedly were not presently being considered in the system. With the launch of e-Hospital, the repeat patients’ entry will henceforth be recorded in the system which is bar-coded. By this way, we will be able to cross the number prescribed by the MCI for getting the permission on the intake,” Dr. Nanjaraj said. The MMCRI has also taken up the task of constructing four “mega” classrooms or lecture hall complexes on its campus here to stand a chance of increasing the intake of MBBS seats from 150 to 250 seats. With 60:40 funding, 300-seater lecture halls are coming up for accommodating more number of students. The erstwhile Medical Council of India (MCI) did not increase the seat intake and one of the reasons was that the MMCRI lacked bigger classrooms – for accommodating 250 students if the permission was granted. Another reason for denying permission for the higher intake was that the number of outpatients treated at the K.R. Hospital, the teaching hospital of MMCRI, was less than 3,000 daily.  Rooms in the new hostels come with attached restrooms, with better facilities for the students.  Each room can comfortably accommodate three students.  With 60:40 funding, 300-seater lecture halls are coming up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mmcri-scaling-up-infrastructure/article33755206.ece

A. Sheeja, project manager, UIDSSMT, said pumping was likely to be restarted by Friday evening after completing the repair work. “If things go as planned, consumers will start getting water from Friday evening and normal water supply will be restored by Saturday morning,” Ms. Sheeja said. Road damaged The latest burst occurred near the Kelamangalam bridge on Tuesday night. It damaged the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road and disrupted water supply to thousands of houses in the Alappuzha municipal area and eight nearby grama panchayats. Following the disruption in water supply, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) and Alappuzha municipality have pressed tankers into service to provide potable water to households. The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the KWA with Central assistance under the UIDSSMT in 2017. However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 50 times, majority of them at Thakazhy and Kelamangalam, in three-and-a-half years, disrupting water supply to residents in Alappuzha municipality and nearby grama panchayats along with damaging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road. A meeting convened by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 had decided to replace the defective pipeline in three months, but the project remains in limbo. Although the KWA prepared a tentative schedule for starting the pipe-relaying work on March 18, 2020, the work failed to take off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1,524 m pipe As per the plan, 1,524 m of the defective pipeline will have to be replaced. This includes 1,084 m of faulty pipeline at Thakazhy and another 440 m at Kelamangalam. Officials said that although the Public Works Department had given its nod through a government order, they were awaiting the permission from the Kerala Road Fund Board, the owner of the road, to start the work.

05 February 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||Move to declare eco-sensitive zones around sanctuary flayed||Protest is brewing against a draft notification of the Ministry of Forests and Environment to declare eco-sensitive zones around the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, which shares its borders with many villages in the district. According to the draft notification issued on January 28, the eco-sensitive zone would be an extent of 0 to 3.4 km around the boundary of the sanctuary. “It will badly affect the lives of thousands of farmers on the fringes of the sanctuary spread over six villages under Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery taluks,” said P.M. Joy, chairman, Karshika Purogamana Samiti (KPS). As much as 29,291 acres of private land on the fringes of the sanctuary would come under the zone and the development of towns like Sulthan Bathery and Kattikulam would be stopped for ever, Mr. Joy said. All development in eco-sensitive zones, including construction of roads and houses, would be affected and farmers would not be able to cut trees they had planted on their land without the permission of forest officials, Mr. Joy said. Wild animal attacks The lives of farmers on the forest fringes is miserable owing to the increasing incidents of wild animal attacks, said T.C. Joseph, chairman, Wayanad Action Committee to Prevent Wildlife Attack. “When the sanctuary was established in 1973, the government had assured that equal importance would be given to human life and wildlife. But gradually, the importance was given only to wildlife,” he said. “As many as 147 persons were killed in wildlife attack in the district in the past 38 years, he said. The farming community living adjacent to the forest were always conserving the forest and wildlife. So the government should restrict the zone to the forest itself,” he added. Religious organisations and political parties are also planning to launch protest against the Ministry’s move. The KPS would convene a meeting of all farmer organisations in the district at 2.p.m. at Sulthan Bathery on Monday demanding to withdraw the notification. The meet would also decide the mode of agitation against the notification, Mr. Joy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/move-to-declare-eco-sensitive-zones-around-sanctuary-flayed/article33755053.ece

The chair, set up at the behest of the State government, will address the lack of facilities for research and development in public sector undertakings in the State, says KEL Managing Director Shaji Varghese. Launch on Feb. 9 The industry-university chair, to be launched by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the Rs. 12.5-crore Mamala unit of KEL on February 9 via videoconferencing, would analyse ideas floated by the electrical company about its new range of products and involve research students in the development of the product using KEL’s manufacturing facilities. The process would help KEL develop new market-oriented products and open up an opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience during their research. The adoption of the industry-university chair concept to include other areas of activities could help launch another wave of industrialisation in the State. The KEL official said the NIT-C and the PSU had already signed an agreement for transfer of technology for manufacturing high-frequency electronic transformers. The concept of high-frequency transformers has been developed by researchers at the NIT-C. These are much smaller than the conventional transformers. A proposal has been submitted to the government to begin industrial production of the new technology transformers, he added. KEL, established in 1964, is fully owned by the State government and has four manufacturing facilities. The company’s clients include the defence forces and Railways and produces alternators for lighting and air-conditioning rail coaches, distribution transformers, frequency converters, and power packs for missile projects. The company had a turnover of over Rs. 127 crore and a net profit of Rs. 68 crore during last financial year. Transformer facility A release said the Chief Minister would also inaugurate a power transformer manufacturing facility at the Mamala unit of KEL on February 9. The plant had been set up with an investment of Rs. 12.5 crore. An electrical vehicle charging station would also be inaugurated on the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway near the power transformer plant. It would be useful for vehicles going to Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam, Idukki, and Munnar from Ernakulam.

05 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||NIA outlines modus operandi||K.T. Ramees, who formed a terrorist gang for smuggling gold through the diplomatic channel, carried out two trial runs using consignments without gold on July 14, 2019. These consignments were received and cleared by P.S. Sarith, another accused, at the international airport in Thiruvananthapuram, according to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Chargesheet In its chargesheet filed before the NIA Special Court here recently in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, the agency said the terrorist gang, apart from Sarith, comprised Swapna Suresh, Sandeep Nair, A.M. Jalal, P. Mohammed Shafi, Saidalavi E. Bava, P.T. Abdu, Rabins Hameed, Hamzath Abdulsalam, T.M. Samju, Shamshudeen, and others. The smuggling of large quantities of gold was carried out with the intention of threatening the economic security of the nation, the agency said.  The Hindu had earlier reported the NIA finding that the accused had formed a terrorist gang for smuggling gold. Providing details of their alleged modus operandi, the NIA said Ramees had conspired with Jalal and others to send consignments from the UAE to test the secrecy and reliability of the smuggling channel. Sarith, Public Relations Officer of the Consulate General of the UAE, Thiruvananthapuram, during September 2019, had retained with him the sample letter pad of the Consulate General with authorisation letters on behalf of the Consul General. The letter pads had forged signatures of the diplomat and the seal of the Consulate General, Thiruvananthapuram, the chargesheet noted. Sarith, who recognised that import consignments for diplomats were exempted from Customs inspections, shared the information with Sandeep Nair, who in turn communicated it to Ramees. Import cargo However, after his discussions with Swapna, Sandeep Nair suggested to Ramees the possibility of using the import cargo addressed to the Consular General for smuggling gold. Sarith hatched a conspiracy with Swapna and Sandeep Nair in May-June 2019 to facilitate gold smuggling by Ramees through the import cargo of the Consulate General against a commission of $1,000 for every kg of gold smuggled. It was also decided that Ramees would raise the gang to collect funds to provide logistical support and recruit more persons, both within India and in the UAE, for smuggling gold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nia-outlines-modus-operandi/article33755178.ece

The report was filed before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal in the case against the ‘consent to establish’ provided by the State Pollution Control Board for the project. The tribunal had asked the KCZMA to ascertain whether there was any violation of the CRZ Notification 2011 or 2019, if any, which was in force at the time of setting up of the unit. The District Industries Centre had allotted 1.8 acres at the industrial development area for the unit meant for manufacturing meat meal from poultry waste. The report said that the distance between high tide line (HTL) of the Periyar river and the main building was 13.6 metre. The distance between HTL of the river and the effluent treatment plant was eight metre. The width of the water body was 80 metre and the CRZ area remains applicable up to 80 metre from the high tide line of the river towards landward side. It is categorised as no-development zone of CRZ III as per CRZ Notification 2011. As per Clause 8 III of CRZ Notification 2011, the area up to 200 metres from HTL on the landward side in case of seafront and 100 metres along tidal influenced water bodies or width of the creek, whichever is less, has to be earmarked as ‘no-development zone’ of CRZ III category. The width of the water body adjacent to the constructed buildings is 80 metre and the no-development zone of CRZ III is up to 80 metre from the HTL of the Periyar river towards the landward side. The constructed buildings come under the purview of Clause 8 III A (i) (ii) and (iii) of the CRZ Notification 2011.

Three ride apps, including a recently launched one, have already brought some solace to the harried auto drivers who had to wait for hours at junctions, awaiting their turn to ferry commuters. The Ernakulam District Autorickshaw Drivers Cooperative Society, a conclave of half-a-dozen driver unions, will launch AuSa, its much-awaited app, on February 17. “A total of 1,000 autos have been operating on the basis of the app for the past few months. It will be formally launched on February 17, the second anniversary of the society’s launch. It was readied in tandem with a private technology firm as partner. We foresee increase in patronage for autos, since commuters will be picked from their destinations, and they will be able to travel at pre-fixed rates, just as in online taxi cabs. This will also lessen the unending wait at stands,” said M.B. Syamandabhadran, an office-bearer of the society. It will also ensure a safe ride for commuters, since the identity of the driver will be known. The revenue model for the app is expected to be announced shortly. “Our autorickshaw category has surpassed pre-lockdown levels thanks to doorstep pick-up, safe and contactless payment, and affordable fares. We hope to promote e-hail over the traditional street hail model for autorickshaws, especially in the new normal. This growth augurs well for driver-partners too, because it creates livelihood opportunities for them,” said a spokesperson of Uber. Apart from safety screens, the firm has a set of safety measures, such as the Go Online Checklist, a mandatory mask policy for both riders and drivers, pre-trip mask verification selfies for drivers and riders, and mandatory driver education on safety SOPs. It has also updated its cancellation policy allowing both riders and drivers to cancel trips if they do not feel safe, driving a shared sense of responsibility, the spokesperson added. Ola too has more or less recovered from the steep lull in demand during the peak-pandemic situation. “We staged a comeback in Kochi, and 600 of our autos are in operation, as compared to 700 earlier. More drivers are coming forward to attach with our platform. The impending arrival of e-autos will further boost patronage for autos,” he said. The latest online entrant is Jugnoo, which, its promoters say, has so far arrayed 200 autos. “The service will for now be available only in Kochi city. The firm has also tied up with 50 shops which will book rides for their customers who are not net-savvy. Drivers are getting attracted, since we charge less than half the commission charged by many online platforms,” said Shajo Jose, secretary, Online Cab Drivers Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ride-apps-a-game-changer-for-autos/article33755535.ece

The move comes shortly after tests revealed high levels of faecal contamination and depleting oxygen levels in Perandoor and Edappally canals. The total coliform count, indicating faecal contamination, had exceeded the maximum permissible limits by 160 and 96 times respectively in both the canals, according to test results of samples collected from the canals over a period of two weeks starting from December second week. Waste management The analysis of the physico-chemical and microbial quality of the water samples in canals has to be carried out in response to the directions given by the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the case related to the unscientific management of solid waste in the State. As per an order issued by Adarsh Kumar Goel, chairperson of the NGT’s Principal Bench, the Chief Secretary has to take steps to ensure proper treatment of plastic, biomedical and construction and demolition waste, which are linked with solid waste treatment and disposal. The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management appointed by the tribunal had also directed the board and other enforcement agencies to initiate immediate steps to check the pollution of rivers, canals and other waterbodies through illegal dumping of waste and discharge of effluents and septage. Senior board officials said teams would be deployed to carry out analysis of samples from major canals under the Kochi Corporation as part of its study. Action plans The parameters to be assessed include pH level, dissolved and suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The board will convene a meeting with civic body officials to chalk out action plans to prevent the pollution of canals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-to-analyse-water-quality-of-canals/article33755549.ece

The work, estimated to cost around Rs. 20 lakh, has been allotted to the buildings section of the Public Works Department (PWD) and is about to be tendered. The district jail sources said the block would be able to accommodate around 20 persons at a time and could also lodge transgender accused from the neighbouring districts of Kottayam and Idukki. Once the new block materialises, the district jail will be the only one among six jails in Ernakulam to have such a facility. Aluva police station The move comes close on the heels of the opening of a new police station at Aluva with a dedicated cell for transgender persons, the only station in central Kerala to have one at present. “It is only fitting that new-age police stations are accommodative of the new realities and change in statutes and rules. Society is getting evolved all the time and police stations alone cannot stand still,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). At present, police stations make stopgap arrangements when transgender persons are to be held overnight. “Usually they are kept in a common area where they can be monitored if the cell is already occupied. But, if they are violent and there is no way but to lock them up, then we put them in the cell and move out existing inmates and think on our foot to find alternative provisions to accommodate them,” said a police officer on condition of anonymity. The district jail at Palakkad and the Central prison at Viyyur have a dedicated block each for transgender persons, with a combined capacity of around 30. Even transgender accused from Ernakulam district are moved into these two jails. At present, the two blocks collectively have three inmates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/district-jail-set-to-get-transgender-block/article33755542.ece
05 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fishers slam MoU for trawlers||Fishers’ unions have slammed reports that the Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) is building 400 trawlers for a US-based company, even as the Fisheries Department categorically denied any knowledge of an MoU between the two entities for the trawler project. Both Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi and Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation, representing traditional fishers, said the widely reported development was an indication of the invasion of the fishing sector by big capital. “It is totally against the policies of the State government and will seriously impact the current equilibrium in the sector,” said Charles George of Aikya Vedhi. Meanwhile, Minister for Fisheries J. Mercykutty Amma denied any knowledge of the development. She said no licence was being issued to trawlers. According to her, the Fisheries Department is in negotiation with Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) for building 10 tuna long liners and gillnet boats for the cooperative sector. The Minister felt that more vessels in the fishing scene could trigger conflict for resources. V.D. Majeendran of the Matsya Thozhilali Federation said no stakeholder was aware of any development related to building or deploying more trawlers off the Kerala coast. “There is no space for more vessels, as marine resources are already much stretched,” he said. A senior KSINC official said the MoU to build 400 trawlers for the US-based EMCC International at Rs. 2,950 crore was a work order. “For KSINC it is a huge work order. They will utilise it [trawlers] in Gujarat or Odisha if they have any issues in Kerala.” KSINC, created in 1975, is the pioneer in the public sector in inland navigation in Kerala waters. While it operates barges, the company has also two yards where it builds small vessels and carries out maintenance work. The PSU also operates two cruise vessels — Sagararani and Nefertiti . The official also said the order for the vessels was from a private investor, who had signed an agreement with the State government during the investment promotion conclave ASCEND 2020. KSINC is to construct the vessel and provide infrastructure. He said people were confusing other issues with KSINC’s work. Mr. Majeendran was of the view that big capital is pressing to exploit the resources off the coast just as it has done on the coast. Reports of MoU for building trawlers is an indication of the shape of things to come when traditional fishers will be alienated. Mr. George, citing official estimates, argued that deep sea fishing off the coast of Kerala could support 37 tuna long liners and gillnet boats and 11 squid jiggers. More large vessels in the scene could end up in over-exploitation as “we are already harvesting resources at the optimum, sustainable level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-slam-mou-for-trawlers/article33755543.ece
05 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Support protesting farmers, says priest||There is a need for Christians to close ranks with the protesting farmers who are fighting for justice, says Father Y.T. Vinayaraj, theologian, writer and chief editor of the Malankara Sabha Tharaka , the organ of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church headquartered in Thiruvalla. “The Christian faith is essentially anti-imperialist and the Church is duty-bound to join forces with people’s resistance movements,” says Dr. Vinayaraj, who took to Facebook the other day to make a fervent appeal for support to the farmers. ‘Offer resistance’ According to him, the Centre is colluding with neo-liberal capitalist forces to divest the farmers and other ordinary people of their rightful share of resources. “This government relies on religious nationalism to gain political legitimacy and deals with an iron hand democratic protests seeking justice. We have had so many instances of this: the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University, the anti-CAA [Citizenship (Amendment) Act] protests, the justice for Rohit Vemula movement and now the farmers’ agitation. It is time subaltern and democratic forces came together to offer resistance,” Dr. Vinayaraj, who also teaches at the Mar Thoma seminary, told The Hindu over phone. ‘Support the deprived’ He feels let down by the leaders of a section of the Catholic Church who he thinks “are only trying to push their vested interests by joining hands with the undemocratic forces”. “What are they trying to strike a deal for? Mere representation in minority forums or for some personal gains? When asked if they discussed the farmers’ protest during their meeting with the Prime Minister, one bishop said they had not discussed any political issue. But isn’t solidarity with the suffering and the deprived classes, the Dalits, at the heart of Christianity? It is a fake religiosity without that,” argues Dr. Vinayaraj, who wants the Church to be a reformist force. Images of the exodus of migrants, the protesting farmers, imprisonment of human rights activists, persecution of women, Dalits and sexual minorities and a government that was increasingly becoming authoritarian were all invoked by the editorial of the Mar Thoma Church organ in its December 2020 issue, asking what these signs portended for the Church. Dr. Vinayaraj, who had stood in solidarity with the nuns and the laity that protested against the rape-accused bishop Franco Mulakkal, says “the faithful should stand with the oppressed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/church-must-back-resistance-movements-says-priest/article33755122.ece
05 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Appointment of CPI(M) leader’s wife at Sanskrit varsity sparks row||The appointment of R. Ninitha, wife of M.B. Rajesh, former MP of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), as assistant professor in the Department of Malayalam at the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, has sparked a controversy after one of the subject experts on the interview board alleged irregularities in the selection process. Ummer Tharamel, Head of the Department of Malayalam and Kerala Studies, Calicut University, who was among the three subject experts on the seven-member selection committee, took to social media to allege that “it was his first experience where the rank list went topsy-turvy”. The charge He said the appointment of Assistant Professor (Malayalam), however, was not in tune with the rank list given by the board. “Those who got the first two ranks were bypassed to choose the third rank holder for the post,” Mr. Tharamel told The Hindu . Ms. Ninitha was ranked first on the list of the candidates under the Muslim category. Prof. Tharamel said he, along with the other subject experts, had registered their opposition and criticism of the selection process before the varsity authorities. Ms. Ninitha joined the Department of Malayalam on Wednesday, according to university officials.  VC denies it Vice Chancellor Dharmarajan P.K. denied the allegations while stating that the selection process was transparent and as per the rules and regulations prescribed by the University Grants Commission. “Each member on the selection committee was asked to write down the marks won by the candidates. They were later compiled to publish the final rank list,” he said. Asked about the marks won by each candidate, Prof. Dharmarajan said it was confidential and could be revealed only before court, if required. The Save University Campaign Committee petitioned Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who is the Chancellor of the varsity, against the appointment. R.S. Sasikumar, chairman of the committee, alleged that the rank list was manipulated to appoint Ms. Ninitha. The selection process was subverted to recruit CPI(M) cadres and their relatives in several vacancies in Sanskrit University. Political considerations loomed large over the preparation of the rank list for the post of assistant professor in the Malayalam Department, he said. The committee urged the Governor to stay the selection process immediately.

05 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Shift to RT-PCR may not serve the purpose||A shift towards increasing RT-PCR tests at the cost of quicker and cheaper antigen tests is likely to hit several roadblocks and may not prove to be useful. Chief Minister Pinrayi Vijayan had said recently that testing would shoot up to a lakh daily, with 75% of these required to be RT-PCR tests. A recent technical paper of the Health Department on its testing strategy says rapid antigen tests are more efficient in containing COVID-19 since PCR samples will have to be transported to a centralised lab staffed by experts, driving up costs and affecting frequency of testing. “Unwarranted use of RT-PCR as a routine test will detect people who are non-infectious and add unnecessary burden to the people and the system,” the paper says. RT-PCR tests can be positive in individuals for up to 42 days, though they might be infectious only for seven to eight days, it says. The presence of viral nucleic acid that the test detects does not always indicate contagiousness, and it could identify infected people after the infectious period has passed, the paper explains. “If we shift to RT-PCR tests, we might not be able to ensure regional distribution of tests, since we will be shifting testing facilities from the field to the laboratory. For regional distribution of tests, antigen tests are more advantageous considering they can be done even at primary health centres without the need for a sophisticated lab,” says Anish T.S., Associate Professor at the Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. Waiting time “In districts where we do not have sufficient RT-PCR testing facilities, waiting time for results will go up. That time delay could increase chances of spread,” he says. “Even ramping up facilities in the government sector now will have limitations. Insisting on 75,000 RT-PCR tests daily will mean that a large majority will have to be done in the private sector,” he says. On the increased focus on RT-PCR tests, A. Sukumaran, former State epidemiologist assisting the Health Department in Wayanad with COVID-19 control measures, says that RT-PCR tests are likely to find few takers in private labs considering its higher cost. “Just shifting to RT-PCR testing does not mean good results are guaranteed. Strict maintenance of quality is needed. Where huge outbreaks are reported, antigen tests have been useful,” says Dr. Anish.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shift-to-rt-pcr-may-not-serve-the-purpose/article33755157.ece
05 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||e-yatra to get new lease of life||After failing to find any bidder twice before since it was conceived nearly six years ago, e-yatra, the Rs. 26-crore World Bank-funded project aimed at comprehensive traffic reforms along the accident-prone Vypeen-Munambam State highway, is about to be tendered yet again. The proposal is either to float two tenders by splitting the various components of the project considering that it had no takers when tendered as a whole or to directly assign some components to government agencies like Keltron and invite bids for the rest of the work as a single tender. The project, the brainchild of Vypeen MLA S. Sarma, evolved during the fag end of the previous government’s term after much blood was spilt and lives were lost along the highway, as traffic increased manyfold with the commissioning of the Vallarpadam Container Transshipment Terminal and the Petronet LNG Terminal. E-yatra was drawn up at a workshop of officials of the PWD and the Transport Department, people’s representatives, political party representatives, and prominent personalities. Initially, the estimated project cost stood at Rs. 33.81 crore, with the PWD to undertake work worth Rs. 26.21 crore and the Motor Vehicles Department Rs. 7.60 crore worth of work. “Later, the project cost was reworked, with the World Bank stepping in and to avoid duplication of work,” said Mr. Sarma’s office sources. The project had the in-principle approval of both Public Works and Transport departments in the previous government, and it was decided to execute the project in a phased manner. But despite enough funds available for road safety work, no allocation was made for the project. Once the Left Democratic Front government came to power, Mr. Sarma wrote to Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran who convened a meeting in the presence of then Transport Commissioner Tomin J. Thachankary. While the meeting gave the go-ahead for the project, it did not materialise, and the change of guard at the Transport Commissionerate further delayed it. Meanwhile, road surfacing and construction of three cross canals as a solution to waterlogging along the State highway using the budgetary allocation of Rs. 10 crore is under way. The vast stretches of the road are in bad shape and traversing the narrow highway is even more nightmarish.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/e-yatra-to-get-new-lease-of-life/article33755538.ece

About 75% of the work has been completed. Pending work, including completing deck slab, crash barriers, parapet, lowering of span, tarring, kerb works and load test, will hopefully get over latest by March 31. “We will not waste a single day’s work, including night hours. The full complement of workers is there at the site, all through,” they added. The work to dismantle and rebuild the pier caps, girders and slabs of the flyover began on September 28, with a nine-month deadline (June 2021). The DMRC awarded the work to Kozhikode-based ULCCS. Every effort was being made to complete the structure in six months, the sources said. The work to strengthen the piers using concrete wrapping was done along with the dismantling and rebuilding work. The ongoing work by the agencies was unique in the sense that traffic disruption was minimal, since the signal junction was barricaded and vehicles through Civil Line Road were diverted through newly-readied U-turns on both sides of the bridge. One reason is that the girders were cast at DMRC’s yard in Kalamassery and transported to the work site. A decision on continuing with a similar system — of routing vehicles through a pair of underpasses beneath the flyover — will be decided as the structure nears completion. DMRC Principal Advisor E. Sreedharan visits the work site at least once a month to take stock of the work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/palarivattom-flyover-may-be-reopened-in-march/article33755123.ece
05 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Murder accused held after 7 years||The Crime Branch arrested a murder case accused seven years after the alleged crime, on Thursday. B. Ashokan, 51, of Neyyantinkara, who used to run an advertisement agency at Perumbavoor, was accused in the murder of Pramod, 31, of Udumbunchola in Idukki, at Perumbavoor where he was working. He was hiding in Kozhikode town after realising that the police had zeroed in on him as an accused. The police said he had murdered the victim by hacking him on the head with a machete and then stabbing him in the stomach using a knife. The accused got acquainted with a family at Mudikkal near Perumbavoor where he was working on a flex board. He had invited a girl from the family to work in his firm. But she turned down the offer. The accused was under the impression that the girl’s decision was on Pramod’s advice. This coupled with the fact that the victim had far greater social acceptance despite being from a scheduled caste community riled him, leading to his murder, the police said. Six cases The accused has six cases, including attempts to murder, in Thiruvananthapuram, Thodupuzha, and Kozhikode. One case was for allegedly attempting to murder a bus conductor at the Thiruvananthapuram KSRTC depot, another for assaulting a nurse at the Neyyanttinkara government hospital, and yet another case for attempting to murder a man in Kozhikode. A tip-off received by Ernakulam Crime Branch Superintendent of Police Tomy Sebastian led to the arrest. A special investigation team led by DySP Y.R. Rustom, Inspector Rajeev Kumar U., Sub Inspector Binulal, Assistant Sub Inspectors Rajeev, Jaleel, and Benoy made the arrest in Kozhikode in the early hours of Thursday. He was produced in court and remanded.

The scheme to promote the metro as a safe mode of public transport, focused on women and students, was launched at St.Teresa’s College here by Alkesh Kumar Sharma, managing director, KMRL, by handing over a Kochi-1 card to Lizzy Mathew, principal of the college. Actor Niranjana Anoop was present. The Kochi-1 card was issued by Axis Bank to over 50 students of the college and other institutions on the day. With this offer, issuance fees, annual fees, and one-time top-up charge will be waived, subject to one-time recharge of Rs. 150. The card being issued as part of the special scheme can be availed from all metro stations by submitting a valid ID proof (driving licence / voter ID / PAN card / passport). The offer is valid for two months. “The Kochi metro has always given importance to women empowerment. This scheme will promote the metro as the safest mode of public transport among women and students. KMRL is working towards first- and last-mile connectivity through e-rickshaw / e-bus, and other commuting modes, to enable a hassle-free journey, Mr. Sharma said. The Kochi metro resumed services post-lockdown from September 7 and has been following the safety guidelines issued by the government and the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued for metros by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This has resulted in a steady increase in daily ridership, with the numbers touching approximately 27,000 commuters a day, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/metros-kochi-1-card-for-women-students/article33755533.ece

Alongside, a group of district and constituency-level leaders had also protested against being sidelined. Sources said she was forced to attend the meeting of the 140 Assembly constituency in-charges in Thrissur after being asked by the central leadership to do so. A source said while the issue of her reinduction into the core committee was discussed at a joint meeting of the BJP and RSS core committees in Kochi recently, no final decision was taken on this. But the party, it was understood, did not want to risk its chances in the forthcoming Assembly elections by keeping her out and therefore, strictly asked her to be present at the meeting on Thursday. Meanwhile, a source said the stand-off between the State leadership and Ms. Surendran was continuing as there was no communication between them. “We are still plagued by the issue of experienced people being overlooked for personal favourites.

05 February 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Theatre in the throes of pandemic blues||Renowned theatre troupe Kalidasa Kalakendram was planning its 59th production Chandrikakkumundoru Kadha when Kerala started reporting its first cases of COVID-19. Despite painstaking groundwork and careful strategy, the project was indefinitely put on ice as the pandemic brought everything to a screeching halt. After a year of cancelled shows, closed venues and shelved productions, the theatre sector is staring at yet another period of uncertainty. While all other sectors have unlocked, theatre companies and artistes are finding it difficult to make a comeback amidst the pandemic. Not a single show Though the government has issued new guidelines for cultural events with a ceiling of 200 persons, the fluctuating scenario is posing new challenges for physical stages. “Usually the season for professional groups starts in January and our busiest period will continue till May. Every year we get nearly 200 venues and post COVID-19 we could not stage a single show. Though we have been looking forward to this season with the relaxation of restrictions, we are scared to take bookings as there is no guarantee. Though all other sectors are on the path of revival, we remain neglected,” says Sandhya Rajendran, artiste and owner of the Kalidasa Kalakendram. The company had invested Rs. 35 lakh for its previous production Amma , but it had to stop in the middle of the season after presenting it on hardly 100 stages. “The real struggle started after the floods and right now we are neck deep in crisis. Somehow authorities have chosen to ignore us despite repeated appeals. In spite of all the loss I am ready to take the risk if the government extends some support,” she adds. Another blow While many of the artistes and technicians took up other occupations to survive, some others are in dire straits post lockdown. “Though we tried to explore online possibilities, it did not work out. Many of my co-artistes are now working in construction sites and as daily wage workers,” says Kannan Nair, actor. Another blow for the sector is the decision to cancel the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK). “We had appealed to the Sangeetha Nataka Akademi with some alternatives so that the continuity of the festival is not lost. We have been conducting the ITFoK for the past 12 editions and it is easier to organise that compared to the film festival,” says J. Shylaja, general secretary, NATAK (Network of Artistic Theatre Activists Kerala). The government has been doing nothing to revive the theatre sector, she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/theatre-in-the-throes-of-pandemic-blues/article33755153.ece

05 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Kappan softens stance on Pala||A day after the intervention of the national leadership of his party, a distinctly mellowed Mani C. Kappan on Thursday announced that he would go by the party's decision on whether or not to contest from Pala in the upcoming Assembly elections. “Sharad Pawar is the president of my party. If he asks me to give up Pala, I should go by that,” he told presspersons here. Reiterating the stance that it was always improper for a coalition to ask its constituent member to hand over its sitting seats, he said a final decision on his candidature would come soon after a meeting between NCP leader Praful Patel and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. To another query as to whether he would contest under the party symbol ‘drum,’ which belonged to the Kerala Congress led by P.J. Joseph, Mr. Kappan said that `clock' had been the election symbol of his party for long. While the latest position adopted by Mr. Kappan raises hopes of a break in the logjam within the Left Democratic Front (LDF) over the Pala seat, sources are still not ruling out the possibility of the legislator switching sides to the UDF. They, at the same time, conceded that the latest statements of Mr. Kappan marked a departure from his usual way of strongly resisting any discussions on handing over the Pala seat to the Kerala Congress (M). “Among the offers to compensate the loss of Pala include a Rajya Sabha seat with a full term of six years and a Ministerial berth to the NCP in case of the LDF returning to power in the State. The UDF, however, still remains hopeful of Mr. Kappan, who has adopted a wait and watch policy, to switch sides just ahead of the elections,” sources pointed out. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Tariq Anwar, who was in Kottayam on Thursday, remained non-committal to queries of a possible entry of the NCP to the Congress-led coalition. “We are trying to take all like-minded parties together ahead of the election. The election committee of the KPCC is meeting in a very short time and will take decisions on matters, including possible alliances,” he said. Meanwhile, the NCP faction supporting Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran hinted at a possible change in the State leadership of the party ahead of the coming Assembly elections. “The national leadership is keen on continuing its good relationship with the LDF. But the relationship between party State president T.P. Peethmabaran and the LDF has gone beyond repair. This points to an impending change in the party leadership,” sources said. Media creation: CPI Rumours of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) switching sides are mere media creation, Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran has said. He was speaking to reporters here on Thursday. “The LDF has not yet started seat-sharing talks. As such, all talks regarding the Pala Assembly seat are mere rumours. The NCP will remain in the LDF,” Mr. Rajendran said. He said that the LDF would retain power after the Assembly elections.

05 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Kathakali maestro Mathoor Govindan Kutty dead||Kathakali maestro Mathoor Govindan Kutty died here on Thursday following a brief illness. He was 81. He is survived by two sons, Unnikrishnan and Murali Krishnan. Relatives said the artiste had been undergoing treatment at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, for COVID-19. A resident of Kudamaloor, near Kottayam, he had over six-decade-long career as an artiste. He was famous for the female characters he portrayed on stage. Born in the Mathoor family in Nedumudy village, Alappuzha, he was drawn to Kathakali and started training at the age of 14. He won the Kerala State Award for the best Kathakali artiste in 2011. He received initial training from Nedumudy Kuttappa Panicker and subsequently studied under Kurissi Kunjan Panicker and Ambalappuzha Shekharan. Under the renowned Kathakali artiste Kudamaloor Kurunakaran Nair, he specialised in the portrayal of female characters. After marrying Rajeswari, the daughter of his master, he relocated to Kudamaloor in Kottayam. He portrayed female leads in performances along with Kalamandalam Gopi, Mankulam Vishnu Namboothiri, Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair, and other prominent artists. His wife predeceased him. He was cremated with State honours on the premises of his younger son’s residence on Thursday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kathakali-maestro-mathoor-govindan-kutty-dead/article33755144.ece

05 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||CPI(M), BJP two sides of the same coin: Shihab Thangal||The Aishwarya Kerala Yatra led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala concluded in the district with a huge rally on the Kozhikode beach on Thursday evening. Inaugurating the rally, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) State president Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal alleged that the CPI(M) and the BJP were two sides of the same coin in executing the communal agenda. Both are speaking in the same voice to destroy the secular fabric of the State. He exhorted people to stay cautious against the dangerous plan to divide people in the name of Hindu, Christian, and Muslim for electoral gains. The State government has failed in all spheres of activity whether it was dealing with the flood situation and the COVID-19 pandemic, he alleged. He added that the rally was getting tremendous response since it began from Manjeswaram. If the United Democratic Front (UDF) constituents stood together, the coalition would effortlessly come to power. In his speech, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar said the people of Kerala were desperately seeking a change in governance. The upcoming Assembly polls will be different from that of the just concluded three-tier local body elections. The UDF will obtain 80% of seats in the Legislature, he said.  Speaking on the occasion, IUML leader P.K. Kunhalikutty said the UDF would come to power in the State whatever gimmickry the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) did during the fag end of its term. The latest decision to extend the validity of the rank list of the Public Service Commission for six months was only to hoodwink unemployed youth, he alleged. The Kannur airport, the Kochi metro, and even the GAIL pipeline projects had been initiated and executed by the previous Oommen Chandy government, Mr. Kunhalikutty said. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran, Kerala Congress (M) leader P.J. Joseph, and CMP leader C.P. John were among those who spoke. The Yatra which entered the district on Wednesday toured all Assembly segments with receptions in mofussil towns. On Thursday, it touched Perambra, Nadapuram and Kuttiyadi Assembly segments in the morning and Vadakara, Payyoli and Koyilandy before proceeding to the city in the afternoon.  Incidentally, the rally also turned out to be the first political rally to held on the beach post-COVID.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-bjp-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-shihab-thangal/article33755046.ece
05 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||UDF’s ‘draft Bill’ for PSC rank-holders||Amid allegations of back-door appointments and nepotism against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) promise that if elected to power it will enact a law that guarantees employment rights of candidates who are selected by the Public Service Commission (PSC) is aimed at striking a responsive chord with young voters and job aspirants. The announcement made by former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, while inaugurating the Aishwarya Kerala Yatra led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala in Kasaragod on January 31, is seen as an attempt to highlight the LDF’s ‘back-door appointments and attempt to regularise contract staff in government institutions’ in the UDF’s campaign for the Assembly elections. Mr. Chennithala underscored this when he said in Kozhikode on Thursday that the UDF would relook at the large number of ‘back-door’ appointments if it comes to power in the State. The practice of making contract employees permanent is rampant, violating Supreme Court orders. The regularisation of temporary and contract staff, bypassing the PSC and employment exchanges, has been mainly done for those with political leanings and influence, he alleged. By lawyers’ forum The Kerala Protection of Employment Rights of (Ranked candidates of Public Service Commission) Act, 2021 is a draft enactment proposal prepared by the State committee of the Congress-affiliated Indian Lawyers Congress and submitted to the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee’s election manifesto committee, which has given in-principle approval to the draft. One of its highlights is that all appointing authorities shall report to the PSC the anticipated vacancy in each category of posts separately six months prior to the arising of vacancy. The vacancies should be published on the website of the departments. The draft ‘Bill’ bars appointing authorities from making ad hoc appointments for which valid rank lists notified by the PSC are in force. Prison term and fine The ‘Bill’ has a section that non-compliance with these provisions will attract imprisonment for a term up to two years and a fine. “It will put an end to the practice of back-door appointments,” said T. Asaf Ali, ILC State president and former Director General of Prosecutions. The practice of filling vacancies in government jobs with temporary appointments that will be regularised according to the whims of the party in power is an infringement of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 16 (equality of opportunity in matters of public employment) of the Constitution, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udfs-draft-bill-for-psc-rank-holders/article33755150.ece
05 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Over 4,000 complaints settled at ‘Santhwana Sparsham’ adalat||The State government’s three-day ‘Santhwana Sparsham’ special adalat offering spot solutions to citizens’ grievances concluded in Kozhikode on Thursday. Over 4,000 complaints were settled at the adalat that was held in three different locations for the convenience of the public. Opening the final round of the adalat held at the Tagore Centenary Hall here on Thursday, Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan said a time-bound solution for all the grievances submitted during the adalat would be ensured by the State government. Complaints which were not settled by district-level officials would be considered by a separate panel and the status would be communicated to the persons concerned at the earliest, he said. “The main intention of holding the adalat was to offer an instant solution for long-pending complaints. For that, we had assured the presence of all district-level officers concerned apart from local body heads and people’s representatives,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan. If there was no solution for an issue, clear instructions had been given to provide satisfactory explanations to applicants, he said. Addressing the adalat, Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel said the Left Democratic Front-led government in Kerala was successful in making crucial interventions in all issues concerning the public welfare. The adalat was held only to give a final opportunity for all citizens to address their unattended issues or complaints, he said. According to Mr. Jaleel, the free ration allotted by the State government for around 90 lakh card holders was a covetable achievement. This was apart from ensuring welfare pension for over 60 lakh persons in Kerala, he added. Both Mr. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Jaleel also listened to the complaints of citizens who were not seemingly happy with the replies received from officials at the adalat. The majority of such complaints were related to the disbursal of treatment aid and the release of government aid for the construction of houses. Revenue Department officials said the three-day adalat was conducted in the district by complying with the COVID-19 protocol. Though there were isolated incidents of protocol violations, the support of various volunteer groups helped manage the event in a healthy way, they said. Online and spot complaints were considered at the adalat which was controlled by a five-member committee appointed by District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-4000-complaints-settled-at-santhwana-sparsham-adalat/article33755051.ece
05 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Field health staff allege raw deal||Field-level staff in the Health Department have complained of a raw deal in the proposals for salary hike for government staff recently submitted to the State government by the 11th Pay Commission. Some of the functionaries of the department staff unions claimed that the qualification for Junior Health Inspector (JHI) and Junior Public Health Nurse (JPHN) had been a two-year diploma and a pass in Plus Two (Science). They pointed out that the staff with similar qualification and similar pay scale had been given more salary in the pay panel proposals. Basic pay According to them, the basic pay for JHI Grade 2, JPHN Grade 2, Pharmacist Grade 2, and Lab Technician Grade 2 was Rs. 22,200 earlier. It was revised to Rs. 35,500 for all except JHIs by the pay panel now. For JHIs and JPHN Grade 2, it is Rs. 31,100. ‘Hopes dashed’ K. Remjith, general secretary, Kerala State Health Inspectors’ Federation, told The Hindu on Monday that the field level staff were in the forefront of all major public health emergencies reported from the State, including the floods in 2018 and 2019 and the ongoing fight against COVID-19. “Most of the other State governments had given incentives for health workers in recent times. Here, however, our salaries had been cut in the wake of floods and the pandemic. We expected a proportional pay rise this time like what was implemented in Karnataka. Our hopes, however, were dashed,” he pointed put. Memorandum Mr. Remjith said that people like pharmacists and lab technicians had to work only in shifts when the pandemic broke out while the health inspectors and public health nurses were the only group active on the field round the clock. The staff unions are planning to submit a memorandum to the Health Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/field-health-staff-allege-raw-deal/article33755042.ece

05 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||AYUSH caution on misleading drug claims||Now, any misleading claims on “boosting your immunity to fight COVID-19” by Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani (ASU) drugs could land the manufacturers in trouble. The Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) has directed licensing authorities in States and Union Territories (UT) to prevent “inappropriate statements” about classical or “sasthriya” ASU drugs and warned of action against the manufacturers. A circular for the purpose was issued by D.C. Katoch, adviser (Ayurveda) and Head, Drug Policy Division in the Ministry, on January 19. The circular says certain instances of “ambiguous statements and unfounded claims to denigrate classical or sasthriya ASU drugs” have been brought to the notice of the Central government. Flouting norms The official claimed that they “tantamount to be misleading to the public and appear to be in contravention of the legal provisions for prohibition of advertisement of drugs”. They could also desist the people from consuming these drugs. In view of this, “all ASU drug manufacturers in the country are hereby advised not to make and publicise any inappropriate statement or misleading claim against classical/sasthriya ASU drug.” The licensing authorities or drug controllers in States or UTs may take action against denigration of classical ASU formulation if their name and use were misleading in nature. The provisions for prohibition of misleading advertisements under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act, 1954 and Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, which also describe the penalty for defaulters, would be applicable. The ASU drugs are defined under Section 3 (a) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. They are manufactured for sale under licence in accordance with the formulae described in the authoritative books specified in the First Schedule to the Act. The circular said these medicines are “widely consumed by the public due to their tradition of use and time-tested effectiveness”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ayush-cracks-the-whip-on-misleading-claims-on-ayurveda-siddha-unani-drugs/article33755043.ece

05 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||CM: IT office space of 1 cr. sq ft developed||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the government has succeeded in creating a robust information technology ecosystem that manages to attract companies despite the global economic downturn induced by COVID-19. Inaugurating Kabani, the new IT building at Technocity at Pallipuram, on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan said several IT and IT-enabled Services (ITeS) companies had evinced interest in setting up their branches in the State’s IT parks where close to 1 crore sq ft of office space had been developed by the government during the last five years. The government had recently announced a slew of relief measures for the benefit of IT companies affected by the lockdown. While rent dues were waived, the government had also decided to reassess electricity charges with several companies remaining closed during the period. In addition to such initiatives, various factors, including qualified human resources, high Internet connectivity, and uninterrupted electricity and water supply stood the IT sector in good stead, he said. Fourth phase Envisaged as the fourth phase of Technopark, the development of the Technocity as a full-fledged campus had become a milestone in the State’s drive towards realising a knowledge society. Responding to a suggestion made by C. Divakaran, MLA, who presided over the function, to ensure that local communities benefitted through such IT projects, Mr. Vijayan said numerous people in the region were bound to benefit directly and indirectly by the development of both Technopark and Technocity. Mr. Divakaran appealed for steps to impart skills for unprivileged children that would enable them to seek placement in IT companies. Spread over an area of 2 lakh sq ft, Kabani has been established at an outlay of Rs. 105 crore and constructed by Kerala State IT Infrastructure Ltd. The three-storied building offers plug-and-play facilities for medium and small firms. It comprises 27-seat modules of 1800 sq ft, and 10-seat modules of 1,100 sq ft. District panchayat president D.

The authority, which turned one year old in January, will step up its activities in the days ahead. “In some instances, the projects should have been completed in 2012 or 2013. There were also several complaints about delay in issuing occupancy certificates,” authority chairman P.H. Kurian said. Another batch of complaints pertained to legal complications involving joint venture agreements inked between land owners and real estate developers. 200 disposed of In its first year, the authority received 524 petitions of which 200 were disposed of. In all, 365 real estate projects and 107 real estate agents were registered with it as of December 31, 2020, according to a status report published by the authority. The adjudicating officer appointed by the authority for handling compensation claims received approximately 150 complaints during this period. Portal by month-end By February-end, the authority plans to launch a web portal which will enable online registration of projects by real estate developers. Its introduction has been delayed due to COVID-19. Under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, the authority is required to operationalise the online system within one year from the date of of its establishment. This facility is expected to usher in more transparency as builders would be required to upload on it quarterly updates on the status of projects. End to exploitation K-RERA was formally established on January 1, 2020. Instances of buyers being exploited by a section in the real estate sector had prompted the Parliament to pass the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act in 2016, making it compulsory for States to form RERAs. Among other things, the Act makes it compulsory for real estate projects and real estate agents to be registered with the State-level RERA. Over the past one year, the authority also notified the general rules and the agreement for sale rules. Public awareness about the Act and RERA has risen in general, but much needs to be done in this area, according to Mr. Kurian. The authority plans to step up awareness-related activities on a serious note once the pandemic subsides, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/in-first-year-k-rera-gets-524-petitions-on-delay/article33755129.ece

05 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Caste slur on CM: DYFI seeks apology||The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) on Thursday sought to put the Congress in the dock over Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president K. Sudhakaran’s “disparaging remarks” about Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s roots in the toddy tapping community. The DYFI State committee said in a statement that Mr. Sudhakaran’s “caste slur” was an affront to ordinary people hailing from socially marginalised and historically oppressed sections. Mr. Sudhakaran had attempted to shame toddy tappers as a socially lower class unsuited for high political office. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had echoed a similar sentiment about Mr. Vijayan. Like the BJP, the Congress has resurrected the Manusmriti. The ancient text sanctioned caste segregation, untouchability and segregation of “polluted” castes, the DYFI said. Renaissance leaders had thrown the code into the dustbin of history. They had mobilised the masses to fight caste oppression. Kerala had defeated casteism through historical struggles and mass movements, the DYFI statement said . Plans agitation The Congress should disown Mr. Sudhakaran’s statement and apologise. The DYFI would launch a Statewide agitation against the Congress’s caste shaming of working class leaders. Mr. Sudhakaran, meanwhile, said he had used the imagery to point out the dichotomy between Mr. Vijayan’s image as a Communist hailing from a proletarian family and his inexcusable fiscal profligacy as Chief Minister. Mr. Vijayan had splurged on a helicopter at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic had hollowed the State’s finances. He had said Mr. Vijayan was the first Chief Minister from a toddy tapper family to hire a helicopter for travel. “Toddy tapping is a vocation like any other. It is comparable to rolling beedis or farm labour. Its not a defamatory usage,” he said. Mr. Sudhakaran said he had done nothing to feel contrite. Chennithala’s stand Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Sudhakaran should avoid such comments. Congress MLA Shanimol Usman also decried the statement. Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan said Mr. Sudhakaran had overlooked Mr. Vijayan’s long innings in politics. Instead, he had used the knowledge of Mr. Vijayan’s caste and ancestry to deem him unfit for the CM’s office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/caste-slur-on-cm-dyfi-seeks-apology/article33755168.ece
05 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Century-old library gasping for survival||The over-a-century-old Sree Chithira Thirunal Library at Vanchiyoor is gasping for survival. Started in 1914 by ‘Vayanasala’ Kesavapillai with 25 books, the library that is indelibly linked to the city’s cultural pulse has fallen upon hard times. Local people and library members are now agitating in front of the library, which celebrated its centenary in 2014, in a bid to rescue it from closure. They have formed a 15-member protection council, with former councillor Vanchiyoor Babu as a patron, to keep the library open, which they allege has been in a steady decline for the past decade.  No salary Now, books are not being issued, nor are newspapers or magazines being subscribed to. Its seven employees are yet to receive salary for months, allege the protection council members. The library boasts an impressive collection, with registered volumes of more than 85,000. There is also a rich and rare collection of bound volumes of magazines and periodicals. These include Lakshmibhai , Kerala Rajyam , and Unni Namboothiri . Rare palm-leaf manuscripts are also housed in the library. The library has had a long connection with the State’s theatre movement. In fact, plays were written to be staged here on the library’s anniversaries. It is also a research centre of Mahatma Gandhi University and reference centre of the University of Kerala, says the protection council. The library is managed by a trust. Protection council chairperson A. Rajasekharan says the council has been formed by readers to protect the library from vested interests and seek salary payment to the employees. Steps are under way to submit a memorandum by readers to the government to bring attention to the issue and take legal measures to restore the library’s glory.  Trust secretary Satheesh Kumar, however, refuted the allegations. There was no bid to sell the property. Salary to the employees would be paid in two days. Books were being issued, though only a couple of people turned up in a day. The reading room would be opened in March or April.  Pandemic impact The pandemic, he said, had an impact on the library too. Their tenants had left during the pandemic, and efforts were on to find new occupants. Salary till July last had been paid on Thursday. The library would be developed as a research centre, he said. Meanwhile, in a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the Aikya Malayala Prasthanam said protection of the library was the need of the hour. It alleged real estate considerations behind the library’s current state, and urged the government to intervene and bring the library under the Kerala State Library Council. A joint district meeting of the Malayala Aikya Vedi and Vidyarthi Malayala Vedi also sought the government’s intervention to protect the library. Mayor Arya Rajendran inaugurated the online meet, presided over by district unit president A.G. Oleena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/century-old-library-gasping-for-survival/article33755672.ece

Inaugurating the stone-laying ceremony of the new building of Kerala Police Cyberdome on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan said the State had a long way to go to achieve cyber literacy, despite being the most literate one in the country. There had been a spate of online financial frauds with numerous professionals, including doctors and engineers, falling prey to them. The ongoing efforts being made by Cyberdome in preventing such crimes had proven effective to a large extent. Aided by experts in information technology, the Crime Branch had also been probing cyber crimes by various groups who had swindled several people through mobile loan applications. He added that the induction of educated youths, including those proficient in various fields, into the Kerala Police have enabled the police force to match up to others in terms of adopting emerging technologies.  Multifaceted role Elaborating on the multifaceted role played by Cyberdome in reining in cyber crimes, the Chief Minister said the agency had been keeping a close watch on extremist activities online. Its social media lab had also been analysing trends on the social media that were crucial for surveillance and maintenance of law and order. The Cyberdome had also been able to prevent cyber attacks by rectifying inadequacies in the websites of government departments and educational institutions, he said. State Police Chief Loknath Behera said the agency remained constantly on its toes to pre-empt cyber crimes that continue to evolve by the day. It had begun to work on possible threats associated with 5G technology even while it was yet to make an entry to the country. He said the Cyberdome building would be constructed by public-sector Steel Industrials Kerala Ltd. (SILK) in a futuristic manner. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran presided over the function. Manoj Abraham, Additional Director General of Police, Headquarters, and nodal officer, Cyberdome, and P. Prakash, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Armed Police Battalions, spoke, among others.

The faculty also demanded that they be paid the salary arrears since January 2016 without delay and that the anomalies in the pay structure of doctors to entry cadre in Medical Education Services be resolved. Long-pending demands Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) has been on the warpath raising these long-pending demands and the entire faculty had gone on a token strike on January 29, boycotting all hospital duties and services except emergency care and COVID care, for three hours. The faculty of all medical colleges have been staying away from their academic, teaching, and official duties since then to press their demand.  Indefinite strike The KGMCTA said that if the government intended to continue their neglect of the fair demands raised by the faculty, the doctors would have no option but to go on an indefinite strike, stopping all hospital services except emergency care, from February 9. While the KGMCTA was aware of the distress it would cause to the public, it is the government’s stubbornness and refusal to implement the pay revision for doctors even after a delay of five years that was forcing the doctors to take such a dire step, doctors said in a statement here. Meanwhile, the Kerala Goverbnment Postgraduate Medical Teachers’ Association, as part of the ongoing agitation launched by medical college faculty, staged a dharna in front of the Secretariat on Thursday donning PPE kits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-medical-college-faculty-to-stage-hunger-strike-today/article33755616.ece

05 February 2021||thiruvananthapuram/Kozhikode,KERALA||CPI(M) seeks to foil Cong. Sabari ploy||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] on Thursday appeared to throw water on Congress’s efforts to politically revive the highly emotive Sabarimala issue to rally majority community votes CPI(M) State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said the government awaited the Supreme Court’s decision. It would implement the verdict in consultation with “everybody,” he said. When pressed whether the CPI(M) had stubbornness in implementing the SC verdict in toto as in 2018 by implementing the judgment to allow women of all ages to worship at the Ayyappa temple, Mr. Vijayaraghavan said: “The current reality would come into play when addressing such matters.” He said the Congress had pulled the wool over Ayyappa devotees’ eyes by promising a law to protect temple traditions if they came to power. “The case is under Supreme Court review. No government can legislate on the matter now,” he said. In Kannur, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala dared the government to file a fresh affidavit seeking to reinstate the custom of allowing only women below the age of 10 and above the age of 50 to worship at the Ayyappa temple. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Monday wrote to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to file a review petition against the Supreme Court order. The Congress had viewed the CPI(M) attack on the secular credentials of the IUML as a tactical gambit to attract Hindu votes. Hence, it purportedly raised the Sabarimala issue. Mr. Chennithala said that the United Democratic Front (UDF) will bring in legislation after the Supreme Court had paved the way for entry of women of all ages into the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala two years ago. All these months, the CPI(M) had been playing hide-and-seek on the issue and was now keeping mum on the verdict, Mr. Chennithala said at a news conference in Kozhikode on Thursday. Fresh affidavit? The affidavit of the LDF government favouring entry of women belonging to all age groups had led to the situation, he said. “Has the CPI(M) changed its stance? Will it file a fresh affidavit,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-seeks-to-douse-cong-sabarimala-bid/article33755158.ece

05 February 2021||NELLORE / ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ramesh Kumar defends launch of e-Watch app||Defending the launch of e-Watch app to check electoral malpractices, State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar has reiterated that unanimous election in panchayats advocated by a few parties is against the spirit of the Constitution and democracy, and is ill-motivated. Addressing the media after reviewing the election preparedness in Nellore and Ongole on Thursday, Mr. Ramesh Kumar urged people to make use of the app available on Google Play Store to lodge complaints of enticements. Mr. Ramesh Kumar said he himself would look into the complaints and direct the officials concerned to take swift action to ensure free and fair elections. Shadow teams would closely monitor the movement of people, especially political party leaders from outside the villages who try to influence the voters, he said. Special attention would be paid to the villages identified as sensitive and hyper-sensitive, he added. Mr. Ramesh Kumar noted with satisfaction that the number of sarpanches decided uncontested had come down when compared to the 2013 elections as the deadline for withdrawal of nominations for the first phase of the gram panchayat elections concluded. He observed that the democratic system would get weakened if the sarpanch and ward member seats were decided on unanimous basis. ‘Keep volunteers at bay’ “When there can be a contest during the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, why unanimous election should be there at the village-level?” he asked, and brushed aside the view that a contest in the local body elections would lead to rivalry and groupism and scuttle development. Exhorting the officials to strengthen democracy by ensuring that the voting percentage went up in the , Mr. Ramesh Kumar directed them to ensure that the village volunteers were not involved in the process.

Commissioner of Police B. Sreenivasulu flagged off and led the walkathon along with the management and medical team of the HCG Cancer Centre. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sreenivasulu said that cancer had been haunting the world for decades and was caused by various factors. While some types of cancer were caused by genetic issues, most were caused due to smoking and other habits. Detection of cancer played a key role in treating it. People should look for certain symptoms and consult a doctor, if needed. Most types of cancer could be cured with proper treatment and early detection, the Police Commissioner said. HCG medical director Dr. M. Gopichand said that 10 million people die across the world due to cancer every year, and in India, around 12 lakh cancer cases are detected every year and eight lakh out of them succumb to it. He said that at least one-third of the cancer cases were preventable by making lifestyle changes and avoiding smoking and consumption of alcohol. The walkathon which began at Padavalarevu Centre on BRTS Road ended at the G.V.R. Govt. Music and Dance College. Students and NSS Volunteers from Nalanda College, Madonna College for the Deaf, KBN College, SRR & CVR Govt. College and young skaters were among those who took part in the walkathon. The event highlighted the World Cancer Day theme “I can, we can”. HCG assistant vice-president (business development) Dr. Sridhar Muni, HCG cluster COO M.D. Raghuram and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lifestyle-changes-will-help-prevent-cancer/article33754898.ece
05 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State plans to secure 14,000 MU per annum from solar power plants||The State government’s tender for development of solar power plants with 6,400 MW capacity, which are aimed at reducing the subsidy burden entailed by free, uninterrupted power supply to the farm sector, has resulted in securing close to 14,000 million units of power per annum at a tariff of Rs. 2.48 per kWh. It is significantly lower than the tariff at which AP DISCOMs are procuring power. NTPC Limited, Adani Renewable Energy Holding Twelve Limited, Torrent Power Limited, Shirdi Sai Electricals Limited and HES Infra Private Limited are the L-1 bidders for the projects, according to an official release. The average power procurement cost of the State as of now is approximately Rs. 5.20 per kWh. Therefore, the government has formulated the policy to procure power from solar power projects of 6,400 MW capacity to be set up in the State. BOT basis The proposed solar plants are conceived on BOT basis. The plants will be transferred to the State after the expiry of the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). At the time of transfer, the plants will be operating at 18% capacity utilisation factor ensuring plentiful supply of power at a low cost. The press release said the authorities adhered to all the guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for the sake of transparency. Apart from giving the potential bidders a month’s time from the date of issuance of the notification, the officials had run the bid documents through the judicial preview process. Unlike the previous government, the present dispensation is committed to executing agreements for procuring power at tariffs lower than the prevailing thermal cost of around Rs. 5 per kWh, it is stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-plans-to-secure-14000-mu-per-annum-from-solar-power-plants/article33755612.ece

Besides moving to online space during the lockdown period and switching to ‘hybrid’ mode of teaching a little later, to accommodate part of students willing to visit schools and attend physical classes, the government has finally reopened all schools for all sections.

Addressing the media after welcoming various leaders from the Palnadu region into the party here on Thursday, Mr. Veerraju said that the 13 districts of the State had suffered a lot when Hyderabad was the capital as the Chief Ministers who hailed from Rayalaseema had never cared for its development, nor for the uplift of the north Andhra and coastal districts. “Much of the development being witnessed now is due to the BJP-led Central government,” Mr. Veerraju claimed. The BJP-JSP combine would usher in a new era of development and politics of empowerment, and shape up leaders who serve the people and not promote their self-interests, he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veerraju-dares-ysrcp-tdp-to-make-bc-leader-as-cm/article33755611.ece

The Greater Visakha City Committee of the CPI(M) staged a protest at the Gandhi Statue near GVMC on Thursday. Addressing the gathering, secretary B. Ganga Rao condemned the decision and demanded its immediate withdrawal, failing which he said the CPI(M) would launch a concerted struggle. He recalled that 32 persons had lost their lives in their struggle to ensure that the plant was set up in Visakhapatnam. “The Communists and other political parties, students and youth waged a relentless campaign against the then Congress government for the establishment of the plant. The plant has also played a key role in the growth and development of North Andhra apart from contributing to the growth of the city,” he said.  Mr. Ganga Rao also found fault with the BJP leaders from the State for failing to raise their voice against the privatisation of the steel plant. He demanded that the ruling YSR Congress government in the State immediately write to the Centre seeking to withdraw the decision. He also called upon the TDP to join the agitation against the NDA government in this regard. He also asked the Jana Sena Party candidate from Gajuwaka to decide whether to stand with the people or align with the BJP on this issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/unions-decry-centres-bid-to-privatise-steel-plant/article33755645.ece
05 February 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mixed response to reopening of primary schools across city||After almost a period of 10 to 11 months, primary classes started in schools following the State government’s instructions from Monday. While some schools received half the number of students, other schools in a few areas registered 90% attendance on the first two days. Optimistic about increase in attendance in the coming days, the school managements say that they have been strictly adhering to COVID-19 protocol. Students were excited about the new benches, new wall paintings, new lockers arranged on the school premises as part of ongoing Nadu-Nedu works. It was made mandatory for the children to wear mask without fail all the time. While some schools provided hand sanitiser to students while coming to classrooms, some other did not. School managements made one or two children to sit on one bench. Midday meals were provided in all the government schools. “Our school has received 95% attendance on the first day. Students were very much excited meeting their friends and viewing renovated classrooms with new benches. We also explained them about dos and don’ts in this COVID-19 situation,” said headmaster, of GVMC Primary School, Peda Jalaripeta, N. Sambasiva Rao. He said that students were allowed only if they bring the signed declaration from their parents, stating that they were willing to send their children to school. According to the government instructions, Classes I, III and V were held on Monday, while Classes II and IV were held on Tuesday. School managements made sure that classes with huge strength were divided into sections to ensure two-in a bench seating format. Syllabus woes Some of the teachers and even parents complained about the syllabus given for the primary school students. They expressed that the old syllabus should have been continued for this year, rather than introducing the new syllabus. One of the teachers from a government school said that though the syllabus was reduced, it would be tough for the teachers to complete on fast-track mode. “In case of private schools, students had attended online classes, while students of government schools were not able to attend due to lack of required gadgets. Even the classes which were organised with the help of Doordarshan were not attended by most of the students. We were shocked to see many children even forgetting the daily morning prayer. It would have been better if the teachers were consulted before introducing the new syllabus,” said a primary school teacher from the city. A few teachers said that they have very less time to complete syllabus. “We may be asked to perform election duty and then we have to conduct the Class X examination and valuations. These works will reduce our teaching time,” a teacher said. Some school managements expressed concern over lack of security personnel with the presence of new equipment in the campus. They appealed to officials to arrange a guard and CCTV cameras. Meanwhile, staff from some schools pointed out the lack of sanitary staff to clean classrooms and toilets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mixed-response-to-reopening-of-primary-schools-across-city/article33755737.ece

Students and teachers listened in rapt attention as B. Ravi Shankar, Medical Oncologist and MD of Omega Cancer Hospitals, spoke on various aspects of breast and cervical cancers, such as causes, risk factors and preventive measures. Dr. Ravi Shankar explained that lack of awareness among women, especially those living in slums and rural areas, was a major factor for the detection of breast and cervical cancer at a late stage, resulting in deaths. About 70% of cancers could be attributed to causes like smoking, irregular and improper diet, genetic and viral infections, he said. He appealed to the participants to watch out for breast cancer symptoms and explained that women who do not maintain proper hygiene of their private parts run a greater risk of getting cervical cancer. A vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was available and this would give 60 to 70% protection, he said. Replying to queries from the participants, Dr. Ravi Shankar said that the HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine should be taken after a girl attains maturity and again before marriage. To another question, he said that pancreatic cancer was difficult to diagnose early and the symptoms would be known through indications like jaundice, stomach pain and changes in bowel movements. The State Government was considering administering the HPV free of cost to all the girl students studying in government schools, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/students-get-valuable-insights-at-cancer-awareness-meet/article33755738.ece
05 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VMRDA to serve notice on builder||The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) said it would serve a legal notice on YTR Enterprises Limited — a real estate builder — after receiving complaints from several homebuyers that it has failed to hand over residential flats to them for years. The YTR Residency Flat Owners Welfare Association, comprising several individuals who had bought flats from the builder, had recently submitted a memorandum seeking legal action against it citing irregularities and violations of law. The association alleged that the builder had sold flats that were mortgaged to VUDA (now VMRDA) and complained about non-completion of the building. VMRDA Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao said that they would initially ascertain the facts in the case for which a legal notice will be sent seeking an explanation from the company. After that, strict action would be taken if the company was found to be guilty of the irregularities, he said. The association members said 87 families had purchased flats from the company M/s YTR Enterprises Limited in Survey 77/3 of Tallavalasa, Bheemili mandal in 2013. Among the 87 families, 52 have taken bank loans to buy the flats. However, the flats have not been handed over to the owners till now. Moreover, the owners are anxious as the construction of the flats has come to a standstill for the last one year. “As per the plan, construction of flats must be completed by 2017. It has been over seven years since construction began. I have been paying monthly instalments for the flat without even knowing when the flat would be handed over to us,” said E. Prasad Rao, a member of the association. He added that VUDA had earmarked 10% of undivided and unspecified land of about 1,281.53 square yards to be retained as ‘mortgage’ by indicating 17 flats in the second floor and shown in the approved plan by VUDA. However, the builder has undertaken registration of those 17 flats also, he alleged. Association members also brought to the notice of the VMRDA that SBI has lodged a complaint against management of YTR Enterprises Limited after they availed a loan by mortgaging the same property with SBI, by suppressing the fact that they have already mortgaged the same property to LICHFL, while availing the loan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vmrda-to-serve-notice-on-builder/article33755741.ece

Elections will be held for 968 gram panchayats in the district, of which 875 are in the rural and tribal areas under the District Police and 93 under the Police Commissionerate. Critical centres Under the District Police, there are 140 hyper-sensitive panchayats and 175 sensitive ones, and all the 244 panchayats in the 11 mandals of Visakha Agency have been categorised as left wing extremism-affected panchayats. All these panchayats come under Paderu sub-division and the polls are scheduled for February 17. In the district, the police face the challenge of braving the threat from the CPI (Maoist), as well as controlling unruly elements in the hyper-sensitive and sensitive panchayats. The Maoists have already released a letter asking tribals to abstain from voting in the elections and have also held a few meetings in the AOB region. “Tackling the Maoist threat is different from enforcing law and order in the hyper-sensitive areas. In case of the LWE, we have a standard operating procedure, but in the hyper-sensitive and sensitive areas in the plain areas, political passions run high and this is a concern for worry,” said Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao. Fully prepared Over half of the hyper-sensitive and sensitive panchayats are in the Anakapalle sub-division. This area will be covered in the first phase of elections on February 9. The District Police will be deploying personnel from its armed wing, Greyhounds, AP Special Police and District Special Parties. About 36 static checkposts have been set up to check the flow of unwanted elements, liquor and cash, said Mr. Krishna Rao. This apart, road opening parties, bomb squads, shadow teams, Quick Reaction Teams and drones will be deployed in all LWE-affected areas. “We have already started conducting flag marches and awareness campaigns in all hyper-sensitive and sensitive areas,” said the SP. Under the City Police, out of 93 gram panchayats, 29 have been categorised as hyper-sensitive and 27 as sensitive. Deployment will be adequate as per the categorisation and all measures are being taken to avoid any untoward incidents, said Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-draw-up-roadmap-for-panchayat-elections/article33755743.ece
05 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Woman SI wins hearts for humanitarian deeds||It was around 10.30 a.m. on January 31, when the mobile phone of Kotturu Sirisha, a sub-inspector at the Kasibugga police station rang. It was her superior officer in the station, who informed her that an unidentified body was found on the town outskirts. She along with some staff rushed to the spot, which could be accessed only after a trek of about 2 km through agricultural fields. Upon reaching there, they noticed that it was the body of an elderly person. Two of her staff refused to carry the body, fearing that the man might have died due to COVID-19. “At that time, I only wanted to ensure a decent last rites for the poor man as my father’s words to see ‘God’ in every man had come to my mind and I decided to carry the stretcher on my shoulders,” Ms. Sirisha narrates. As she started carrying the body on her shoulders, the staff who refused earlier, joined her in the effort. The video of the incident has gone viral in social media and Ms. Sirisha became an overnight sensation. She has received at least 400 calls and hundreds of Tweets in social media for the last three days, including from many senior police officials and general public. Roots in Vizag A native of Vizag city, she says that her father K. Apparao, a mason, is her motivating factor. “Though uneducated, he taught me human values and always desired to see me as a police officer,” she tells The Hindu.  An alumnus of the Visakha Women’s Degree College, Ms. Sirisha, on her father’s advice, prepared and got selected as a constable for the Excise Department in 2014 and cracked the SI examination in 2017. Though all my postings were out of my native city and district, my connection with Visakhapatnam is emotionally strong, she says. She had earned a good name among her staff and people, wherever she was posted in the last three years, for her helping nature and kind attitude. Ginni Ramu, a native of Nandigam, recalls how she took care of an elderly couple who were thrown out of their house in December 2019. She not only provided essentials and took care of them for a brief period but also helped re-unite them with their children, after a number counselling sessions, he says. “My goal is to become a DSP for which I am preparing now,” says Ms. Sirisha. DGP Gowtham Sawang’s words of appreciation, “You have resembled what friendly policing is”, have given her a big boost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/woman-si-wins-hearts-for-humanitarian-deeds/article33755614.ece

Satyanarayana Murthy has demanded that the Centre immediately drop the move of withdrawing its stake in the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and handing over the plant to the POSCO. Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Murthy recalled that when the VSP was on the verge of being referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in 1998-99 fiscal year, freedom fighters Patti Seshayya and Bairagi had prepared for taking a ‘Jala Samadhi’. The struggle had not only prevented the VSP of being referred to the BIFR but also saw the plant earning profits in the subsequent years. ‘Navaratna’ PSU The plant has gone for expansion from 3.4 million tonnes to 7.3 million tonnes, with its own funds and bank loans. The ‘Navaratna’ PSU is being privatised on the plea that it is accruing losses after 2015, he said. “The VSP is the biggest heavy industry in the State and it is for this reason that Gajuwaka Assembly constituency has people with the highest per capita income in the State. The allocation of captive mines to the VSP will help the it make profit again,” Mr. Murthy observed. He recalled that the Centre, in the past, had divested its stake in the Hindustan Zinc Plant (HZL) and it was handed over to the Vedanta Group later. “Similarly, plans are afoot to hand over the VSP to the POSCO. Agitations against the move will be intensified in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,” said Mr. Murthy.  BMS plans dharna Meaenwhle, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) opposed the proposal to divest its stake in the VSP. BMS president Kommineni Srinivasa Rao attributed the losses of VSP to the non-allocation of captive mines. The BMS, with the support of political parties, would bring pressure on the Centre to withdraw its decision. A dharna will be organised in the plant on February 6 (Saturday).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-wants-centre-to-drop-proposal/article33755731.ece

Sources said that the field staff of the Forest Department allegedly tried to launch preparatory works by deploying earthmoving machines for raising a plantation under the State government’s Haritha Haram afforestation drive at Rajaraopeta and Suraram villages. A group of local ‘podu’ farmers put up stiff resistance to their attempts at both the villages claiming that they had been cultivating the ‘podu’ lands for the past many years. This has led to mild tension at both villages, sources added. However, the forest staff maintained that the lands were located in the reserve forest area and insisted on digging trenches for plantation drive citing notices reportedly served by the department on the occupants of the forest lands last year to vacate the lands. Meanwhile, the CPI (M) senior leader Kasani Ilaiah, district secretary Annavarapu Kanakaiah and the Girijana Sangham district secretary Bukya Veerabhadram and others reached Suraram. They extended their support to the ‘podu’ cultivators and sought grant of pattas to the latter to protect their livelihoods. A host of local leaders cutting across party lines converged at the spot and mounted pressure on the forest staff to stop the trench works following which the latter left the spot along with the earthmoving equipment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/podu-cultivators-halt-forest-dept-work/article33755657.ece

05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘TS achieved great progress on EoDB, land record computerisation’||The State has achieved significant progress on several fronts like computerisation of land records, ease of doing business and health indicators over the past few years, according to the XV Finance Commission. The Commission, in its report, has appreciated the State for ensuring computerisation of more than 99% of its land records data. Telangana was the only other State to have achieved this after Maharashtra, the Commission said adding accurate and efficient direct benefit transfers depend on large measure on correct and updated land records information. Moreover, ensuring public access to land records online substantially reduces the risk of fraud and deception during land transactions. Referring to the Ease of Doing Business parameters, the Commission said the State government had implemented numerous investor-friendly policies like TS-iPASS for single window clearance and T-HUB for encouraging the startups. These and similar initiatives catapulted Telangana to the third spot in the EoDB rankings of the State in 2019. The State should continue such steps in order to promote industrial development. On the health indicators front, the State is ahead of the national average in most of the key health indicators. According to the sample registration systems survey of 2018, the under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births was 30 as against national average of 36 while the percentage of children (12-23 months) covered by basic vaccination was 68 (62). Maternal mortality per one lakh deliveries in Telangana during SRS 2016-18 was 63 against the national average of 113. The State ranked fifth in the country on the sustainable development goals Index 2019. It was a frontrunner in terms of Good Health & Well Being, Decent Work & Economic Growth and Reduced Inequality. However, the Commission said the State needs to improve its performance in other development goals like No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Clean Water & Sanitation, Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure and Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-achieved-great-progress-on-eodb-land-record-computerisation/article33755515.ece

Attendance on the first day was 45% followed by 54% on the second day and 57% on the third day. On the fourth day today, it peaked to 64% with a jump of 7%.

According to the figures from the Department of School Education, attendance was highest for 10th class with 73% followed by 59% among 9th class and 44% for Intermediate first year. Attendance in government schools was much better compared to private schools as per the figures. Officials continued to encourage students to come to schools giving them confidence about the hygiene being maintained and the precautionary measures taken as per the COVID-19 guidelines issued by the government. Director of School Education, Sri Devasena visited the Zilla Parishad High School in Jalalpur of Bommalaramaram mandal of Yadadri district and also Bhavitha Centre. She interacted with the students about the safety, hygiene and academics. Later, she also had lunch with them to check the quality of mid-day meal being served. When contacted, Ms. Devasena said students are happy to back at the school and during her interactions with the students she realised that they have not lost contact with the teachers. The online classes and other modes of communication kept the students in touch with their teachers. During the last four days the Director visited schools in Jangaon and Medchal districts. Parents of several private schools in cities and towns seem to be reluctant to send children - compared to the government schools in the rural areas. While transport is a big issue in the cities, rural students generally walk to the schools or use bicycles as they stay close to the schools. Parents in urban areas and cities depend on autorickshaws that are filled to the brim or the public transport infusing a sense of fear among them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/attendance-in-schools-colleges-picking-up-steadily/article33755520.ece
05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Only oral orders for nominal charges for burials given’||While Telangana State Waqf Board Chairman Mohammed Saleem waxed eloquent on providing free burial space in Muslim graveyards, the Muslim endowments panel is yet to issue orders in writing on the facility, a Right to Information query has revealed. It was in 2017 that Mr. Saleem said that strict action would be taken against mutawallis of graveyards charging exorbitant fee in the name of providing grave space. While there was opposition among other members of the board who said that free burials are not possible and that at least a nominal fee should be charged, Mr. Saleem said he would ensure that no family members of the deceased would have to suffer. The board also launched a helpline last year after a man was allegedly denied grave space. Cut to 2021, and according to a query filed by a researcher with the Right to Information portal YouRTI.in, only oral orders have been issued in connection with providing grave space free of charge or at reasonable rates. “Oral instructions not to charge extraordinary expenditure there is no GO in this regard,” the RTI response from the Public Information Officer of the TSWB reads.  ‘Public-friendly’ Speaking to The Hindu , the researcher said that he wanted to know the extent of enforcement of TSWB Chairman’s initiative. “Free burials or charging nominal rates is a public-friendly move. However, in the absence of a written circular or order or notice from the TSWB, it is next to impossible to have proper implementation of this intiative,” the researcher said. ‘Particular sect’ The researcher also sought to know whether the Daira Mir Momin graveyard in Sultanshahi is meant for burials of one particular sect of the Muslim community. The board responded that the graveyard is for adherents of both Shia and Sunni sects. The TSWB also stated that the it was on May 15, 2014 that a managing committee of the Daira Mir Momin comprising 11 members was constituted. The body was scheduled to exist for a period of two years. The Inspector-Auditor, Waqf Cirles 1, 5 and 7 was instructed to submit a detailed report on reconstituting the managing committee. However, this is pending.

However, the petition was transferred to Andhra Pradesh High Court following allotment of cases to the two High Courts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. “Have you impleaded in AP HC in that matter,” Chief Justice Hima Kohli asked the Special Government Pleader. As the latter said no, the Chief Justice observed if the Telangana government did not want to do anything for the benefit of the underprivileged sections. She said the State government should have impleaded itself in AP HC in that matter and got the stay vacated. The voiceless children belonging to underprivileged and poor sections should not be left alone when their interests are being affected, the bench felt. ‘Last opportunity’ It directed the State government to implead in the matter in Andhra Pradesh High Court, observing that it is giving the last opportunity to the government to comply with the provisions of the Right to Education Act. The bench disposed of other PIL pleas with similar content. When lawyer B. Rachna Reddy said that her client filed a petition over indiscriminate fee charges of private schools, the bench inquired if that point was covered in any other plea. Eventually, one petition covering all aspects of the matter was taken as the lead plea and decided to be heard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-unhappy-with-state-govt/article33755513.ece
05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Strive to sustain higher revenue from own resources’||The XV Finance Commission has suggested that the State should continue its efforts to sustain higher revenue from its own sources, both tax and non-tax. The Commission appreciated the State government for its low dependence on Central transfers indicating greater resilience on own resources that most other States. The Central transfers constituted less than 27% of the total revenue receipts of the State in 2018-19. The State also achieved relatively higher own tax receipts to GSDP ratio which stood at 7.5 the same year. Commenting on the fiscal discipline, the commission said the fiscal deficit-GSDP ratio of the State jumped from 3.3% in 2015-16 to 5.4% the next year and thereafter, declined to 3.1% in 2018-19. The debt-GSDP ratio rose from 17% to 22.9% between 2015-16 and 2018-19. The State resorted to additional borrowings under Article 293(3) for three years since 2016-17 and this was over and above the 3% fiscal deficit – GSDP ratio. Deficits and debts “The State therefore needs to bring down its deficits and debt to sustainable levels,” the commission said. Quoted the observations made by the Auditor General, Telangana, the commission said if off-budget borrowings of the State amounting to Rs. 29,965 crore in 2016-17 were accounted for, the debt-GSDP ratio would jump by more than 5 percentage points to 24.9% in the same year. The Auditor General observed that the State registered revenue surplus of Rs. 1,386 crore during 2016-17 and this was overstated by Rs. 6,778 crore on account of irregular accounting. “Thus the State had, in fact, revenue deficit of Rs. 5,392 crore in 2016-17,” the Commission said in its report. The commission also expressed concern that the fiscal deficit of Rs. 35,281 crore was understated by Rs. 2,500 crore due to crediting of borrowed funds as revenue receipts. “The downside risks on the State’s fiscal situation remain a major challenge,” the commission said. On the FRBM compliance, the commission said the State did not adhere to FRBM targets of Fiscal Deficit - GSDP ratio during the period 2015-16 to 2017-18. However, the debt-GSDP ratio remained within the target during the same period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/strive-to-sustain-higher-revenue-from-own-resources/article33755516.ece

05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||IIIT develops AI powered video editing tool||The International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) has developed GAZED, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered video editing tool that combines images and videos from a static camera with that viewed by a user. GAZED, an acronym of GAZe-guided EDiting technique, was developed by a team comprising IIIT’s Centre for Visual Information Technology’s Prof. Vineet Gandhi, and his students Moneish Kumar and K.L. Bhanu Moorthy. In traditional recording techniques in events like music concerts, several cameras placed at different points are handled by trained personnel. After the footage is captured, the video is then edited meticulously by a video editor. GAZED seeks to make things much simpler even as it improves visual experience. While footage from a single static camera is taken, the AI engine triggers a multiple pan-tilt-zoom cameras from a single video output. It is from this point that the GAZED dons the hat of a video editor and selects the best shots. The result is a rich visual experience akin to that of cinematic footage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/iiit-develops-ai-powered-video-editing-tool/article33755499.ece

The programme was part of the cyber security forum of HCSC to promote awareness on mobile and internet use and also follow safety precautions. “As we are aware of the immense increase of internet use by children, and also to attend classes online, the potential risk of many unwanted activities has also grown up,” police said.

05 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Limited local suburban train services likely||There is some hope of limited services of the local suburban trains starting soon with SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya accepting a suggestion made by one of the mediapersons during the virtual interaction on Thursday. Mumbai had started the local trains in a limited way and therefore, the same could be considered here, he was requested. The local train services were shut ever since the lockdown and did not start because of the ‘Work From Home’ by most IT/ITES employees and also students having online classes but now limited services can be considered, said Mr. Mallya. With regard to the phase II of the MMTS, he said most of the works pertaining to the project are scheduled to be completed, but commencement of suburban services is unlikely given the pending payment from the TS government and the railways having spent Rs. 400 crore more than what it was supposed under the 2/3rd funding pact made. “It is difficult to say when the services will start but we have been making use of the railway infrastructure like we had commissioned the Ghakesar-Cherlapalli line recently,” he said. Cherlapalli terminal station is very much on track with the allocation of Rs. 50 crore and as the works start the zone could seek more funds. “The total cost is likely to be about Rs. 240 crore and it could take up to three years to complete the project. We have sought 100 acres from the government but right now the works are being taken up on our own land,” he said. The proposed Nagulapalli terminal station towards the west side of the twin cities has been grounded because the land available is at “right angles” and not at all feasible for the railways infrastructure. At the same time land has been identified at Tellapur for setting up maintenance yard for the proposed private trains scheduled to become operational within the next two years. “Once the the ongoing doubling, tripling of lines along with the freight corridors are completed, then we can consider starting new trains. We will try to provide better services in the meantime,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/limited-local-suburban-train-services-likely-soon/article33755505.ece

05 February 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||‘TRS govt. initiatives developed agriculture’||Development of agriculture sector in Telangana was possible because of the several progressive measures taken by the government, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy on Thursday. He said the measures such as the farm input investment, ample irrigation, soil suitability, and minimum support prices for the produce, have all ensured expansion of the sector and profits for farmers. An example of the results is Nalgonda district, which in recent years has been among the top paddy-producing districts in the State, he said. Mr. Jagadish Reddy along with District Collector Prashant J Patil spoke to farmers at an awareness-cum-training session on ‘Innovative Agriculture Practices’, at the recently-inaugurated Rythu Vedika at Thipparthy. The Minister said high-profit farming with low investment must be the mantra, and farmers should opt for vegetable and fruit, and pulses cultivation, as against the traditional investment-intensive paddy and cotton crops. Mr. Patil also added that farmers, with the assistance of officials and experts at Rythu Vedikas, should learn about national and international market requirements. Later, speaking to media persons, Mr. Jagadish Reddy objected to Congress leader K. Jana Reddy’s earlier statements that no development was achieved under TRS regime. “Let him decide the place and time, I am accepting his challenge to talk about the development achieved in Nalgonda. It is because of Congress party leaders, fluorosis which started in a small village in Munugode spread to the whole of the district,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-govt-initiatives-developed-agriculture/article33755661.ece
05 February 2021||PASTAPUR (SANGAREDDY DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Local crop diversity yet to be identified by govt.||Deccan Development Society (DDS) in association with Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS) organised a programme for drawing maps as part of Participatory Research Analysis (PRA) on millet crops. Officials from agriculture, statistical and horticulture departments were present. Two women from Arjun Naik Tanda and Mood Tanda, prepared the maps of fields in their respective villages. They had a clear idea of the connecting roads and the fields . Not only were they able to point out which crops are being sown in which field. In consultation with each other and other women from the tandas present there, the drew the maps. Once the land was mapped, they filled it with colours, mostly with red colour representing red soil lands. Part on the top was identified with blue colour indicating black soil. Then the fields were marked with crops like jowar, pulses and other varieties of crops they cultivate. Each farmer cultivates not less than five crops irrespective of land holding, however small it might be. The crops are jonna, pachha jonna, korralu, sajjalu, kandulu, minimulu and other crops. They have mentioned about 20 varieties of crops they cultivate in their fields. While doing this, they sang traditional songs as they do in their day-today activity in the fields. During the discussions between farmers and officials, it was identified that there was no provision online system to register all the varieties of local crops. Either it would be the varieties supplied by the government or simply local. The government officials have informed that millet varieties like samalu, argulu, aviselu were identified only recently by the government. Farmers also felt that all inter-crops must be identified separately to prove their existence. “We will register all crops sown by farmers even in a single gunta. However, they will be named as local varieties instead of making a detailed study and identifying them. The decision needs to be taken at the top level. We are ready for joint survey with DDS and CESS in this regard,” said B. Narasimha Rao, District Agriculture Officer (DAO). He has also expressed his willingness to organise PRA in villages during the season. International conspiracy “We see an international conspiracy in not identifying the local varieties. There is a need that the officials make field visit and register all varieties of crops being sown by farmers irrespective of acreage,” said P.V. Satheesh, Director, DDS. He said that PRA is completely transparent, public and information will be collected from all t he participants. Prof. Suresh from CESS coordinated the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/local-crop-diversity-yet-to-be-identified-by-govt/article33755664.ece

05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||No Net at border yet, farmers lose link with those back home||As Internet services at the Singhu border continued to remain affected on Thursday, protesting farmers claimed that their link with those back in their respective villages has snapped. The farmers, who have been protesting for over 70 days, said in a bid to counter rumours and fake narratives, they earlier used social media. However, with the suspension of the Internet, they said, they are now traveling several kilometres to upload videos and other relevant information. ‘Phone calls are patchy’ Gurmeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Moga district, said: “With the Internet ban, the government has completely blocked us out. Even though they said the ban is over, we still do not have access to the Internet. Sometimes even phone calls are patchy. The government is trying to ensure that our voices do not reach the public.” He added: “Earlier, we could simply do a Facebook live or something on social media to spread our messages. This way, we got a lot of support from those living abroad. But look what has happened now. We have been completely isolated from the rest of the world.” Following the connectivity issues, a group of farmers from Punjab’s Taran Tarn district said new ways to update people back in their respective villages are being used. Another farmer, Prabhjot Singh, said: “It has become extremely difficult to keep the communication going. Because we are coming here on a rotation basis, the only option we have for communication is to wait till it is our turn to return. The group that went back yesterday [Wednesday] captured several videos over the last four to five days. Once they reach the village or if they get proper connectivity on the way, they will upload them.” The farmers are now left in the dark, said Manjeet Singh, a farmer. “The government has completely snapped our links with our families. It has now become easier for them [government] to ensure that only their version is out there. There are times when we travel several kilometres away from the site so that we can post videos or some information,” Mr. Singh added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-net-at-border-yet-farmers-lose-link-with-those-back-home/article33755186.ece
05 February 2021||New Delhi,||Duo from Faridkot take on the ‘dirty’ job||They belong to the opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum, but these two men from Punjab’s Faridkot, camping at Tikri border since late November last year, have more in common than just the district they come from and their support for the farmers’ cause. With three washing machines each on the opposite sides of the road, placed around half-a-km from one another, Raju Dhillon, an ex-kabaddi player from a small land-owning farmers’ family, and Gurtej Singh, who gets by as an agricultural labourer, are providing on the spot laundry service to countless protesters for 10 to 12 hours a day . “When we first came here, a few of my ex-athlete friends and I started doing the laundry by hand. Then my uncle from Canada donated one washing machine to us, after which a friend’s family and one more did the same,” Mr. Dhillon said. “We begin around 7 a.m. and the machines then work non-stop for 11 to 12 hours. People come with their clothes and we wash them in front of them before handing them over. Someone donated a tank to help us with the water supply, while others keep donating washing powder now and then,” he also said. Team work While Mr. Dhillon has a team of around half-a-dozen, including himself, on his side of the street, Mr. Singh, who got the machines from a charitable institution in his village, goes at his own service solo. From filling the machines with water pipe in a bid to save time as well as rinsing them of soap suds before dropping them in the dryer to handing them over to their owners, Mr. Singh’s service more or less follows Mr. Dhillon’s schedule and pattern. “I came here the day the protest started. The machines were provided by the sarpanch of my village. I just took charge of them, reached here, set them up and started washing clothes. It has been 70 days since,” he said. “The machines run for 10 to 12 hours every day. They do most of the work, I just do whatever I can to be able to wash as many clothes as possible. The only issue I face is an electric shock because of my wet clothes every now and then but they are not too serious,” he also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/duo-from-faridkot-take-on-the-dirty-job/article33755189.ece
05 February 2021||New Delhi,||Court rejects plea seeking probe into R-Day violence||The Delhi High Court on Thursday rejected a petition, seeking investigation into the violence that happened during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the petitioner to either withdraw the plea or face dismissal with costs. The court also asked the petitioner whether he started typing the petition right after the incident occurred on January 26 as the petition was filed on January 29. “Do you know how much time is given for investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code? You expect the investigation to be completed within two days of the incident? Does the government have a magic wand which it will wave and everything will be done? Should we dismiss it with cost or will you withdraw,” the Bench said to advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma. Mr, Sharma then said he will withdraw the petition filed on behalf of three Uttar Pradesh residents, who had sought action against the persons involved in the violence. SGTushar Mehta said 43 FIRs have been registered in connection with the case. The SG said provisions of the UAPA have been invoked where required and the “investigation was being carried out strictly in accordance with law and on priority basis looking at the seriousness of the matter”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-rejects-plea-seeking-probe-into-r-day-violence/article33755182.ece

Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri demanded that the CM withdraw the decision. In a meeting of the BJP legislature party, a resolution was passed demanding that the Delhi government withdraw its decision and immediately restore the bus service of the security forces. The party MLAs said that the law and order situation in Delhi was tense and there was a possibility of disturbances during the ‘chakka jam’called by the protesting farmers on February 6. “In such a situation, how will the security forces be deployed somewhere? Will they walk to the scene?” MLAs asked. They added that the decision to remove buses in such a stressful time was to create chaos.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/restore-dtc-bus-service-for-security-forces-bjp/article33755183.ece

The deceased — Navreet Singh from U.P., had come to Ghazipur border a week before the parade. Sakcher Singh, a farmer from Punjab, said: “The prayer meet had begun from the morning. It went for an hour. Some performed kirtans in his memory. Earlier also such prayer meets have been organised in memory of those who died during the agitation.” ‘Paid no respect’ Many farmers alleged that, by playing patriotic songs on loudspeakers, the security personnel at the site “did not pay respect” to the meet. Gurmeet Singh, a farmer, said: “Even though we cannot tell them anything, we were hopeful that they will stop playing the songs at that time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/prayer-meet-held-for-man-who-died-during-parade/article33755187.ece

With the help of CCTV and mobile footage, the police had identified the two-wheelers that were guiding the tractors. The vehicles were found to be registered in West Delhi. “We had called around six people for questioning at the Crime Branch office on Tuesday. After getting their statement, they were allowed to go. In the footage obtained by the police, it could be seen that a group of bikers was guiding the route to tractor drivers and the mob to the Red Fort,” said the officer. Thousands of protesting farmers had clashed with the police during the tractor parade called by their unions on January 26. Many among them, driving tractors, entered the premises of Red Fort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sit-identifies-group-that-guided-farmers-to-red-fort/article33755184.ece

He further appealed to the farmers to refrain from using “unparliamentary language as it is a fight for roti , not votes”. Regarding the tweets made by activist Greta Thunberg, he said it was an ideological battle and those who agree with the farmers have come out in support. Earlier, he said it seemed that the government wanted the farmer protest to continue. “We are constantly asking the government for talks, but they are paying no heed.” He also gave a formula for a long protest. “I appeal to every village to send one tractor with 15 people for 10 days. This cycle should continue till our demands are met,” he said.  Police criticised He also criticised Delhi Police for not allowing the Opposition MPs to reach the protest site. “MPs are the voice of democracy,” he said. In a related development, the Shamli administration denied permission for a Kisan Panchayat in Bhainswal village on Friday citing Section 144 of the CrPC. However, the district president of Rashtriya Lok Dal, Yogendra Singh, said they were in talks with the administration and that the panchayat would be held. “We didn’t ask for permission. We just sent a letter to inform them that as our vice-president Jayant Chaudhary would attend the panchayat, adequate security is provided. In reaction, the administration imposed Section 144 of CrPC.” Mr. Singh said the administration was under an impression that it was a political rally. “We clarified it is a farmers’ rally, which we are just providing support. There won’t be any party flags.” When the District Magistrate didn’t respond despite repeated attempts, Mr. Chaudhary tweeted: “144 reasons why I will go to Shamli on Friday.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/keep-delhi-out-of-chakka-jam-on-feb-6-tikait-tells-farmers/article33755480.ece

Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, while presenting the budget on Wednesday, requested the State government to approve the proposal as it would facilitate speedy development of infrastructural facilities. Nationalist Congress Party leader and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said it is a political decision and no bureaucrat should poke his nose into politics. He should realise MHADA and SRA have reshaped Mumbai for good. SRA was formed under the guidance of late Balasaheb Thackeray. MHADA was formed in 1948 as Bombay Housing Board. He should refrain from such comments,” he said. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap also opposed the move. “There are a number of planning authorities in Mumbai at present, such as MSRDC, MMRDA, MHADA, SRA, Bombay Port Trust.

05 February 2021||Mumbai,||‘Worry about agitating farmers, not Usmani’||The Shiv Sena on Thursday took a jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party, which claims to be working for Hindutva, saying it should ideally worry about thousands of Hindu and Sikh farmers protesting against the Central government instead of student leader Sharjeel Usmani, whom the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra would handcuff at any cost. “For 90 days, farmers are camping on the borders of Delhi. All those farmers are Hindus. Tell us when are you going to send them back home with respect? That farmer is fighting for his rights. Now water and power connections are snapped and they have been given a carpet of spikes. Should we call it felicitation of Hindu farmers?” asked an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana . It asked the BJP leaders to worry about the Hindutva which is barricaded at the road. “Maharashtra is run by a government headed by Uddhav Thackeray. Hindutva will not be attacked here. The Maharashtra police will go to Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh where he is hiding and handcuff him. The north is a factory of anti-hindutva activities and from there it spreads all over,” said the editorial in the Saamana .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/worry-about-agitating-farmers-not-usmani/article33755101.ece
05 February 2021||Pune,||Now, Bhujbal miffed at Usmani’s ‘anti-Hindu’ remarks||Maharashtra Minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Chhagan Bhujbal on Thursday expressed anger over the alleged ‘anti-Hindu’ remarks of Aligarh Muslim University student leader Sharjeel Usmani in a speech at the second edition of the Elgaar Parishad on January 30 in Pune. Speaking in Pune, Mr. Bhujbal, an influential OBC leader in the State, said, “While we too speak out against Manuvad [the allegedly patriarchal and casteist sentiments expressed in the Manusmriti ], we never hurt the feelings of anybody.” However, the Republican Yuva Morcha (RYM), a city-based Ambedkarite outfit, said Mr. Usmani’s speech raised serious questions about the polarising nature of communalism in Indian society. Rahul Dambale, president, RYM, said Mr. Usmani, during his 27-minute speech, spoke about the decay in Hinduism as practised by certain individuals. “Sharjeel was expressing his opinion about the moral decay in Hinduism and had qualified his speech with specific instances of murder and lynching by non-Muslims of members belonging to the minority community. He also urged people to beware of those who preach religious hatred,” he said. Mr. Dambale said Mr. Usmani’s remarks at the event ought to be taken seriously. Even in so-called ‘progressive’ States like Maharashtra, there has been mobilisation on the grounds of religious and caste hatred, he said. “There have been mob lynchings in cities like Pune and Nagpur. The Supreme Court, taking cognisance of this, has urged the Centre from time to time to make laws to prevent incidents of violence on religious grounds. In fact, there has been a constant flow of criticism on the bigotry pervading in radical Hindutva as practised by some,” he said. Mr. Dambale said the grandfather of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was reformer Prabhodankar Thackeray, who had criticised bad elements in Hinduism. “In fact, it is the criticism of BJP leaders Devendra Fadnavis and MLA Ram Kadam which is more poisonous than Mr. Usmani’s criticism. One shouldn’t forget that it was their party that was in power when the Bhima-Koregaon clashes erupted. The main perpetrators – Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide – are known for their affinity to the RSS and the BJP,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/now-bhujbal-miffed-at-usmanis-anti-hindu-remarks/article33755100.ece
05 February 2021||YANGON,||Amid resistance, Myanmar blocks FB||Myanmar’s new military government blocked access to Facebook as resistance to Monday’s coup surged amid calls for civil disobedience to protest the ousting of the elected government and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Facebook is especially popular in Myanmar and is how most people access the internet. The military seized power shortly before a new session of Parliament was to convene on Monday and detained Ms. Suu Kyi and other top politicians. It said it acted because the government had refused to address its complaints that last November’s general election, in which Ms. Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide victory, was marred by widespread voting irregularities. The state Election Commission has refuted the allegations. About 70 recently elected lawmakers defied the new military government on Thursday by convening a symbolic meeting of Parliament that was prevented from opening. They signed their oaths of office at a government guest house in the capital, Naypyitaw, where about 400 of them were detained in the aftermath of the takeover. They have since been told they can return to their home districts. The unofficial convening was a symbolic gesture to assert that they, not the military, are the country’s legitimate lawmakers. Some expressed their anger and their determination to resist the coup as they left the guest house. ‘Treason against govt.’ “This violates the human rights of the whole citizenry. This is not a coup. This is a treason against the government. I will have to say that this is state treason,” said Khin Soe Soe Kyi, a member of Ms. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party. The military declared a one-year state of emergency and put all state powers into the hands of the junta, including legislative functions. It said that at the end of that period it will call an election and turn over power to the winner. Anti-coup graffiti appeared in Yangon, the country's biggest city, with the slogan “Don’t want dictatorship”’ scrawled on a wall on a busy street. In Mandalay, a city known for its activist politics, a spirited protest by about 20 people in front of the University of Medicine was broken up by police. Three were arrested. Medical personnel have declared they won’t work for the military government. Health workers are highly respected for their work during the coronavirus pandemic that is taxing the country’s dangerously inadequate health system. For a second night Wednesday, residents of Yangon conducted noise protests, banging pots and pans and honking car horns. The protests have revived a song associated with a failed 1988 uprising against military dictatorship. Myanmar was under military rule for five decades after a 1962 coup, and Ms. Suu Kyi’s five years as leader have been its most democratic period since them, despite continued use of repressive colonial-era laws. Videos posted on social media showed medical personnel and others singing “Kabar Makyay Bu” — or “We Won’t Be Satisfied Until the End of the World” — sung to the tune of “Dust in the Wind,” a 1977 song by the U.S. rock group Kansas. Thousands of people in Naypyitaw joined a rally in support of the military coup on Thursday, the latest of a number of events that aim to project an image of popular acceptance of the power grab. Ms. Suu Kyi remains highly popular. Her party said Wednesday that she has been charged with possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies — believed to be used by her bodyguards — that were found in her house,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-resistance-myanmar-blocks-fb/article33754811.ece

The strike was called by Prachanda-led faction to oppose the appointment of office bearers and members of various constitutional bodies by Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli-led caretaker government. Major markets, educational institutions, offices and factories were shut down while transport services were disrupted during the strike. The government had mobilised at least 5,000 security personnel in Kathmandu to prevent any untoward incident. Only few motorbikes were seen moving around the capital city. Over 200 cadres and leaders of the Prachanda-led faction were arrested for their involvement in vandalism, arson, and other prohibited activities in different parts of the country, My Republica newspaper reported. Nepal Communist Party’s Central Committee members Ashta Laxmi Shakya, Bijaya Poudel, Hitnath Shakya, Himal Sharma and Amrita Thapa were among those arrested. The protesters vandalised at least three vehicles in Kathmandu for defying the strike. Police arrested at least 100 leaders and cadres of the Prachanda-led faction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-200-arrested-in-nepal-strike/article33754815.ece
05 February 2021||Beijing,||WHO team visits Wuhan lab, holds ‘frank’ talks||World Health Organization inspectors had “very frank” discussions with Chinese scientists about the source of the pandemic, including theories it leaked from a laboratory, the head of the probe in Wuhan told AFP Thursday. The talks covered famous claims widely reported in global media, Peter Ben Embarek said in an interview a day after he and his WHO team visited the lab. While he did not identify specific theories, Mr. Ben Embarek described some of them as irrational. “The discussions were very frank,” the food safety scientist said. “We discussed... a lot of the famous theories and so on, and what has been done to explain them,” added Mr. Ben Embarek. The trip on Wednesday to the Wuhan Institute of Virology was one of the highest-profile events on the agenda because of the controversial theory it was the source of the pandemic. Speculation emerged early in the pandemic that the virus could have accidentally leaked from the lab in Wuhan, although there was no evidence to back up that theory. Former U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters seized on those rumours and amplified them with theories that China deliberately leaked the virus. He appeared to dismiss some of the theories. “If we start chasing ghosts here and there, we’ll never move anywhere,” he told AFP. “So that’s also an important step that we were also able to understand where these stories are coming from.... And we are able to, in a rational way explain why some of them are totally irrational, why some of them could make sense, and why some of them can be explained or not explained,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-team-visits-wuhan-lab-holds-frank-talks/article33754806.ece
05 February 2021||The Hague,||ICC convicts Ugandan rebel commander for war crimes||The International Criminal Court on Thursday convicted a Ugandan child soldier-turned-Lord’s Resistance Army commander of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Dominic Ongwen, 45, was found guilty of 61 charges over a reign of terror in the early 2000s, including the first conviction by the ICC for the crime of forced pregnancy. The court said Ongwen ordered attacks on refugee camps as a senior commander in the LRA, which under its fugitive chief Joseph Kony waged a bloody campaign in four African nations to set up a state based on the Bible’s Ten Commandments. “His guilt has been established beyond any reasonable doubt,” presiding Judge Bertram Schmitt said as he read out the verdict in the tribunal in The Hague. Ongwen, nicknamed “White Ant”, was convicted of charges including murder, rape, sexual enslavement and the conscription of child soldiers. He denied all the charges. Judges rejected defence arguments that Ongwen was himself a victim, as he had been abducted by the LRA at the age of around nine and suffered psychological damage as a result. “The chamber is aware that he suffered much,” Judge Schmitt said. “However, this case is about crimes committed by Dominic Ongwen as a responsible adult and a commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army. “The chamber did not find evidence for the claim by the defence that he suffered from any mental disease or that he committed the crimes under duress,” the judge said. Human Rights Watch said the case was a landmark in achieving justice for victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army. The LRA was founded three decades ago by former Catholic altar boy and self-styled prophet Kony, who launched a bloody rebellion in northern Uganda against President Yoweri Museveni. The United Nations says the LRA killed more than 1,00,000 people and abducted 60,000 children in a campaign of violence that spread to three other African nations — Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/icc-convicts-ugandan-rebel-commander-for-war-crimes/article33754818.ece

The trial, which was conducted under tight security in Antwerp, has further poisoned already tense relations between Tehran and European capitals. The terrorism conviction was also claimed as a victory by the exiled National Council of Resistance in Iran (NCRI), the opposition group that was targeted for attack. Assadollah Assadi, now 49, was attached to the Iranian mission in Austria, when he supplied explosives for an attack that was planned for a June 30, 2018, NCRI rally in France.

05 February 2021||London,||U.K. strips Chinese state TV channel of licence||U.K. regulators stripped China’s state TV channel of its national broadcasting license on Thursday, after an investigation cited lack of editorial control and links to China’s ruling Communist Party. The communications watchdog, Ofcom, said it revoked the licence for China Global Television Network, or CGTN, an international English language satellite news channel. CGTN had been available on free and pay TV in the U.K. Regulators started looking into the station after receiving a complaint from a human rights group, Safeguard Defenders, calling for an investigation into its ownership. Ofcom is also continuing to investigate a slew of other complaints that it violated rules on fairness and accuracy. One was from a former British Consulate employee in Hong Kong, who said he was detained and tortured by Chinese police for information on protesters. Another was by a British corporate investigator who said he was forced to confess while imprisoned in China. The watchdog said it found that the entity that held the station’s licence, Star China Media Limited, didn’t have editorial responsibility for CGTN’s output, which is a licencing requirement. Losing its broadcasting licence is a major setback for CGTN, which was part of the Chinese government’s push to expand its soft power and burnish its image abroad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-strips-chinese-state-tv-channel-of-licence/article33754816.ece

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Should Board exams be conducted in one go this year?||With the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the academic year 2020-21, for the first time, students of classes X and XII are set to face Board examinations based on knowledge gained almost entirely from virtual teaching. What are the challenges in conducting the examinations now? Chandra Bhushan Sharma (Professor, School of Education, Indira Gandhi National Open University, New Delhi) and K. Devarajan (former Director of Government Examinations, Tamil Nadu) share their views in a discussion moderated by D. Suresh Kumar . Edited excerpts:  An academic year has almost gone by with students having limited classroom learning. Should the school Board examinations be held now in the paper-and-pen mode? Chandra Bhushan Sharma:I think this is the right time to revert to the normal process of pen-and-paper tests. We had a new normal and very successfully experimented with online teaching-learning as well as assessment and evaluation. It is time we revert to the default [method]. The population under [the age of] 18 is the least affected by COVID-19. They can fight it. But they cannot fight a situation where they are not allowed to conduct teaching-learning. We are not realising that while we have about one crore people suffering from COVID-19, in India alone, 40 crore children in schools and colleges are not allowed to meet or live their normal lives. This is worse than a pandemic. The teaching-learning [process] should also go back to normal. We had conducted NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) successfully. I believe it is a good decision to go back and conduct paper-pencil tests at least for Board exams. The rest can be left to schools. K. Devarajan:I agree that Board examinations cannot be done away with, but the issue is when to conduct them. Most students were not able to connect for online classes. Besides, [most] teachers were not trained and oriented towards the online teaching-learning process. I know that even some private schools in Tamil Nadu were struggling to make teachers teach through the online mode. So, firstly, we can start the classes and then decide on conducting examinations. Let me illustrate this. Three persons were engaged for a task. The first person had to dig a hole, the second had to drop a seed and the third had to fill the soil. One day, the second person was on leave, but the third person began filling the soil. When asked, he responded that “this is our job”. Similarly, there is a Board and they have to conduct an examination, but they don’t bother whether classes were conducted or not. In my view, first, classes should be conducted for three months. Then, examinations could be conducted for those portions, and later, we can have another examination for the remaining syllabi. Given that access to quality online education was not uniform across the country due to the urban-rural digital divide, would it be fair to test all class X and XII students through a common Board examination at the State/national level? CBS:See, I agree that it is not a level playing field. Some students are privileged to have access to modern gadgets and the best teachers. But don’t forget that the more we delay Board exams, the more we are depriving these students of the chance of getting into an institution of higher learning, as well as their teaching-learning time. I quite agree that we are not doing great justice to everyone, but we are left with no other option. Conducting exams will provide a level playing field in the sense that all the children would be writing the same exam. The Central and State governments took efforts to provide access to content through Swayam Prabha, in which 33 television channels were put into use and in all Indian languages through the Diksha portal. Even radios were used extensively in States like Bihar and Jharkhand. So, it is not that if you did not have access to mobile phones or fast Internet, you were deprived. Whatever could be done during the pandemic has been done. Now, let’s get back and conduct the exams. We have no time left. KD:Even Tamil Nadu started an educational [TV] channel. But the problem is that not all villages have uninterrupted power connections. Also, some families have a single TV set only, and some parents may not allow children to watch educational programmes as they want to watch other shows. Even if students watch [TV], it [the content] is very difficult to understand. While the governments took great efforts [to launch the channels], the question is, are they effective? We have to first check if students understand the classes, and then conduct the examinations. Otherwise, only privileged students from urban centres will get into higher education institutions. Even now, many students fail in the first year of engineering courses. My point is that you should at least make them study well in schools, cover the full syllabus, and then allow them to join higher education [institutions]. The academic year can be postponed till January. You will lose only six months. Who decided that the academic year should start only in June? CBS:See, I think Mr. Devarajan and I are on the same page, except that he is insisting that we first conduct classes for three months and then hold the exams. As far as the issue of electricity is concerned, I have been working on technology-augmented education, and for the last 30 years, we have been trying to answer this question. There will always be a difference or a gap between the haves and the have-nots, but we have to manage with that. What I believe is that we should not postpone exams any further. The sooner we bring back the students to normal schools, colleges and classrooms, the better it is. I believe that [the concept of] Board exams is sacrosanct in our country. We want to relax it. Through the National Education Policy 2020, we have relaxed a number of things, and you will witness that in the coming days. The NCERT did a tremendous job in restructuring the curriculum during a pandemic ... I don’t think our students, who have undergone the revised online curriculum, will be in any way less than a normal batch, except that they have not done the repeat exercises. The U.K. invited students from across the globe, put them in quarantine at their [own] cost and [only] then let them start classes. We can provide such facilitiesas wellandstartour processes. Could governments at least make Class X Board examinations optional, as these students have never given a Board exam? The CBSE did this a few years ago… KD:The problem is that internal examinations have not been conducted for Class X students [in most schools]. Actually, they should have at least conducted tests at home and asked the students to send them by post, corrected it and given feedback. In any case, conducting Class X Board examination is not difficult. You can’t rely on internal marks as last time, many private schools [reportedly] fabricated scores, whereas government-school teachers gave real marks. Instead, staggered uniform exams could be conducted. Is there a need to adopt a separate examination policy this year for students with special needs and those hailing from economically backward regions with limited access to online education? CBS:You have raised a very important issue. We are so used to looking at school education from a bureaucratic perspective. We do not trust the teachers, we make a policy that is top-heavy, and then ask teachers to follow [it]. Look, we have schools in Arunachal Pradesh, we have schools in remote areas that do not have even a single case of COVID-19. Why did we stop those schools from going ahead with the normal teaching-learning process,[in places] where we had the problem of accessibility of online technologies? This is because we decide on policies from a centralised perspective, either [from that of] Delhi or Chennai, or Patna or Jaipur. We have forgotten that the person at ground zero — the principal of the school, the teacher of the classroom, knows the situation better. I have been talking to teachers from various parts of the country and they have said, “There is not a single [COVID-19] case, I don’t know why my school is closed, and we don’t have access to technology.” When you make a policy which is top-heavy, which is bureaucratic, which is centralised, you have these problems for a country like India. There is a need to establish a School Education Commission that will look at things from the perspective of schools. This is an issue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and the Board exams of 2021. With your experience as an administrator of school education and in conducting Board examinations, what would be your suggestions to make these exams less stressful for students? KD:The CBSE [could have] conducted a meeting of all [school] Board chairpersons and decided on how to make this examination stress-free through syllabus reduction. But they have not done that. The CBSE is a leading Board. They should have conducted a meeting of other Boards much before announcing the schedule because if even a single Board does not conduct exams and declare results, it would affect admissions to higher education courses. If five or six States do not conduct exams and declare the results, how will you conduct NEET or admissions to the IITs? Secondly, if all Boards decide on staggered syllabus-based exams, students won’t feel the same stress as in writing examinations for the entire portions. Also, some students may miss the examinations due to personal reasons. So, if an average of two or three examinations is taken, their future will not be affected. There is no point in condensing textbooks. For instance, there is a chapter on electricity with five or six pages, how can you reduce the content to one page? The children will not be able to understand the concept. As an author of textbooks, I would say this will be very difficult. As an exception, should a scheme of instant supplementary examinations be evolved to give students who fail a second chance this year? CBS:I completely agree. See, we have made our exams very rigid and that is why we have seen so many [student] suicides. I have been the chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), where we did it [reforms]. In the NIOS, students can choose the date of the exam. I believe we must do this [for all Boards]. We must hold multiple exams instead of assessing students on the basis of one exam. Why is this not happening? My take on it is that we take bureaucratic decisions about education. Those who take decisions on education have never ... taught [children]. They have no idea what a child is. So, they decide the way they have been trained — like an officer. School education must be managed by those who have been to a class and know students and their mentality. As for the assessment of students, guidelines should be given to teachers ... Once you tell them “your assessment is sacrosanct, please be honest”, they will do a good job. We have stopped trusting our teachers. And that is why we are in a situation where we have to decide on so many things. Let the classroom teacher be in control of the class and the principal of the school control the school.  We take bureaucratic decisions about education ... School education must be managed by those who know students and their mentality Chandra Bhushan Sharma||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/should-board-exams-be-conducted-in-one-go-this-year/article33754804.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Missing the Gandhian imprint||Gifted journalist Ved Mehta, who passed away last month, believed that Gandhi was hard to copy. Writing about Martin Luther King’s struggle against racism in the United States, Mehta wondered if Gandhi could be replicated in that country. Mehta found Gandhi’s standards of ethical conduct far too high for emulation by others. He also thought that Gandhi was lucky not to have been born in Leopold’s Congo or Stalin’s Russia or Hitler’s Germany. Under such regimes, ‘he would have met his death in a purge’, Mehta wrote. A complex legacy In the same article, Mehta recalls a dialogue between Gandhi and Nehru during the non-cooperation movement of the 1920s. On hearing about a violent incident in the Chauri Chaura village of Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi decided to withdraw the first all-India movement he had led. Jawaharlal Nehru asked him, ‘Must we train the 300 and odd millions of India in the theory and practice of non-violent action before we (can) move forward?” Gandhi’s reply was short and unequivocal: ‘Yes.’ Gandhi’s rigour did mellow with age and experience, but some of his tall contemporaries remained sceptical of his strategy of mass mobilisation. Tagore foresaw that Gandhi’s legacy might prove tough to follow in the absence of his leadership. However, Gandhi’s legacy is complex and evokes some fundamental issues embedded in the theory of peaceful settlement of conflicts. It is useful to visit these issues today when we are in the middle of a mass movement focused on a subject of Gandhi’s deep concern: rural economy. Those in the forefront of this movement are farmers. The questions their protest brings into public attention go well beyond the validity of their apprehensions and doubts. Gandhi is highly relevant to these questions. His legacy for India, and the rest of the modern world, is not confined to the culture of protest. It also involves an interpretation of peace: its logic and the method of inquiry it demands. Can a conflict be peacefully resolved? A satisfactory answer to this question requires that we understand peace more precisely in the context surrounding the present mass protest. Farmers’ agency Several scholars, columnists and advisers have argued over the past few weeks that farmers need to be persuaded and their suspicion... about the new laws removed. This is also the state’s line of argument. As for the government, its initial position was that opposition to the new farm laws is based on misunderstanding. The government has maintained the view that the farmers who are agitating are misled and do not represent the farming community as a whole. Among experts, those who support the new farm laws have taken the stand that these laws are necessary for reforming the agricultural sector and such wider reform will eventually benefit farmers. Their protest has been attributed to insufficient dialogue. Thus, both the government and the supporters of the new laws view farmers as objects of persuasion or guidance. In this jointly held view, the farmers are believed to have no agency of their own. For the government and its expert advisers, an outreach effort is the answer to protests. This idea is similar to the persuasion approach. The term ‘outreach’ reveals its inherent approach: that of spreading the word across the boundary that divides decision-makers and targets of decisions. Persuasion and inequality If persuasion is what this conflict requires for resolution, let us examine its nature. Along with mediation, persuasion ranks high among the means of achieving a peaceful resolution in a conflict situation. However, there is a condition attached to the use of persuasion in this context. The condition is that both sides, i.e. the persuaders and the ones to be persuaded will be equal partners in the act. It is not enough to say that during the negotiation they will behave as if they are equal. For persuasion to work, the two sides must be equal to begin with. They must feel equal. If there are mediators, their job is to make each side realise that they are equal. This condition is clearly difficult to apply in the present conflict. Inequality between farmers and the state has deep historical roots. It is reflected in the rural-urban gap. As a professional community, farmers suffer from the common stereotypes that the urban educated classes carry with regard to villagers. According to these stereotypes, farmers cannot be expected to know their own good — especially the benefits that are somewhat distant — on account of general ignorance and lack of education. The poor spread of education reinforces this stereotypical perception of the farming community as being simple-minded, and therefore prone to being misled. Education is, in fact, quite crucially responsible for widening the hierarchical divide between the rural and the urban, and for portraying the latter as the engine of change in the former. The view that farmers’ opposition to the new laws is merely a reflection of certain “doubts” which can be removed in the course of further discussion is reminiscent of the stereotype that the villagers are like children who do not understand the complex decisions made to benefit them in the long run. Teachers in India typically conclude their class lecture by asking “Any doubts?” The assumption is that children can only have doubts, but no real questions. The kind of protest the farmers have launched — and have done their best to sustain — carries unmistakable traces of Gandhi. Indeed, the very idea that a mass protest must remain peaceful is a legacy of Gandhi. His faith in non-violence has an unstated, hidden view of the adversary. While the one who protests is expected to shun violence, the other side must also fulfil an expectation. In Gandhi’s frame, the protester endures great suffering, and thereby arouses the deeper human instincts in the adversary’s heart. To see this as a strange, romantic idea is to miss its moral vision and where it comes from. Tradition to political use Gandhi did not invent this vision; he spotted it in tradition and put it to a new, political use. The value system he used and modernised can still be witnessed in certain settings and contexts. For instance, when an irksome neighbour falls ill or meets with an accident, a few people do ask if the family needs help. A similar customary value covers hospitality. Teachers ask children not to take advantage of an injured member of the rival team. Internationally maintained modern norms for warring nations have their origins in similar old ethics sustained by tradition in several cultures. Gandhi used this old value system to develop his ethic of non-violence in oppositional politics. It was rooted in the belief that an adversary has human instincts which can be activated by demonstration of self-inflicted suffering. Gandhi saw the protester’s willingness to endure physical discomfort as a means of awakening the adversary’s saner instincts. The struggle versus values The farmers’ struggle and suffering have failed to achieve this psychological goal. Neither the government nor the privileged urban middle classes seem to have felt a sense of unease over the physical suffering the farmers have endured in Delhi’s severe winter. Many among the protesters have lost their lives and their deaths have been ignored. Over the past few decades, a few lakh farmers have committed suicide. Their despair has not moved many in metropolitan centres and other cities. Apparently, India has gone through a sea change in values, both at personal and collective levels. The charade one routinely hears that education must inculcate moral values, overlooks the broader social context and direction of change. It is a romantic idea that education can compensate for psychological losses incurred in the pursuit of lopsided goals. It is hardly surprising that a farmers’ movement is reminding us of the legacy we inherited from Gandhi’s social experimentation.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||A year on, mind the gaps in the pandemic response||January 30, 2021 marked one year since India detected its first case of COVID-19 — a student in Kerala who had returned from Wuhan, China. Analysing the country’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic so far reveals a mixed bag of successes and failures along with a host of unknowns looming ahead, that urgently need to be addressed to both limit damage due to the pandemic and get back to the path of economic and social recovery. Till date the country has recorded 1,07,90,183 cases and 1,54,703 deaths due to COVID-19 — the second largest in the world in terms of cases, after the United States, and fourth in terms of deaths. India versus the world Official statistics show that India has fared better on rates of infections and deaths than many higher income countries. For example, India’s case fatality ratio on February 3 stood at 1.4% compared to 2.8% in the United Kingdom or 3.1% in South Africa, while India’s deaths per million is 112, compared to 1,362 in the United States, 1,486 in Italy, or 1,831 in Belgium. However, it has not done so well compared to countries of similar income and demography in South Asia. While India’s case fatalities ratio was lower than Bangladesh (1.5%) and Pakistan (2.1%) it was but significantly higher than Bhutan (0.1%), Nepal (0.7%), the Maldives (0.3%) and Sri Lanka (0.5%). Deaths due to COVID-19 per million population in Bangladesh was 50, Pakistan was 54 and Sri Lanka was just 16, lower than in India. India’s initial response was marked by political commitment at the highest level, with several steps taken early in screening international travellers, restricting inbound traffic from severely affected countries, and preparing quarantine facilities for those testing positive. However, like with many other countries, India too has not been able to figure out till now what the best way to open its borders to normal travellers is while keeping out those carrying COVID-19 infection, particularly the new more virulent strains. Lockdown and after India was also among the few countries to announce a stringent nationwide lockdown much before it had a significant number of cases. The U.K. and the U.S. hesitated to impose a lockdown, costing many lives due to their late response. However, the Indian lockdown was imposed at very short notice without stating the strategy or specific objectives. To begin with, there was no evidence-based justification provided for such a sudden imposition of the lockdown without any lead time, nor was its purpose clearly communicated to the public. Was the lockdown meant to eliminate the epidemic through contact treatment, isolation and case management? Was the valuable time gained to be used to strengthen the health system and prepare for the expected rise in cases? Ultimately when India ended up lifting the lockdown, cases were already rising rapidly with confirmed cases per million people going further from 200 on June 9, 2020 to 7,454 on January 1, 2021. Unfortunately, the lockdown was also marked by excessive dependence on security forces to ensure enforcement of physical distancing measures and quarantine-related restrictions. An unintended offshoot of the lockdown was the large-scale exodus of migrants and families forced to walk hundreds of kilometres back to their homes in the countryside. Dozens died in the exodus, with many in horrific road accidents. There were also deaths due to lack of sufficient food, drinking water and the sheer stress of travelling. Their plight highlighted the lack of a social safety-net for poor Indians both from before as well as during the pandemic. State-level ownership In terms of lessons learnt, there are many. First, in the context of the country’s federal structure, no public health response can be successful without ownership at the state level. The lack of consultation with State governments saw many of them implementing COVID-19 response policies hesitantly without much initiative or innovation. This experience has however not prompted any rethink of the top-down approach towards States at the national level. Second, in all epidemic responses, generation and use of strategic information plays a crucial role. Given India’s global reputation as a software superpower, the pandemic would have been an ideal staging ground for fast-tracking plans to create an integrated digital health information system to improve the efficiency and transparency of the COVID-19 response. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), India’s national disease surveillance framework, was not visible throughout the response. While the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) carried out selective sero-surveillance studies in metropolitan areas, these surveys were limited in coverage and periodicity. It is therefore still a matter of guesswork as to what percentage of India’s population have been infected with the virus — an indicator of herd immunity. Civil society’s role The response was also marked by a lack of involvement of civil society organisations as partners with state agencies. On earlier occasions such as polio eradication and AIDS response, civil society played an important preventive and promotional role in bringing the infections under control. It goes to the credit of many civil society organisations that they voluntarily stepped into the response and played a meaningful role in providing social support and lobbying with funding organisations such as the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) to provide social support to affected families. As India joins the select group of vaccine-producing countries, there is light at the end of the tunnel. With health-care workers, frontline workers, people above 50 and those with underlying health conditions covered by the vaccination programme launched in mid-January 2021, it can be expected that the epidemic would slow down. However, here again the end game strategy for the vaccination programme remains unclear, raising questions about whether its benefits will be sustainable in the long term. Divide widened Another critical unknown in India’s COVID-19 response is over its plans to revive the economy and restore livelihoods of millions of people, who are today in danger of starvation and for whom even basic health care has become unaffordable. The pandemic period has exacerbated existing social inequalities and the poor face a ‘lost decade’ ahead, a challenge which needs to be addressed on priority. There is an urgent need to examine all these critical gaps in the response to the pandemic, whether they occurred through acts of omission or commission. Without such an open inquiry and widespread debate, India will miss yet another chance to learn the right lessons and ensure a more robust, well-thought out and humane response to similar crises in future.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The way forward in Myanmar||In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar, causing at least 138,000 deaths and displacing 1.5 million people. Surprisingly, the government announced a pre-scheduled referendum on the military-scripted constitution around the same time. Amid limited communication channels available to reach out to Myanmar generals, there were calls for international military intervention to secure access to relief as the Myanmar military refused to allow foreign aid. It took several rounds of diplomacy from various members of the international community to gain access. This sums up the zeitgeist of Myanmar generals and the dilemma before the international community of isolating a country riven with mass-scale poverty and ethnic strife. There are indeed some common lessons for the international community to avoid making mistakes made in the past. One, the developments in Myanmar will invariably bring back the old debate around the prudence of sanctions. The coup in Myanmar coincided with the first month of the Biden administration in the U.S., which has promised to bring back the values of democracy and respect for human rights to the core of the U.S. foreign policy. Notwithstanding the western sanctions before 2010, China, Thailand and Singapore were the key trading partners of Myanmar. The present reality is no different. Singapore was reportedly the largest foreign investor in Myanmar in 2020, accounting for 34% of the overall approved investment. Given that the military has been able to economically withstand sanctions by striking deals with Asian countries in the past, sanctions are unlikely to bring any major political change. The limited European trade with Myanmar that started after 2010 benefits the poor — the European Union’s ‘Everything But Arms’ scheme targets the poor in Myanmar’s garment industry. The scheme allows the world’s least-developed countries, such as Myanmar, to export most goods to the EU free of duties. Two, the old debate around the need for accountability for crimes against humanity will resurface. As political changes got underway in 2010, many generals, such as Than Shwe, who was the de-facto head of Myanmar from 1992 to 2011 and was on the radar of the international community for perpetuating a regime of human rights abuses, quietly vanished from the scene. This bred a culture of impunity. During the 2017 Rohingya crisis, senior military officials brazenly exploited social media to mobilise public support for brutality against Rohingyas. China’s influence Three, a critical international player in Myanmar is China. China has appointed specific envoys for Asian affairs, who are de-facto working on Myanmar-related issues since 2013. The international community, particularly the West, has to factor in China’s multi-layered influence on Myanmar. Four, many international mechanisms comprising Western and Asian countries that were formed to coordinate strategies on Myanmar were disbanded after the 2015 election. That the changes in Myanmar were irreversible was the standard thinking. Relevant actors should be brought on a common platform by reviving past mechanisms. Five, the expectation that Myanmar will see a nationwide protest against the Tatmadaw after the coup should be examined with the geographical extent of Bamar, Myanmar’s largest ethnic group, who support the National League for Democracy. The minorities in the country form around 35% of the population. In the current scenario, the military will continue to exploit ethnic and religious fault lines. Engagement with domestic stakeholders, including ethnic minorities, especially from the north, should be pursued by the international community. No one possesses a magic wand of solutions. But there is one consistent lesson, that no change is irreversible, particularly in a context where military leadership scripted the meaning of democracy, and domestic forces and geopolitics continuously fail to deter its actions and impulses to rule.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Pious and sanctimonious||India’s unusual response to comments on the ongoing farmers’ protests by some international celebrities comes across as highly sanctimonious. “The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. It advised these celebrities to ascertain facts and properly understand the issues at hand “before rushing to comment on such matters”. The response is somewhat supercilious in the immediate context of what singer and performer Rihanna had said in a single tweet. She had asked why the issue was not being talked about more, while drawing attention to a news report on the extraordinary measures taken by the government to put down the farmers’ protests, including the laying of trenches and barricades and banning the Internet. Other international personages who had ventured to talk about the issue included some lawmakers from the U.S. and the U.K. too, but even that did not warrant a formal response from the government. If the MEA statement’s claim that “some vested interest groups” were mobilising international support smacked of paranoia, the fact that a few isolated comments could send the Indian government into a tizzy, and lead to a lengthy riposte, reflects a siege mentality arising from deep insecurity. Whether it is organised dissent within the country, or informal criticism from elsewhere, it sees everything as a conspiracy against itself, a design on the country’s unity and the stuff of propaganda. The registration of a police case after Greta Thunberg, the teenaged Swedish climate change activist, shared a protesters’ ‘toolkit’ on Twitter, has added another twist to this unedifying demonstration of touchiness. Many Indian celebrities, from the fields of cinema and sports, joined issue with Rihanna to state their case against what they saw as external interference. Many of them professed their desire to keep the country together and voiced their disapproval of ‘propaganda’. The larger issue, of course, is something the government itself has drawn attention to. What is the limit to the claim that a problem is a country’s internal matter and something those outside its borders are not entitled to comment upon? Given India’s recent comment voicing concern over the military takeover in Myanmar or the attack on Capitol Hill in the U.S., and its oft-expressed views on developments in neighbouring countries, it requires no iteration that some issues that have a bearing on human rights, survival of democracy and international relations do tend to invite comment. It is not as if only the farmers’ protests have got traction overseas. The best way for the government to avoid international criticism is not to allow more people to see it as authoritarian, disrespectful of rights, and given to attempts to undermine institutions of democracy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pious-and-sanctimonious/article33754785.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||An inevitable showdown||The Government’s notice to Twitter after it reinstated several handles that mentioned a controversial hashtag, which the former wanted blocked, marks a critical point in an already uneasy relationship between a powerful government and an influential technology platform. A showdown seems inevitable now, what with the Government threatening Twitter with penal action for not complying with its orders. The issue pertains to tweets put out by some handles on the ongoing farmer protests as also a hashtag that suggested that a farmer genocide was being planned. The Ministry of Electronics and IT ordered these handles (257 URLs and one hashtag) to be blocked on the grounds that they were spreading dangerous misinformation about the protests. Twitter initially complied with the order but then restored these tweets and handles, which included those of media houses. The Government’s initial order was issued under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, under which it can direct an intermediary to block any information for public access “in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above…” This is the same Section under which hundreds of Chinese apps have been banned in recent months. The world over, technology platforms have enough safeguards to act as intermediaries without being liable for the content that is published. But Twitter’s act of defying the orders as per the law means it is on slippery territory. Though the use of Section 69A has been often criticised for the secrecy surrounding the process, it was upheld by the Supreme Court in the landmark Shreya Singhal vs Union of India (2015). The Court then was satisfied with the safeguards available. The technology platform’s stance may perhaps even lead to a legal challenge to the provisions of the Section. On the other hand, while there are many grounds on which this Government’s handling of the farm protests can be criticised, including its hyper-sensitivity to any criticism, reflected in the FIRs filed against many journalists, it has to be unequivocally said that the hashtag that it wanted blocked was not merely distasteful but seriously problematic, and indefensible on the grounds of freedom of speech. In a very sensitive setting, one that at least at one point was simmering with the potential for large-scale violence, provocation of any kind is unacceptable. What further happens in this face-off will be of interest not just for the two parties but for the governments of the world as well as the platforms of the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-inevitable-showdown/article33754786.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The expert and the journalist||The passing of Patna-based social scientist Shaibal Gupta recently got me thinking about the relationship between experts and journalists, which is a complicated one. Many experts, particularly those in academia, use the word ‘journalistic’ in a rather disapproving way. The implication is that journalism is non-rigorous and lacking in nuances. It is a different matter that good journalists are expected to be, and are, rigorous and attentive to nuance. A more counterproductive approach by many experts is to assume that complex questions cannot be presented in a simple language. Some experts, who are not really rigorous themselves, resort to complicated writing to hide their own inadequacies. Gupta was someone who did not wear his knowledge and wisdom on his sleeve — he was generous with everyone who sought him out, as legions of journalists from all over the world would easily attest. Intense commitment In 2002, when I reached Patna as a reporter, he was among the first people I met. Until the last weeks of his life, he remained in touch and was a source of immense wisdom and patience. He wrote for The Hindu even from his deathbed. What drove him was not fame or attention, but an intense commitment to public communication — that an idea should not merely remain in an academic paper or a book, but must be channelled into public debates. Gupta never lost an opportunity to meet journalists, and it was never about advancing his own standing as an expert. As his fans from around the world would vouch, he was always humble and modest enough to seek opinions and information from those who met him. “After you have finished your travels, call me,” he would tell reporters who went to cover Bihar. He would take special efforts to connect to the readers of a particular outlet. He could compare Tamil Nadu or Kerala with Bihar to make a point so that his idea is communicated well. Considering the crisis of expertise in public debates, remembering him is important. While a section of media parades partisans and bigots as experts on one hand, on the other, most experts draw further into isolation. Gupta did not shy away from offering a comment piece and patiently pressing for its publication. He presented his comments in a gentle and inoffensive manner while speaking and writing. Unlike many seekers of media space, Gupta came across as someone who did it all with a sense of public service. Legitimate expertise Expertise on hire that validates vested interests in politics and business delegitimises expertise itself. There is also the danger of media taking state authorities’ opinion as the final word on many issues, particularly in those related to national security. All this has created a vicious knowledge ecosystem that endangers democracy and civil society. Journalists and experts must have a mutually respectful relationship. Experts must increasingly engage with the public and communicate in the language and idiom of the masses. Their failure or unwillingness to do so significantly adds to the crisis of our time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-expert-and-the-journalist/article33754798.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||All set for landing on moon today||The Apollo 14 astronauts have begun an eight and a half hour rest period. Earlier the spacecraft with its crew primed and all systems proclaimed fit for third lunar landing went into orbit around the moon, and while behind the dark side of the moon emerged into an orbit 107 to 313 km high before shifting, four hours later, into a path 17 to 109 km high, the closest approach yet by an Apollo command ship. On Apollos 11 and 12, the lunar ships were released at altitudes above 104 km. Command ship pilot Stuart Roosa to-day [February 4] told Mission Control here [SPACE CENTRE (Houston)], “we’re going to try to get secured for a big day to-morrow.” Then he said: “That’s about it. See you to-morrow.” Roosa and the two who will leave him alone while they land on the moon, Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell, were in their fourth revolution around it when they began the rest period. Their landing time is set for 4:16 a.m. E.S.T. (14-46 hrs. I.S.T.) to-morrow [February 5]. The moon landing programme got the “go” signal after a worrisome battery on the lunar lander was checked and found okay and Mission Control told the astronauts “it looks good.” “We’re here,” shouted Shepard as the spacecraft skimmed over the craggy landscape at the low point of the orbit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/all-set-for-landing-on-moon-today/article33754797.ece

Profitability was impacted by higher provisioning of Rs. 10,342 crore for the quarter, out of which loan losses accounted for Rs. 2,290 crore. This compares with total provisions of Rs. 7,253 crore a year earlier, when loan loss provisions stood at Rs. 8,193 crore. Operating profit declined 4.88% to Rs. 17,333 crore. Total income fell to Rs. 75,981 crore from Rs. 76,798 crore. “Excluding the one-off interest income and other income during Q3 of FY20, the year-on-year growth in net profit and operating profit for Q3 of FY21 is 133.78% and 26.23%, respectively,” the bank said in a regulatory filing. Net interest income for the quarter rose 3.75% to Rs. 28,820 crore. Non-interest income grew 1.54% to Rs. 9,246 crore, it said. Total deposits grew at 13.64% to Rs. 35,35,753 crore out of which current account deposits grew 11.33%, while savings bank deposits increased 16% . Credit grew 6.73%, mainly driven by Retail (Personal) Advances (15.5%), SME (5.62%) and Corporate Advances (2.23%), the bank said. The size of the loan book climbed 8.16%, it said. Home loan growth Home loans, which constituted 23% of the bank’s domestic advances, grew 9.99%. The net NPA ratio fell 142 basis points (bps) to 1.23%. In value terms, net NPAs stood at Rs. 29,032 crore, compared with Rs. 58,249 crore a year earlier. The gross NPA ratio fell 217 bps to 4.77%. The provision coverage ratio improved 848 bps to 90.21%.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||‘This is the highest capex ever over a 2-year period’||Expenditure Secretary T.V. Somanathan said the Centre had been very careful and realistic in its expenditure and receipts projections for FY22, and that its push for capital expenditure was the largest ever over a two-year period. Excerpts:  You have called it an expansionary budget, but overall spending is just about Rs. 33,000 crore more in 2021-22 over this year’s revised estimates (RE). Also, what’s been the approach used for overall estimates? Yes, but the RE is substantially higher than the Budget Estimate (BE), which is contrary to expectations of most analysts and economists. So spending expanded this year and the expansion has been sustained into next year. As recently as two weeks ago, a lot of analysts were saying it will be about Rs. 30-31 lakh crore. It might have looked more expansionary if we spent Rs. 30 lakh crore this year and then spent Rs. 34 lakh crore… but actually, spending around Rs. 34 lakh crore in both years is more expansionary. Incremental expenditure isn’t high, I agree, but the composition changes very substantially. This year’s spending had a big weight of welfare schemes and subsidies, and next year, many of those one-time expenditures disappear and get replaced by capital expenditure. The capital expenditure is 34.5% above 2020-21’s BE and 26.5% over the RE. With six months of closure and restrictions, capital expenditure has been difficult to sustain, yet the capex is above BE, which is a significant achievement. Most people didn’t expect us to reach anywhere near the capex budget. But we are likely to reach Rs. 4.39 lakh crore. And this year’s BE was 21% higher than previous year, so over a two-year period, this is the highest increase in capex ever. . There are concerns the Rs. 73,000 crore allocation for the MGNREGS in FY22 may not suffice to meet the rural job distress. In MGNREGA, next year’s allocation is slightly higher than this year’s initial provision, but much lower than this year’s revised estimate. The reason for that is we have made a Budget estimate based on normal offtake from April. One can say that it would not have normalised in April, it’s anyone’s guess as of now. There are signs that a lot of normalisation of activity is going on. I have no certainty what the offtake will be next year. What we have provided is what is required in a normal year like 2019-20. If it proves inadequate, we will supplement it during the year. But 2020-21 is not a guide to 2021-22, because that was a very special elevated situation due to the lockdown and the out-migration to rural areas, which I think is not a comparable or reasonable point of estimation for ’21-22. Of course, minimum wages have increased since 2019-20, so we made a small increase. The problem would arise if there is excess demand and we don’t provide it. But as of now, it is premature to say what the level of demand will be. And we have made an assumption of a normal year. We have provided Rs. 1,11,500 crore this year and the demand is tapering off. It’s a very substantial number that is approximately what the Rural Development Ministry asked for. On defence spending, the headline numbers don’t show a substantive increase. A very erudite economist on a channel was asking how can defence pensions and salary go down and claimed this is obviously a false estimation. In government, we have periodic payments of Pay Commission arrears because it takes a long time for some disputes to get settled and some category of person who didn’t get it, gets it. So there were substantial pension and salary arrears paid in FY20 and, to a much lesser extent, in 20-21. So when you remove the arrears component, the salary and pension bill does become less in 21-22. It is not a falsification of the salary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/this-is-the-highest-capex-ever-over-a-2-year-period/article33754770.ece
05 February 2021||Chennai,||Sundram Fasteners profit climbs to record Rs. 124 crore||Sundram Fasteners Ltd. plans to return its annual capital expenditure to the pre-COVID-19 level of Rs. 300 crore in the next fiscal year after a good ramp up in sales volume helped it post a record standalone quarterly profit of Rs. 124 crore in the October-December, Managing Director Arathi Krishna said. “The company, on an average, invested around Rs. 300 crore every year for three years,” Ms. Krishna told reporters on Thursday. “For FY21, we had to drop our capex... to Rs. 150 crore. Next fiscal, we are expecting go back to pre-COVID levels in terms of capex,” she said, adding that about 10% of that would be earmarked for defence and aerospace businesses. The manufacturer of precision components for the automotive, infrastructure and aviation sectors has forayed into aerospace and defence as it works to reduce its dependence on the auto industry and aims to raise its share of revenue from other sectors to 25% in the coming years. Currently, the share of auto and non-auto business stands at 80:20. Third-quarter net profit rose 20% to Rs. 124 crore as revenue from operations jumped 36% to Rs. 942 crore. “It is the highest ever standalone net profit recorded by the company,” Ms. Krishna said. “It was achieved on the back of increase in domestic demand and revival in exports. The previous highest net profit of Rs. 111 crore was posted during Q3 of 2018-19,” she added. “The last two years were difficult year for the automobile sector. Now, we are seeing remarkable recovery. We are optimistic that it will keep us going. Our capacity utilisation has reached 75%. There is a good ramp in sales and we expect that to continue for a few more quarters,” she said. Domestic sales climbed 43% to Rs. 637 crore in the third quarter, while exports rose 24% to Rs. 277 crore. Cost control helps Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation increased by 65% to Rs. 206 crore, helped by cost control measures (which contributed 1-1.5% of EBITDA) and improvement in operational efficiency. Expressing concern about rising commodity prices, Ms. Krishna said while the initial increase in costs had been shared with the customers, the company would have to wait to see how they would respond before taking any further action on prices. Ms. Krishna said the company’s Chinese venture had returned to pre-COVID levels and reporting monthly revenues of Rs. 27 crore. There was also an improvement in the U.S. market, with the contraction narrowing to about 2%, from 15%-16% earlier. The board, on Thursday, reappointed Suresh Krishna as chairman and non-executive director for a period of five years from July 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sundram-fasteners-profit-climbs-to-record-rs-124-crore/article33754774.ece

05 February 2021||London,||Liverpool’s title defence in tatters||In keeping with a bizarre Premier League season lacking the usual home comforts Liverpool’s grip on its title was loosened further as it was beaten 1-0 at Anfield by Brighton and Hove Albion on Wednesday. Steven Alzate’s scruffy 56th-minute goal was enough for Brighton to record a deserved first league win over Liverpool since 1982 and leave Jurgen Klopp’s champions trailing Manchester City by seven points having played a game more. City won 2-0 earlier at Burnley to make it 13 straight victories in all competitions and Pep Guardiola’s side will head into Sunday’s clash at Liverpool in confident mood.  Goals by Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling secured a routine three points for City, which moved on to 47 points from 21 games. Incredibly all five of Wednesday’s fixtures ended as away wins, continuing one of the main themes of England’s top flight being played in empty stadiums during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leicester City climbed above Liverpool into third place with a 2-0 win at struggling Fulham with James Maddison creating the goals for Kelechi Iheanacho and James Justin. Bouncing back West Ham United bounced back from defeat by Liverpool to move into fifth spot with Jesse Lingard scoring twice on his debut in a 3-1 win at Aston Villa. Everton is sixth after an entertaining 2-1 victory away to Leeds United — Gylfi Sigurdsson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin on target for Carlo Ancelotti’s side. It was only the second day in English top-flight history in which a programme of at least four fixtures produced a clean sweep of away wins — the other occurring in 1991. Less than 40% of Premier League matches have been won by home teams this season with away wins now more common. Graham Potter’s Brighton is now 10 points above the relegation zone in 15th place after he got the better of Jose Mourinho in a 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday and now proved more than a match for the celebrated Klopp.  The results: Aston Villa 1 (Watkins 81) lost to West Ham 3 (Soucek 51, Lingard 56, 83); Burnley 0 lost to Manchester City 2 (Jesus 3, Sterling 38); Fulham 0 lost to Leicester 2 (Iheanacho 17, Justin 44); Leeds 1 (Raphinha 48) lost to Everton 2 (Sigurdsson 9, Calvert-Lewin 41); Liverpool 0 lost to Brighton 1 (Alzate 56).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/liverpools-title-defence-in-tatters/article33754927.ece
05 February 2021||Chennai,||Upbeat rivals India and England embark on a fascinating duel||Amid fading light and pin-drop silence, Glenn McGrath steamed in, Harbhajan Singh settled in his stance, and the Aussie’s thunderbolt was squeezed for runs to settle the humdinger of a decider at Chepauk in 2001. You can still hear the crowd’s roar. Sadly, there will be no spectators for the India-England first Test that gets underway here on Friday. After its trail-blazing triumph in Australia, India has the wind and the momentum in its favour. Now, back at full strength with skipper and batting mainstay Virat Kohli and the premier pace pair of Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah returning, India will fancy its chances. Sporting pitch There is still some grass left on the surface and the pitch for the first Test should be sporting in nature with healthy bounce, enabling strokeplay, assisting the pacemen and providing help to the spinners as the match progresses. After its 2-0 series triumph on spinner-friendly tracks in Sri Lanka, achieved without the influential Ben Stokes and the speedy Jofra Archer, England could provide a tough challenge to a host that normally demolishes opponents at home. India’s formidable batting line-up will be predictable in nature. And the explosive Rishabh Pant will play as wicket-keeper batsman ending speculation about being fielded as a specialist bat. Three spinners India is likely to play three spinners, off-spinning all-rounders R. Ashwin, Washington Sundar and either Chinaman-bowler Kuldeep Yadav or left-arm spinner Axar Patel. Axar will give the attack control and England did struggle against left-arm spin in Sri Lanka. If the Englishmen are not able to pick him, wrist-spinner Kuldeep can inflict some damage. After his heroic display in Australia where he batted under excruciating pressure with the grace and flow of a natural left-hander, and bowled with accuracy and subtle variations, the young Washington is expected to keep his place. And the pace pack of Ishant and Bumrah, in his first Test at home, should torment the Englishmen. Old warhorse Ishant will be playing his 98th Test and is only three shy of 300 Test scalps. Talking about numbers, the Test will be momentous in nature for English skipper Joe Root. It will be his 100th. Key man With match-winning monuments — 228 and 186 — behind him in Sri Lanka, Root will be the key man in the England middle-order. His duel with Ashwin will be a battle within the larger game and Root is expected to use his feet and also employ the sweep and the reverse-sweep. England is not short of match-winners. Among them will be skilful all-rounder Stokes with huge reserves of mental strength. The fleet-footed Jos Buttler will be the X-factor in the line-up. The feisty Ollie Pope will replace the injured Zak Crawley, ruled out for two Tests. The pace attack, with the wily James Anderson, the lanky Stuart Broad and the hostile Archer — two of the three should play — has a fair amount of venom. And the two spinners, offie Dom Bess and left-armer Jack Leach did team up well in Sri Lanka. Like the silent era movies, this will be a ‘silent’ Test. Oh!, for the roar of the crowd!  The teams (from): India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Ajinkya Rahane (Vice-capt.), Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Rishabh Pant (wk), Washington Sundar, R. Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya, Mohammed Siraj, Wriddhiman Saha, Mayank Agarwal, K.L. Rahul and Shardul Thakur.   England: Joe Root (Capt.), Dom Sibley, Rory Burns, Ollie Pope, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Dom Bess, Jofra Archer, Jack Leach, James Anderson, Ben Foakes, Dan Lawrence, Olly Stone, Chris Woakes and Ben Foakes.

05 February 2021||Chennai,||England has some great memories on Indian soil||Kevin Pietersen’s sorcery with the bat, skipper Alastair Cook constructing big scores at the top of the order, Jonathan Trott’s stability in the middle-order, off-spinning great Graeme Swann getting the ball to spin, dip, and then hiss and turn off the pitch, Monty Panesar’s quickish left-arm spin defeating the batsmen and James Anderson’s two-way swing. These were the chief ingredients of England’s epoch-making 2-1 win over host India in the four-Test series of 2012. Precise execution You need heroes for a famous conquest and England possessed them. They comprehended the conditions, and executed their strategy with precision. Pietersen’s 186 in the second Test at Mumbai — England went down by nine wickets in the first Test at Ahmedabad — has to be among the greatest innings ever played on an Indian pitch that offered considerable turn. The gifted Pietersen was light on his feet, played the ball late when it spun, using the depth of the crease, and employed the sweep and the reverse-sweep to compelling effect. Cook made 122 in the same innings — England’s first essay — with studious left-handed batting, occupying the crease for long periods, playing straighter than squarer and becoming a roadblock for the Indian spin attack led by R. Ashwin. And then there were wickets for the spin pair of Swann and Panesar, the latter’s six for 81 in the Indian second innings — Swann picked the other four — settled the issue. England made it 2-1 in Kolkata, Cook built another edifice — an innings of 190 — blunting the spinners. And, Panesar and England’s pace pair of James Anderson and Steve Finn provided the wickets. Actually, David Gower’s England had stunned India 2-1 in 1984-85 as well after Laxman Sivaramakrishnan bowled India to victory in Mumbai with a 12-wicket match haul. Incredible victory Then, England spinners Phil Edmonds and Pat Pocock combined to bowl out India on the final day in Delhi to fashion an incredible victory. Legend Kapil Dev and Sandeep Patil were dropped for the next Test for ‘reckless’ batting. England clinched the series in Chennai with the lion-hearted Neil Foster bowling with verve, skill and heart, picking up 11 in the Test. And the runs were provided by opener Graeme Fowler and Mike Gatting, both of whom notched up double hundreds. England can surprise you.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-has-some-great-memories-on-indian-soil/article33755474.ece
05 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Focus on fitness in Hazare preparation||Tinu Yohannan sounded pleased as he talked over phone from Krishnagiri, Wayanad, on Thursday afternoon. Not just because the Kerala cricket team's training camp under his supervision was progressing smoothly. The India Test seamer-turned coach is glad that the Yo-Yo test, which gauges a player's fitness, has finally been implemented for Kerala's cricketers. His suggestion to the KCA, made sometime back, had been approved. All clear The Yo-Yo test was conducted during the camp at Krishnagiri and all players there had cleared the test, according to Tinu. “A few more players — Sanju Samson, S. Sreesanth and K.G. Rojith — are yet to join the camp,” he said. “Every player should undergo the Yo-Yo test. There will be no compromise.” Tinu stressed on the importance of physical fitness in the modern game. “Look at how the Indian team has gone on to become one of the fittest teams in the world under the leadership of Virat Kohli,” he said. “I felt there was a need for the Yo-Yo test in the Kerala team. I am glad the players, including the more experienced ones, have responded positively.” He said the players looked even fitter than they did during the recent Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy tournament in Mumbai. “The players are in fine shape,” he said. “But there are concerns about seamers Basil Thampi and K.M. Asif. I hope they recover soon.” Confident He would want them to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day tournament, the dates of which are expected to be announced soon. “We are confident of a good show in the Vijay Hazare Trophy,” Tinu said. “It is disappointing that there would be no Ranji Trophy this season, as it is a big loss for our players like Jalaj Saxena. But it is good that the one-day tournament is on. Something is better than nothing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/focus-on-fitness-in-hazare-preparation/article33755109.ece
05 February 2021||Chennai,||Pant will be backed, says Kohli||India captain Virat Kohli had high praise for Rishabh Pant and said the team will back the explosive wicketkeeper-batsman even for home Tests after his brilliant showing Down Under. “He has had impact performances in Australia recently, he is in a good space and we want him to build on this,” said Kohli on Thursday. “He will continue to be backed because he’s an impact player and along with his hard work he can be a consistent match-winner, someone that the opposition would definitely be very wary of every time.” Kohli, who regains charge of the team after missing three Tests in Australia for the birth of his first child, also praised vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane’s leadership in his absence. Based on trust “Our relationship is based on trust and very well knowing that all of us are working towards only one goal which is to make India win. And I would like to mention that he fulfilled his responsibility in Australia with flying colours and it was amazing to see how he led the team towards victory, which has always been our goal.” Commenting on the possible bowling combination, Kohli said that the team will continue to play bowlers who can contribute with the bat as well. “We will try to give us as many options as possible along with guys having the ability to contribute with the bat. That has been the pattern for success for us in home conditions over the last few years.” When asked about India needing to win the series with at least two wins to qualify for the final of the World Test Championship against New Zealand, Kohli said, “In this Australia series, we didn't speak about winning because of the WTC. I think it is a by-product of doing well as a team. For us, it remains a game of cricket, one session at a time, one hour at a time and that’s how success is achieved in the longest format of the game. “Maybe in New Zealand [in 2020] we did discuss it a bit and that could have added extra pressure on us to do everything so precisely and we ended up being under pressure a little bit.”  Any issue which is present in the country, we do discuss it, do talk about it and everyone has expressed what they had to about the issue. We briefly spoke about it in the team meeting Kohlion the farmers’ protest||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pant-will-be-backed-says-kohli/article33754879.ece
05 February 2021||Chittagong,||Mustafizur, Mehidy put Bangladesh on top||Mustafizur Rahman claimed two early wickets after Mehidy Hasan struck his maiden Test hundred to put Bangladesh on top in the first Test against the West Indies here on Thursday. Mehidy hit 103 off 168 balls to guide Bangladesh to 430 in its first innings before Mustafizur’s two for 18 helped the hosts reduce the tourists to 75 for two at stumps on the second day. Captain Kraigg Brathwaite and Nkrumah Bonner added 51 runs in an unbroken third-wicket stand to stave off further damage after Mustafizur rattled the visitors by dismissing John Campbell and Shayne Moseley early. Brathwaite remained unbeaten on 49 alongside debutant Bonner (batting 17) at stumps. Earlier, Mehidy was the last man dismissed in Bangladesh's innings when he holed out to substitute Kavem Hodge at long-on off off-spinner Rahkeem Cornwall. Shakib Al Hasan also struck 68 as Bangladesh dominated the West Indies’ bowlers to add 188 runs in two sessions. Left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican was the top West Indies bowler with four for 133.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mustafizur-mehidy-put-bangladesh-on-top/article33754778.ece
05 February 2021||Mumbai,||India is better balanced and will come out on top: Tendulkar||Ahead of what promises to be an exciting Test series between India and England, Sachin Tendulkar spelt out what he is looking forward to, in a chat with The Hindu. Excerpts: How significant is this series considering international cricket is returning to India after almost 11 months? This takes me back to 2008, when Mumbai was under attack. That time also, we were playing England. And now after the pandemic, it’s the same opposition and the same venue. I am hoping that the result is also the same. It’s great that cricket has come back to India and people are looking forward to it because India have won in Australia and England in Sri Lanka. Does the series win in Sri Lanka make England a more dangerous outfit? Yes, yes. There’s no better tonic than victory. When you start winning, then your mindset is all about ‘even from difficult situations, I can win’. When you are not winning, even from a winning situation, you feel like ‘what if I lose from here!’ Right now, England are in a winning mind-frame. Those teams are always dangerous. England is an experienced team. I am sure the Indian team has done the homework but it will require a big effort from both teams. I feel the standard of cricket will be really high, so it will be a closely fought series. India is a better balanced team and will come out on top. How tricky would it be to play back-to-back Tests at the same venue? That’s going to be a new experience. That’s why the first Test becomes even more critical. It not only sets the tone for the series but also the fact that England will know how this particular pitch is behaving. Accordingly they can start preparing for the next Test. The team that adapts sooner tends to find the opposition playing the catching game. So the first Test at both the venues is going to be extremely critical. How have you seen Joe Root evolve as a cricketer? When Joe Root played his first Test match [at Nagpur in 2012], I remember having told a couple of teammates: “Here is the future captain of England”. He played smartly, he knew how to rotate the strike. It was evident that he knew how to score runs in the first Test match itself. He is set to play his 100th Test now, it’s a fantastic achievement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-is-better-balanced-and-will-come-out-on-top-tendulkar/article33754881.ece
05 February 2021||Melbourne,||Organisers say Aussie Open will start on time||As many as 160 players are back in isolation after a hotel quarantine worker tested positive for COVID-19. Six tune-up tournaments were suspended for a day so that 507 people connected with the Australian Open could be tested for the virus. But Australian Open organisers weren’t deterred at all, vowing that the year’s first Grand Slam tournament would start as planned next Monday, with all the tune-up tournaments completed — with tweaks expected — between Friday and Sunday. The one-day shutdown was triggered — the Victoria state premier, a leading health official and Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley all said — out of “an abundance of caution.” “We are absolutely confident the Australian Open is going to go ahead,” Tiley told a news conference on Thursday. “We will be starting on Monday and we have no intention of changing times.” Preparations have already been disruptive and chaotic for the so-called Happy Slam, even compared with some recent troubles. Organisers and players have had to deal with searing heatwaves some years. In 2020, acrid smoke from deadly bushfires overshadowed the leadup to the tournament. Two months later, the Formula One season had a false start when the Australian Grand Prix was called off before an official practice session could be staged. Drivers and teams had flown in from Europe. There were thousands of fans queuing up to enter Melbourne’s Albert Park circuit. Still, the government shut it down. Tiley was confident tennis wouldn’t go the same way as the F1 GP. “The event that we have planned and the lead-in events — we’re absolutely confident it’s going to go ahead,” Tiley said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/oz-open-will-start-on-time-say-organisers/article33754910.ece
05 February 2021||Los Angeles,||George helps Clippers cruise past Cleveland Cavaliers||Paul George bounced back from a sub-par contest (against Brooklyn Nets) and used it for motivation as Los Angeles Clippers beat Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday to avoid losing consecutive games for the first time this season. Season high George drained a season-high eight threes en route to 36 points as the Clippers crushed the Cavaliers 121-99 to remain the only team in the NBA not to have suffered back-to-back defeats. Kawhi Leonard scored 24 points and Croatia's Ivica Zubac delivered 10 points and 16 rebounds off the bench for the Clippers, who finished 4-2 on the road trip. Antetokounmpo on song In Milwaukee, two-time reigning NBA most valuable player Giannis Antetokounmpo delivered a triple-double of 21 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists to fuel the Bucks' 130-110 rout of Indiana Pacers. Antetokounmpo connected on seven of eight shots from the field and seven of eight from the free-throw line, and the Bucks led from wire-to-wire, taking a 106-72 advantage into the final period. Double-double for Doncic Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with a career-high 33 points and 12 rebounds, but Indiana, coming off Tuesday's 134-116 victory over Memphis Grizzlies, couldn't slow a Bucks team that made 21 three-pointers. Elsewhere, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway combined for 73 points to help Dallas Mavericks snap a six-game losing streak with a 122-116 win over the Atlanta Hawks. Doncic scored 27 points, posting his 11th double-double with eight rebounds and 14 assists.  The results: Pelicans 123 bt Suns 101; Cavaliers 99 lost to LA Clippers 121; Miami Heat 100 lost to Wizards 103.   Spurs 111 bt Timberwolves 108; Atlanta Hawks 116 lost to Mavericks 122; Kings 116 bt Celtics 111.

05 February 2021||Kochi,||Lessons for India from Canada||The big surprise in Indian sport is that many leading athletes have gone without being dope-tested in crucial years, even before the last major championships. High jumper Tejaswin Shankar feels that if athletes are in the testing pool, they should be tested regularly. “To be honest with you, even I haven’t been tested for dope for a long time. I fill my whereabouts details but, that being said, I might be in a different country but I think if you’re part of any country and if you’re in the testing pool, then you should definitely be tested,” he said. “The last time I was tested in India, I think was during the Fed Cup before the Commonwealth Games in 2018. But that was the last time I went there as well. The university here carries out regular testing but then most of the time it’s for recreational drugs.” Different scene Shankar spoke about a different scene in other countries. “I have a friend. She’s a Canadian athlete and, like me, she lives in Manhattan too. “She has to fill her whereabouts too but she told me, since the (2018) Commonwealth Games already 10 or 11 times there have been people from the doping control office knock on her door at 5 a.m. to collect her sample. “They are able to send people or probably they have a tie-up with somebody. I see that and I feel, wow, they have some sort of system and their results are in front of everyone. So, I don’t think I have to say anything more.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lessons-for-india-from-canada/article33755105.ece
05 February 2021||Kochi,||Tejaswin Shankar’s formula to stay calm||The many question marks over the Tokyo Olympics have left athletes worried but high jumper Tejaswin Shankar has hit a formula to find some calm. “The other day, it was trending on twitter that the Olympic Games are being cancelled. I just don’t click on them because during quarantine time I was thinking what I was going to do next,” said the national record holder from Kansas, USA. “It turns out the one best advice I was able to give myself was, Olympics or no Olympics I want to jump 2.33m. Once I jump that, even if the Olympics are not going to happen, I’d be very happy because I was able to get the (Olympic qualification) standard. “It’s not in my hands whether the Games happen or not but I think it’s definitely in my hands to jump 2.33.” With so much uncertainty around, Shankar feels that athletes should grab every opportunity they get. “The one thing I learned from the COVID situation, and what everybody should learn, is we shouldn’t wait for the opportunity, but make sure you grab the opportunity you have right now,” said the 22-year-old who is on a scholarship programme at the Kansas State University. “We are having competitions here so I’m trying to make the most of them. I’m triple jumping, long jumping and try to look at the big picture and jump higher in the outdoor season starting April.”  Incidentally, he broke the Indian heptathlon record while winning the indoor KSU DeLoss Dodds Invitational at Manhattan last week with a total of 5650 points bettering P.J. Vinod’s 5561 which came in the 2008 Doha Indoor Asians. Along the way, Shankar did a 2.25m high jump (personal best 2.29m) which proves that he is in good form despite the global pandemic. But he is likely to miss the first three Indian Grand Prix meets and the Federation Cup in February and March. “As of now, the Federation Cup are on the same dates as the (US) indoor nationals and the NCAA championship. So, just like every year, we may have the same conflict,” he said. “I’ll probably try and do the inter-State in June. Once April comes we will have three solid months to focus on jumping on a higher level and I think I’ll be able to jump higher as well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tejaswin-shankars-formula-to-stay-calm/article33755107.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||NEUFC holds Goa||Two penalties from Federico Gallego helped NorthEast United FC come from behind twice to hold FC Goa 2-2 in a 2020-21 Indian Super League match at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Vasco da Gama on Thursday. Both teams missed several chances in the second half before Goa took the 2-1 lead. Amarjit Singh diverted the ball coming from a Jorge Ortiz corner with his head towards full-back Gurjinder Kumar, who inadvertently slotted the ball into his own net. Just three minutes later, NorthEast United defender Ashutosh Mehta won a spot-kick. As a result, Gallego completed his brace, equalising for the second time on the night. In the end, NEUFC manager Khalid Jamil’s unbeaten streak since taking over from Gerard Nus continued, while Juan Ferrando’s men had to settle for a fourth consecutive draw. The Gaurs had started the first half brightly and took the 1-0 lead in the 21st minute. Brilliant team move During a brilliant Goa team move, Devendra Murgaonkar played a dummy to let Alberto Noguera’s pass from midfield reach Ortiz on the left flank. The Spaniard then sprinted past Ashutosh to enter the box and slide the ball towards Noguera, who set up Alexander Jesuraj for a simple tap-in.  NorthEast eventually won a spot-kick in the 41st minute when Noguera fouled Luis Machado. Gallego stepped up and levelled the scores.  The result: NorthEast United FC 2 (Federico Gallego 41-pen, 83-pen) drew with FC Goa 2 (Alexander Jesuraj 21, Gurjinder Kumar 80-og).

05 February 2021||Chennai,||Root has a lot riding on his shoulders||On the eve of his 100th Test, skipper Joe Root knows a lot is riding on his shoulders as England’s main batsman. And the key to his success will be how he handles India’s spinners, especially R. Ashwin. Play by ear “I just have to play what is in front of me. I will not look to dominate or defend,” said Root on how he intends to tackle Ashwin. “He is a fine bowler, has a great record in India. I have scored some runs and he has got the better of me a couple of times. It is going to be a great battle within the Test match,” he said. England, though, was dealt a blow with top-order batsman Zak Crawley being ruled out of the first two Tests with a wrist injury following a fall near the dressing room on Tuesday. With Crawley absent, Root may even have to bat at number three. Something he didn't rule out. Teams could learn from India’s success in Australia despite a plethora of injuries. But there would be equal pressure on India now to do well at home, the England skipper said. The pitch Commenting on the Chepauk wicket, Root said, “I had a brief look. It was not the prettiest wicket ever, but we all know that doesn't tell you a huge amount. History would suggest here that it is going to be a good wicket for a majority of the game and spin will come into it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/root-has-a-lot-riding-on-his-shoulders/article33754875.ece
05 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Goal is to do well at Australian Open’||There was no action at Melbourne Park, hosting six men’s and women’s tournaments simultaneously across the 18 courts. But, Divij Sharan had no complaints. He did not have to take a COVID-19 test and could go out and train for two hours. It was different for the 600 players, coaches and family members who were tested as the stayed in a hotel, which had a positive result. Zero cases “Zero cases in Victoria for almost a month,” said Divij, who had won his first round of doubles with Igor Zelenay of Slovakia on Tuesday. “Tomorrow we are scheduled to play the sixth match on the court. The forecast is rain all day,” said Divij. The uncertainty apart, it has been good training for Divij with Igor with whom he had won the ATP Tour title in St. Petersburg in 2019. “We have put in the hours the last couple of weeks and are working towards getting match sharp. Our goal is to do well at the Australian Open which should then set us up for the rest of the year,” he said. It was a good return to the circuit, with a win.  “We were a bit rusty in the first round but came through in the match tie-break. It keeps us in contention to go deep into the tournament,” said Divij. After having competed without a coach or trainer last year, Divij was happy to have Paul Dale with him as coach for the first Grand Slam of the season. “I have worked with Paul earlier. I keep in touch with him. I am really happy to have him here. We have been working hard on my game through the two weeks of quarantine,” said Divij.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/goal-is-to-do-well-at-australian-open/article33755192.ece

05 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Aakash Dave signs up for Luca SC||The Malappuram-based professional football club Abreco Luca SC has signed former Jamshedpur FC striker Aakash Dave for this season. Aakash Dave mostly played for Jamshedpur FC's second side last season. Aakash is expected to to add teeth to Luca SC's fowardline. The club is gearing up for the Kerala Premier League (KPL) this season. “I am really excited about this move.

The expectation from me is high and I hope to deliver,'' he said. Cutting edge “Aakash is an important addition to our team. He can play as winger or attacker.

05 February 2021||Chennai,||Daruvala creates history||India’s top racer Jehan Daruvala created history in the Formula 3 Asian Championship, scoring a breakthrough victory for Mumbai Falcons, an all Indian-outfit, in Abu Dhabi on Thursday evening.  He started from pole and led every lap to comfortably win the first race at the second round of the continent’s premier championship. The Mumbai Falcons racer had a good start from first but Isack Hadjar managed to pull alongside Jehan before braking into the first corner. Jehan out-braked Hadjar and held his lead exiting the corner. Later, Guanyu Zhou was on a charge and overtook Hadjar and reduced the gap to Jehan to under 0.7 seconds. But the Indian reeled off a series of quick laps to increase his lead to three seconds before posting the fastest lap of the race which gives him pole position for race two on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/daruvala-creates-history/article33754925.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Bhaktisara of Tirumazhisai||The Vedas, the sastras and the puranas teach in one voice that Narayana is the Supreme Truth and the highest Purushartha for all jivas. The sages and rishis steeped in meditation have also been blessed to know this truth with utmost conviction in their inner being. Likewise, the Azhwars, held to be the incarnations of the Nityasuris and endowed with the highest jnana by the Lord Himself, convey their experience of God in their hymns in a simple and direct manner. Tirumazhisai Azhwar, in his two famous hymns Tiruchanda Vrittam and the Nanmukan Tiruvandadi, makes the emphatic claim that by bowing down to the Supreme Lord and by having faith in His protecting power, one can be redeemed from the cycle of birth, said Sri A. Srinivasachariar in a discourse. Azhwar states that the validity of this truth is Timeless, and does not depend on his affirmation. The other important truth he reinforces is that the Lord cannot be attained by human effort, that is, by practising karma, jnana or bhakti yogas alone. No doubt, these ways of worship are useful as stepping stones. It is only by the Lord’s Sankalpa that a devotee becomes eligible for mukti. The duty of the jiva is to surrender his entire being to Him and remain devoted to Him at all times. This act of nyasa and prapatti helps the jiva shed the sense of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and he leads life in accordance to the Lord’s wish. Tirumazhisai Azhwar is also known as Bhaktisara. The name reflects his extraordinary bhakti, which in his case is not merely a means to attain God, but is his very life’s mission. His whole self is drawn to God naturally and this experience overflows as selfless devotion to God at all times with no other motive whatsoever. This is the highest state of bhakti yoga that Krishna teaches in the Gita.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhaktisara-of-tirumazhisai/article33754871.ece

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to the stone age||Kaviya Maria Cherian’s grandmother, Anna Thomas, a septuagenarian, cooks only in traditional cookware such as earthen pots, soapstone vessels, bell metal utensils, and cast iron tawas and skillets at her home in Thiruvalla, Kerala. “On a firewood stove, she makes the rice in a kalam while the fish is made in clay pots seasoned with age and use. Tempering is done in cast iron woks while tawas are for dosas. I really love the way she cooks and the flavour of the food,” says Kaviya. However, to Kaviya’s dismay, there was not a single piece of traditional cookware at her house in Kochi. “When I tried to buy a cast iron kadai, I found it difficult to find one, as many of the craftsmen, especially in Kerala, had stopped practising their craft. In supermarkets and stores, I could only find aluminium vessels, non-stick pans and hard iodised pans,” says Kaviya. She realised that there was a large market for such products though soapstone vessels, cast iron pans, skillets and bell metal urulis were not easily available in stores. Determined to make a difference, the 26-year-old, working in a bank in Mumbai, started Green Heirloom, an online store, in August 2020. It specialises in traditional cookware from all over India. She says even ubiquitous things like ceramic bharanis had to be sourced from Andhra Pradesh while the soapstone chattis come from Tamil Nadu. Mindful practices  The pandemic and a renewed interest in boosting immunity by adopting mindful eating and safe cooking methods have seen a surge in demand for traditional cookware. Many households are dumping their non-stick cookware for cast iron tawas, woks, earthen pots, kal chatti , brass and bell metal urulis . “We are working round the clock to make vessels of bell metal, brass and copper. Urulis of varying circumference see demand from customers all across south India,” says Sajeesh V., working in a smithy in Mannar, that makes uruli, vaarpu, chembu , etc. The bigger urulis , once used for roasting rice flour, spices and for cooking payasams and curries, are now favoured for cooking meat in homes and hotels as heat is evenly retained. For instance, homemaker Shailaja Sasikumar uses a brass uruli she inherited from her husband’s grandmother, to makebiryani. The spike in demand has seen Sreedevi Padmajan, who has an outlet in Thiruvananthapuram, run out of cast iron tawas. She says with a laugh that there is a waiting list. “I source it from two places, one in Tamil Nadu and one in Karnataka, and even then I am unable to meet the demand. Meen chatti (earthen pots for cooking fish) is another fast moving piece. I source those mainly from Thrissur and a few from Thiruvananthapuram. There are red and black ones. The black are clay pots treated again with heated rice husk for a glossy black coating,” she says. Mumbai-settled Marina Balakrishnan uses only traditional cookware. Her Instagram page shows her making puttu on a gleaming bell metal puttu kudam , shining with the patina of age, and unniappams simmering in a brass mould. Marina asserts that cooking in those makes a difference to the taste and Suma Sivadas, a former chemistry teacher-turned-cookery host, from Kottayam, agrees with Marina. Suma’s YouTube channel has the 76-year-old explaining how to make ethnic dishes in traditional cookware. “As a chemistry teacher, I know that the souring agents we use in our cooking will not react with the soapstone vessels. Earthenware enhances the taste and consistency of curries cooked in those, especially fish,” she explains. From another time  Though she has a couple of non-stick cookware in her kitchen, Suma points out that even if a scratch removes the Teflon covering, it could lead to poisonous chemicals leaching into the food cooked in the damaged vessels. “Now, soapstone vessels might take a little time to get heated but it retains the heat for a longer time and that makes dishes like sambar and aviyal cooked in it tastier,” she believes. Suma enjoys showing her viewers how an older generation used cookware like puttu kudam and idli chembu . “Growing up in Thodupuzha, I remember my grandmother using a cylindrical brass utensil that could be opened on both sides to grill nenthran banana. It would be kept in the firewood stove when rice or curries were being cooked. After a while, the banana would be grilled in its skin. All those utensils seem to have disappeared from most kitchens.” She adds that every nook and corner in India has a range of traditional cookware that was manufactured locally or in the neighbourhood. Jet black Longpi or Nungbi pottery from Manipur’s Ukhrul district is sought after all over India. “I have a small outlet in my homestay in Imphal and the pottery is a hot seller. Customers from abroad too have expressed interest. But this pottery, handmade with clay and black rock is made only in a particular village and so I am unable to get them in sufficient numbers. The price range is between Rs. 250 and Rs. 5,500,” says Satyajit Elangbam. In many instances, the cookware has been modified for smaller, modern families. Kaviya observes that since most of her customers are from cities such as Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai, she standarised the size of the cast iron kadais to 10 inches and that of the kal chatti to hold one to two litres. Small Urulis around seven-and-a half inches in circumference have many takers. A manual is also sent to customers to show them how to care for their cookware. The price of her products range from Rs. 450 for a clay curd setter to Rs. 6,000 plus for bronze urulis and vessels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/back-to-the-stone-age/article33755068.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Across the State on a country boat||Abhijith Bharath is on his dream journey. On January 28, he set off to explore Kerala on a country boat with his father Bharathan A.A.; a slow, meandering journey through the picturesque yet lesser-explored canals and backwaters. “We don’t have GPS. We are going to rely on our instincts and just take things as they come. We don’t even have a well-defined route map,” adds Abhijith. The idea is to understand life along Kerala’s waterscape, interact with people and soak in the experience of living on a boat. The duo started its journey from Poyya, Thrissur, and reached Kollam in seven days. “We plan to go up to Thiruvananthapuram and then back to Thrissur, before starting towards the northern region of the State covering Malappuram up to Kasaragod,” says Abhijith. Abhijith, 25, is an album designer and his father, a fisherman. Having grown up beside the backwaters in Ezhikkara, Paravur, Abhijith has always been fascinated by boats. Growing up, he attended vallamkalis (boat races) just to savour the heady excitement of seeing so many boats in action. Recently Abhijith felt a compelling desire to see Kerala on a boat. “And I wanted my father to accompany me,” he says. He discussed the idea with Bharathan, who agreed wholeheartedly. Funds, however, were a problem. The journey would require a boat in good condition, which the duo initially thought of borrowing. “But when it did not work out, we decided to get a new boat,” he says. Bharathan pledged his house in Poyya and bought a boat. Once the boat came in, Abhijith got to work, modifying it for the journey. He fitted a small motor first. The traditional fishing boat soon got a total makeover with a kitchen, a toilet, a desktop, dismantlable tents to sleep in and storage space, complete with a solar panel. The boat is 10 kol (about 24 feet) in length and one-and-a-half kol (about 4 feet) in breadth. Ahibjith decided to get his computer on board so that he could get some work done. The entire modification was done by members of Abhijith’s family. It took about three months and Rs. 1.5 lakh to set it up. “Now, this boat can easily accommodate at least three people,” says Abhijith. The kitchen consists of a stove, sink, a small space to store provisions, an ice-box to store fish. Space has been provided for cooking gas and potable water. It has been designed in such a way that these amenities fit well into the belly of the boat. The cover, made of the material used as floorboards in buses, acts as the floor of the boat. “This is a self-contained unit. We have everything we need on board,” says Abhijith. There is a sink, a sewage collection compartment, and waste bins, too, so that the water body is not polluted, he adds. They buy supplies from the closest village as and when they need them. Abhijith is also a vlogger, and is documenting the journey on his YouTube channel, ‘Travel with Abhijith’. Along their way, people have come up to see them, click selfies and some have even offered to host them in their homes. Bharathan and Abhijith sail through the day and rest during the nights. “My father, who has been a fisherman all his life, knows the water and its many ways. He knows when the tide or the wind changes,” says Abhijith. “However, it is still an adventure. When the wind is strong, or the tide is high, we don’t sail. We wait for it to pass,” he adds. They have life jackets for safety. Bharathan steers for the most part, with occasional help from Abhijith. For directions, they ask villagers and fisherfolk whom they meet on their route. They aim to visit all the villages that can be accessed by water. The entire journey will take about a month and more. “It is not like travelling on the road. Few people have undertaken a feat such as this,” says Abhijith. The 25-year-old adds, “We have no clue how this will turn out. But that is the fun of it. We are taking each day as it comes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/across-the-state-on-a-country-boat/article33755071.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||When the sparks go out||Hello friends! We’re in the second month of the New Year and everything still feels old. Stale. Been there done that. I’m finding this year really hard. Harder than last year even. I honestly thought I’d be back at school by now. Back at the cricket nets, back to eating out and going to movies. But, nope, still doing online school from the sofa. I don’t know about you but each and every day is the same as the day before: wake up, breakfast, sit on the couch and do school, lunch, sit on the couch and game with my friends and then go down to play, come home and eat dinner, listen to lectures about homework, gratitude, practising music, finding purpose in life, brush teeth and go to bed. That’s been every single day for longer than I care to remember. I just want something different to happen. Something new. I tried to explain to my folks that that’s why I love playing Minecraft so much. When you build a world in Minecraft, you can do something new every single time. You’re in control of things. You aren’t at the mercy of COVID-19. Unlike the real world where no two days are different; in Minecraft, no two worlds are the same if you don’t want them to be. Of course, grown ups don’t understand this at all. All they see is more screen time, which they think is a waste. Not as something that gives us a small escape from the awfulness that is everyday life in a Covid world. Taking a break I appreciate how parents are trying to bring kids back to the real world, but the real world isn’t the most fun place to be right now. I think it’s one of the reasons why I’ve been having a hard time writing every week. And why I asked my cousin S to take over for me last week. Writers need inspiration; we need to see and experience new things that keep our creative juices going. Right now, I’m not experiencing anything other than slow brain erosion. (Okay, okay! Maybe S is right and I am super dramatic!) Since I can’t keep asking S to take over for me and write to you all every week, I’ve decided to take some time off from writing, and see if it helps me. They say boredom is essential to creativity. I’m not saying I’m going to get my next big idea from cloud watching, but it sure has been ages since I did that. So, I think I’m putting my pen (actually keyboard) to rest for a while. Till we meet again, stay safe, wear a mask, wash your hands and don’t let the grown-ups get you down!  I just want something different to happen. Something new.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/when-the-sparks-go-out/article33755803.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The magical hour||I drew a blue cloud in my drawing book. The moment I finished highlighting its edges with a silver pencil and wrote magic vehicle beside it, the paper became blank. I was taken aback. I checked my pencils; they were the regular kind, not the magic ones where the colour faded after a few minutes. “Perhaps the cloud floated away.” I shook my head and drew a small fairy in a green dress and wrote her name: Diana . The moment I finished, the fairy too disappeared from the paper. I was once again staring at a blank page. Then I drew a brown castle amid a cluster of grey clouds. It too disappeared from the page. “Looks like I’ll get a zero for my drawing homework tomorrow. It’s just not my night,” I groaned. In my nine years, this was the first time something like this had happened. I shut my drawing book. The neatly stuck label carried my name and section: Varun Pandit, IV B . As the room had suddenly turned chilly, I walked towards the window to shut it. I blinked in surprise, as a small silver-edged blue cloud floated towards me with a fairy in a green dress sitting on it. Midnight adventure “Hello Varun,” she smiled. “The cloud and I were created by you in the magical hour during which whatever you draw appears before you. Thank you for making this magic vehicle pollution-free, environment-friendly and noiseless. I just saw some vehicles below, spewing so much smoke that I started coughing.” My mouth fell open! “Want a ride?” she asked. “Yes,” I said, without thinking. Then looked down from my apartment on the 10th floor and gulped. “Diana, won’t we fall off the cloud?” “A magic vehicle never lets its passengers down,” she said and pulled me onto the cloud. Once I made myself comfortable, the magical cloud started its journey. Initially, it flew low. I saw two black dogs, sitting under a street light. Looking at the cloud and its passengers, one dog barked to his friend, “I don’t believe it! These humans are here, there and everywhere. Bad enough that we animals have to put up with them on the ground; now the poor birds will have to tolerate them in the sky as well!” “True,” barked the other dog, nodding in agreement. “How can I understand what the dogs are talking about?” I turned to Diana. “On a magical cloud, everything and everyone gets magical powers,” she grinned. As the cloud started floating up, the clouds turned grey. I surveyed the world below. People looked like ants. The mountains were like small dark lumps. The rivers were like ribbons of moonlight flowing across the plains. Suddenly, the cloud stopped in front of a brown palace. “Can I see the palace?” I asked. “No,” Diana replied. “Tomorrow, in the magical hour, you must draw the inside of the palace. Only then can you enter it.” I nodded. For the first time, I was excited about drawing. Tomorrow, I would draw more magical creatures who would take me on another midnight adventure.  “A magic vehicle never lets its passengers down...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-magical-hour/article33755798.ece

A woman in a black cloak…” said Keya. “Oh my god! You’re not saying…” Moti uncle nodded and showed them the picture. Only the house could be seen; no woman. “Are you saying the woman from that picture got out and is haunting us?” asked Albert, who had followed them upstairs. “Yes. When I bought this picture, there was a woman sitting outside this house,” said Moti uncle. Keya and Dhruv nodded in agreement. “To find out more, we need to go back to Odds ‘n’ Ends and ask the manager. I am sure he knows the story behind this,” said Moti uncle. “Sir, if you don’t mind, may I also come? I am too scared to stay here by myself.”  To be continued...

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Balarama bests Dhenuka||We’ve all heard many tales of Krishna; so here is a story about his elder brother Balarama. Both Krishna and Balarama grew up among the cowherds of Gokul and Vrindavan. Along with the other boys, the brothers would take the cattle out to graze in the forests. While the animals munched on the fresh grass and other plants, the boys would pluck fruits and berries. One day, Balarama saw some trees on which ripe berries hung in huge clusters. As he went towards the tree to pluck them, one of his friends stopped him. “Those trees are in the territory, which belongs to the asura, Dhenuka. There is also lots of grass for the cows. But any animal or man who enters that area never comes back alive.” To eat or not Balarama listened and calmly asked, “Do you want to eat those berries?” “We do but…” the cowherds were afraid. Balarama marched up to the tree and began to shake the branches. As the berries dropped to the ground, the overjoyed cowherds began to pick them up and stuff their mouths. The asura, who was not far away, heard the sounds of merriment. “Who is messing around on my grounds?” he wondered, as he headed towards the noise. When he saw the cowherds enjoying the fruits, a furious Dhenuka took the form of a wild ass and charged at them. While all the boys ran for their lives, an unperturbed Balarama continued to shake the tree. Dhenuka raced up to him and kicked out, sending the boy flying into the air. But Balarama landed on his feet and, as Dhenuka kicked again, he caught him by the feet, swung him around, and flung him far away. Dhenuka was killed as he crashed to the ground. The other wild asses also charged up to the boys to avenge their leader’s death. But Balarama, with Krishna’s help, bested all of them. Once the last of the asuras disappeared, the boys who had been hiding among the bushes and on trees emerged cheering. They hoisted Balarama on to their shoulders and took him back to the village in a triumphant procession. By getting rid of Dhenuka, Balarama had not only provided new areas of the forest for the boys to explore but also new grazing grounds for the village’s cattle.  “Any animal or man who enters that area never comes back alive...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/balarama-bests-dhenuka/article33755775.ece

But Shaun is captured by Trumper, an animal-control worker, and thrown into the animal lock-up where he meets Bitzer, the farmer’s dog who chased after the caravan when it rolled away. With the help of a homeless dog Slip, the two imprison Trumper and escape. Though they find the farmer, he does not recognise them. So they come up with a plan to revive his memory and take him back to the farm. But then, Trumper escapes. What happens next? Do they all get back to the farm? Does the farmer regain his memory?  Trivia: The movie is based on the 2007 British television series Shaun the Sheep, which itself was a spin-off on Wallace and Gromit movie.  There are absolutely no dialogues, only animal sound effects.  It was released on the Chinese New Year’s Day in the Year of the Sheep.  The film was nominated at the 88th Academy Awards for the Best Animated Feature and also earned several other nominations at various awards that year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/big-city-adventure/article33755820.ece

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are||What is at the bottom of the black hole ? Can you believe it? The answer is: we don’t know. A black hole has such a strong gravitational field that nothing — not even light — can escape it. It gets even better. According to astrophysical theories, a black hole’s mass is concentrated into a tiny point of infinite density known as a singularity, which is responsible for the gravitational field. But since quantam effects have a big role at the centre of a black hole and we do not have a quantum theory of physics yet, we have no idea what the core or bottom of the black hole looks like and what exists there. What we do know is that a black hole has a boundary called event horizon and once an object crosses that, it cannot escape the black hole’s gravity. How do insect repellents work? Body odour or temperature, the carbon dioxide exhaled, and movements — these are among the different factors that attract insects. The repellents interefere with its sense of smell and taste and stop it from finding a human host. However, how long it is effective depends on the strength of its main ingredient. Those with lower levels may work for shorter periods and vice versa. Sweat and contact with water or clothes can also reduce its efficacy. As the word repellent suggests, these formulations do not kill the insect; they only keep them from biting us and spreading diseases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article33755761.ece

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||A theatre, a people and peace||The large open-air stage is set in front of a Shiva temple. A colourful throne is placed on it. Large numbers of men, women and children have gathered on its three sides and eagerly await the arrival of Mirza Sahib in a procession. As Mirza Sahib approaches the stage, a Hindu priest and a Muslim fakir sing and dance in praise of Shiva and Allah and hug each other. The play unfolds. Like the audience, the large number of characters who take the stage one after another are both Hindu and Muslim, and they interchange roles of characters from both communities. A slice of tradition For the past 250 years, this unique folk theatre called Mogal Tamasha has been thriving in the small town of Bhadrak in Odisha. And both Hindus and Muslims take great pride in a tradition that they call their ‘own’. Interestingly, Mogal Tamasha was first established to maintain communal harmony and it has survived only in this town. Bhadrak has equally large Muslim and Hindu populations and it witnessed two major communal riots in 1991 and 2017. Bhadrak has always played a big role in Odisha’s history. Strategically located on the erstwhile Grand Trunk Road that passes via Jajpur, Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, connecting Kolkata with Puri, it has held an important position in the administrative, military, commercial, religious and cultural affairs of the State.  Mogal Tamasha was created by poet Bansi Ballav Goswami around 1780, a cultural outcome of when Bhadrak was part of the Mughal empire. Odisha was Mughal territory for nearly 200 years until the Marathas took over in 1751. The folk theatre depicts the corrupt practices of the Mughal administration in a farcical and comical manner. Poet Bansi Ballav was adept in six languages — Persian, Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, Sanskrit and Odia (his mother-tongue) — and the Tamashas he scripted and directed were multi-lingual. Although he wrote a large number of Tamashas, just seven scripts have survived, of which only  Mogal Tamasha is staged now. Believed to be the poet-playwright’s magnum opus , Mogal Tamasha has not only survived the onslaught of time, its inherent message of communal harmony has become the symbol of peaceful co-existence in this town. “Just after the communal clashes of 2017, I staged a show here. Nearly two-thirds of my audience were Muslim women,” says Badal Sikdar, the octogenarian exponent of the theatre form and a recipient of the Natya-Guru award from the Ministry of Culture. Sikdar played a pivotal role in redesigning Mogal Tamasha. Earlier staged from dusk to dawn in the open, Sikdar adapted it for the proscenium stage and an urban audience. He also introduced women actors. Says Kanta Singh, an Odia cinema actor from Bhadrak who shifted to tamasha , “There was a lot of criticism when I decided to join Badal Sikdar’s Sanket troupe in 1988. But I went ahead and gradually the presence of women in Mogal Tamasha found social acceptance.” “I believed that women characters must be played by women actors in order to give a realistic feel to the play. I introduced female actors despite much criticism, and 32 years later, we have so many women actors from Bhadrak who take pride in being members of Mogal Tamasha troupes,” says Sikdar. “We consider Mogal Tamasha the pride of Bhadrak and our national heritage,” says Abdul Bari, a social activist, who won the National Harmony Award for his role in restoring peace in the town during communal tensions. Sikdar agrees, “Saifullah is my favourite actor, who loves to essay any character, Muslim or Hindu. Similarly, Nizam sings songs in praise of Shiva in the play. We, the artistes and audience of Bhadrak, are oblivious of our religious identity as far as Mogal Tamasha is concerned.” Why did Mogal Tamasha remain confined to Bhadrak unlike other art traditions of the State that are popular across geographical boundaries? “Its tradition prohibited anyone other than the ustads (exponents and troupe leaders) to stage it. It was even believed that if anyone unauthorised tried to stage it, they would die of some disease. “The directors and actors were thus limited to the nine villages in and around Bhadrak where Mogal Tamasha was a part of the annual Chaitra Parva (spring festival),” explains Krushna Charan Behera, renowned researcher and professor of Odia literature, whose 11 years of persistent effort finally brought the script to the public in printed form in 1966. The original palm-leaf manuscript, preserved and worshipped by the practitioners, was destroyed in a fire. However, bits and pieces of it had been noted down by actors to memorise dialogue, sequences and songs. The professor, a student of Bhadrak College who later became a lecturer there, spoke to these actors and compiled a volume from what they remembered. The collection was published as a book that was treated as a priceless discovery in literary, historical and cultural circles. All India Radio and Doordarshan documented it and presented it. As people outside Bhadrak came to know of it, Mogal Tamasha was invited to a number of theatre festivals. And directors like Badal Sikdar developed abridged versions suitable for the proscenium stage about four decades ago. “In the last 40 years, my troupe has staged more than 300 shows across Odisha and India. Both urban and rural audiences enjoy our shows,” says Sikdar. Though there is no definite plot and most of the 18 characters are not necessarily connected, the manner of its presentation makes it exciting for the audience. “I believe the visionary poet-playwright crafted Mogal Tamasha keeping in mind the socio-cultural realities of his town. The subject, treatment, languages used, place of performance, background of actors and audiences have contributed in maintaining communal harmony in this region,” says Behera. Despite the accolades Sikdar has received for the revival of Mogal Tamasha , he is disheartened. “Without patronage it has become a dying tradition,” he says. “Over the years, the nine original villages have merged into Bhadrak. So the tradition of celebrating Chaitra Parva and allied rituals like Mogal Tamasha have also disappeared. The number of troupes has come down from 13 to just 3. Unless the Government steps in with a definite action plan, it will fade into oblivion again,” he warns. “Times and tastes have changed, but the mass appeal of Mogal Tamasha continues, apparently due to its classic artistic structure and inherent elements of communal harmony,” says National Award winning filmmaker, Himansu Khatua, whose documentary Kahe Ballav, made two years ago on the theatre form, has been screened across the globe.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||An imaginative kaleidoscope||For the past nine years, Gayatri Subramaniam, founder-director, Guru GV Ramani Natya Kala Foundation, (GVRNKF) has been hosting interesting events in Vashi, Navi Mumbai. This year’s annual festival was held online. The opening event was Meenakshi Srinivasan’s Bharatanatyam performance. She began with an invocatory salutation to Lord Padmanabha. Verses from Kulasekara Azhwar’s ‘Mukundamala’ and Swati Tirunal’s kriti (‘Bhogeendra sayeenam’, Kuntalavarali) combined with sollus and swaras were a beautiful exploration of Srikara on Ksheerasagaram. The pauses allowed ample time for every pose of Vishnu to sink in. The imagery of the procession aided by apt musical notes was a delight. The Thanjavur Quartet varnam (‘Sarasa Ninnu,’ Karnataka Kapi, Rupakam) was a sensitive interpretation of sringara bhakti. The nayika’s intense longing for union with Lord Brihadeeswara as a lover and devotee at once was brought out seamlessly. The unhurried delineation of her pangs, chosen episodes and the various Shiva stances contributed to the visual gratification. In the Sarangapani padam, the nayika pretends that she does not know Krishna and asks for his name. Though startled at first, Krishna decides to play along, and lists his different names. Graceful presentation Music for this padam was by K. Hariprasad, set in raga Nattakurinji, misrachapu talam. The entire presentation, from Krishna’s point of view, was embellished with intermittent reactions of the nayika. Blessed with lithe deportment, Meenakshi carried off her recital with grace and charm. The costumes were neat and compact. By fine-tuning the prayer song and intermittent overtures, Meenakshi could have squeezed in a brief thillana. The orchestra featuring Hari Prasad (vocals), Jayashree Ramanathan (nattuvangam) and Vedakrishna Ram (mridangam), Ishwar Ramakrishnan (violin) and J.B. Srutisagar (flute) enhanced the performance. Intelligently choreographed Seven dancers of Leela Samson’s Spanda Dance company presented ‘Nokkam,’ intelligently choreographed, with abstract and symbolic pieces and traditional and contemporary content. In ‘Bhaskaraya Namah,’ the dancers paid obeisance to the Sun with agile movements. The play of light, the chanting, surya namaskar, the synergetic feet-tapping sound — it was an invigorating amalgam. ‘Athishay’ portrayed the amazing feat of Krishna vanquishing the Kalinga. The quick successive movements of the dancers represented the serpent’s hood with Krishna surmounting each of them in turn. In Purandaradasa’s ‘Aadidano Ranga,’ the villagers celebrate Krishna’s conquest through song and dance. The transition from one raga to another — Charukesi, Hamsanandi and Bhimpalas — was smooth. The next piece eulogising the river, music composed by Rajkumar Bharati, was set in varnam mettu. The lilting gait of the river, the generosity of nature, the disconnect between man and nature, forgetting the five senses, were all conveyed in ‘Nadhi, nee endrum vaazhi.’ The singing in different octaves and swaras depicting the river flowing was appealing. The chota khyal of Kumar Gandharva juxtaposed Dvaitam and Advaitam. On one side of the stage two lovers, in a pool of light, awaken to the dawn of a new day while on the other side a couple await in dusk the onset of night. Two dancers represent Bhogta and Drishta, the two birds from the Vedas symbolising man veiled and unveiled at once. The contrasted light and silhouette effects were exemplary. Swarnanjali, the concluding thillana, in raga Purvi was a celebration of rhythm, the evolution of seven swaras, the colours, animals and rasas they represent, culminating in the pranavartha, worship of Brahma beyond form and religion. The dancers, backed by their training and rehearsals, did full justice to Leela Samson’s innovative choreography in their individual and collective capacity. The introductions by Leela before every piece were interestingly done on faded images of the dancers. Blend of styles A brief impactful invocation by senior Carnatic vocalist Sikkil Gurucharan set the stage for ‘Shivamritadhaara,’ a thematic collaboration with Bharatanatyam duo — Renjith Babu and Vijna Vasudevan. An impressive entry as a river flowing, the traditional mallari where Vijna walked with sedate steps with the kumba while the agile Renjith donned several roles including Nandi, the drummer, etc., depicting the procession. Well-executed jatis segued into ‘Jambupathe.’ The involved emotive singing by Gurucharan and the nuanced portrayal by the duo made it an audio-visual delight. The Bahudari raga alapana with a lilting tanam and intelligent niraval for the kriti ‘Sadanandathandavam’ created a comprehensive experience. This allowed scope for a melodious violin display by Ishwar and a scintillating thani by Sumesh. Moving back to the collaboration, the duo presented ‘Nagendraharaya’ defining the panchakshara. Beginning with the imagery of the eight snakes moving through the chakras, the description for each akshara was detailed and communicative. Gurucharan was at his best while singing this piece and Renjith found ample scope holding relevant yoga poses. Gurucharan’s next was a padam in Nilambari, set to misrachapu tala. This composition by V.P. Dhananjayan was a lullaby sung by a mother to a child as she waits for her husband. The concluding thillana began with melodic notes on the violin by Ishwar Ramakrishnan. Beautifully co-ordinated nritta was followed by sensitive abhinaya. The verve and diction of Sikkil, combined with Sumesh Narayanan on the mridangam and K.S. Balakrishnan on the nattuvangam added value. The colour co-ordinated costumes in light and dark blue were appealing. The duo should be credited for the apt use of hasta mudras, their research and suitable role reversals. Videography and editing by Iyappan Arumugam and event coordination by Varsha Kumar were noteworthy.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||In a league of his own||Thichoor Mohanan is a veteran edakka artiste whose earliest memories of the instrument are inseparable from the temple that shares its fence with his house. In the sanctum of the quiet Ayyappankavu temple, the three-year-old Mohanan would play random strokes on the drum that hung on the wall. . This daybreak activity was no leisure. He had to repeat the task later in the forenoon and at dusk. The child was actually working when he held the stick and beat one side of the instrument. Mohanan, in fact, was performing a temple duty that his family has been associated with for generations. Played only by men Convention permits only men to play thehourglass-shaped edakka during the routine puja. And Mohanan turned out to be the only member from his family eligible to play it. . “Obviously, when I was young I didn’t understand the significance of the art,” says the 62-year-old artiste. “I would beat the edakka half-asleep. Sometimes I would doze off midway and wake up only when the priest finished the closed-door rites and sprinkled the teertham .” Mohanan went on to perform for more than two decades at temple festivals in central Kerala’s Thalapilly taluk. And was hailed for his edakka playing at the traditional panchavadyam ensembles that went on for more than two hours. The state government recognised his eminence with the Sangeetha Nataka Akademi award in 2019. Important tour Mohanan recalls his trips outside Kerala, as a teenager, which strengthened his percussive skills. A famed troupe included him in its tour of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta in December 1975. Anchoring the panchavadyam were the illustrious Pallavur Maniyan and his brother Kunjukutta Marar. While they would stand in the middle of the row of timila drummers, Mohanan would be at one end with the edakka slung from his left shoulder. The concerts would move slowly along the temple streets, presenting popular crescendos at the crossroads. “I was 17 then. The rigours gave me back-to-back practical lessons,” he says. A full-fledged panchavadyam features 60 artistes playing five kinds of instruments. The edakka is the sole drum. While one hand holds the slender stick which has an outward curve towards the tip, the left palm is used to push and lift the hollow wooden trunk up and down the rounded membranes on both sides. “This enables the edakka to change its pitch,” says timila master Kariyannur Narayanan Namboodiri. “The gamaka-laden resonance so generated adds to the harmonic value of a panchavadyam.” Mohanan’s edakka gains special attention in the passage just after the detailed first chapter of the panchavadyam, notes aesthete B.K. Harinarayanan, a poet-lyricist. The edakka is played after a break in the confluent music by the timila and maddalam drums besides the ilathalam (cymbals) and the kombu (horn). “Few can match Mohanan’s brilliance in retaining the tempo from that junction. The way he single-handedly takes the cue is magical,” Harinarayanan says. Self-learned lessons If Mohanan has been a busy artiste for four decades, it has largely been due to his capacity to observe the techniques of his seniors and absorb their sense of beauty. While his unclewas his first guru, Varavoor Kuttan Nair formally taught Mohanan since the age of nine. Vellithiruthi Krishnankutty Nair and Pookattiri Divakara Poduval further trained him in the chenda. They equipped the youngster to perform keli and tayambaka concerts. “That apart, I have several mentors who have guided me at several phases,” says Mohanan. “They made me eclectic. I experiment, but I don’t compromise on the techniques that I believe are core to the art.”That said, certain new-age trends bother Mohanan. One such is the general slide in discipline. He says. “Friction over seniority is on the rise. That existed in the old times too, but the yesteryear masters maintained respect for the opposition.” Keen professional rivalry, says Mohanan, is fine. “The alacrity, though, should not be to outshine others. Panchavadyam is teamwork.”  The writer is a keen follower   of Kerala’s performing arts.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||In record time||There was palpable tension and excitement as Bharatanatyam dancers around India and the globe nervously rehearsed, adjusted costumes, cameras and lights, as they waited for the cue to start. With a prompt from nattuvangam artiste-teacher Madurai R. Muralidaran, the well-co-ordinated Chennai studio group commenced the strenuous 50-jati presentation. There was no respite during the 75-minute effort. Around 125 dancers, ranging from the age of nine to 60 made history with an event that went on to be certified by the India Book of Records and the Asia Book of Records for the ‘Maximum Participants Performing Bharatanatyam jatis (50 jatis) on Virtual Platform’. It was a well-rehearsed and coordinated attempt. Muralidaran had numbered the jatis and introduced the sollus before the start of each. The approximately 1.5 minute jatis were lilting and rhythmically appealing. Muralidaran varied the speed of rendering sollus, using emphasis, karvais and usi, to create varying jaati patterns, with the same sollus repeated again and again. “I stuck to the traditional format. We have only the pancha jaatis to play around with. Most jatis were in Adi tala and the rest in tisra-nadai Adi tala and khanda-nadai Triputa tala,” said Murlidaran. His well-modulated voice made for a pleasant listening experience. He was accompanied by veteran mridangists Kesavan and Dhananjayan. The ‘50-jati challenge’ was Muralidaran’s brainchild. He was teaching nattuvangam to about 450 artistes across the world when he thought of this challenge and asked those interested to come on board. About 150 did. For three months, as Muralidaran created jatis week after week, he taught it to the dancers with the help of his senior student Deepa Mahadevan and daughter Kavya Muralidaran. He said he did not just teach them the adavus. He taught them the sollus, modulation, nattuvangam and the genesis of the jatis along with their mathematical intricacies. He also trained them for the challenge — conditioning the bodies, strengthening the knees and conserving energy and building stamina. The dancers were not just his disciples, they were interested students from various dance schools. Awards galore Thisis not the first time Muralidaran has created a record or set up a challenge. In 2019, he taught 359 students the Sankeerna Jaati Dhruva Tala Alarippu (29 aksharas) in Bharat Kalachar and had them perform it for the Guinness Book of Records, that very morning. That evening he presented Chaturvidam — four margams in different talas — for the Guinness Book of Records, Asia Book of Records and India Book of Records. Early 2020, when all his foreign assignments were cancelled due to the pandemic, he wrote and composed 25 varnams, composing one a day for 25 days, written in the morning and sung by a musician at the end of the day. He posted it on social media and made it to the Asia Book of Records and the India Book of Records. Muralidaran is not done yet. He is waiting to hear from the Guinness Book of Records for the ‘50-jati challenge’ and plans to stage the programme again for them. Clearly, he is an artiste who is happy to push the envelope.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The star of bhajans||In one of his interviews, Narendra Chanchal fondly remembered how his mother used to call him Mohammad Rafi. The boy, however, always wanted to make a name as Narendra Chanchal and that he did. Instead of being part of a crowd, the boy with the rustic voice, who could reach the high pitch at will, wanted to be a crowd-puller and he remained one till the end. Often called the ‘Midnight Singer’ (also the name of his biography), Chanchal gave devotional music popular appeal as his name became synonymous with jagrans and bhajans for Mata (goddess). Born in Amritsar in a humble family, as a child he followed his mother who was often called to sing bhajans at neighbourhood functions. Sometimes he would sing too. The neighbours loved his voice. They would even pay him in appreciation. Their encouragement gave Chanchal the confidence to become a professional singer. During his visits to Vaishno Devi, he picked up Punjabi and Dogri folk songs. He steered clear of using film song tunes in his bhajans. He often described himself as a messenger of the goddess. He took to jagran, the all-night vigil, as a means to spread jagriti (awareness) and didn’t limit himself to singing. He often conversed with the audience on social issues. One of his songs is about the role of the father in a family while decrying female infanticide. More than the rituals, he saw Navaratras as an opportunity to celebrate the change of season. He used to celebrate New Year’s Eve at Vaishno Devi by performing first at the holy cave and then at a ground in Katra. Over the years, it came to be known as Chanchal Mela and drew huge crowds at the peak of winter. Richa Sharma, who also started her career as a Jagran singer in Delhi remembers Chanchal being fondly refered to as ‘Pappaji’ in the devotional music circuit. “At many jagrans I would perform in the 11-12 midnight slot and then Pappaji would take over.” A very generous performer, Richa recalls how, as her popularity grew, he would come early and listen to her singing, while sitting in his car. Perfect stage for singers Richa says that performing at jagrans prepares singers for any stage. “The kind of full-throated, powerful voice he had, Narendra Chanchal was bound to make an impact. Unlike me, films happened to him by chance. He wanted to spend his life singing for the divine.” Unlike today, Richa recalls a time when jagrans were secular spaces, where Sufi songs were common. “Sufi concerts were unheard of in those days and singers would sing Bulle Shah to warm up the audience.” Little wonder then that it was a kafi of Bulle Shah, which Chanchal sang at an Army charity event, that opened the doors of cinema for him. Raj Kapoor attended that event and found in young Chanchal a voice that he was looking for the unforgettable song ‘Beshak mandir masjid todo, par pyar bhara dil kabhi na todo, is dil main dilbar rehta’ in Bobby that encapsulated the film’s message .  The film won him the Filmfare Award for best playback singer. Narendra Bedi’s Benaam followed where he sang the title song, ‘Main benaam ho gaya’. The song was picturised on Chanchal and he became a star singer. Manoj Kumar made him sing a crucial antara in the song, ‘ Mehengai maar gay i’ in the film Roti Kapda Aur Makaan. Chanchal sang along with Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar and Jani Babu. The song, however, that established him as a star devotional singer was ‘Tu ne mujhe bulaya sherwaliye’ from Asha that he sang with his childhood icon, Mohammad Rafi. This was followed by ‘Chalo bulawa aaya hai mata ne bulaya hai’ from Avtar . In the 1980s, these songs sparked a trend of devotional music in films. In one of his interviews, Chanchal admitted that the fame went to his head and he lost his voice. He soon realised and went back to where he belonged — the stage. This also coincided with an era when unusual voices like his were not used much in playback singing. Clad in bright kurtas with heavy gold chains around his neck and bracelets on his wrists, Narendra Chanchal glammed up to defy the deprivations he faced in childhood. “What I loved about Pappaji,” says Richa, “was that he was devoid of aadambar (hypocrisy).”  Chanchal admitted that the fame went to his head and he lost his voice. He soon realised and went back to where he belonged — the stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-star-of-bhajans/article33755354.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Rich layers of talent||Eyebrows were raised when Kerala Lalithakala Akademi announced its list of awardees for 2020. It included Kathakali artiste Sadanam Harikumar — but for sculpture. For many painters and artists, however, this did not come as a surprise — they had seen Harikumar’s art works at exhibitions and at the solo show he had organised with an Akademi grant. The moulding of this multi-talented artiste is linked to some institutions closely associated with the freedom movement. As a child born in Sadanam Kathakali Academy (1953), founded by his father, the veteran freedom fighter Sadanam Kumaran, training in the classical dance-theatre was a given. He donned the kachcha (loin cloth) while in the third standard and had his arangetram when he was in the fifth standard. He ascribes all his achievements in Kathakali — an accomplished performer, musician, playwright (with 19 plays to his credit) and costume designer — to the doyen Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair Asan, who was at the helm of the Kathakali department in the Academy then. “My guru is the most resourceful exponent of Kathakali I have ever met in my life and he has had ample influence on my artistic career,” Harikumar has said earlier. Before the Kathakali Academy was established, his father had founded Gandhi Seva Sadanam (1946) as part of the freedom movement. This institution had different courses for teaching people crafts for self-reliance. Working on clay was one such. As a child, Harikumar mingled with the artisans and learnt to sculpt in clay. He soon realised his flair for the medium, and even won prizes in school competitions. Later, while in Christ College, Irinjalakuda, an institution known for its extra-curricular activities, his talents bloomed in full. In 1989, Harikumar became a lecturer in the Kathakali department in Santiniketan, another trailblazing institution that emerged from the Independence Movement. The extent to which this campus motivated his artistic propensity is beyond description. Alongside his classes, he began making terracotta sculptures in the department of Fine Arts. The veteran K. G. Subramaniam in the department wondered how he could create such unique works by merely observing. . By the time Harikumar left Shantiniketan in 1994 due to health issues, he was an accomplished sculptor. Back home, it took more than a year for him to recover completely. He soon got back to sculpting and joined the Sadanam Teachers’ Training School as lecturer. By this time, Harikumar was confident enough to try his hand at portraits. He painted ten legendary Kathakali artistes, including Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon, Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair, Thekkinkattil Ramunni Nair, Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair, Vazhankada Kunchu Nair, Thiruvalwamala Vankichan Swamy, Moothamana Kesavan Namboodiri and Mundaya Venkitakrishna Bhagavathar. Perhaps the last in the series was of C. S. Krishna Iyer, his guru in Carnatic music. He also made busts of his parents. The piece that fetched him the Lalithakala Akademi award is titled ‘Karmayogam’ and shows a resurrected man with a wreath on his chest and crows milling around. The six-foot sculpture depicts ramifications of life and death. Foray into painting Harikumar’s foray into painting also happened in Santiniketan. Though he started with oil, he moved to acrylic and recently to Photoshop painting. Sculptor, painter, a Kathakali and Bharatanatyam dancer, musician and composer (he has 30 Malayalam songs to his credit), Harikumar’s achievements mirror the dialogue between Sage Markandeya and King Vajra in the Vishnudharmothara Purana, when the king started by wanting to learn sculpture and the sage said he had to learn painting first, for which he had to learn dance, for which he must know instrumental music, which in turn required a knowledge of singing. And thus was born a multi-dimensional talent.  The writer and culture critic is a trained musician.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/rich-layers-of-talent/article33755394.ece
05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Creative and uncompromising||Kalki Memorial Trust honours promising classical music artistes every year and the event is followed by their concert. This time the Trust awarded Mylai M. Karthikeyan, a talented youngster in the field of nagaswaram. The function, followed by Karthikeyan’s concert, was a sumptuous affair notwithstanding the fact that time was a constraint. The event took place at Ragasudha Hall, Mylapore. Mastering nagaswaram, a royal and formidable instrument, is no easy task. It demands not just musical acumen but a lot of energy and practice. Karthikeyan proved adept at both during his concert. He packed his concert with several items without compromising on either quality or tradition. He was accompanied by Gummidipoondi R. Gnanavel on the nagaswaram, Mangalam K. Aasan and Sivanvayil N. Rajaratnam on the thavil, and Saravanan on the talam. The recital started with the Mallari in Gambhira Nattai, which is unique and a special musical offering in nagaswaram. He next took up the Tyagaraja kriti ‘Inta paraka’ in Mayamalavagowla and followed it up with Dikshitar’s ‘Sriramam ravikulabdhi somam’ in Narayanagowla and Syama Sastri’s ‘Parvati ninnu’ in the rare raga Kalkada.  Impressive swara sallies Karthikeyan’s Gowrimanohari raga essay, with a few distinct and special touches unique to the raga, was melodic and the choice was once again a Tyagaraja kriti, ‘Guruleka etuvanti.’ The rapid fire swara sallies between Karthikeyan and Gnanavel were impressive. A rare and zesty ‘Brihadeeswaro’ in Ganasamavarali and Kalki’s popular ‘Vandaadum solaithanile’ in Harikamboji came in tandem. The main raga chosen for the evening was the majestic Kalyani. Karthikeyan’s well-structured essay carried several élite sancharas in the upper registers, which were distinctive for nagaswaram. Muthuswami Dikshitar’s kriti ‘Kamalambam bhajare’ was his choice. A leisurely rendition appended with a series of interesting swara exchanges between Karthikeyan and Gnanavel created a brilliant aura. The twin thavil support extended by Mangalam K. Aasan and Sivanvayil N. Rajaratnam was pleasing throughout and their tani avartanam carried ample dynamism after the main kriti. Karthikeyan added Kalki’s ‘Kattrinile varum geetham,’ ‘Aaduvome pallu paduvome’ (by Bharati) and a Tiruppugazh in Dwijavanti as tail-enders. The evening, moderated by Seetha Ravi, had begun with S. Chandramouli, trustee of the Kalki Memorial Trust, welcoming the gathering, and Lakshmi Natarajan reading out the citation. Senior vocalist S. Sowmya, who presided over the function, recalled her great admiration for Kalki’s writings, the special position of the nagaswaram, and Karthikeyan’s musical acumen.  The Chennai-based author writes on music.   Mastering nagaswaram is no easy task. It demands not just musical acumen but a lot of energy and practice.

05 February 2021||February 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Stage is where the student is||Even when the doors of schools and colleges were shut, the window to culture remained open. “Crisis or calamity, we have been keeping this movement going. No challenge is too big for SPIC MACAY. In 1977, when we began to build a bridge between students and Indian performing arts, we realised how difficult it is going to be to save it from collapsing. So the pandemic is just another trying phase,” says Kiran Seth. Soon after the lockdown was announced, SPIC MACAY’s huge team of volunteers from around the country came up with ways to reach out to students. “Not many have discussed the impact of social isolation on young minds. Loneliness is not easy to cope with at this age. Hence, we decided to keep them engaged through arts. For the past 43 years, we have been trying to draw their attention to the timeless beauty and calming effect of our classical art forms, but it is now that we really need to help them experience it,” points out Seth. Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Delhi since 1976, Seth, a cultural crusader, founded SPIC MACAY to take education beyond classroom learning. From starting with just five students in the audience to making the whole campus resound with rhythm and melody, SPIC MACAY has mastered the art of connecting with the young. Special series It began streaming several thematic music and dance performances since April 2020. While the Rendezvous series is an interaction with exponents of different art forms, the Parampara Series is designed to focus on musicians carrying forward their guru’s legacy. They also conceived the Great Masters series to make the new generation aware of the approach and style of legendary artistes. The Classical Evening series on Saturdays features music and dance performances. Says renowned flautist Ronu Majumdar, “I have always been in favour of cultural activities that involve the younger generation. I was delighted when they invited me to connect virtually with students as part of the Rendezvous series. With no concerts and recordings, I thought it was the best time to involve in activities that will create an appreciative young audience.” Besides classical arts, SPIC MACAY has been screening ‘Cinema Classics,’ both Indian and international, which is followed by a discussion about the film with a renowned filmmaker. The Sunday noon Craft and Folk series is an effort to not only showcase our rich tradition but extend support to craftsmen and folk artistes severely impacted by the pandemic. The annual SPIC MACAY convention, Anubhav, was also held virtually. “Though we have been busy curating an exciting line-up, it has not been easy to raise funds. Some reputed educational institutions came forward to host performances. Recently, IIM Bangalore organised a dusk-to-dawn musical event, ‘Yamini’, featuring Vishaka Hari, S. Sowmya, Venkatesh Kumar, Purbayan Chatterjee and Mysore Chandan Kumar. As always, the SRF Foundation has been a major support. This being the Diamond Jubilee year of IIT Delhi, the alumni raised a huge amount that has been sustaining us through this crisis,” says Seth. Amid a surfeit of digital cultural events SPIC MACAY holds its own, says senior Bharatanatyam dancer, Chitra Visweswaran, who was part of one of the series. “Engagement with art can make it easier for the young to get used to the new normal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/stage-is-where-the-student-is/article33755369.ece

05 February 2021||New Delhi,||Centre ready to introduce Bill defining Delhi govt., L-G powers||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is all set to introduce a legislation in the Budget session of the Parliament to amend a 1991 Act pertaining to the powers and functions of the Delhi government and the Lieutenant Governor. The proposed legislation received Union Cabinet’s approval on Wednesday. The Bill is likely to clearly define the powers of the L-G and the Delhi Government on the lines of the Supreme Court judgment of February 2019. It is likely to give more teeth to the L-G’s office. A Supreme Court Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and Ashok Bhushan had other than the question of services given a unanimous verdict on the role of the two authorities. The services plea has been referred to a larger Bench of the SC and the hearing is yet to conclude. 2019 verdict In the February 14, 2019 verdict, the court upheld as “legal” the MHA’s May 21 and July 23, 2015 notification authorising the L-G to exercise powers in relation to services and directing the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) police not to take cognisance of offences against Central government officials. The apex court confirmed the Delhi High Court’s finding that the ACB’s jurisdiction is confined to Delhi officials and statutory bodies and does not extend to Central government officials. Last year, the MHA notified rules for the newly created Union Territory of J&K where it said that in case of difference of opinion between the L-G and a Minister when no agreement could be reached even after a month, the “decision of the Lieutenant Governor shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Council of Ministers.” The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 is among the 20 Bills proposed to be introduced in this Parliament session. The reason stated to move the legislation says, “The Bill proposes to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, in the context of judgment dated 14.02.2019 of Hon’ble Supreme Court [Division Bench] in Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017 and other connected matters.” The Bill was listed in the monsoon session last year but it could not be taken up as it had not received the Union Cabinet’s approval then.  The Hindu had reported that according to changes proposed in the new Act, the L-G could act in his discretion in any matter that is beyond the purview of the powers of the Delhi Assembly in matters related to the All India (Civil) Services and the ACB. At loggerheads The Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government is often at loggerheads with the Centre regarding administrative matters in the Capital. The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, is also likely to be tabled this session. The Bill seeks to create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of crytptocurrency and its uses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-ready-to-introduce-bill-defining-delhi-govt-l-g-powers/article33755090.ece
05 February 2021||Chandigarh,||Farm laws: Hooda, Cong. MLAs march to Raj Bhavan||The Haryana Congress MLAs, led by Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, on Thursday staged a march to the Governor House here, demanding repeal of the three Central farm laws. The legislators, who marched from the MLA hostel, were stopped by the police near the Governor House.  ‘No appointment’ They accused the Governor of not giving them an appointment despite repeated requests. Mr. Hooda said he had been constantly seeking an appointment as both the ruling and the Opposition have their own importance in democracy. “It is the constitutional right of the Opposition to convey the voice of the people to the Governor and it is the duty of the Governor to listen to the Opposition. But we are not being given any time,” he said. “We are demanding the Governor to convene a special session of the Assembly so that the situation in the State and the issue of the farmers can be discussed.” ‘Bill for MSP’ Mr. Hooda said the Congress will bring a Bill to amend the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act in the next Assembly session so that farmers can get guaranteed minimum support price. “Also, a no-confidence motion against the the BJP-JJP coalition government will be moved. The situation has become such that due to the opposition from the people, the Chief Minister, Ministers and the MLAs backing the government are avoiding going to their constituencies,” he said. Abhay resignation Asked about Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Chautala, who recently resigned as MLA, Mr. Hooda said Mr. Chautala instead of resigning should have voted against the government. “Why did he not resign when farmers were being cornered in Kandela during the INLD government in 2000. This no-confidence motion will reveal the truth of those who are merely playing political games under the guise of the peasant movement and running indirect alliances with the government,” said Mr. Hooda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farm-laws-hooda-cong-mlas-march-to-raj-bhavan/article33755081.ece
05 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Priyanka Gandhi attends prayer meeting for farmer in Rampur||Invoking Sikh Guru Guru Gobind Singh, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Thursday “to oppress somebody is a sin but to bear oppression is a bigger sin”. She was speaking at the final prayer meeting for Navreet Singh in Rampur village in Uttar Pradesh. Singh, 24, died allegedly when his tractor overturned during the tractor rally on Republic Day in Delhi. While some media outlets have claimed, after the family of the deceased expressed doubts, that Mr. Singh’s tractor overturned when he was hit by a bullet, Rampur District Magistrate (DM) Aujaneya Kumar Singh maintained that Singh’s post mortem had not indicated any bullet injury. Ms. Vadra said the country stood firm with the farmers and that the protest against the farm laws would continue till the government repealed them. Describing the ongoing farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders as a “true” movement, she insisted it was not a “political” agitation. Ms. Vadra said a farmer son’s went had gone from Rampur village to Delhi thinking that his woes would be heard. “That if they were united, the government would listen. The government would open doors to listen to what is there in the farmers’ hearts. But it didn’t happen,” she said. She promised H.S. Dibdiba, grandfather of the deceased, that his grandson’s martyrdom would not go in vain. Ms. Vadra sat in the women’s enclosure and interacted with the female members of the family. She said by not repealing the farm laws, the government was doing injustice to the farmers. But the “bigger injustice”, she asserted, “is when they describe martyrs [those who died during the farmer protests] as terrorists and call the farmer protest a political conspiracy against the government,” she said.  ‘Leader of no use’ Without naming the Prime Minister, Ms. Vadra said that a leader who could not “listen to the pain of the poor and the farmers, and say that their suffering was his suffering” was “of no use”. Hundreds of people attended the ‘Antim Ardas’ of Singh, held at a gurudwara in the Dibdiba village of Bilaspur in Rampur district. Rashtriya Lok Dal vice president Jayant Chaudhary and Samajwadi Party leader Ram Govind Chaudhary also addressed the prayer meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/priyanka-gandhi-attends-prayer-meeting-for-farmer-in-rampur/article33755083.ece
05 February 2021||New Delhi,||HC expresses displeasure over disturbances in virtual hearings||The Delhi High Court on Thursday expressed displeasure at advocates arguing or attending matters through videoconferencing while being on “roads, sitting in parks and even running up on stairs”. Justice Prathiba M. Singh was annoyed with the regular disturbances in virtual hearings making it difficult for the court to conduct proceedings. “Advocates are on the road, sitting in parks and even running up on stairs while attending or arguing the matter. This is simply shocking,” Justice Singh said. “It is very difficult to conduct proceedings like this. For the last 45 minutes, I have managed to hear only one matter because the counsel was inaudible and because half of the time goes in answering the lawyer who says ‘Am I audible’ for 20 times,” Justice Singh said. Justice Singh said she will have to start issuing a note that advocates who are not in a place from where they are properly audible, will not be allowed to attend the virtual proceedings. The court said that according to the videoconferencing rules, the lawyers and parties are supposed to join the proceedings from a quiet place from where they are at least properly audible, even if not visible. Justice Singh said the lawyers should check their Internet connection while participating in the virtual proceedings. She said even if the lawyers are not properly visible, they should be audible. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, who was logged in for some other case in Justice Singh’s court, said the fraternity should accept with grace the facility of virtual proceedings being extended to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-expresses-displeasure-over-disturbances-in-virtual-hearings/article33755088.ece

Mr. Kejriwal said that there was a need to spread awareness about the Delhi government’s electric vehicle policy and the various benefits being offered to those who make the switch. “Delhi has to turn its EV adoption movement into a mass movement to form a collective commitment to decrease pollution by purchasing EVs.

Mr. Sisodia claimed that this was against democracy, constitution, and will of the people of Delhi. “Today [Thursday], from media reports, we came to know that the Central government on Wednesday passed a law in the Cabinet to snatch the powers of the Delhi’s elected government [Chief Minister and Ministers] and give to the L-G. By amending the GNCTD Act, the Central government is going to give so much power to the L-G that he can stop the Delhi’s elected government’s work,” Mr. Sisodia said in a video statement. ‘Against democracy’ “Delhi’s elected government won’t have power to take decisions, it will be with the L-G, which means that it will be with the Central government. The Central government’s this step is against the democracy and the Constitution,” he added. The Deputy CM said that the BJP wants to govern Delhi’s people through the ‘backdoor’. “It is clearly mentioned in our Constitution that barring police, land and public order, everything else falls under the ambit of an elected government in Delhi. In its reading of the Constitution, the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court has also clearly distinguished the powers of the elected government and the L-G. But, the BJP, which has faced defeat thrice in the past, wants to govern Delhi through a proxy,” he said. He claimed that the BJP doesn’t want free electricity and water for the people of Delhi and hence, it is using ‘unconstitutional’ ways.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-wants-to-govern-delhi-through-backdoor/article33755097.ece
