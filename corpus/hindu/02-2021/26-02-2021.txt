Nair,||Govt. to monitor OTT content||For the first time, the government, under the ambit of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, has brought in detailed guidelines for digital content on both digital media and Over The Top (OTT) platforms, while giving itself overriding powers. Emergency powers The new rules, unveiled at a joint press conference by Information TechnologyMinister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, lay down a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism. However, over and above this framework, the government has equipped itself with “emergency” powers to block public access of any information. The rules state, “in case of emergency nature” the Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, may “if he is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient and justifiable” give orders to block access. Such orders can be released “without giving an opportunity of hearing” to the publishing platform. The first level of the grievance redressal system will be at the level of each OTT provider. Each complaint will have to be addressed within 15 days. If the complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, then thecomplainant can scale it up to a self-regulatory body collectively established by the OTTs. This body will be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, a High Court, or an independent eminent person from the field of media, broadcasting, entertainment, child rights, human rights or other relevant fields.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-monitor-ott-content/article33937031.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, Pakistan agree to adhere to 2003 ceasefire||In a first joint statement issued by the two sides in years, India and Pakistan on Thursday said they have agreed to a “strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control (LoC) and all other sectors” with effect from the midnight of February 24-25 (Wednesday). The decision was announced after discussions between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of both sides over the established hotline on February 22. “In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have [the] propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence,” the statement issued in Delhi and Islamabad said, adding that they would use existing mechanisms of hotlines and flag meetings to resolve any “misunderstandings”. As per the existing mechanism, there is a discussion by officials from the Military Operations directorate every Tuesday but the DGMOs speak only when one side requests for a conversation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-pakistan-agree-to-adhere-to-2003-ceasefire/article33937048.ece
26 February 2021||Mangaluru,||Varsity tries again to create new PG departments||In Mangalore University’s second attempt to create two new postgraduate departments to teach Geography and Medical Physics, by carving them out from their parental Departments of Marine Geology and Physics, respectively, its academic council in its meeting on Thursday approved two separate revised statutes to establish the departments. The university introduced the postgraduate programme in Geography at its campus from 2016-17 while the Medical Physics programme commenced from 2018-19. The council passed the revised statutes governing the establishment of postgraduate department of studies and research in Geography and in Medical Physics. Though the university earlier had prepared the draft statutes for the establishment of the same two departments and had sent them for the approval of the government the latter had not approved them stating that the government can not approve creation of new posts in view of financial constraints. Hence, the university revised the draft statutes by redeploying the existing posts of teachers and the same was tabled before the council for approval on Thursday. The revised draft statues said that each of the two new departments will have one Professor, an Associate Professor, and an Assistant Professor. Their posts will be made available by redeployment of similar posts already existing in the postgraduate departments of the university. A programme in Medical Physics is relatively a new one introduced by the university. Medical Physics is the application of Physics to the needs of medicine. Its draft said that this discipline of Physics is responsible for the technical foundations of Radiology, Radiation Oncology, and Nuclear Medicine. There is an acute shortage of trained and qualified medical physicists in the country. A medical physicist is often called as radiation physicist who played a prominent role in team work in terms of ensuring complete quality assurance of radiation generating equipment, enabling accurate treatment planning and guiding radiation oncologists in precise treatment delivery, pre and post-treatment quality checks on treatment plans, the draft added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/varsity-tries-again-to-create-new-pg-departments/article33937694.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fix ‘non-exploitative, reasonable’ fee for MBBS: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday spelt relief for students and private self-financing medical colleges alike in Kerala by directing the State's Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee to consult with the college managements and fix a ‘non-exploitative and reasonable’ fee from 2017-18 onwards for MBBS studies. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao asked the committee to complete the exercise in three months. “The committee shall re-examine the proposals of the managements of medical colleges for the fixation of fee 2017-18 onwards,” the court ordered. The judgment is based on appeals stemming from over three rounds of litigations involving the State, managements of the private colleges and students in the High Court. Clears the air The apex court, in its judgment, cleared the air by confirming the wisdom of a February 28, 2019 judgment of the High Court. In 2019, the High Court had asked the committee to “closely scrutinise the fee suggested by the managements to examine if the fee proposed was not excessive and to eliminate any element of profiteering or collection of capitation fee.” The managements were directed to cooperate with the committee in the matter of fixation of fee. Justice Rao took a leaf from the 2019 decision by choosing not to delve into the merits of the fee structure of any individual college, but simply conforming to the principles of fee fixation laid down in a 2017 Act. “Unaided professional institutions have the autonomy to decide on the fee to be charged, subject to the fee not resulting in profiteering or collection of capitation fee. Regulation of fee is within the domain of the committee, which shall ensure that the fee is non-exploitative and reasonable,” Justice Rao explained. Lack of clarity The apex court agreed with the Kerala High Court that lack of clarity over the fee structure for MBBS in private aided and unaided colleges was beneficial neither for the institutions nor the students. “Therefore, we direct the committee to expeditiously reconsider the proposals of the private self-financing colleges for fee fixation from 2017-18 onwards. Needless to mention that fee for earlier years also needs to be finalised in case it has not been done in respect of any college,” the judgment said. The Supreme Court said the committee could direct college managements for information necessary to arrive at a decision that the fee proposed by the managements was "neither excessive nor exploitative in nature." “A reasonable opportunity should be given to the managements of the private self-financing colleges in respect of their proposals for fee fixation. The entire exercise shall be completed within a period of three months from today,” Justice Rao ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fix-non-exploitative-reasonable-fee-for-mbbs-says-supreme-court/article33937211.ece
26 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Steps to register senior citizens||The State will immediately commence the preparations for the registration of those above 60 years in the State for receiving COVID-19 vaccine, so that it can be done as soon as the Centre gives the go ahead, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said in a statement here on Thursday. She said the State planned to ease the vaccination process for those above 60 years by ensuring that they can receive the vaccine at the nearest health facility. The government is planning to open vaccination sites in 300 private hospitals also to speed up the drive for senior citizens. Ms. Shylaja held a review meeting with senior health officials on Thursday to assess the State’s progress in the vaccination drive. She directed that the second phase of vaccination for front-line workers and officials be completed as soon as possible. Health workers who had registered but had missed out on the first dose should take the vaccine before February 27. Front-line workers and poll officials should come forward to receive the first dose of vaccine before March 1, she said. 4 lakh doses arriving The State will receive 4,06,500 doses of COVID vaccine on Friday. While there are no issues in vaccine supply, finding human resource and making physical arrangements for the vaccination process in each of the sites are turning out to be a laborious task. A doctor needs to be posted in each site through the entire process as every person receiving the vaccine has to be observed for half an hour. Not more than 100 vaccinations are being done per site per day, according to the Centre’s directive (also because of the time factor). However, if required, Kerala is fully equipped to take on the challenge of vaccinating more people in a mission mode, health officials said. They said the State is in the process of readying 1,000 vaccination sites a day for the same. As of Thursday, there were 611 sites across the State Data collection Data collection of those above 50 years in the State, based on the 2011 Census figures, is about to begin. The Health Department also has to collect the data of those above 45 years with chronic diseases. The numbers, predictably, are going to be huge. Only when the data collection process is over can the Health Department place its vaccine requirement before the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/steps-to-register-senior-citizens/article33937218.ece
26 February 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra Budget session from March 1||The Budget session of the Maharashtra legislature would be held from March 1 to 10, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said on Thursday. Opposition BJP alleged that the government was trying to curtail the session on the pretext of the novel coronavirus situation, but Mr. Parab claimed that it was opposition parties which wanted a one-day session. The session would start on March 1 with the Governor’s address to the two Houses while the Budget would be tabled on March 8, the minister told reporters after a meeting of the legislature’s Business Advisory Committee here. “The State government will also table supplementary demands on the first day. The House will hold discussion on Governor’s speech on March 2 while the next two days are reserved for discussion on supplementary demands,” Mr. Parab said. There will be no sittings on March 6 and 7 due to weekend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-budget-session-from-march-1/article33937718.ece
26 February 2021||Mumbai,||Refusal to make tea no provocation to assault wife: HC||Upholding a 35-year-old man’s conviction for assaulting his wife, the Bombay High Court has said the wife’s refusal to make tea for husband could not be accepted as provocation for him to assault her, and said that wife is “not a chattel or an object”. In an order passed earlier this month, Justice Revati Mohite Dere said, “Marriage, ideally, is a partnership based on equality. But, notions of patriarchy and the idea that the woman is a man’s property still prevail in society, leading a man to think that his wife is his chattel.” The HC also said that the testimony of the couple’s six-year-old daughter inspired confidence and could not be disbelieved. The court upheld the conviction and 10 years’ imprisonment awarded to Santosh Atkar (35), a resident of Pandharpur in Solapur district, by a local court in 2016. He was found guilty on the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. As per the order, Atkar and his wife had been having disputes for some time. On the day of the incident in December 2013, his wife insisted on going out without making a cup of tea for him. The man then struck her with a hammer, injuring her grievously. As per the case details and testimony of the couple’s daughter, Atkar then cleaned the spot of the crime, gave his wife a bath, and took her to hospital. She succumbed to her injuries after being in the hospital for about a week. The defence argued that Atkar had been provoked into committing the crime because his wife refused to make tea. The HC, however, rejected the argument and held that there existed adequate evidence, including testimony of the man’s daughter, to prove the charges against him. “The deceased, by refusing to make tea for the appellant (Atkar), by no stretch of imagination, can be said to have offered grave and sudden provocation for the appellant to assault her, much less, such a brutal assault,” it said. “It would not be out of place to observe that a wife is not a chattel or an object,” the HC said. Such cases reflected the imbalance of gender and skewed patriarchy, the socio-cultural milieu one had grown up in, which often seeped into a marital relationship, it said. The court said an imbalance of gender roles existed in society, where the wife was expected to do all the household chores. “Emotional labour in a marriage is also expected to be done by the wife. Coupled with these imbalances in the equation is the imbalance of expectation and subjugation,” Justice Mohite Dere said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/refusal-to-make-tea-not-a-provocation-to-assault-wife-hc/article33937059.ece
26 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CM hints at Cong.-BJP-IUML axis||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said the BJP’s invitation to the Indian Union Muslim League to join the National Democratic Alliance was not surprising. When pressed about BJP national executive member Sobha Surendran’s overture to the IUML, Mr. Vijayan said: “It is merely a public expression of the Congress-BJP-IUML axis. Its genesis was in Vadakara and Beypore. The IUML would not openly align with the BJP at least for now. However, the axis remained strong,” he said. The difference between the Congress and the BJP was thin. Congress leaders have towed a soft Hindutva line. The BJP’s economic policy equalled that of the Congress. It was characteristic of the UDF to align with the BJP to defeat the Left Democratic Front electorally, he said. In Gujurat, the Congress had not fielded anybody against the BJP’s Rajya Sabha candidate. Losing relevance The Congress was fast losing its political relevance. Its legislators and Ministers in Puducherry had defected to the BJP. In Kerala, the Congress was the ideological echo chamber of the BJP. Both parroted the same set of lies against the LDF, Mr. Vijayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-hints-at-cong-bjp-iuml-axis/article33937264.ece
26 February 2021||CHITTOOR,||I ignored party workers while focussing more on State: Naidu||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday admitted that he had ignored the interests of the party workers as he focussed more on the development of the State after the bifurcation. “I admit that I had overlooked the interests of the party workers as I concentrated on development of the State in the backdrop of the injustice done to us post bifurcation,” Mr. Naidu said while interacting with the party workers at the Rallagangamma temple junction of Kuppam Assembly constituency. Mr. Naidu’s three-day tour of the constituency assumed significance as it came after the severe drubbing the party had faced in home turf in the panchayat elections. Unlike his previous visits when he had confined himself to meeting a few local leaders, Mr. Naidu this time directly spoke to the party workers and elicited their views on reasons for the party’s drubbing. Responding to the allegations of intimidation and money flow, which were believed as the prime reasons for the party’s dismal show, Mr. Naidu alleged that the YSRCP leaders had dumped Rs. 50 crore to manipulate the elections in Kuppam. ‘Shed differences’ “Apart from promising the moon, they (YSCRP leaders) had threatened the voters. Still, you (cadres) had worked hard and saved the party’s image. It is time you shunned differences and worked as a team. I will give all activists a free hand in electing their leaders at the mandal and constituency levels,” Mr. Naidu said. The party workers welcomed Mr. Naidu as he entered the constituency at Gudichembagiri by road from Bengaluru. Addressing a roadshow, he alleged that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had left Kuppam parched without supplying drinking water . “In the 20-month YSRCP rule, the State has slipped into anarchy. The people have to decide whether they support rowdyism or peace,” he said and expressed confidence that the TDP would win a majority of seats in the MPTC / ZPTC polls. Predicting that Jamili elections (simultaneous polls) would be held in one-and-a-half years, Mr Naidu said the TDP would return to power in the State. “The police officers and officials who serve the interests of the YSRCP will be paid back in their own coin,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/i-ignored-party-workers-while-focussing-more-on-state-naidu/article33937035.ece

Ramachandraiah (Kadapa), Mohmmed Karimunneesa (Vijayawada), and Duvvada Srinivas (Srikakulam) would be contesting in elections. “The YSRCP will not be involved in Teachers’ Quota elections, and we leave the decision to the teachers’ unions, as they can express their version better in the House,” he said. Party leaders in Guntur, Marri Rajasekhar, L. Appireddy did not figure in the list. Naidu flayed Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy criticised the former Chief Minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, on Swami Swaroopanandendra, and recalled that the TDP leaders had met the seer along with their president in the past, which was “holy then and tantric now”. He said that Mr. Naidu was showing his true colours after the defeat of the TDP-backed candidates in the panchayat elections in his home turf Kuppam. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy slammed Nara Lokesh over his “abusive language” in public meetings. “People have shown Mr. Naidu his place in the 2019 polls and the panchayat polls,” said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy. Stating that there was no short cut to success, Mr. Reddy said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had taken public welfare to the village level benefiting every eligible person in the State without creating any hassles and leaving no scope for corruption. The better governance provided by YSRCP had paved the way for a clean sweep in the panchayat polls and the same would continue in the coming municipal, MPTC and ZPTC elections, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ysrcp-announces-six-candidates-for-mlc-polls/article33937037.ece

26 February 2021||Kalaburagi,||Poll pact in Mysuru emerged locally: HDK||Referring to the Congress support for electing JD(S) candidate Rukmini Made Gowda as Mayor of Mysuru, former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy has said that the understanding between the two parties emerged locally. “There were no talks between the State-level leaders of both the parties on the election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Mysuru. It was Congress leader Tanveer Sait who took the initiative to extend the party’s support to JD(S) candidate to keep the BJP, the single largest party, away from power. The alliance was therefore forged locally.” Mr. Kumaraswamy said, in Kalaburagi on Thursday. Asked about JD(S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda’s disinterest in the imminent byelections to three Assembly segments, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that the party would field its candidates. Criticising the BJP government in the State, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that its priorities were misplaced. “Mr. Siddaramaiah had promised to build Anubhava Mantapa at a cost of Rs. 600 crore in Basavakalyan. The announcement was made to attract voters and ensure the victory of Congress candidate B. Narayanrao in the last Assembly elections. When I became the Chief Minister in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, I allocated Rs. 670 crore for irrigation projects in Bidar district instead of taking up the Anubhava Mantapa project. Now, the BJP government has again announced the construction of Anubhava Manatapa keeping an eye on Basavakalyan by-elections. Priorities are misplaced in the Yediyurappa government. Funds are not being released to the projects and programmes that were announced in the budget and approved in the Assembly,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/poll-pact-in-mysuru-emerged-locally-hdk/article33937177.ece

A non-subsidised domestic cylinder weighing 14.2 kg is now priced Rs. 810 in Chennai, with Rs. 25 being the subsidy amount. On February 4, the price was Rs. 735 per cylinder and it was later revised to Rs. 785 per refill. Last month, it was Rs. 710.

Distributors said as the price was revised on Wednesday night, bills meant for delivery on Thursday would have been cancelled so that the revised prices could be incorporated. “Customers would have received two text messages with both the amounts. In some homes, since it is the end of the month, consumers who pay by cash might return the cylinders if they don't have enough money,” said a distributor.

26 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,||‘Cong. govt. in U.T. failed to work with the Centre’||Days after the V. Narayanasamy government fell in Puducherry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that it had failed to cooperate with the Centre in implementing schemes and in funds utilisation. At a public meeting held here, he said that while people voted for the Congress in 2016 with hopes and aspirations, the party leaders tried to please the high command. “I came here three years ago. Now, I could see more happiness among the people because of two reasons. One is due to the development works I inaugurated this morning... The second is the removal of the Congress government,” he said. Citing the video of a wrong translation made by Mr. Narayanasamy during Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s recent visit, Mr. Modi said that instead of telling the truth, “he lied to his own leader and the nation”. (Mr. Narayanasamy had subsequently said he had indeed visited the region where the woman complained of lack of attention). “It is in the culture of the Congress to spread lies,” the Prime Minister said. Mr. Modi was confident of the NDA forming a government in the Union Territory after the Assembly election. “Such a government will be people’s government and the high command will be the people. I want to see the UT [the Union Territory] become the BEST [business hub, education hub, spiritual hub and tourism hub].” The NDA government would focus on the coastal development and revive the cooperative sector to enhance the lot of women, he said. Mr. Modi said the Congress had bagged “several medals in spreading lies”. “The party follows our colonial master’s policy of divide and rule. Sometimes they pit one region against the other and at other times one community against another. They are the gold, silver and bronze medallist in spreading lie,” he said. Referring to Mr. Gandhi’s statement on the need to create a separate ministry for fisheries, Mr. Modi said that in May 2019 itself, a Ministry of Fisheries was constituted by the NDA government. In the last two years, the budgetary allocation for the Ministry had gone up by 80%. “The credit for constituting a Ministry for Tribal Affairs also goes to the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee,” he said. The Congress “will never pass an opportunity to call others anti-democratic,” he said, adding the party should look in the mirror to understand the reality. “Panchayat elections were held in Ladakh, and recently in Gujarat. Even after the Supreme Court directed that the civic bodies elections be held in the Union Territory, the Congress government had not conducted them. But the party calls others anti-democratic,” he said Nominated legislator and BJP Puducherry president V. Saminathan and former Minister A. Namassivayam spoke at the meeting.

It said the 2018 judgment of the Supreme Court decriminalising homosexual sex was “neither intended to, nor did it in fact, legitimise the human conduct in question”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/same-sex-marriages-will-cause-havoc-govt-tells-hc/article33937350.ece
26 February 2021||Bengaluru,||BMTC bus fare hike likely||Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who also hold the transport portfolio,on Thursday, hinted at a ticket fare hike for buses run by Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). The Minister said the pandemic and fuel price increase had led to huge losses for the corporation, following which BMTC had proposed a hike in the range of 18-20%. The move comes amidst a Bharat Bandh call bytransporters and traders over fuel price hike. The proposal has not gone down well with commuters who rely on BMTC buses to commute to work. The commuter-led forum, BMTC Bus Prayanikara Vedike, has threatened to stage protests if the government increases the fares. “The Chief Minister will take a final call on the fare hike, such that neither BMTC nor the commuters are overly burdened,” Mr. Savadi said. He also clarified that there was no question of a fare hike in buses run by other road transport corporations as ticket rates had been increased by 12% last year. The last time BMTC fares were hiked was in 2014-15. C. Shikha, Managing Director, BMTC, told The Hindu that the corporation was estimated to suffer losses to the tune of Rs. 700 crore for 2020-21, due to loss of ridership and fuel price hike. This is over and above the Rs. 540 crore loss it incurred in 2019-20. “The government helped us pay salaries of staff, otherwise even that would have been a problem during the pandemic,” she said. The cost of a litre of diesel at bulk purchase cost in the range of Rs. 49-Rs. 52 a year ago, which has now shot up to Rs. 77.50 a litre as on Thursday. Ridership is yet to return to normal levels post lockdown. As against an average daily ridership of 35 lakh before lockdown, it is now around 20 lakh a day, she pointed out, making a case for the fare hike. While acknowledging the revenue deficit of BMTC, Bus Prayanikara Vedike members argued that a fare hike was not the answer. “The pandemic has hit incomes badly, especially in the unorganised sector where people have lost jobs as well. A bus fare hike at this stage can only be described as cruel,” said Vinay Sreenivasa of the Vedike. He added that buses are a public service and the BMTC should not be run like a private for-profit firm. “The State government must support the corporation and not transfer the burden to commuters. The State government should at least exempt RTCs from fuel tax,” he said. Regular commuters also pointed out that BMTC fares are already higher than their counterparts in other cities, which only deterred the poor from using its services. “Ridership and revenue both dipped after the previous hike in 2014-15. This is a flawed policy. Already garment workers and labourers find BMTC buses unaffordable and use private transport or walk long distances. Any fare hike will further hit ridership and push BMTC into a vicious cycle,” Mr. Sreenivasa argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bmtc-bus-fare-hike-likely/article33937548.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||India, China review status at LAC||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday spoke to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to review the ongoing disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In a message on Twitter, Mr. Jaishankar said he “spoke to State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi this afternoon” and “discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement”. The two Ministers had met in Moscow in September and agreed that the situation was “not in the interest of either side” and to continue dialogue and “quickly disengage”. Working out the modalities, however, was complicated and took several months. Both sides agreed on a plan to disengage at the ninth round of military-level talks in January, which began to be implemented earlier this month. On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs said the completion of disengagement on the north and the south banks of the Pangong Lake last week was “a significant first step” towards resolving the remaining issues. “Both sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. “The two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues.” He said as agreed by both sides, the 10th round of meetings between Corps Commanders was held on February 20, within 48 hours of the completion of disengagement on the north and the south banks of Pangong Lake. ‘Misleading comments’ Responding to what he called “misleading” comments in the media, Mr. Srivastava said, “India has not conceded any territory as a result of this agreement.” He added, “On the contrary, it has enforced observance and respect for LAC and it has prevented any unilateral change in the status quo.” On Wednesday, Army Chief Gen. Manoj Naravane said disengagement at the lake was “a win win” situation for both sides, but cautioned that there was a long way to go towards full disengagement, and thereafter, de-escalation. “We now have to move on to the stage of de-escalation. After that, de-induction of troops, which went to the higher reaches.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-review-status-at-lac/article33936986.ece

The third upward revision thus far this month, it has made the cooking gas refills dearer by Rs. 100 each for households in a span of just three weeks. Following the latest increase, 14.2 kg cylinders in Delhi cost Rs. 794 each, as against Rs. 769 at which they were supplied on Wednesday.

26 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Pandemic generation’ hit hard: CSE||The country is all set to usher in a “pandemic generation”, with 375 million children (from newborns to 14-year-olds) likely to suffer long-lasting impacts. The challenges could range from being underweight, stunting and increased child mortality, to losses in education and work productivity, according to the State of Environment Report, 2021, released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Thursday. Over 500 million children have been forced out of school globally and India accounts for more than half of them. “COVID-19 has made the world’s poor poorer,” Sunita Narain, Director-General of the research organisation, said in a statement. “115 million additional people might get pushed into extreme poverty by the pandemic — and most of them live in South Asia.” India ranked 117 among 192 nations in terms of sustainable development and was now behind all South Asian nations, except Pakistan, according to the report. India’s air, water and land have become more polluted between 2009 and 2018. Of 88 major industrial clusters in the country, according to the Central Pollution Control Board, 35 showed overall environmental degradation, 33 pointed to worsening air quality, 45 had more polluted water and in 17, land pollution became worse. Tarapur in Maharashtra emerged as the most polluted cluster. ‘Lack of action’ CSE experts pointed out that this data clearly indicated a lack of action over the years to control and reduce pollution even in areas that were already identified as critically or severely polluted. When ranked on the basis of achieving Sustainable Development Goals, the best performing States were Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. The worst performers were Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh, the report stated. Forestland diversion continued unabated in the country. Over 11,000 hectares were diverted in 22 States in 2019. Eight coal projects granted clearance in ‘no-go’ areas would divert 19,614 hectares of forestland, fell over 1 million trees, and evict over 10,000 families. Sixty-seven million Indians died due to air pollution in 2019, the report said. The economic cost was over $36,000 million, equivalent to 1.36% of the country’s GDP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-generation-hit-hard-cse/article33937006.ece

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti termed the agreement a “big and welcome development”. “Dialogue is the only way forward if both countries want to stop the unending cycle of violence and bloodshed across the borders and J&K,” she said. ‘Sustainable peace’ NC president and Member of Parliament Farooq Abdullah said the measure would go a long way towards sustainable peace between the two countries. “The NC has always been a strong votary of India-Pakisan peace. It is the people of J&K that have been facing the brunt of escalating tensions alongside the borders. I hope the agreement is followed in letter and spirit. The development will allow people living alongside the LoC and the International Border to go about their normal lives with minimal disruption and risk,” he said. The former Chief Minister hoped the development would increase the possibility of some forward advancement towards the resolution of all impending issues between India and Pakistan. ‘Right step’ Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq termed the move “a step in the right direction”. “For the interest of mutually beneficial and sustainable peace in the entire region, India and Pakistan need to address the core concern of J&K in keeping with the aspirations of its people. We have always advocated it,” he said. Jammu Muslim Front (JMF) chairman Shuja Zaffar described the “silencing of guns on the border a tribute to humanity”. “Bloodshed of humanity is no solution. Dialogue is the only way forward. This is a big welcome development. This historical agreement will benefit people on both the sides of the border,” added Mr. Zaffar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nc-pdp-hurriyat-welcome-india-pakistan-ceasefire-deal/article33936993.ece

Mr. Nadda, who launched the campaign from the party office in Kolkata, said that along with the 30,000 boxes, there would be LED vans where people could give suggestions digitally. “The BJP wants to work for the development of Bengal. Under the Lokkho sonar Bangla , we want suggestions from the people of the State on all kinds of issues,” he said. The party was seeking suggestions on how to give a push to industry, agriculture, health and religious tourism among other sectors. The aim of the campaign was to take the State on the path of development, free of corruption. ‘Parivartan yatras’ The campaign is another attempt by the BJP to connect to the masses. Prior to this, the party started five “parivartan yatras” across the State. During the past several public meetings, the BJP leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had emphasised on the slogan Sonar Bangla .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-expands-sonar-bangla-drive/article33937015.ece
26 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,||Congress govt. in U.T. failed to work with the Centre: Modi||Days after the V. Narayanasamy government fell in Puducherry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that it had failed to cooperate with the Centre in implementing schemes and in funds utilisation. At a public meeting held here, he said that while people voted for the Congress in 2016 with hopes and aspirations, the party leaders tried to please the high command. “I came here three years ago. Now, I could see more happiness among the people because of two reasons. One is due to the development works I inaugurated this morning... The second is the removal of the Congress government,” he said. ‘Cong. spreads lies’ Citing the video of a wrong translation made by Mr. Narayanasamy during Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s recent visit, Mr. Modi said that instead of telling the truth, “he lied to his own leader and the nation”. (Mr. Narayanasamy had subsequently said he had indeed visited the region where the woman complained of lack of attention). “It is in the culture of the Congress to spread lies,” the Prime Minister said. Mr. Modi was confident of the NDA forming a government in the Union Territory after the Assembly election. “Such a government will be people’s government and the high command will be the people. I want to see the UT [the Union Territory] become the BEST [business hub, education hub, spiritual hub and tourism hub].” The NDA government would focus on the coastal development and revive the cooperative sector to enhance the lot of women, he said. Mr. Modi said the Congress had bagged “several medals in spreading lies”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-govt-in-ut-failed-to-work-with-the-centre-modi/article33937617.ece
26 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||LJD-JD(S) merger plan fizzles out||The Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) has backed out from a proposed merger with the Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] in the State, citing the latter’s “wavering political stance.” LJD State general secretary Shaik P. Harriz spelt out the party’s position here on Thursday, shortly after JD(S) MLA and Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty claimed in Palakkad that the decks for the merger were cleared after JD(S) president H.D. Deve Gowda approved the alliance. The LJD’s withdrawal from the merger talks has come against the backdrop of reports of Mr. Gowda warming up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Lack of clarity “There existed a lack of clarity regarding their political position. He (Mr. Gowda) says one thing and does its opposite. The onus is on the JD(S) to clarify its stance regarding the possibility of an alliance with the BJP. They cannot toe contrasting political lines. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala has always battled political fascism and has been fighting the BJP tooth and nail,” Mr. Harriz said, while adding that the decision to suspend merger talks was taken at the LJD’s State committee meeting that was held in Thrissur. Pointing out that the LJD has not entirely closed the door on an alliance with the JD(S), he ruled out the possibility of a merger before the upcoming Assembly polls. He said that many workers of the JD(S) in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Idukki had already joined the LJD with many more in Kozhikode and Wayanad set to follow suit in the coming days. Incidentally, Mr. Harriz’s press conference was held at the JD(S) district committee office that, he claimed, was possessed by the party faction that merged with the LJD few days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ljd-jds-merger-plan-fizzles-out/article33937267.ece
26 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Poet Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri dead||Eminent poet and academic Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri, whose verses reflected a serene blend of tradition and modernity, passed away here on Thursday. He was 81. Noted for the depth of his scholarship in the literature and philosophy of India and the West, Namboothiri was highly respected as a teacher and orator and represented the finest traditions of contemporary Malayalam poetry. For some time now, the poet had been confined to Sreevalli, his home on a narrow bylane at Thycaud in Thiruvananthapuram city, owing to failing health. The end came at his residence on Thursday afternoon. As an insightful poet who enriched Malayalam poetry, Namboothiri was noted for his progressive and philosophical convictions, which, at the same time, were deeply rooted in the Indian ethos. In this, he stood apart from his contemporaries. Important works His important poetical works include Swathantryathe Kurichoru Geetham , Pranaya Geethangal , India Enna Vikaram , Ujjayiniyile Raappakalukal , Aranyakam , Parikramam , Aparajitha , Bhoomigeethangal , and Mukhamevide . Other works include Asaahitheeyam , Kavithayude DNA , and Alakadalum Neyyambalukalum , Rithu Samharam , and Kuttikalude Shakespeare . Born at Iringolil, Thiruvalla, on June 2, 1939, Namboothiri taught English at government colleges in Kozhikode, Pattambi, Kollam, Ernakulam, Thripunithura, Chittur, and Thalassery before retiring from service as head of the department at University College, Thiruvananthapuram. A recipient of the coveted literary prizes in Malayalam literature, including the Odakuzhal Award, Vallathol Prize, Vayalar Award, and the Ezhuthachchan Puraskaram, Namboothiri also received the Kerala Sahithya Akademi Award in 1979 for Bhoomigeethangal and the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1994 for Ujjayiniyile Raappakalukal . The nation honoured him with the Padma Shri in 2014. He leaves behind wife Savitri Antharjanam and daughters Aditi and Aparna. The cremation will be held on Friday.

26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fix reasonable fee for MBBS course: SC to Kerala panel||The Supreme Court on Thursday spelt relief for students and private self-financing medical colleges alike in Kerala by directing the State’s Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee to consult with college managements and fix a “non-exploitative and reasonable” fee from 2017-18 onwards for MBBS studies. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao asked the committee to complete the exercise in three months. “The committee shall re-examine the proposals of the managements of medical colleges for the fixation of fee 2017-18 onwards,” the court ordered. 3 rounds of litigation The judgment is based on appeals stemming from over three rounds of litigation involving the State, the managements of private colleges and students in the High Court. The apex court, in its judgment, cleared the air by confirming the wisdom of a February 28, 2019 judgment of the High Court. In 2019, the High Court asked the committee to “closely scrutinise the fee suggested by the managements to examine if the fee proposed was not excessive and to eliminate any element of profiteering or collection of capitation fee”. The managements were directed to cooperate with the committee in the matter of fixation of fee. Justice Rao took a leaf from the 2019 decision by choosing to not delve into the merits of the fee structure of any individual college, but simply conforming to the principles of fee fixation laid down in the 2017 Act. “Unaided professional institutions have the autonomy to decide on the fee to be charged, subject to the fee not resulting in profiteering or collection of capitation fee. Regulation of fee is within the domain of the committee which shall ensure that the fee is non-exploitative and reasonable,” he explained. Lack of clarity The apex court agreed with the High Court that lack of clarity over the fee structure for MBBS in private aided and unaided colleges was beneficial neither for the institutions nor the students. “Therefore, we direct the committee to expeditiously reconsider the proposals of the private self-financing colleges for fee fixation from 2017-18 onwards. Needless to mention that fee for earlier years also needs to be finalised in case it has not been done in respect of any college,” the judgment said. The top court stated that the committee could direct the college managements for information necessary to arrive at a decision that the fee proposed by the managements was “neither excessive nor exploitative in nature”. Justice Rao said, “A reasonable opportunity should be given to the managements of private self-financing colleges in respect of their proposals for fee fixation. The entire exercise shall be completed within a period of three months from today.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fix-reasonable-fee-for-mbbs-course-sc-to-kerala-panel/article33936978.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC plans exclusive courts for cheque cases||The Supreme Court on Thursday considered the creation of additional courts to exclusively hear and decide cheque bounce cases. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde said the apex court, even if additional courts were set up by the government, would still have to streamline the procedure for the conduct of these cases. The Bench was hearing a suo motu case registered last year to evolve a “concerted” and “coordinated” mechanism for expeditious disposal of cheque cases.  35 lakh pending cases The court had found that over 35 lakh cheque bounce cases were pending in various courts across the country. It had appointed senior advocate Siddharth Luthra and advocate K. Parameshwar as amici curiae in the suo motu case. It had sought responses from the Centre and other stakeholders, including the Reserve Bank of India. The issue of prolonged litigation regarding dishonoured cheques came to the court’s notice when it was hearing a case dating back to 2005. “A recent study of the pending cases, reflects pendency of more than 35 lakh, which constitutes more than 15 percent of the total criminal cases pending in district courts. Further, there is a steady increase in the docket burden,” the court said in its order in March 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-plans-exclusive-courts-for-cheque-cases/article33937007.ece

26 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Rid country of social evils, says Venkaiah||Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday emphasised the need for an India that is ‘free from social evils like casteism and corruption’ and ‘takes pride in its rich cultural and spiritual heritage.’ The youth should strive to build a stronger, happier, and prosperous India, Mr. Naidu said while delivering the first P. Parameswaran memorial lecture organised by the Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram here. India’s intellectual tradition in the cultural and civilisational contexts had survived over 5,000 years, and this tradition, interwoven with India’s social texture, helped sustain India’s fundamental unity despite diversities, he said. Paying rich tributes to Parameswaran, Mr. Naidu called him a ‘Tapasvi’ and humanist par excellence and said his life inspired others to place the nation above everything. He revived the tradition of observing Ramayana month in Kerala and through his writings and speeches could change the tenor of intellectual discourse in Kerala. In modern times, Advaita was made an inspiration both in intellectual and social reformation strata by Sree Narayana Guru. “But for Guru, Kerala would have drowned in the darkness of social and intellectual decline,” he said. Epics’ impact Referring to the epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, as the fountainhead of Hindu thought and philosophy, Mr. Naidu said the religious and cultural life of India and much of Asia had been deeply influenced by them. In India there should be no discrimination on the basis of the gender, religion, or region. Every language, every human being, had to be respected. “The age-old concept of share and care should be adhered to. It is the core of Indian philosophy. We are surviving because of this philosophy passed on by our forefathers,” he said. Governor’s view Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said Parameswaran was a seer who gave the world valuable insights into social, religious and cultural aspects of human lives, through his writings and oratory. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan also spoke. Ahead of the lecture, the Vice President asked the organisers to switch off the air conditioning and open the windows. The country should learn lessons from COVID-19 and we should ‘live as much as possible in sun and normal air.’ Mr. Naidu urged planners and architects to ensure enough light and air circulation in buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rid-country-of-social-evils-says-venkaiah/article33936969.ece
26 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Prime accused in quarry blast case held||The Chickballapur police arrested the prime accused in the quarry blast case — G.S. Nagaraja, a partner in Shirdi Sai Aggregates and Bhramara Vasini M-Sanders — late on Wednesday. Mr. Nagaraja, a BJP leader from Gudibande, had been absconding since six people were killed in the explosion near the quarry on Tuesday. He was arrested from Hosur, Tamil Nadu, sources said. Mr. Nagaraja popularly known as BJP Nagaraja, was recently appointed as a member of the advisory board of Southern Railway. Following a police raid and seizure of a vehicle from the quarry area on Monday, Mr. Nagaraja allegedly instructed his employees to dispose of the illegally procured and stored explosives, while doing which the explosion occurred, according to sources. With this, the total number of arrests in the case have gone up to six, including all the partners in the quarry and crusher unit. One of the partners, Ismail, died two months ago, sources said. The Chickballapur police have also detained one Ganesh from Hosur, who regularly carried out explosions at the quarry but allegedly was not involved in the Tuesday night’s incident, for interrogation. A team from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) now tasked with the probe into the case, visited the spot on Thursday and took over the case. Meanwhile, the local police have come under severe criticism from local villagers as even three days after the blast, charred body parts of those who died in the accident are still found lying around, offering a very disturbing sight. “The police have not even combed the area properly and collected all the remains. That was the bare respect to be given to the dead,” said activist Ravi Krishna Reddy, who visited the spot on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prime-accused-in-quarry-blast-case-held/article33936964.ece

A day ago, the Union Cabinet approved a proposal by the Ministry to dissolve the Assembly and impose President’s Rule in the Union Territory. The notification said President Ram Nath Kovind had received a report from the administrator of the Union Territory on February 22 and “after considering the report and other information”, the President was “satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the Union Territory of Puducherry cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 (20 of 1963)”. The notification issued by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said, “the Legislative Assembly of the said Union Territory is hereby placed under suspended animation.” Union Territories are administered in accordance with the provisions of Article 239 to 241 of the Constitution, and according to the Allocation of Business Rules, 1961, certain subjects pertaining to Union Territories, namely Legislative matters, Finance and Budget and Services, have been allocated to the Home Ministry.

26 February 2021||New Delhi,||Same-sex marriages will cause havoc: govt.||The Centre on Thursday opposed any changes to the existing laws on marriage to recognise same-sex marriages, saying such interference would cause “a complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country”. “Living together as partners and having sexual relationship by same-sex individuals is not comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children which necessarily presuppose a biological man as a ‘husband’, a biological woman as a ‘wife’ and the children born out of the union between the two,” the Centre argued in the Delhi High Court. It said the 2018 landmark judgment of the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual sex in India was “neither intended to, nor did it in fact, legitimize the human conduct in question”. In an affidavit filed in response to petitions seeking to recognise same-sex marriage, the Central government said, “despite the decriminalisation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the petitioners cannot claim a fundamental right for same-sex marriage being recognised under the laws of the country”. The Centre submitted that “registration of marriage of same-sex persons also results in violation of existing personal as well as codified law provisions — such as ‘degrees of prohibited relationship’; ‘conditions of marriage’; ‘ceremonial and ritual requirements’ under the personal laws governing the individuals”. “Any other interpretation except treating ‘husband’ as a biological man and ‘wife’ as a biological woman will make all statutory provisions unworkable,” the government cautioned. The High Court has listed the petitions for hearing on April 20.

Justice H.P. Sandesh said that whether transactions were for other private purposes related to music business of Mr. Gagan Baderia or not had to be established in a full-fledged trial as “there is a direct evidence with regard to transfer of money to the tune of Rs. 20 lakh in Rs. 10 lakh each through cheques”. Mr. Gagan, a music director, has been arraigned as an accused in the case of illegal mining and illegal export of ore by M/s Janthakal Mining Company Ltd owned by one Vinod Kumar Goel, who is the main accused along with Mr. Gangaram Baderia in the case. The charge sheet filed by Special Investigation Team of Lokayukta had alleged that Rs. 20 lakh was paid to Mr. Ganga Baderia from the cheques of M/s 21st Century Wire Rods Ltd., of which Mr. Vinod Kumar Goel and his son Gaurav Goel were directors. The money transaction had allegedly occurred days before Mr. Gangaram Baderia cleared files of M/s Janthakal Mining Co. Ltd. On Mr. Gagan’s contention that proceedings against him cannot be continued as the government has not granted sanction for prosecution of his father, the court said that cannot be ground to quash criminal case against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/illegal-mining-hc-declines-to-quash-case-against-ex-officials-son/article33937184.ece
26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||INCOIS to go for aerial mapping of ocean floor||The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) is planning to take the help of the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) for airline mapping of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshwadeep to get a better picture of the ocean floor, also called ‘bathymetric’ study. “NRSC has already done a similar high resolution topographic Airborne Laser Terrain Mapping (ALTM) for entire coastal areas of the country and we are in the process of integrating the data for a 3D multi-hazard mapping of both the east and west coastline for a more precise picture of the ocean floor,” said director T. Srinivasa Kumar, in an exclusive interaction. Such a study has become imperative in view of the recent tsunamis of the Indonesian coasts where more than the quake related high waves, damage was due to landslides that had under the sea beds causing sudden wave surge leading to much damage without giving sufficient time to alert people, he pointed out. The research institute, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, had also identified ‘gaps’ across the coast of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha for installing more tide gauges for better monitoring of the sea and more accurate prediction of impending disasters like cyclones. This is in addition to the 36 already floating on the Bay of Bengal, informed senior scientist E. Pattabhi Rama Rao. In the meantime, INCOIS scientists in association with their counterparts in the Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) and an United States independent scientific agency, Massachusetts-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), have been mining the data recorded by a unique ‘Flux Buoy’ retrieved from the Bay of Bengal off the Kolkota coast, a few months ago. The buoy was dropped off into the sea to monitor the temperatures, pressures, salinity, radiation and geo-chemical changes at various depths in a high resolution scale, compared to other buoys in the seas. “It was ‘installed’ on the far seas in May 2019 and was supposed to have been retrieved in May 2020 but due to lockdown and restricted overseas travel conditions, the US scientists could not come, so we took it out in October,” explained Mr. Rao, also group head of ocean observations and data management group. “It will take months before we are able to decipher the information logged on the buoy and efforts are on to simultaneously unravel the data online at NIOT, here and the WHOI,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/incois-to-go-for-aerial-mapping-of-ocean-floor/article33937545.ece

Even though every State had the freedom to bring in its own regulations in travel, it cannot be against the general guidelines. All States should be willing to follow the general guidelines issued by the State regarding inter-State travel after the lockdown was lifted, or else the public would be put to a lot of difficulties, he pointed out. There was no justification for Karnataka’s action in preventing travellers into the State from Kerala and it was hoped that the Centre would take a positive approach on the issue. He pointed out that when compared to the previous week, the number of COVID-19 patients had gone up in the country this week by 31%. Disease transmission is rising in 16 States, with the weekly increase going over 10% in five States. However, in Kerala, new cases were showing a steady downward trend and the active case pool was dropping steadily, Mr. Vijayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/travel-curbs-pinarayi-seeks-pms-intervention/article33937268.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Government to monitor OTT content||This self-regulatory body also has “censuring” powers in case of any incriminating content. At the third tier, the government has equipped itself with overriding powers in the form of “oversight mechanism”. An inter-ministerial committee will perform this function and it will largely have the same powers as the collective self regulatory body of the OTTs. Both Ministers also clarified that no new law has been framed. And the government already has power to step in, in case of an emergency under the existing law. Mr. Javadekar said that the structure has been created to facilitate “soft touch regulation”. There have been widespread concerns about digital content, especially on OTT platforms, Mr. Javadekar said, with 50 Parliament questions in the recently concluded first part of the Budget session dedicated to it. He said that multiple meetings had been held with OTT platforms before the framing of these guidelines. He said that despite the Ministry’s request, the OTT platforms had not come up with a satisfactory self-regulatory mechanism. “There is a Censor Board for films, but OTT platforms have no such mechanism. For OTT platforms, we have decided on a 3-tier system,” Mr. Javadekar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/government-to-monitor-ott-content/article33936961.ece

As per the inscription which was deciphered by scholars, Krishnadevaraya, one of the greatest emperors of India who ruled from the South, died on October 17, 1529, Sunday, and incidentally this day was marked by lunar eclipse. K. Munirathnam, Director, Epigraphy Branch of the Archaeological Survey of India, Mysuru, said their office received a photograph of the inscription from K.R. Narasimhan, a retired professor who stays in Yelahanka, Bengaluru. On deciphering, it turned out to be an inscription recording the date of death of Krishnadevaraya, he added. The inscription is engraved on a slab kept on the north side of Gopalakrishna temple at Honnenahalli in Tumakuru district and is written in Kannada language and characters, said Prof. Narasimhan. It records the demise of Kṛishṇadēvarāya _(Vīrakṛishṇarāya mahārāyalu yī tathā tithiyalu astamayarāgalu)_ in Śaka 1451, Virōdhi, śu. 15, lunar eclipse, which corresponds to 1529 AD, October 17, Sunday, according to Prof. Munirathnam. The inscription also registers the gift of the village Honnenahalli, situated in Tumakuru, for conducting worship and providing offerings to the god Veeraprasanna Hanumantha of Tumakuru by Timmappanna Nayaka along with some officials and inhabitants of Tumakuru. Studying the new discovery with another inscription engraved on the north and west walls of the Kalakahstishvara temple at Sri Kalahasti in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, it has been concluded that King Achyutharaya got himself coronated on the fourth day after the death of Krishnadevaraya. The Kalahasti inscription refers to the date of Achyutaraya’s coronation as October 21, 1529 AD, according to Dr. Munirathnam and Prof. Narasimhan. Prof. Narasimhan said one of his friends M. Dhanpal, a BMTC driver and an archaeology buff, drew his attention to the inscription by sending him the photographs. “Dhanpal has a tendency to scour the places he visits for archaeological remains and stones and shares the details with me,” said Prof. Narasimhan. “On receiving the photo and studying it, I informed Dhanpal that this inscription refers to Krishnadevaraya,” he added. Normally, the death of kings were not recorded in the inscriptions and this was one of those rare records, Prof. Narasimhan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inscription-recording-krishnadevarayas-date-of-death-discovered/article33937180.ece

Appealing the Secretary of State’s decision in the High Court is only possible with the High Court's permission. Notice of application for approval to appeal has to be sought within 14 days of extradition, or discharge, ordered by the Secretary of State. “Unless there is an appeal, a requested person must be extradited within 28 days of the Secretary of State’s decision to order extradition (subject to any appeal),” according to the UK's official website. In its order, the Westminster Magistrates Court held that there were sufficient grounds warranting Mr. Nirav Modi's trial in India. It also accepted the evidence put forth by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate that he had conspired to destroy the proof against him and intimidate witnesses. It was alleged that he forcibly kept his employees, some of who were dummy directors in the firms floated by him, in illegal custody in Cairo and got their mobile phones destroyed in Dubai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-nod-for-nirav-modis-extradition/article33936976.ece

Think-tanks and experts welcomed the new “well-intended” rules, stating that these bring clarity on responsibilities of intermediaries. However, they added that in the current form, these guidelines could undermine the principles of open and accessible Internet and violate the right to privacy and free speech of users, particularly in the absence of robust data protection law. They noted that these could also lead to an erosion of the ‘safe harbour’ protection given to intermediaries under Section 79 of the IT Act. On receiving a court order or being notified by the appropriate government agency, an intermediary will need to remove or disable access to information any unlawful information “as early as possible, but in no case later than 36 hours”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stricter-rules-for-social-media-platforms/article33936979.ece

We have always maintained that we are committed to addressing issues, if any, in a peaceful bilateral manner,” said Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, when asked about the timing of the agreement that follows days after India and China announced a disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “On key issues, our position remains unchanged,” he added. Pakistan’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs Moeed Yusuf called the agreement a “win” for Pakistan. He said the agreement followed “efforts behind the scenes”. In a tweet, he denied that the talks were the result of “back-channel diplomacy” between him and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and had resulted from the “direct channel” between the DGMOs. “Do you think this could happen without efforts or without pressure, something which India has not agreed to all these months and years?” Mr. Yusuf told journalists in response to questions about the agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-pakistan-agree-to-observe-2003-ceasefire/article33936981.ece
26 February 2021||LUCKNOW,||Tandav case: HC rejects anticipatory bail plea||The Allahabad High Court on Thursday refused to grant anticipatory bail to Aparna Purohit, head of Indian Originals, Amazon Prime, in the ongoing investigation in the cases lodged against the makers of the web series Tandav.  While rejecting her plea, the court stated that while western filmmakers had refrained from ridiculing Jesus or the Prophet, Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and are still doing this most unabashedly with Hindu gods and goddesses. ‘Taking advantage’ “Things are worsening as is evident from the fact that an obscure stand-up comedian, Munawar Faruqui, from Gujarat made comments on Hindu god and goddesses in a New Year show at Indore and gained undue publicity on being arrested in a case. This shows that from films this trend has passed to comedy shows,” Justice Siddharth said. “Such people make the revered figures of religion of a majority community a source of earning money in the most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of country,” the court said. Senior counsel for the applicant said the web series was a work of fiction. The cast and crew of the web series had also issued an unconditional apology. The court said, “There appears to be a design behind such acts on the part of the people who just give a disclaimer in all the films and depict things in movies which are really religiously, socially and communally offensive in nature.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tandav-case-hc-rejects-anticipatory-bail-plea/article33936989.ece

26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||I-T searches on premises of Haryana Independent MLA||The Income Tax Department on Thursday conducted searches on the premises of an independent MLA, Balraj Kundu, from Meham in Haryana and several other places in connection with suspected tax evasion, according to an agency official. Mr. Kundu has extended support to the farmers’ protest against the three farm laws and had also protested against the related agri “reform” ordinances brought by the Centre last year. The searches were carried out at his Rohtak residence and multiple other locations in Gurugram.  Suspected tax evasion The Income Tax Department released a statement in the late evening stating that the searches were in the case involving a Gurugram-based real estate company, its promoters, directors and other group companies, covering 20 premises. The company is in the business of government contracts specialising in the construction of roads, highways, bridges and runways. It also is into real estate development and residential complexes. “The search has yielded evidence of bogus long-term capital gain of Rs. 25 crore in the names of the main promoter and family members in 2012-13 and 2013-14, on which no tax has been paid. The search has also establi-shed that bogus expenses in the form of sub-contracts to the tune of Rs. 100 crore have been claimed by the group, to reduce its taxable income,” said the department. According to the agency, the parties in whose names such expenses were booked were unaware of the transactions. “This amount of Rs. 100 crore has been routed back to the group companies as share capital and share premium,” it said, adding that documents related to “benami” assets were seized during the searches. Foreign currency worth $14,000 and Rs. 1 crore in cash were also found. Mr. Kundu had withdrawn his support to the Manohar Lal Khattar government about a year ago alleging inaction against corruption. He had alleged corruption in the operations of sugar mills in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-t-searches-on-premises-of-haryana-independent-mla/article33937352.ece

Some of the 2,400 students of Corporation schools are likely to get free coaching for getting admission to IITs and other institutes of higher education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/free-neet-coaching-started-for-students-of-corpn-schools/article33937586.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Despite rapid urbanisation, key projects remain incomplete||Located in the west of the city, Maduravoyal constituency is considered a gateway to the State capital. Though the constituency underwent rapid development in the past few years in terms of urbanisation, several pending issues have remained unchanged for over a decade now. Unlike its name that means ‘charming entrance’, not everything is pleasant about the constituency. Those who enter the city cannot miss the half-constructed pillars on Poonamallee High Road, which are part of the unfinished elevated corridor between Maduravoyal and Chennai Port, a project which has been stalled for over a decade. Maduravoyal is home to a large number of labourers due to its proximity to industrial areas and Koyambedu. Once a part of the Villivakkam Assembly segment, the constituency now has fast developing areas such as Nolambur, Valasaravakkam, Nerkundram and Ramapuram merged with the city and also a few panchayats, including Vanagaram, Ayapakkam and Adayalampattu. Though some of the basic amenities were improved, a few major civic issues have remained unaddressed for many years now, residents noted. Protection of the Maduravoyal and Porur lakes, replacing causeways across Cooum river with bridges and its restoration and the construction of a flyover near DLF to reduce traffic congestion are some of the most common demands of the residents. Second flyover G. Natarajan, president of the Mangala Nagar, Porur, Residents’ Welfare Association, said traffic congestion continued despite the use of the Porur flyover. Another structure needs to be built near DLF and linked to the existing one. Restoration of the Porur lake had been left unfinished due to a lack of proper desilting, fencing and strengthening of bunds, Mr. Natarajan added. Residents are still awaiting the completion of an underground drainage network. C. Thirumal Adimai, secretary, Federation of Maduravoyal Residents’ Welfare Associations, said, “Better coordination between Metrowater and the Corporation will help.” The constituency is still home to cultivation in some pockets, including near the Vanagaram tollgate and Karambakkam. Social activist V. Pugalventhan said the desilting of ponds would help cultivation and groundwater recharge. The sewer network scheme in Karambakkam has remained unfinished for a few years now. “Infrastructure in schools and anganwadis need to be improved. The Chettiyaragaram middle school must be upgraded as children otherwise travel to Porur or Poonamallee. We also need upgraded primary health centres in Chettiyaragaram and Maduravoyal. We need more camera surveillance in places like Thandalam to prevent crimes,” he said.  Land ownership Former Maduravoyal MLA G. Beem Rao recalled that some of the demands he had raised in the Assembly remained pending. The demand for pattas for needy people in and around Porur and Alapakkam had not been addressed. Land must be given at market rates to about 22,000 families residing on temple lands at Porur and nearby areas, he said. “I had introduced several small buses in Mogappair and Nerkundram in 2013. But they were stopped in 2016. Upgradation of Ayapakkam panchayat to a municipality, a government arts and science college and increased patrolling to prevent crime are other demands,” Mr. Rao said. Besides converting overhead electricity cables to underground ones, residents of Nolambur demanded that causeways be replaced with bridges across the Cooum to prevent the release of sewage by tankers. S. Swaminathan, secretary, JAMBA United Welfare Association, wanted the work to upgrade the Mogapair West bus terminus to be accelerated and bus routes to be operated. However, sitting MLA and Minister for Rural Industries P. Benjamin noted that projects worth Rs. 1,000 crore had been executed through the Greater Chennai Corporation in the constituency. “Nearly 2,589 beneficiaries were recently given free patta documents. Porur now has a government hospital at a cost of Rs. 11.73 crore. Several waterbodies, including those in Ramapuram and Chettiyaragaram, have been desilted. The sewer network in Karambakkam will be completed soon,” he said. Measures were afoot to further improve Porur lake and also replace the causeway at Nolambur. The proposal to construct a flyover near DLF was under scrutiny, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/despite-rapid-urbanisation-key-projects-remain-incomplete/article33937593.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘All pass’ announcement takes teachers, students by surprise||The sudden announcement by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami that students of Classes 9, 10 and 11 [State board] have been declared “promoted” without any examinations this academic year has taken teachers and students by surprise in Tamil Nadu. Only a week ago, School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan said Class 10 board exam dates would be announced soon. In all State board schools, nominal rolls of students writing the Class 10, 11 and 12 public exams were prepared once schools reopened. Even the exam fees were collected. Unnecessary decision “Schools reopened [for physical classes] only a month ago and this sudden announcement is sure to impact the learning and seriousness of the students towards academics. We feel this decision was unnecessary. We are going to meet Education Department officials to allow us to conduct at least school-level model exams,” said K.R. Nandhakumar, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Matriculation, Higher Secondary and CBSE Schools Association. While guidelines on how marks will be awarded are expected from the School Education Department, there are concerns in government schools on how this will apply to them. Private schools, since June 2020, have been proceeding with the academic year through online classes and many schools have been conducting regular assessments for the students as well. “A majority of government schools, especially those in rural areas have not been able to conduct online classes, let alone any form of evaluation. For students who are opting to shift to polytechnic or ITI courses after Class 10, a marks certificate is extremely important. We are waiting to see how the department will address these concerns,” said Patric Raymond, secretary, Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers’ Federation. Mr. Patric emphasised the need to at least conduct school-level exams. “Cancelling exams for Classes 9 and 11 would have been okay given that this has no bearing on their subsequent admissions. But Class 10 students having no boards will raise concerns. Students shifting to another State might face challenges with admissions. The option of conducting exams with limited portions for students of Class 10 could have been explored,” felt N. Vijayan, correspondent, Zion Matriculation School. Most schools, however, want classes to continue on campus for Classes 9,10 and 11. “It is only now that students have returned and are able to concentrate to some extent. If classes stop for them, it will be a challenging transition into the next academic year,” a teacher said. The need for a clear academic calendar or schedule has been a pressing demand over the last six months, especially with regard to classes that were supposed to take up the board exams. Following the latest announcement, there is a need for schools to know now more than ever as to how to proceed with the syllabus over the next two months. Teachers in government schools will also become busy from March as they have to be involved in Assembly poll-related work. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association, in a statement, welcomed the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-pass-takes-teachers-and-students-by-surprise/article33937126.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Red Hills reservoir to turn into a tourist spot||The Water Resources Department (WRD) has proposed to develop the Red Hills lake as a tourist attraction and recently submitted a proposal to the Tiruvallur district administration. In a bid to encourage community participation in lake conservation, the WRD has initiated efforts to create a green belt on the 30 acre vacant site around the lake’s boundary and protect it from encroachments. Built in 1876, the Red Hills reservoir is one of the five major waterbodies meeting the drinking water requirements of Chennai. Of the 830 million litres a day supplied as drinking water to the city, the Red Hills reservoir contributes nearly 270 mld. It is now brimming with water as the lake has storage of 3,182 million cubic feet, which is nearly 96.4% of its capacity. WRD officials said about 400 saplings were planted recently on the lake’s boundary along G.N.T. Road. “We wanted to secure the 30 acre site that is now free of encroachments and increase the green cover and create a recreational space around the waterbody. We have submitted a proposal and design to develop the lake as a tourist spot on the lines of the Poondi reservoir,” said an official. The WRD has proposed to create a park with children’s play area and a pond on the lake’s periphery along G.N.T. Road. Officials of the Tiruvallur district administration have assured the WRD that steps would be taken to develop the lake into a tourist attraction, the official added. V. Irulandi, former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and member of Rotary Club of Alandur, said: “We target to plant up to 1,000 saplings on the site around the lake. We recently planted 12 varieties of native species, including neem, Iluppai, Magizham, Vengai and Indian gooseberry.”   The WRD is awaiting funds from the Tiruvallur district administration to develop the green space around the waterbody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/red-hills-reservoir-to-turn-into-a-tourist-spot/article33937832.ece
26 February 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Act against those who tried to prevent woman police officer from filing complaint’||A day after Special DGP Rajesh Das was put on compulsory wait following a complaint of sexual harassment from a woman IPS officer, a group of IPS officers said on Thursday that Chengalpattu Superintendent of Police D. Kannan had prevented and criminally intimidated her while she was going to the headquarters. On Wednesday, the government also constituted a committee under IAS officer Jayashree Raghunandan to probe the allegation. ‘Vehicle intercepted’ One of the IPS officers said, “When the victim wanted to complain to the head of the police force and the Home Secretary, a District Superintendent of Police, at the direction of Mr. Rajesh Das, his superior officer, intercepted her vehicle and stopped it, with the striking force in tow, and forced her to talk to her abuser. Is this the way a DSP acts? He can do or would have done many things in favour of the accused. What action will be taken against this person?” Sources said the woman officer, of the rank of SP, was proceeding to Chennai to lodge a complaint with the Home Secretary against Mr. Rajesh Das. At a toll plaza, Mr. Kannan intercepted her official vehicle with his striking force. Further, the sources said, he directed striking force personnel to remove the keys of her car. He then told the woman officer that she should not file a complaint against Mr. Rajesh Das. When she refused, Mr. Kannan insisted that she talk to Mr. Rajesh Das on the phone before proceeding further. At that point, according to police sources, she warned Mr. Kannan that she would record this incident, too, as he attempted to threaten her on behalf of Mr. Rajesh Das. Then, he handed over the vehicle key and withdrew. Mr. Rajesh Das had also reportedly asked the Superintendents of Police of Kallakurichi and Villupuram districts to stop her while she was proceeding to Chennai. But the sources clarified that both officers refused to obey this instruction. The IPS officers said the committee, which was formed to go into the complaint, should also probe the role of Mr. Kannan. “If we are going to be silent about such atrocious behaviour of men in khaki, every one will suffer. Service and institutions don’t end with our career or in our lifetime. Our future generations should have a safe, secure and protected environment,” another officer said. Another officer added, “The victim has displayed dignity and exemplary courage, and the more we get to know about the horror she endured the more disgusted we are. Everyone who aided and abetted this must be exposed and punished.” The IPS officers also appealed to the Tamil Nadu IPS Officers Association to recommend the suspension of Mr. Kannan. In a statement, the association said it “stands in solidarity against any harassment at workplace. We request the inquiry committee to do justice by a free, fair and expeditious inquiry with sensitivity involved.”  DSP denies charge Responding to the allegation, Mr. Kannan told The Hindu that the district police had indeed stopped the vehicle of the woman officer at a toll plaza. “You should also ask her what had happened. In what way am I connected with her? My boss called me up and said she was on the way and issued instructions to stop her vehicle and hand my phone over to her. I did as I was asked to and merely told her that sir [Mr. Rajesh Das] wanted to speak to her. She sat in the car and talked to him on the phone. How do I know that there was bad blood between them?” He also denied that he had removed the key from her vehicle. “What was the necessity for me to remove the key? She is an SP-level officer. Ask her if I came near her or talked to her beyond what I told you. I was not aware of the real issue between them. My only mistake was that I obeyed the orders of my officer.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/act-against-those-who-tried-to-prevent-woman-officer-from-filing-complaint/article33937599.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City commuters hit hard by bus strike||Despite the officials of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) promising to take adequate steps to maintain normal bus services on the day of the strike called by nine transport trade unions, residents in the city faced severe hardships on Thursday. Hundreds of commuters, particularly those in the southern and western suburbs, were affected because of the limited operation of buses in the morning hours. Adding to the woes of the commuters was the non-availability of alternative public transport. Commuters from the southern suburbs were the hardest hit because of the snapping of the overhead power cable in the morning hours between Pallavaram and Tambaram, causing complete stoppage of trains for a few hours. Also, the limited operation of train services announced by the Southern Railway on the Chennai Beach-Tambaram section for commissioning the third line resulted in hundreds of commuters getting stranded in different stations. Some were forced to take private vehicles to their offices. No option T. Arul Das, a resident of Perungalathur, said already Southern Railway had placed restrictions on the workmen special services during peak hours and added to that the operation of limited services left the residents with no option but to travel in private vehicles or commercial vehicles. He blamed the poor planning of the government for the hardships caused to the people. With the nine transport trade unions calling for a strike citing the non-conclusion of wage talks, transport employees, comprising mechanics, supervisors, drivers and conductors, stayed away. A senior MTC official said the strike call was illegal as wage talks were being held and Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar had also announced interim relief of Rs. 1,000 per month to all the employees. LPF senior trade union leader K. Natarajan said the trade unions were forced to call the strike because of the humiliation meted out to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-commuters-hit-hard-by-bus-strike/article33937596.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||St. Andrew’s Church on Poonamallee High Road celebrates 200 years of consecration||The St. Andrew’s Church (The Kirk in Scottish) on Poonamallee High Road completed 200 years of consecration on Thursday. A thanksgiving service was held at the church to celebrate the bicentenary milestone in the evening. A commemorative film that traced the 200-year journey of the church from design to execution and service to generations of city residents was released on the occasion. A commemorative book was also launched. Consecrated in 1821, St. Andrew’s Church is recognised as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. Isaac Johnson, Presbyter of St. Andrew’s Church (The Kirk), said the congregation of about 500 families in the church supported many ministries that made a difference to the lives of several marginalised people in the city. The church is an intrinsic part of the rich cultural and religious heritage of the city. When it was consecrated in February 1821, there was not much development then. Landmarks such as the Central and Egmore railway stations followed much later in 1873 and 1908 respectively. Designed and built by Major Thomas de Havilland with Colonel James Caldwell as chief engineer, the church is circular with a diameter of 81 ft and an inner circle of Corinthian columns that hold up a brick dome. The church stands on a masonry foundation of 150 brick and pottery wells on what was once the flood plains to the south Cooum. Dulip Thangasamy, secretary of the Kirk Session, highlighted the ministries taken up in the community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/st-andrews-church-on-poonamallee-high-road-celebrates-200-years-of-consecration/article33937584.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Transport unions to go on indefinite strike from today||Having called a strike on Thursday, the nine transport trade unions affiliated to Opposition parties have proposed to begin an indefinite strike, saying the government is yet to offer talks. Labour Progressive Federation senior leader K. Natarajan said, “The trade unions would go on an indefinite strike from tomorrow [Friday]...” ‘It is illegal’ Senior officials of the Transport Department said Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar had already announced an interim relief of Rs. 1,000 a month for all employees of the eight State Transport Undertakings (STUs) and had also assured them of continuous talks on a wage revision. Hence, the call for an indefinite strike was illegal, they said. A senior official of the Transport Department said more than 55% of the buses attached to the eight STUs were operated. He said only 15,000 to 16,000 buses were being operated because of the less than 50% occupancy mandated in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Thursday, around 8,500 buses were operated, and the occupancy rate was over 90%. He said: “The State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) operated more than 1,500 buses as we did not want long-distance passengers to suffer.” Chennai residents experienced severe hardship because of the restricted operation of buses (only 55%) and the non-availability of suburban trains on the Beach-Tambaram section due to a cable fault. But bus services were almost 70% in Coimbatore and Erode districts. The Transport Department was able to operate more than 40% of the buses in the districts around Tiruchi and Madurai. In the Madurai region, many commuters had a tough time as 50%-60% of the buses did not ply in the southern districts. Being a ‘muhurtham’ day, commuters could not travel from Madurai to Ramanathapuram in government buses. They were forced to take private buses, not many of which were available. In Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Dindigul and Virudhunagar districts, 50% of the buses did not ply. In Ramanathapuram, only 30% of the 450 buses operated until 11 a.m., according to CITU district secretary M. Sivaji. A senior transport official said in Tiruchi that at least 45% of the services were affected in the Tiruchi region, comprising Tiruchi, Perambalur and Ariyalur districts. In Thanjavur, commuters were forced to travel in heavily crowded buses. While the unions claimed that 70% of the buses did not run, officials said 50% of the regular services were operated. Employees, except those owing allegiance to the trade unions of the AIADMK, the PMK and the TMC, struck work. In the Coimbatore region, tourists going to and coming from the Nilgiris were affected as very few buses were operational. Many tourists trying to use the public transport to return home or go sight-seeing were forced to hire taxis or auto-rickshaws, a tourist said.  SETC operated more than 1,500 buses as we did not want long-distance passengers to suffer senior official Transport Department||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transport-unions-to-go-on-indefinite-strike-from-today/article33937114.ece
26 February 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Congress, DMK begin seat-sharing talks||Commencing preliminary seat-sharing talks with the DMK on Thursday, the Congress is learnt to have pitched for over 50 seats for the upcoming Assembly election. However, the senior partner is believed to have gently pointed to the poor strike rate of the Congress in the 2016 Assembly election, when it won just eight of the 41 allotted seats. The DMK also conveyed to the Congress delegation that it wanted to contest as many seats as possible to secure a comfortable victory. “We told them that a narrow victory may lead to anything in today’s political situation. We have witnessed the BJP’s game in Puducherry,” a DMK source said. However, the Congress is buoyed by the response its former president Rahul Gandhi drew during his two recent visits to Tamil Nadu. It has been working on identifying potentially strong constituencies from where it can contest. When Congress leaders explained Mr. Gandhi’s personal interest in Tamil Nadu, DMK leaders countered that no one was interested in witnessing what happened in Bihar and other States, where the Congress failed to register a big victory. Dinesh Gundu Rao, AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu, who was part of the Congress delegation, when contacted, said the party had sought a certain number of seats from the DMK, based on an assessment done in the last few months. ‘Fruitful meeting’ “We don’t want to go into the numbers. The meeting with DMK leaders was fruitful and friendly. We have sought a number of seats. Let us see,” he told The Hindu . The numbers will be finalised as talks progress. Another Congress leader said the party was asking for a higher number of seats as it did not want to be pushed into a corner to accept very few seats from the DMK. When asked if the Congress had a certain threshold to which it was willing to go down, a leader said they hoped it would not come down to such a scenario. “The alliance is quite strong and is in a position to win the poll. Things will be sorted out,” the leader said. The DMK team was represented by general secretary Duraimurugan, treasurer T.R. Baalu and women’s wing leader Kanimozhi. Apart from Mr. Rao, the Congress delegation comprised former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, AICC spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri and Congress floor leader in the Assembly K.R. Ramasamy. Mr. Duraimurugan said the general council meeting of the party to discuss the Assembly poll would be held on March 7.

26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Builders cannot escape RERA with invalid completion certificates: HC||Builders and real estate developers cannot escape from the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act of 2016 if they had obtained completion certificates without completing the project in all respects and without providing amenities, such as approach roads, water facilities, drainage connections and so on, as agreed between them and the purchasers, the Madras High Court has held. Justice S.M. Subramaniam held that “mere completion of structural building is insufficient to arrive a conclusion that it is a ‘completion’ within the meaning of the provisions of the RERA or under the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act of 1971… Even in common parlance, the word ‘completion’ would only mean substantial completion in accordance with the contract between the parties.” Second appeal The ruling was passed while dismissing a second appeal preferred by SARE Shelters Project Private Ltd. which had developed a housing project on 100 acres close to Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) at Thiruporur in Chengalpattu district. A resident welfare association of Phase I of the project had approached the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulation Authority in 2018, complaining about the absence of basic facilities. However, the Authority refused to entertain the complaint after the developer claimed that it was not an ongoing project to be covered under the RERA and that a completion certificate for Phase I of the project had been issued by the Executive Officer of the Thiruporur panchayat in 2014, much before RERA came into force on May 1, 2016. When the residents took the decision on appeal to the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, the latter overturned the Authority’s decision and hence, the present second appeal. Dismissing the appeal, Justice Subramaniam agreed with senior counsel R. Singaravelan, representing the residents, that the completion certificate issued by the Executive Officer of the town panchayat could not be considered a valid certificate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/builders-cannot-escape-rera-with-invalid-completion-certificates-hc/article33937765.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination will provide immunity against disease, say experts||Ever since the government introduced vaccines in the country mid-January, there have been severa concerns. What if there is a second surge? Will the government impose another lockdown? Are vaccines safe and efficacious? Will they really protect people from COVID-19? Three experts who participated in a panel discussion on Thursday dispelled the myths regarding the vaccines and put to rest fears and concerns about their efficacy. V. Ramasubramanian, an infectious diseases specialist and an adviser to the State government on the control of COVID-19, said the country had been protected, thanks to its young population. Only 6% of the population was over the age of 60 years. However, currently several States were seeing a rise in the number of cases again. The surge could be contained if people remained sensible and followed safety protocols, such as wearing masks, washing their hands and maintaining physical distancing, pointed out V. Ravi, retired professor of neuroviology from NIMHANS and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2, Karnataka. The human body builds immunity in two ways – from infection or through vaccination. If not vaccinated, the chance of catching the infection was always present, Dr. Ravi said. “For any respiratory pandemic there will be a second wave,” he explained. A surge can be contained only by aggressively testing, tracking, and contact tracing, he added. Despite the surge, why were even healthcare workers hesitant to take the vaccine? Saranya Narayan, chief microbiologist at Neuberg Diagnostics, which organised the panel discussion on ‘Variants and Vaccination’, said lack of information and awareness about the need for vaccination was the reason. She said only when healthcare workers in her own organisation were educated did they agree to be vaccinated. Now that several States were seeing a surge in cases, would the government consider another lockdown? Dr. Ramasubrmanian said lockdown was a draconian move, and may not be an option. The experts said partial lockdowns, night curfews and containment zones would continue to be enforced. Among the tests, RT-PCR was the international gold standard test, they said. As for the vaccines’ efficacy on variants, the experts said nearly half a dozen vaccines had been developed. Though they had been fast-tracked, the routine protocols had not been bypassed, Dr. Ravi said. The experts were agreed that there was no doubt that vaccination offered protection against the infection. Vaccines helped develop immunity. If the immune response is weak, the virus could replicate in the body. Vaccination would protect people with comorbidities too, they pointed out. “If you have a comorbidity, go ahead and take the vaccine. We are only worried about how effective the vaccine is, not the safety,” said Dr. Ramasubramanian. Dr. Ravi said trials on two vaccines for children aged 10 to 18 were under study, and the results were expected in early May.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-will-give-immunity-against-covid-19-say-experts/article33937591.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AMMK projects Dhinakaran as its Chief Minister candidate||The Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) on Thursday decided to project its general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran for the post of Chief Minster during the Assembly election. Pointing out that Mr. Dhinakaran had been functioning with the “blessings” of former interim general secretary of the AIADMK, V.K. Sasikala, a resolution, adopted at the inaugural meeting of the party’s general council held through video-conferencing, stated that the party would strive to work hard to make him the Chief Minister. The AIADMK will be “retrieved from the hold of the wrong persons who are working selfishly,” the motion added. Through another resolution, the party empowered the general secretary to take decisions with regard to stitching up an alliance and finalising seat-sharing arrangements with other parties. Alluding to the DMK, one of the motions said the party was “duty bound” to protect the State from the “gang of evil force”. The AMMK wanted the Centre to have petrol and diesel brought under the purview of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a solution to tackling the problem of increasing commodities’ prices. Totally, 14 resolutions were adopted at the meeting, which was attended by 2,359 of its 2,574 members. Later, the general secretary told reporters that “the AMMK-led front would be number one”. “It will be the one that prevents the DMK from returning to power. We will never compromise on our position,” he said. Citing the resignation of a DMK legislator in Puducherry, he held the DMK responsible for causing the fall of the Congress Ministry there. “Had the DMK been genuinely interested in the welfare of minorities, it would not have allowed the collapse of the Congress regime. Before casting their votes, the minorities should find out which party will safeguard their interests,” he said. As for forming an alliance, Mr. Dhinakaran said talks were on with several parties. “An alliance will definitely materialise,” he said.  In a release, Mr. Dhinakaran announced that application forms for ticket seekers for the Assembly election would be issued from March 3 to 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ammk-projects-dhinakaran-as-its-chief-minister-candidate/article33937115.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Veterinary college gets ‘Eat Right Campus’ tag||The Food Safety Department has begun certifying private institutions, including colleges and hospitals in the city that have in-house canteens, as “Eat Right Campuses”. Recently, the Madras Veterinary College Hostel and Apollo Hospitals, Greames Road, have been given such certification by the department based on the guidelines issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Veterinary college warden N. Kumaravelu said the process of certification began before the lockdown. “We had stopped using maida and providing junk food some two years ago. We had included traditional food, including sundal, in the diet. The Food Safety Department gave us tips, including not to use wooden cutting boards or layer shelves with newspapers since those attract pests. They suggested that we place a board in the mess showing how much food is wasted and after that the wastage has drastically reduced,” he said and added that college Dean K.N. Selvakumar sanctioned automation of the mess and fixing of meshes on the windows. “It has been a joint effort of students and staff that has helped us improve the mess,” he said. Designated Food Safety Officer for Chennai A. Ramakrishnan said the certification was being done as part of the Eat Right Chennai campaign. “Under this campaign, private companies, corporates, government offices, public sector undertakings, anganwadi centres and even prisons, where food is prepared and served to people, can be certified. We have four parameters based on which the campus is evaluated,” he said. These parameters include steps to ensure provision of healthy food, environmentally sustainable practices and creating awareness among individuals on the campus of the need to make the right food choices. Any campus that has chosen to be part of the programme first does self-assessment and a third-party audit by an FSSAI-empanelled agency.  We have four parameters based on which the campus is evaluated and certified  A.

26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||U. Ve. Sa., composer of Tamil keerthanas||The relatively lesser known face of U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer (U.Ve.Sa.), the grand old man of Tamil, has drawn the attention of Tamil scholars and musicians. He had composed keerthanas on Lord Muruga at Ilanthai Nagar in Sri Lanka and published them in 1891. Author and vocalist T.M. Krishna has set two of them to music and rendered it on the occasion of U.Ve.Sa.’s 166th birth anniversary on February 19. “The compositions are proof of U.Ve.Sa.’s knowledge of music. He had set them to particular ragas and I was able to tune them to music because of the spread of music in the words. They give a lot of scope for an elaborate rendition in a concert,” said Mr. Krishna, who has already sung the keethanas in ragas Suruti and Sahana . “I will soon render the other songs,” he said. The two songs have been released on YouTube with an introduction by historian A.R. Venkatachalapathy. Those who are familiar with his autobiography would know that U.Ve.Sa., born into a family of musicians, learnt music from Gopalakrishna Bharathiyar, the author of Nanda Charitram, when he was in Mayiladuthurai. But he quit learning music since his Tamil teacher Meenakshisundaram Pillai was against it. Writer Perumal Murugan, who has done an elaborate study of U.Ve.Sa.’s works, said the book containing the keerthanas was among his first to be printed. It was titled, Ilanthainagar Dhandapani Virutham.  On request The keerthanas were written on a request from Jaffna philanthropist Kumarasamy Chettiar, who had bought copies of Seevaka Chinthamani and distributed them in Jaffna. “After falling ill, he constructed a temple for Muruga at Ilanthai Nagar and requested U.Ve.Sa. to pen 10 viruthams on the main deity and a few more songs on the presiding deity,” said Mr. Perumal Murugan, who has written a detailed article on this — U.Ve.Sa. Thulangum Keerthanikal.  Kumarasamy Chettiar was particular that the songs should bear the name of the village. The songs cover various genres, including Oosal, Etcharikkai and Mangalam . The Etcharikkai song was set to raga Saveri by U.Ve.Sa. himself. The book was reprinted again in 1944 by U.Ve.Sa.’s son.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/u-ve-sa-composer-of-tamil-keerthanas/article33937602.ece

26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Coal import: PIL plea seeks probe by DRI, CVC, DVAC||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to file a counter affidavit within a week to a public interest litigation petition which sought a joint probe by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) into an alleged scam that had been taking place in the State over the years in import of coal for thermal power stations. Justices R. Subbiah and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup issued the direction on the PIL petition filed by C. Selvaraj, 70, a retired Assistant Engineer of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) who had also served as general secretary of a TNEB engineers’ association for many years. The petitioner urged the court to quash a tender notification issued by Tangedco on February 8 for supply of 20 lakh tonnes of imported steam coal. According to the petitioner, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in 2017 found that an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 746.13 crore had been incurred by Tangedco since it had not invited and evaluated the bids for import of coal on variable price method. CAG had stated that the failure to independently verify the correctness of gross calorific value furnished by the supplier resulted in undue benefit to the extent of Rs. 813.68 crore, the petitioner said and opposed import of coal. “The first respondent (Tangedco) is not justified in going for global tender for importing coal without declaring non-availability of coal within the country and also not ascertaining and promoting alternative methods of electricity generation,” the petitioner said. He said that the financial burden incurred by Tangedco from import of coal was passed on to the common man in the form of tariff revision. Therefore, import of coal should be the last option, the petitioner added.

26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rajini has nothing to do with loan dispute: Kasthuri Raja||Film director R. Krishnamurthy alias Kasthuri Raja on Thursday contended before the Madras High Court that his son’s father-in-law and actor Rajinikanth had nothing to do with a loan taken by him from the late financier S. Mukunchand Bothra. The submission was made during the hearing of a civil appeal preferred by Gagan Bothra, son of Mukunchand Bothra, seeking a direction to Mr. Rajinikanth to take action against Mr. Raja for having supposedly misused the actor’s name for taking the loan or to conclude that there was collusion between them. Justice N. Sathish Kumar had dismissed the financier’s 2015 civil suit on July 24, 2018. When the appeal was listed before Justices N. Kirubakaran and P.D. Audikesavalu, the director’s counsel Haja Mohideen Gisthi said his client borrowed Rs. 10 lakh from the deceased in 2012 after signing on some blank papers. Although the loan was repaid, the signed papers were not returned to him. The financier had filled the blank papers, stating as if the director had borrowed Rs. 65 lakh with an assurance that Mr. Rajinikanth would settle the amount in case of a default. The counsel pointed out that Mr. Gagan Bothra had agreed in the parallel criminal proceedings that it was his father’s handwriting on the promisory note. The judges posted the case to March 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rajini-has-nothing-to-do-with-loan-dispute-kasthuri-raja/article33937595.ece

26 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Alternative source for anti-cancer drug identified||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras have identified a sustainable, high-yielding alternative source for the anti-cancer drug camptothecin. Camptothecin is an alkaloid isolated from ‘Camptotheca Acuminata’, a Chinese tree and ‘Nothapodytes Nimmoniana’, an Indian tree. It requires nearly 1,000 tonnes of plant material to extract one tonne of camptothecin. In the past decade, the population of N. Nimmoniana fell by 20%, according to the researchers. The researchers have developed a microbial fermentation process that can be an economically-efficient method of production to fulfil the market demand. Two drugs, topotecan and irinotecan, are produced using camptothecin. Over a dozen derivatives of camptothecin are under various stages of clinical trials. Smita Srivastava, associate professor in the Department of Biotechnology, led the research.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alternative-source-for-anti-cancer-drug-identified/article33937151.ece

26 February 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Over 70% buses operated in Coimbatore dt.: TNSTC||Despite the strike called by transport trade unions, the Coimbatore division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) claimed that over 70 % of buses were operated in Coimbatore district on Thursday. According to TNSTC officials, around 663 town and mofussil buses out of the total 868 buses were operated within Coimbatore district. All these buses were operated using permanent government employees such as drivers, conductors and supervisors and no contract workers were utilised. Due to this, the commuters in the district were not affected, they claimed. However, general secretary of CITU Coimbatore unit M. Velankanni Raj claimed that around 65 % of the buses were not operated in the district on Thursday and that only 20 buses were operated per TNSTC branch in the district. Apart from TNSTC buses, private buses were operated in the district as usual. According to V. Duraikannan, president of Coimbatore District Bus Owners Association (South), around 450 buses including 150 town buses were operated in the district on Thursday. Nine Opposition trade unions such as LPF, CITU, AITUC and INTUC called for a State-wide strike on Thursday accusing the State government of not completing the wage talks. In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, the unions condemned the interim relief announced by Transport Minister and demanded clarity on the next round of talks. Tourists affected in the Nilgiris With very few buses being operated in the Nilgiris, tourists were the most affected. Many tourists were forced to hire taxis or were reliant on autorickshaws to travel outside the Nilgiris and to popular tourist spots. R. Rajesh, a college student from Tiruppur, said he and his friends were planning to return home after visiting the Nilgiris in bus on Thursday, but because of the strike, they decided to book a taxi. “As taxis are in demand, they are charging around Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3,000 for an one-way journey to Tiruppur,” he said. TNSTC officials claimed that 40 % of the buses were plying throughout the Nilgiris on Thursday, with 30 drivers also being temporarily brought in. They admitted that very few buses were plying to neighbouring districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-70-buses-operated-in-coimbatore-dt-tnstc/article33937614.ece
26 February 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||DMK promotes ‘strongman culture’ when in power: Modi||Launching the BJP’s Assembly election campaign in Coimbatore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused the DMK of promoting a “strongman culture” when in power as its style of governance is based on “bullying and harassment”. “In every district, its [DMK’s] anti-social elements will trouble innocent citizens,” Mr. Modi said during a public meeting at the CODISSIA Trade Fair Complex grounds. The women of Tamil Nadu suffered the most due to this culture, he said. “Entire Tamil Nadu knows how the DMK treated Amma Jayalalithaaji. I do not need to repeat it,” he said, adding that leaders who allegedly “troubled” the former Chief Minister were “rewarded by the DMK and Congress”. Mr. Modi said meetings of the DMK and the Congress were like “corruption hackathons,” where leaders of both parties “brainstormed on how to loot”. “Those suggesting the most innovative ways are given posts and ministries,” he said. The two Opposition parties suffer from “internal contradictions” and “continuous family drama” and they cannot deliver good governance to the State, he said. While in power, the DMK and the Congress did not “bother” about the demands of the Devendrakula Velalar community, but the AIADMK and BJP governments had accepted the community’s “long-standing demand,” he said. The people of India want “development-oriented governance,” Mr. Modi said, describing the working of the AIADMK and BJP governments at the State and the Centre respectively as “classic examples of cooperative federalism”. The BJP-led Central government has ensured “a life of prosperity and dignity” to small farmers in the past seven years and has brought a “paradigm shift in agriculture” through Kisan Credit Cards and the National Agriculture Market (eNAM), he said. Small farmers must not “feel suffocated by middlemen,” he said. Applauding the Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSME) sector in Coimbatore district, he said Rs. 14,000 crore had been sanctioned for 3.5 lakh MSMEs in Tamil Nadu under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. BJP’s State general secretary Raama Sreenivasan translated the speech of the Prime Minister from English to Tamil. Mr. Modi began his speech by saying “ Vanakkam Tamil Nadu , vanakkam Coimbatore”, followed by “ Vetrivel veeravel”.  Prior to his speech, BJP State president L. Murugan presented him with a ‘ vel’ .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-promotes-strongman-culture-when-in-power-modi/article33937120.ece
26 February 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||T.N. major contributor to nation’s industrial growth, says Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday acknowledged that Tamil Nadu had been a major contributor to the country’s industrial growth. At a function in Coimbatore to dedicate as well as lay the foundation for infrastructure projects across the State, he said Tamil Nadu had ensured uninterrupted power supply, which was essential for industrial growth. Mr. Modi dedicated two major power projects being implemented by Neyveli Lignite Corporation, adding 709 mw solar and 1000 mw of thermal power generation to the existing capacity. The projects were implemented at Rs. 10,800 crore. About 65% of the power generated, including the added capacity, was for Tamil Nadu and only the rest 35% was shared among the southern states. Lauding the legacy of Tamil Nadu in maritime initiatives right from the days of freedom fighter V.O. Chidambaranar, the Prime Minister said that widening of the road and bridges at Korapallam would further strengthen the cargo handling capacity of the VOC Port at Thoothukudi. Development and environment are closely linked, he said, referring to the 500 kw roof top solar power generation implemented at the VOC Port. Mr. Modi said works were already on for generating another 140 kw. A project for another 5 MW ground-level solar power generation facility at Rs. 20 crore would be launched soon. By meeting the 65% of the port’s energy requirements, VOC Port had become a pioneer in green ports, he said. Stressing the need for ensuring dignity to every individual, Mr. Modi said that as many as 4,144 tenements constructed by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at a cost of Rs. 332 crore at Tiruppur, Madurai and Tiruchirapalli were being dedicated to those who never had a roof above their head even after 70 years of independence. Mr. Modi also laid the foundation for an Integrated Command and Control Centre for eight of the 11 smart cities at a cost of Rs. 92 crores “to provide intelligent and integrated solutions for problems faced by cities”. The Prime Minister said the Rs. 934-crore project for modernising the Lower Bhavani Project, for which the stone was laid on Thursday, would irrigate two lakh acres of lands in Erode, Tiruppur and Karur districts thus paving the way for realising the dream of “one drop more crop”. Union Minister for Coal Pralhad Joshi said that a series of reforms initiated by Mr. Modi since 2014 had given encouraging results, helping the mines sector to break from the shackles of restriction. The open auction for commercial mining was fetching Rs. 6,650 crore revenue a year.  Thanking the Prime Minister for providing funds for LBP modernisation, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami sought funds for more such projects to enhance efficiency in water management. He urged Mr. Modi to declare the Godavari-Cauvery river linking as a national project to benefit Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu on the lines of the Ganges rejuvenation.  The Chief Minister appealed for the operation of night flights from Salem and Thoothukudi, flight connectivity between Coimbatore and Dubai and speeding up the modernisation of Coimbatore and Madurai airports. He also sought 50 % funds from the Centre for the proposed Coimbatore Metro Rail project. Deputy Chief Minister O. Pannerselvam thanked the Prime Minister for bestowing personal attention on the needs of Tamil Nadu. Lauding Mr. Modi for his occasional use of Tamil, he said there were some leaders, who claimed to be champions of the Tamil race, but could not even read properly the printed Tamil text. Governor Banwarilal Purhohit and Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani took part in the function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-major-contributor-to-nations-industrial-growth-says-modi/article33937153.ece

26 February 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||70% TNSTC buses operated in Erode district||The indefinite strike called by opposition transport trade unions had less impact as around 70% of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses were operated in the district here on Thursday. Nine transport trade unions had called for a State-wide strike over the government’s failure to conclude wage talks that was last held in 2019. They also claimed that a provident fund amount of the transport workers were used for running the transport corporations and wanted immediate settlement of retirement benefits. A senior TNSTC official said that there are 770 buses attached to 13 bus depots in the Erode region and 620 buses were operated on Thursday. “Around 70% to 72% buses were operated and steps would be taken to operate more buses”, the official said. In the absence of frequency of buses in the morning and evening hours, commuters, particularly job-goers, faced difficulty as private buses carried maximum commuters. People who depend on town buses face more difficulty as they have to wait for long hours to reach their destination. Private buses were jam-packed and commuters movement in rural areas was the most affected due to less frequency of buses.  Salem Staff Reporter adds  Officials from Salem zone of TNSTC said that the strike has not affected in the region. However, the trade unions claimed that about 70% did not report for work and about 40% services were affected. But TNSTC officials said that services from various depots in the Salem division to other places were not affected. According to officials, there are about 1,900 buses under the division services from Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri were not affected. Officials said that services progressed as usual on the day.  Special Correspondent adds from Dharmapuri  In Dharmapuri, the strike cast a shadow on normalcy with over 40% of public transport pulled off the roads. The Dharmapuri division with a total of 850 buses operated only 60% buses between the two districts. This entailed operation of less than optimal number of town and moffusil buses. Nine transport trade unions announced an indefinite strike starting from Thursday over the impasse on the wage settlement talks. Earlier the nine unions, including the Labour Progressive Federation, Indian National Trade Union Congress, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Hind Mazdoor Sabha and All India Trade Union Congress had declared that the strike will include eight State Transport Undertakings and the Metropolitan Transport Corporation. In Krishnagiri, with fewer buses, the commuting employee traffic to industrial belts of Hosur was hit due to a shortfall in the number of buses. In Krishnagiri, about 57% of buses were said to have operated to various parts of the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/70-tnstc-buses-operated-in-erode-district/article33937163.ece

Chidambaranar Park (VOC) and the Children’s Park at Rs. 6.42 crore, the Corporation has decided to reopen both the parks to the public between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. from Friday. The Park, established in the 1920's, housed a zoo with wild animals and also had a mini train functioning for the children. However, due to poor maintenance, the animals were shifted to the Vandalur Zoo and the mini train service was also stopped. Under the Smart Cities Mission, the Corporation had proposed to carry out development works and the parks were closed to the public in April, 2019. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, works were delayed and were completed recently. Layouts were redesigned, and works were carried out to develop footpaths, fountains and more play materials were installed. The parks were formally inaugurated by School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan last week. However, the parks were not reopened for the public as electrical works were not completed. Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that both the parks will be reopened to the public from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. everyday. He said that the public will be allowed to visit only during evening hours and after ensuring more security measures, public visiting time to the parks will be increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voc-park-to-be-reopened-to-public-from-today/article33937169.ece

26 February 2021||Karaikal,TAMIL NADU||Karaikal residents desire weekly grievance redressal session by L-G||Residents of Karikal enclave are hopeful that the present Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry Tamilisai Soundararajan will retain the system of redressing public grievances through video-conferencing that was introduced by her predecessor Kiran Bedi. Though an element of dissatisfaction prevails among the people over what they describe as the lack of proper follow-up action by the office of the L-G, the people have no second thoughts about the sincerity of purpose with which the system was introduced. Under the system, the public were encouraged to submit their written petitions and the L-G used to scrutinise them on a weekly basis every Friday. “The residents very much desire resumption of the practice that got discontinued during the lockdown. The purpose behind the exercise was indeed good. But, very many issues were not taken to the proper attention of the L-G by the Secretariat officials and staff. The language barrier was a main impediment. Under the new dispensation, there is a possibility for better dispensation of service from the office of the L-G,” V. R. Dhanaseelane, president of Karaikal District Citizens' Welfare Association said. There have been instances of some officials in key positions interpreting the public grievances with misleading translations during the course of video-conference sessions, he said. According to the president of Karaikal unit of India Against Corruption S. Anandkumar, replacement of key officials and staff in the L-G’s Secretariat after the change of guard was a good augury. “Since the L-G is vested with judicial and quasi-judicial powers, the people are hopeful that the present L-G will strike a strong sync with the people owing to the knowledge of local language,” Prof. Anandkumar said. All the same, there are also apprehensions among the public as to whether the present L-G will handle on an even keel complaints against those who had recently switched party allegiances that had led to the downfall of the Congress government, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karaikal-residents-desire-weekly-grievance-redressal-session-by-l-g/article33937097.ece
26 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Strike: curtailment of bus services affects passengers||People were affected here on Thursday due to curtailment of bus services because of the transport strike called by the opposition trade unions. The staff of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) affiliated to nine opposition trade unions participated in the State-wide strike citing the non-conclusion of wage talks. Bus drivers, conductors, mechanics and other staff stayed away from work. While a senior TNSTC official said around 50% of the buses were operated in the district, opposition transport unions claimed only 20% of the fleet was in service. “Around 30% of the staff reported for duty. Buses were operated on major routes within Madurai and other districts. However, there was a reduction in the number of buses deployed on each route as compared to a normal working day,” said the official. However, A. Kanagasundar, district secretary of a transport union affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, claimed that around 90% of the staff stayed away from work. “Despite conducting various protests, the government did not come forward to hold talks with the trade unions regarding wage settlement,” he said. The interim relief of Rs. 1,000 per month announced by the transport department was insufficient, he said. With only a limited number of buses on road, residents were left with no option but to use private transportation, said S. Parthiban of Doak Nagar. “The daily-wage workers were affected the most. The government must immediately intervene in this matter and resolve the issue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/strike-curtailment-of-bus-services-affects-passengers/article33937689.ece

Muruganantham. In a press release, he said fuel prices had been increasing in the last two months and it seemed the price of petrol might rise to more than Rs. 100 a litre. “Since construction materials, medicines, groceries, vegetables and raw materials of micro and small scale industries were transported through lorries, the increase in fuel prices would have a cascading effect - an increase in lorry freight will lead to price escalation of essential commodities,” Mr. Muruganantham said. In the end, the common man would be affected.

At a function here on Thursday, Justice Baskaran congratulated the efforts of Dr. Ramasubramanian in providing service to the community. He said that after visiting one of the de-addiction centres run by the Foundation he came to know how addiction to tobacco products and alcohol forced youngsters to commit crimes. An awareness must be created among students about the ills of addiction to tobacco and alcohol products. The students must be engaged in providing counselling to those who suffer from addiction, suggested Justice Baskaran.

Chamber president N. accidents said in a press release issued here on Thursday that though they have extended moral support, shops would be kept open for business.

26 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Seven shops gutted in Madurai||Seven shops on Town Hall Road were destroyed in fire that broke out on Wednesday night. Fire and Rescue services personnel from City fire station struggled for more than two hours to douse the flames. The fire was first noticed in a shop that takes up sales and service of wrist watches. The watchman of Khadi Kraft showroom, situated opposite to these shops, alerted neighbouring shop owners after noticing smoke billowing out from the roof of the shop. Though Fire and Rescue Services personnel rushed to the spot within a few minutes, they could not take up fire fighting at once as overhead electric cable was running close to the shops that sell electronic goods and clothes. Koodal Alagar Kovil Teppam All Small Traders Welfare Association president R.S. Sundar Babu said goods worth several lakhs were destroyed in the fire. Raising suspicion over possibility of sabotage, he wondered how could the fire break out within minutes after the shops were closed.“We usually close the shops between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. The owner had left only a few minutes earlier and there was fire on its roof,” he said. The tin-roof shops had no battery for uninterrupted power supply. Besides, all the shopkeepers have the practice of switching off the mains to cut off power supply before closing the shops, he said. The association has lodged a complaint with Thideer Nagar police station. The police were verifying video footage of closed-circuit television cameras in the vicinity. Over 100 shops were located around the temple tank. After the temple authorities ordered eviction, the shopkeepers sought an alternative site to shift their shops, Mr. Babu said. District Fire Officer Vinod and Additional DFO Pandi supervised the fire fighting exercise carried out by six tenders. Since all furniture and goods were highly combustible, the fire spread fast, said Station Fire Officer R. Venkatesan.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice R. Hemalatha directed the State to file a counter affidavit in the petition filed by S.Sumathi of Aruppukottai. She said that based on the decision to reduce the age limit, Teachers Recruitment Board had issued a notification for the post of PG Assistants and the reduced maximum age limit was fixed. ‘Arbitrary move’ Reducing the upper age limit was arbitrary and thousands of teacher aspirants would be affected as a result. Therefore, the rules prescribing the new maximum age limits should be declared illegal as people who were preparing for several years for the examination would be deprived of participating in the recruitment process, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/age-limit-challenged-before-hc/article33937131.ece

The petition also sought appointment of a commission to probe the fire accident that happened on February 12. Hearing the petition filed by M. Rajasekaran of Madurai, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice R. Hemalatha directed the State government to file a counter affidavit on the steps taken to regulate the functioning of fireworks industry and the compensation given to the families of the victims. The petitioner, a member of the Loktantrik Janata Dal, said accidents were taking place in fireworks units repeatedly and the government was not taking any serious measures to stop them. No action was taken against licence holders of the units. Unless there was a stringent law in place, it would be hard to stop such accidents, he said. He pointed out that many fireworks units in the district functioned without proper licence. He sought a direction to the State to appoint a commission to probe the recent fireworks accident in the district and provide appropriate compensation to the families of the victims. Meanwhile, the death toll of the February 12 fire accident rose to 23 after one more worker succumbed to injuries at Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital on Thursday.

26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry govt. fell due to Congress’ internal politics: BJP||The BJP reacted sharply to former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanaswamy’s accusations that the fall of his government on Monday was due to the BJP luring Congress MLAs, stating that the blame rested squarely on the Congress’s “harakiri” type internal politics rather than any external reasons. Rajya Sabha member and co-in charge of polls for the Puducherry Assembly Rajeev Chandrashekhar told The Hindu that while four of Mr. Narayanswamy’s MLAs had deserted him, only one had crossed over to the BJP. He said, “Of the four, one remains a DMK MLA, two are yet to decide what they will be doing and only one who deserted Mr. Narayanaswamy is with us. We didn’t have the numbers and made it very clear that we didn’t want to stake a claim to form a government. How come we are being accused of pulling down the government? The plain fact is that the BJP is the only party determined to grow especially in south India, while the Congress is busy committing ‘harakiri’ because of its internal issues. The Congress-led government fell because senior leaders in that party who are leaders in their own right are feeling suffocated thanks to the antics of Mr. Narayanaswamy and Mr. Rahul Gandhi.” The BJP “was happy to take the credit” but it was hardly due to them that the government fell, he stated. Rules out sympathy Mr. Chandrashekhar refuted scenarios floated in some quarters that the premature demise of the Congress-led government in Puducherry would lead to sympathy for Mr. Narayanaswamy, undercutting any anti-incumbency that the government may be facing. “One only needs to look at the crowd at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in Puducherry today [Thursday] to see that that is not the case. Mr. Narayanaswamy’s own colleagues brought his government down because they knew the people did not support it,” he observed. The Union Cabinet approved the imposition of President’s Rule, and the Union Territory will go to polls in a couple of months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-govt-fell-due-to-congress-internal-politics-bjp/article33937154.ece

26 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||PM assures all help for U.T.’s development||In a charm offensive around the theme of development of Puducherry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a slew of projects, across the logistics, health infrastructure, heritage and pilgrim tourism sectors. Seeking to connect with the people, Mr. Modi said, “I am here to personally assure all possible support from my government for the development of Puducherry.” Inaugurating digitally three projects and laying the foundation for four others, worth an estimated Rs. 4,000 crore at a function in Jipmer, he said Puducherry, a beautiful land with rich talent pool, had potential for a lot of industrial and tourism development that would provide a lot of employment and opportunity. Underscoring India’s requirement for world-class infrastructure to cater to its development needs, the Prime Minister, who laid the foundation stone for the Rs. 2,426 crore four-laning project of NH 45-A, said the 56 km Sattanathapuram–Nagapattinam stretch, covering Karaikal district, would improve connectivity and spur economic activity. At the same time, it would improve access to the Saneeswaran Temple and provide easy interstate connectivity to the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health and the Nagore Dargah. Stating that the agriculture sector would gain from this, Mr. Modi said it was the government’s duty to ensure that innovating farmers get good markets for their produce. “Good roads do exactly that. The four-laning of the road will also draw industries in this area and generate job opportunities for local youth,” he said. After laying the foundation stone for the Puducherry Port’s development under the Sagarmala scheme, he said once completed, it would help fishermen who have been using the port for venturing into the sea for fishing operations, as well as provide the much-needed sea connectivity to Chennai. “This will facilitate cargo movement for industries of Puducherry and ease load on the Chennai port. It will open up possibilities of passenger traffic among the coastal cities,” Mr. Modi said. Inaugurating the Rs. 28 crore Blood Centre in Jipmer, he said the new facility would accommodate advanced facilities for long-term storage of blood, blood products and stem cell banking. The facility would also function as a research laboratory and a training centre for personnel in all aspects of transfusion. He also launched the Phase-I project of the Medical College Building on the Karaikal campus, which would house all modern teaching facilities required for MBBS students. The Prime Minister also inaugurated the re-built Mairie heritage building, recreated in its old form. Laying the foundation stone for a 400 m synthetic athletic track at the sports complex in the city as part of the Khelo India scheme, he said once good sports facilities come up in Puducherry, youth from this region could excel in national and global sports meets. The 100-bed girls hostel constructed at Lawspet, which was also inaugurated on Thursday, is another initiative to help sporting talent and will accommodate hockey, volleyball, weightlifting, kabaddi and handball players. The hostel students will train under SAI coaches. Hailing Puducherry as “holy land”, whose divinity had brought him back again after a visit three years ago (for the golden jubilee celebrations of Auroville), Mr. Modi said, “Puducherry has a presence on India’s western and eastern coast. This land is a symbol of diversity. People speak five different languages, practice different faiths but live as one”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-launches-new-projects/article33937128.ece

For this purpose, they have set up a smart classroom in their police station and a traffic park around the station. This police station recently received the ISO certification for providing quality road safety awareness to students. Meet Ranipet traffic police inspector T. Mukhesh Kumar, SSI D. Meganathan and grade 1 police constable K. Shankar, who have been conducting classes on road safety for students of Road Safety Clubs from 21 schools in their jurisdiction. “The police, health, highways and transport departments have to teach them 20 subjects. We teach them basic traffic rules, safety for pedestrians and cyclists, traffic violations and reasons for road accidents among other things,” said Mr. Mukesh who underwent training on road safety at the Institute of Road Transport, New Delhi. To impart the knowledge in a better manner, the policemen set up a smart classroom and a traffic park around the police station with the help of then Ranipet Superintendent of police A Mayilvaganan. “The smart classroom is on the first floor and there is a room full of traffic signs and rules painted on the wall. There is also a library for the students,” he added. Mr. Mukesh said that since the police station is exclusively for traffic, unlike others which share space with the law and order police, they also set up a traffic park. “We train the children in the park and test their knowledge in the smart classroom,” said Mr. Meganathan. He said that they did not interact with the children like police personnel. “We speak to them like friends and they are able to grasp the lessons easily,” he added. T. Kapil Dev, physical education teacher, Government Higher Secondary School, Ranipet said that this was a new experience for the children. “The atmosphere inside the station itself kindles their interest to learn,” he said.

26 February 2021||Sivaganga,TAMIL NADU||Karti Chidambaram flays govt. for increasing retirement age||The AIADMK’s poor administration is reflected in enhancement of retirement age for state government employees from 59 to 60 years, alleged Congress MP Karti Chidambaram in Sivaganga on Thursday. Speaking to reporters at Okkur near here, where he had launched a campaign to receive petitions from the public on bullock-carts, he said maladministration had exposed the inefficiency of the AIADMK government in power. ‘Empty coffers’ Since the government had emptied the coffers, it could not honour the retiring employees with gratuity and other benefits on the day of superannuation. The government had enhanced the retirement age to escape from the financial commitment. Mr. Karti Chidambaram flayed the Centre’s wrong policies and lack of direction had led to fuel price hike. He criticised the BJP government for rechristening a cricket ground in Ahmedabad as Narendra Modi stadium. The people were frustrated as the governments at the Centre and in Tamil Nadu were not interested in bringing down the price even after it had gone up. The Congress MP said that when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, the then UPA government handled the issue in a tactful manner and ensured that the fuel prices were in control unlike the present regime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-flayed-for-increasing-retirement-age/article33937146.ece

26 February 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Raising of retirement age will affect chances of youth: Balakrishnan||The upward revision of retirement age for State government employees will affect opportunities for younger generation in getting employment in government departments, said K. Balakrishnan, state secretary, CPI (M) on Thursday. Addressing journalists in Thanjavur, he said the State government, which was struggling to settle the retirement benefits of the State Transport Corporation employees, had announced that the retirement age for government employees would be increased to 60 years. This was nothing but an attempt to evade its responsibility of shouldering the financial burden of settling the retirement benefits of those due to retire from government service during this year. “Increasing the retirement age will have a negative impact on the prospects of the younger generation in getting employed as government servants at the right time of their life”, he added. Responding to a question on seat allocation in the DMK alliance for the Assembly polls, Mr. Balakrishnan pointed out that in the previous election that the Communists were allotted seats in double digits and hoped for the same now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/raising-of-retirement-age-flayed/article33937098.ece

Addressing a farmers’ grievance day meeting, Dr. Senthil Raj said the district witnessed loss of crop cultivated on 1.21 lakh hectares including agricultural crops raised on 1.04 lakh hectare and horticultural crops cultivated on 17,000 hectares. Following a survey conducted by officials of revenue and the agriculture departments, the government allocated Rs. 123 crore as relief. While Rs. 96.50 crore had been disbursed, the remaining farmers would receive the relief within a week. Similarly, crop loan to the tune of Rs. 181 crore was waived in the district as announced by the State government. Referring to ongoing paddy harvest in the district, the Collector said direct procurement centres had been established at Srivaikundam, Paeikulam, Pannampaarai, Vasavappapuram, Manakkarai and Iruvappapuram.

And paddy direct procurement centre should be opened at Nazareth also. Agriculturist Thamizh Mani of Kurumbur said steps should be taken for early disbursal of insurance benefits for plantain crop loss suffered by farmers and a base price of Rs. 25 fixed for plantain at auction centres. Also, desilting of Kadambakulam and its overflow channel should be taken up before next season. Pauldurai of Sattankulam said steps should be taken to ensure flow of water into eight irrigation tanks in their region with water released in to the third and fourth reaches of Manimuthar dam.  ‘Strengthen bunds’ As Aththimarappatti witnessed heavy flood overflowing from nearby Uppaar Odai in mid-January, farmer Jothimani appealed to the Collector to strengthen the bunds of the stream to permanently save the hamlet from deluge.

The main federations of employee associations had decided to defer an indefinite strike they had planned earlier on the issue after two rounds of talks with the Secretary - Defence Production. Subsequently, on request, the federations had submitted a robust proposal last December for continuation of Ordnance Factory Board in the present form. The federations are disappointed over the Central Government’s neglect of the proposal and its decision to go ahead with the plans for corporatisation. The All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), Indian National Defence Workers' Federation, and Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh have now decided to revive their action programmes after learning that the EGOM meeting will take place on March 2 to discuss the modalities for implementation of government's plan for corporatisation of OFB. Accordingly, gate meetings will be conducted for reading out the pledge to reject the government’s decision to corporatise OFB, and the employees will affix their signature and forward the same to the EGOM on the same day, C. Srikumar, General Secretary of AIDEF, said. In separate letters to the Defence Minister and the Secretary - Defence Production, representatives of the three employee federations said the move for corporatisation had violated the conciliatory settlement reached on October 9, 2020. “The federations cannot remain silent spectators,” the letter addressed to Secretary - Defence Production, said, demanding autonomy to the OFB as in the case of Railways.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defence-civilian-staff-fight-against-corporatisation/article33937816.ece

At the Central Bus Stand, nearly 40 % to 50 % of the buses were operated by 10 a.m. Most of the crew members, who reported for duty were members of Anna Thozhirsanga Peravai while most workers owing allegiance to the LPF, CITU and AITUC took part in the strike. According to sources in the TNSTC, 55% of buses in Tiruchi region were operated as usual. While it was 50% in Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur recorded 76% and 65% respectively. Out of 955 buses in the region, about 485 buses were operated. Crew members of other buses failed to report for duty. The limited operations put commuters to hardship as many had to wait for long hours to catch buses to their destinations. Buses were operated for short destinations such as Dindigul, Manapparai, Thanjavur, Karur and Kumbakonam. But, there were hardly any buses to Ramanathapuram, Rameswaram, Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli. A. Selvakumar, a passenger from Tiruchi, said that he had been waiting for a bus to reach Ramanathapuram since 7 a.m., but was yet to find one till 9.30 am. However, all private buses operated as usual. There were allegations of collection of excess fare in some private buses operated to Pudukottai from Tiruchi. As against the normal fare of Rs. 47, a few operators collected anywhere between Rs. 60 and Rs. 70 for Pudukottai, it was alleged. In Thanjavur, commuters were forced to travel in heavily crowded buses due to curtailed services. Commuters arrived at the bus stands in different parts of the district only to find a few buses plying to full capacity. Many had to wait for more than 30 minutes as the State Transport Corporation, Kumbakonam Division officials made ad-hoc arrangements to ensure adequate services to clear traffic from the bus stands. Kumaran of Thanjavur, a regular commuter between Thanjavur and Kumbakonam, faulted the STC officials for remaining lethargic and failing to keep standby bus crew ready to nullify the strike effect from the early morning hours itself. It could have helped the public avoid travelling in packed buses amidst the pandemic. While the striking trade unions claimed that 70 per cent of buses were off the roads, TNSTC officials said that they were able to operate 50% of regular services to cater to the needs of the travelling public. All employees except those owing allegiance to the trade unions of AIADMK, PMK and TMC, have stayed away from the work. Official sources said that the patronage to the strike call from employees had gradually declined after 10 a.m. as the news about crediting of Rs. 1,000 as “interim relief” in the employee's bank accounts reached them. The officials indicated that they might engage temporary bus drivers and conductors to maintain normal services, if necessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/workers-strike-hits-operation-of-tnstc-bus-services/article33937100.ece

Testing strategies, meanwhile, have been modified, especially for travellers from the UK and four other countries, officials said. Speaking to The Hindu , S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, Tiruchi, said that travellers from the UK, Brazil, South Africa and from the Middle East, must carry negative RT-PCR reports. “While all travellers from abroad are required the test report, travellers from these countries will be kept on a watch and another test will be taken after seven days,” he said. The Tiruchi International Airport also has a counter where the RT-PCR test can be conducted for travellers. The test will take eight hours to process, following which, the patient can be placed in home quarantine or at a hospital, depending upon the results. Meanwhile, at Thanjavur, where a few local clusters too, were identified over the past month, surveillance has been increased, said I. Raveendran, Deputy Director of Health Services, Thanjavur. “We have identified three clusters and have controlled them. Contact tracing and testing have helped us in this feat,” he said. In the district, seven patients who returned from the UK tested positive in January. While their samples were lifted and sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, the results were yet to be received. “We have isolated them, treated them and they have returned home after recovery too,” he said. As of this week, 19 foreign returnees are in home quarantine in the district. “Following a meeting with the Chief Secretary, we have been instructed to intensify follow-ups. We have also been able to keep a check on the death rate in the district, by ensuring patients receive treatment on time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-covid-19-strains-health-officials-on-alert/article33937094.ece
26 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Toll-free number launched to help children of migrant labourers||Collector J. Innocent Divya launched a dedicated toll-free number for the children of migrant labourers here on Wednesday. The dedicated helpline number, called “Saheli”, has been designed in such a way that the children of migrant labourers facing any sort of abuse or harassment can speak to child welfare workers in their own native languages. “In the coming weeks, a dedicated helpline number will be assigned, but for the time being, it has been attached to the 1098 Childline number,” Ms. Divya told reporters. Ms. Divya said the labour department in the district would work on identifying the children of all migrant workers in the district. The department would compile a database of all migrant labourers employed in factories, plantations and hotels, and ensure that their children were also identified. The Collector said the safety and welfare of these children was of paramount importance, especially when their parents were away at work and the children were left alone at home. The steps to address the concerns surrounding the safety of the children of migrant labourers had been taken following the murder of an 8-year-old girl, the daughter of migrant workers from Jharkhand, whose body was found almost a month after she was reported missing from her house in a tea estate in Coonoor. Sensitisation campaigns would be targeted at both the parents as well as the children, to make sure that they were aware of the helpline service, said the Collector. Child welfare workers would also conduct awareness campaigns in school, with two “ambassadors” being selected among the student body in government schools in the district, whom the children could approach requesting help for reporting abuse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/toll-free-number-launched-to-help-children-of-migrant-labourers/article33937610.ece
26 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Water filtration systems installed in 34 carrot cleaning units||Owners of 34 of the 47 carrot cleaning units have installed water treatment and purification systems to treat the runoff from the machines in the Nilgiris. The district administration, in a release, said the district had a total of 47 carrot cleaning units. The owners had been directed to install the systems to treat water used to clean carrots at the unit. Pollution Conservationists had voiced their concerns in the past that the runoff from the units was highly polluted, carrying chemicals and pesticides which get washed off from the carrots while they were being cleaned and get released into nearby rivers and streams. A variety of wildlife, which were drinking water from the runoff from the units, including gaur, were said to be dying due to drinking the untreated water and from feasting on the discarded carrots from the units. The owners of the units had requested that they be given time till they installed the systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 47 units, the systems had been installed in 34 units, which were now being allowed to function. 9 units closed Nine of the remaining 13 units had been closed down for failing to install the systems and would be allowed to function only when they installed the systems. The owners of the other units were in the process of getting the plants installed, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-filtration-systems-installed-in-34-carrot-cleaning-units/article33937611.ece
26 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Owners of illegal resorts begin farming along notified elephant corridor||Contravening the rules of the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forests (TNPPF) Act, the owners of resorts whose buildings were sealed by the district administration have begun cultivating their lands along the notified elephant corridor in Bokkapuram in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) buffer zone. Local Adivasi residents in Bokkapuram alleged that the resort owners had felled bamboo and other trees from their lands and have started tilling the soil. A retired official from the Revenue Department said there were a number of rules that the resort owners in the area were flouting. “For a start, they are not allowed to put up fences restricting movement for wildlife. They are also illegally drawing water from streams running through the region,” he said. Property owners cannot grow crops in previously uncultivated lands. “This could be a strategic move by them to claim that they are in fact not running illegal resorts, but are instead only farmers,” said a Nilgiris-based conservationist. It is illegal to change land-use along the elephant corridor and in all TNPPF Act notified lands in the Sigur plateau, the conservationist said. Local residents alleged that the property owners were also drawing water from a marshland located behind the Bokkapuram Temple, for farming. “The elephant corridor has been notified to allow elephants a pathway to move between habitats. It does not matter if the corridor is blocked by buildings or by farms; they are all violations, which left unchecked could to an increase in conflict between humans and wildlife. The district administration, revenue department, local body and the forest department need to get their act together and take strict action against these violators,” said another conservationist from the Nilgiris. When contacted, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone) L.C.S. Srikanth said that he was not aware of the lands being cultivated by the resort owners and promised to take action. Collector J. Innocent Divya too promised to look into the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/owners-of-illegal-resorts-begin-farming-along-notified-elephant-corridor/article33937156.ece

VOC Port has taken up installation of grid connected to the 25-acre power plant at a cost of Rs. 20 crore and the project is expected to be completed by August. The plant is estimated to generate 80.64 lakh units (KWH) per annum, meeting 60% of the total energy consumption of the port. In addition, it will also aid in reducing the carbon footprint in its operations. The VOC Port has been implementing various ‘Green Port’ initiatives and has already installed 500 KW rooftop solar power plant. Installation of another 140 KW rooftop solar project is in progress. The port has also initiated the process for setting up onshore wind farms along its long coastline. It has issued work order to National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) to prepare DPR for installing onshore and offshore wind turbines to harness wind potential on private-public partnership basis. On implementation of all the projects, the port will become the ‘First Green Port’ of the country. The Prime Minister also dedicated the eight-lane Korampallam bridge and rail overbridge near Tuticorin Thermal Power Station to the nation. The project was taken up at a cost of Rs. 42 crore as an initiative under the Union Government’s ‘Sagarmala’ programme. The existing bridge and rail overbridge have been widened on either side to 8.5metres for a length of 277 metre and the existing road leading to the bridge to 10.30 metres for a length of 1.577 km. At present, the VOC Port has only four-lane connectivity. The new project will facilitate full-fledged eight-laning of the approach road to the port and will facilitate seamless entry for time-sensitive cargo-laden container trucks from Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Madurai etc., bound for destinations across the globe. Collector K. Senthil Raj and Chairman of VOC Port T.K. Ramachandran participated in the function here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-lays-foundation-for-voc-ports-5-mw-solar-power-plant/article33937135.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Good response to transport workers’ strike in south T.N.||More than 65% of buses were off the road as the transport workers’ indefinite strike that began on Thursday evoked good response from employees affiliated to nine trade unions. Demanding immediate commencement of wage settlement talks, disbursal of gratuity and pension benefits on the day of retirement, filling-up of vacancies in the transport corporation, the workers announced indefinite strike from February 25. With the strike beginning on Thursday, an auspicious day, the public were put to a lot of hardships.

After only 20% of the buses were operated till 7 a.m., the situation improved slightly with a few more pressed into service in Tirunelveli. Of the 564 buses from 11 depots in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts, 262 (46%) were operated till 9.30 a.m. Only 678 of 1,235 personnel reported for work despite stern warning from the government.

(Mr. Narayanasamy had subsequently said he had indeed visited the region where the woman complained of lack of attention). “It is in the culture of the Congress to spread lies,” the Prime Minister said. Mr. Modi was confident of the NDA forming a government in the Union Territory after the Assembly election. “Such a government will be a people’s government and the high command will be the people. I want to see the U.T. [the Union Territory] become the BEST [business hub, education hub, spiritual hub and tourism hub].” The NDA government would focus on coastal development and revive the cooperative sector to enhance the lot of women, he said. He said the Congress had bagged “several medals in spreading lies”. “The party follows our colonial master’s policy of divide and rule. Sometimes they pit one region against the other and also one community against another,” he said. Referring to Mr. Gandhi’s statement on the need to create a separate Ministry for fisheries, Mr. Modi said in May 2019 itself, a Ministry of Fisheries was constituted by the NDA government. The Congress “will never pass an opportunity to call others anti-democratic,” he said, adding the party should look in the mirror to understand the reality. Nominated legislator and BJP Puducherry president V. Saminathan and former Minister A.

Inbadurai of cheating him to the tune of Rs. 40 lakh. According to complainant T.V. Mani, 72, of Cheranmahadevi, who is a retired executive officer of Kalakkad union, said he, through the bank account of his son Raju, transferred Rs. 40 lakh to the account of Mr. Inbadurai on February 21, 2019. “Since he refuses to return the money and threatens me when I ask him for repayment, I have filed a complaint with the Deputy Inspector General of Police today,” Mr. Mani said after submitting the complaint. Refuting the charges, Mr. Inbadurai said he used to borrow money from his friend and colleague Ram Prasad, an advocate.“When I was in need of the money [Rs. 40 lakh), I approached Mr. Ram Prasad, who asked Mr. Mani to transfer the amount and I got Rs. 40 lakh from the account of Mr. Mani’s son Raju. Though I returned the money, Mr. Mani has filed a fake complaint.” He said he had evidence to prove that he returned the money to Mr. Mani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/retired-man-accuses-mla-of-cheating/article33937136.ece

Mr. Modi said meetings of the DMK and the Congress were like “corruption hackathons,” where leaders of both parties “brainstormed on how to loot”. “Those suggesting the most innovative ways are given posts and ministries,” he said. The two Opposition parties suffer from “internal contradictions” and “continuous family drama” and they cannot deliver good governance to the State, he said. While in power, the DMK and the Congress did not “bother” about the demands of the Devendrakula Velalar community, but the AIADMK and BJP governments had accepted the community’s “long-standing demand,” he said. The people of India want “development-oriented governance,” Mr. Modi said, describing the working of the AIADMK and BJP governments at the State and the Centre respectively as “classic examples of cooperative federalism”. The Central government has ensured “a life of prosperity and dignity” to small farmers in the past seven years and has brought a “paradigm shift in agriculture” through Kisan Credit Cards and the National Agriculture Market (eNAM), he said. Small farmers must not “feel suffocated by middlemen,” he said. Mr. Modi particularly highlighted that the minimum support price for copra had nearly doubled in six years. Applauding the Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSME) sector in Coimbatore district, he said Rs. 14,000 crore had been sanctioned for 3.5 lakh MSMEs in Tamil Nadu, including around 25,000 enterprises in Coimbatore, under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. “India is proud of them,” Mr. Modi said, assuring them that the Central government would be with MSMEs in their efforts. The Government of India has modernised textile infrastructure in seven years, he said. BJP’s State general secretary Raama Sreenivasan translated the speech of the Prime Minister from English to Tamil. Mr. Modi began his speech by saying “ Vanakkam Tamil Nadu , vanakkam Coimbatore”, followed by “ Vetrivel veeravel”.  Prior to his speech, BJP State president L.

He should be ashamed of calling himself a lawyer,” BJP leader and Minister for Rural development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa said in Chikkodi on Thursday. “He fails to realise that the Ram Mandir is coming up on land cleared by the Supreme Court of all disputes. The Congress leader is needlessly opposing it. This is for political reasons,” Mr. Eshwarappa said. “People of this country have rejected the Congress as its leaders have been insulting Lord Rama. If the Congress continues to insult the Ram temple, they will continue to suffer setbacks,” he said. To a question, he said he had no idea why Mr. Siddaramaiah was not participating in rallies by Kuruba community leaders seeking ST tag. “Conflict of ideas and political differences are there between us. He is in the Congress and I am in the BJP. Such differences are bound to exist. But, he has to explain why he is not attending the rallies,” Mr. Eshwarappa said. He inaugurated Nutan Vidya Mandir school in Koulagudda village near Athani. The Minister urged the villagers to send their sons and daughters to school. “My mother sent me to school while working in arecanut fields. Education helped me achieve success in life,” he said.

26 February 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Consumers oppose GESCOM’s power tariff revision proposal||A proposal by the Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited (GESCOM) to the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) for increasing power tariff by 156 paisa a unit for all category of consumers was strongly opposed. In a consultative meeting of power users convened by KERC at the district administrative complex here on Thursday, almost all consumers appealed to KERC to reject the proposal. In his presentation on the tariff revision proposal, Rahul Pandve, Managing Director of GESCOM, put the projected revenue deficit of Rs. 1,196.89 crore, which included the pending deficit of Rs. 982.29 crore and the projected deficit of Rs. 214.60 crore for 2021-22, and appealed to the commission to allow the hike. GESCOM projected the revenue of Rs. 5,950.74 crore against the projected expenditure of Rs. 6,165.34 crore for 2021-22. Opposing the proposal, Deepak Gala, president of Hyderabad Karnataka Environment Awareness and Protection Organisation, argued that GESCOM’s mismanagement and the government’s disinterest in paying its dues and interests on dues was the primary reason for revenue deficiency. He appealed to KERC not to allow GESCOM to transfer the burden it created to genuine consumers. “Additional capital expenditure incurred on providing power supply to Ganga Kalyan Irrigation Pumpsets was Rs. 289.92 crore, which is in addition to the amount paid by various State-owned corporations. The GESCOM should have collected the dues from the government, as it does with ordinary consumers, instead of transferring it to the genuine consumers,” he said. Mr. Gala also questioned the legality of the government’s decision to waive the interest amount on the dues payable by gram panchayats to GESCOM for street lighting and water supply projects. A representative from the Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry told the KERC that the industrial units in the region were going through hard times in the backdrop of COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown and appealed the KERC not to allow the hike. Many people in the meeting expressed dissatisfaction over the functioning of GESCOM and its negligence in addressing the power users’ problems. In his concluding remarks, Shambhu Dayal Meena, chairman of KERC, directed the GESCOM officials to hold power users’ consultative meetings on a regular basis and develop a grievance redressal mechanism for time-bound resolutions of problems. “Develop a mobile app for registering complaints from power users and their speedy disposal integrating a consumer feedback system. Whenever there is a new circulation, direction or order from the government or KERC, convene a meeting of your officers to sensitise them. If you have any confusion interpreting a direction, you can always approach KERC. Hold the executive engineer or assistant executive engineer responsible for power-related accidents in his/her area,” Mr. Meena told Mr. Pandve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/consumers-oppose-gescoms-power-tariff-revision-proposal/article33937193.ece

26 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘ Union Budget 2021 was mere sloganeering’||Retired professor of economics, Mangalore University, G.V. Joshi on Thursday said mere sloganeering, political benefits and hero worshipping were the highlights of the Union Budget 2021. He was speaking as a moderator at a panel discussion on Union budget organised by the PG Department of Business Administration at Alva’s Institute of Engineering and Technology at Moodbidri. The Budget aimed at privatising every sector, he said, adding that it still rallies around the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee that has become outdated. There should be inclusive development of weaker sections of society; but the Budget neither mentions inflation problems nor talks about a slow economy, Mr. Joshi said. Retired IRS officer Jayaprakash Rau said the Budget has completely ignored population effects on the economy. “It was unfortunate that a pandemic like COVID-19 had to happen to wake up the government to realize the idea of self-reliant India,” he said. The government was right in encouraging seaweed cultivation as the country has over 8,000 km of coastline, said chartered accountant Nitin J. Shetty. Prakash Paneerselvan, assistant professor, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru, who talked about defence sector, said dearth of self-realised indigenous technology was one of the biggest problems in the sector. Krishna Bhat, entrepreneur, said India’s low rank in Ease of Doing Business Index was worrisome. “Labour laws are not reformed from ages. Bureaucracy is the reason for hindrance of growth,” he said. Every government was indulging in popular gimmick of offering loans to farmers and waiving them later, quipped Karnataka Rajya Rubber Belegarara Hitarakshana Vedike president Sridhar G. Bhide. Agriculturist Vishweshwara Bhat Bangaradka said the only sector that saw growth despite the economic slowdown and COVID-19 pandemic was agriculture.

26 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Thokkottu-Deralakatte road’s poor condition affects commuters||About a 3-km stretch between Thokkottu Junction on National Highway 66 and Yenepoya Medical College, Deralakatte on Thokkottu-Mudipu-Melkar road has been in a pathetic condition with potholes and craters dotting the stretch. The road connecting the education hub in Mangaluru south with several medical colleges and Mangalore University main campus, always bustles with traffic even as the deplorable condition of the road has only added to the woes of road users. Saleem Ahmed, a resident of Deralakatte, said already road users have been facing congestion problem and the bad road has aggravated their problems. If a heavy vehicle, namely a bus or a truck, was moving on the road, other vehicles could not overtake the heavy vehicle due to the continuous flow of traffic from the opposite direction, he said. Potholes and craters further slow down vehicular movement causing traffic logjams during peak hours, he said. Keshav Poojari, a resident of Thokkottu, said some of the craters cover almost half of the carriageway because of which vehicle riders/drivers move on the wrong side of the road to avoid them. In the bargain, there were every chances of accidents occurring, he pointed out. The Public Works Department (PWD) has taken up four-laning of the Thokkottu-Mudipu road patch by patch arranging funds under different heads. While about 2 km of the road was made four-lane between Yenepoya Medical College and Deralakatte Junction, earth work, construction of road embankment etc., were going on between Thokkottu and Yenepoya, said Executive Engineer Yashvanth Kumar. He told The Hindu pothole filling work would immediately be undertaken on the affected stretch of the Thokkottu-Mudipu road considering the importance of the road as well as the inconvenience to its users. Incidentally, the road—Melkar-Thokkottu—was planned to be upgraded as a bypass for Bengaluru-Mangaluru National Highway 75, particularly for vehicles to and from Kerala. Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had laid the foundation stone for the proposed bypass along with another proposed bypass—Mulki-Kateel-B.C. road. Work on these were yet to commence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/thokkottu-deralakatte-roads-poor-condition-affects-commuters/article33937701.ece

26 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Kerala COVID-19 spike upsets tourism in Mysuru, Kodagu||The tourism industry that was on the path of recovery after a disturbing 2020 over the COVID-19 pandemic is once again staring at an uncertain fate after the spike in infections in neighbouring Kerala, and the curbs that followed. The restrictions imposed by the State government on the entry of people from Kerala has affected the overall tourist footfall in Mysuru and Kodagu, a drop of 30-40 per cent. People with negative reports of the tests done within 72 hours are entering the borders but their numbers are small. The hotels in Mysuru and homestays and resorts in Kodagu are reporting cancellation of bookings of visitors from Kerala in view of the stricter rules imposed in the State with a compulsory RT-PCR test for the people coming from the neighbouring State. The surveillance at border checkposts in Mysuru and Kodagu has also contributed to the fall in tourist inflow, said stakeholders of the tourism sector with whom The Hindu spoke. B.S. Prashanth, President, Mysuru Travels’ Association, said he had received information from his travel agents in Kodagu that bookings were getting cancelled after the curbs were brought in. “We are in a helpless situation. The industry that was seeing some hope after a surge in visitors is once again being pushed to a crisis situation.” In Mysuru, the hotel occupancy which was around 70 per cent till recently, is down by 30 per cent. Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association President Narayana Gowda said running the business is now difficult, with no relief whatsoever from the government. “When the industry is facing crisis after crisis, the government is busy collecting taxes from us.” Mr. Gowda said the association has requested the district authorities to ensure that the tourists are not subjected to harassment in the name of screening and testing as recovery post-pandemic may get prolonged even further. “We have no objection to the steps taken for controlling the contagion but the tourists should not face pestering that affects the tourism industry which is giving livelihood to lakhs of families,” he argued. B.R. Nagendra Prasad, President, Kodagu Hotels, Restaurants and Resorts Association, said Kerala tourists have stopped visiting Kodagu with strict vigil at the border check-posts for controlling the COVID-19 spread.  Fresh worries for zoo Instead of recording the footfall of pre-COVID-19 days, the Mysuru zoo is witnessing lesser turnout of visitors, causing fresh worries to the management. The unexpected fall comes just as the weekend turnout had crossed 7,000-8,000 after the pandemic cases dropped substantially since the beginning of 2021. The weekend footfall is almost down by 3,000. Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni told The Hindu that the footfall to the zoo had been affected with drop in visitors from Kerala. The zoo maintenance was solely dependent on the gate collection. If the revenue falls, it will have a direct impact on its maintenance. “The zoo needs a sum of Rs. 7 lakh a day to meet the expenditure and the maintenance of animals and birds. We are yet to get this sum and we hope the footfall picks up further so that we can be become sustainable post COVID-19,” according to zoo sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kerala-covid-19-spike-upsets-tourism-in-mysuru-kodagu/article33937330.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BWSSB to set up helpline to regulate cleaning of pits and septic tanks||The IT capital’s reliance on manual scavengers is a dirty secret. In an effort to crack down on citizens hiring private service providers to clean pits and septic tanks, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is working towards setting up a helpline. The purpose is to register agencies and service providers offering de-sludging and cleaning services, and crack down on those who break the law. This comes a year after the Board decided to make it mandatory for citizens to hire service providers that it had certified. An internet search on service providers to clean pits and septic tanks throws up hundreds of results, with many of the companies offering ‘mechanical cleaning’. However, activists claim that this cleaning is not bereft of human intervention with agencies hiring cheap labour as well. Poor response The Board’s efforts, however, seem to be hitting a dead end, with next to no response to its call to private service providers. BWSSB made a public announcement, twice, urging private service providers to attend a meeting on certification and fixing a price for various services. Most of the firms are concentrated in outer areas of the city where the sanitary infrastructure is absent. BWSSB officials admitted that the response has been poor, both times. While just eight service providers attended the first meeting, 12 attended the second. “We got the list of these private service providers from a private company. However, most of the numbers listed are either out of reach or wrong, and some of the addresses were not traceable,” said a BWSSB official. K.B. Obalesh, State convenor of the Safai Karmacharis Kaval Samiti, said the effort was part of the Centre’s ‘Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge’. “Around 240 cities and towns from across the country are participating in the challenge, including Bengaluru and six other cities in Karnataka,” he said. Pointing out that there were many issues with private agencies offering such services, Mr. Obalesh said that safety precautions were often not taken, resulting in deaths. Service providers reluctant “The BWSSB must record the kind of equipment used by these agencies, the capacity of the jetting and sucking machines, safety gear provided to the cleaning personnel, and security provided to them,” he said, and added that many agencies were not responding to the BWSSB’s call only because they feared that they could end up making a loss if the rates are fixed. “After all, faecal matter is now akin to ‘gold’ for these service providers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bwssb-to-set-up-helpline-to-regulate-cleaning-of-pits-and-septic-tanks/article33937558.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘Informal sector workers yet to recover from economic fallout of COVID-19’||Informal sector workers in Bengaluru, whose lives were disrupted by the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, are yet to recover their losses and their livelihood is yet to return to pre-COVID-19 levels. A study by Azim Premji University, which was released on Thursday, found that 15% of informal sector workers continue to be unemployed after losing their jobs. In addition, 23% had experienced a break in employment during the pandemic, and nearly half of the people surveyed (46%) are currently engaged in the same job but with less pay. Around 75% of those surveyed were engaged in jobs similar to what they did before the pandemic, but most with lower pay or break in employment. Researchers surveyed around 250 people in the informal labour sector. They mostly comprise self-employed people like street vendors, waste pickers, autorickshaw drivers, mechanics, dhobis and small business owners, or those working on wages rather than fixed salaries, such as domestic workers, sex workers and construction labourers. Vulnerable groups The study also looked at vulnerable groups such as garment workers, security staff and retail shop workers. Their current income is in the range of Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 12,500 compared to the monthly income of Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 20,000 before the lockdown, the study noted. Women and the elderly, the most vulnerable and disadvantaged under the informal category, the study found, had experienced difficulty in sustaining existing livelihoods as well as finding jobs. “Informal sector workers, lacking the safety net offered by formal sector employment, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged livelihood loss and a slow revival of trade have continued to stress the lives and livelihoods of these vulnerable groups,” the study observed. Managing essential household expenses, mortgage, access to health care, and diminished employment opportunities are some of the major challenges faced by such families in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/informal-sector-workers-yet-to-recover-from-economic-fallout-of-covid-19/article33937567.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Trucks will not ply today, may block highways in State||In support of the Bharat Bandh on Friday, trucks and cargo transport vehicles will not only stop plying, but are also expected to block all highways in Karnataka. This bandh has been called by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) and All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA) to protest fuel price hike and demand simplification of Goods and Services Tax (GST). While the transport sector has decided to participate in the strike, the State’s trade bodies have only extended moral support. They have decided not to down shutters in view of losses already incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, trade will be affected given that trucks will not be plying. Senior police officials said that they would not allow trucks to hamper traffic movement. “The cost we incur per kilometre has risen from Rs. 28 a year ago to Rs. 40, mainly due to increase in diesel prices. The excise duty is increased whenever international crude oil price is decreased, but when the international crude oil price is increased, the excise duty is not decreased,” said G.R. Shanmugappa, general secretary, South Zone Motor Transporters’ Welfare Association. Threat of indefinite strike from March 15 He listed other woes, including the proposed vehicle scrapping policy and e-way bills. “We are tired of making repeated representations to the government, and have decided to go on an indefinite strike from March 15 across the country, if our demands are not met,” he said. While fuel price hike remains the main pain point for the transport sector, trade bodies are also demanding simplification of the GST Code. “Despite 395 amendments to the GST Code, we are in a mess. This is pushing several MSMEs into extinction. Given the economic situation owing to the pandemic, recession and fuel price hike, only a simplified GST Code can help revive the economy,” said prominent trade activist Sajjan Raj Mehta. Foodgrains trader Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, also a member of FKCCI, said while the traders had extended moral support to the bandh and will submit memorandums to government functionaries in all districts on Friday, businesses won’t be shut down.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/trucks-will-not-ply-today-may-block-highways-in-state/article33937561.ece

In the first phase, luggage handling kiosks will be established in 88 bus stations in Karnataka and 21 outside the State, totalling 109, which will be expanded further. The RTCs have selected a private firm, Strategic Outsourcing Pvt. Ltd., as a business facilitator for the next five years. The firm will put up kiosks, handle booking, loading and unloading of parcels. “The three RTCs presently earn an average of Rs. 8.5 lakh a day, adding up to Rs. 40 crore in annual revenue. But a lot of potential is unexplored in this sector. With the new cargo service, we expect this revenue to at least double to Rs. 80 crore,” said Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi on Thursday. In the coming days, there are plans to expand the programme into a door-delivery service in selected cities, he added. The parcels will be insured. A software has been developed to help users track their parcels. A 24/7 call centre – 18002085533 and 8884445552 – has been launched. The services will be flagged off by Chief Minister B.S.

While activists working for the welfare of manual scavengers peg the number at 25,000, a pilot survey of six districts, including Bengaluru, identified a total of 1,720 manual scavengers. K.B. Obalesh, State convenor of Safai Karmacharis Kaval Samiti, said manual scavenging was prevalent in at least in 98 wards where the sanitary infrastructure is absent. The BWSSB, he pointed out, had around 150 jetting and sucking machines. “Just around 100 are used by the Board, which is grossly insufficient to cover the city. This is why citizens hire private service providers,” he said. He claimed that there was no coordination between Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), BWSSB, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The BBMP was entrusted with the job of surveying and identifying manual scavengers with the objective of rehabilitating them to take up alternate jobs. In the first survey taken up in May 2013, only 201 manual scavengers were identified. Another survey was taken up in Rajarajeshwarinagar, Mahadevapura, South, West and East zones where 1,138 manual scavengers were identified. According to S.G. Raveendra, BBMP Special Commissioner (Welfare), the third survey, with focus on outer zones, is almost complete. “The number of manual scavengers are being re-verified for three zones, including Yelahanka and Dasarahalli,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/practice-prevalent-in-at-least-in-98-wards/article33937556.ece

The announcement was made to attract voters and ensure the victory of Congress candidate B. Narayanrao in the last Assembly elections. When I became the Chief Minister in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, I allocated Rs. 670 crore for irrigation projects in Bidar district instead of taking up the Anubhava Mantapa project. Now, the BJP government has again announced the construction of Anubhava Manatapa keeping an eye on Basavakalyan by-elections. Priorities are misplaced in the Yediyurappa government. Funds are not being released to the projects and programmes that were announced in the budget and approved in the Assembly. The Chief Minister is releasing funds to projects that were approved in the Cabinet such as buying new vehicles to Ministers,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said.

According to officials, tension had been brewing between the rival organisations for the past couple of days. On Wednesday, both the RSS and SDPI activists took out separate protest marches. They, later, clashed at Nagankulankara Junction resulting in the death. Another RSS activist K.S. Nandhu who suffered serious injuries has been recuperating at a private hospital in Ernakulam. His severed right elbow was re-attached through a six-hour-long surgery. Shops vandalised The investigation into the murder is being conducted by a special investigation team. The arrested were booked for murder, conspiracy, attempt to murder and evidence destruction. The BJP observed a dawn-to-dusk hartal in the district on Thursday in protest against the murder. The hartal turned violent at Cherthala, where a few shops and vehicles belonging to SDPI activists and sympathisers were torched and vandalised. District Collector A. Alexander imposed Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) at Cherthala and Ambalappuzha taluks until Saturday. SDPI district president Thahir M.M. alleged that the RSS was unleashing violence in the district. He said that RSS workers had attacked the SDPI Cherthala mandalam committee office and destroyed flag poles of the party across the district.

Initiated by the State government, the exhibition will feature the artworks of 267 malayali artists from India and abroad, making it one of the largest art exhibitions ever to involve Malayali artists on a global scale. “Most artists, including me, are confined to homes for the past several months. This inspired many of us to profoundly think about our home, surroundings, and the world. These poignant thoughts led to the creation of the exhibition ‘Lokame Tharavadu’,” Mr. Krishnamachari said in a statement.  Bounceback He said that similar to various other sectors, the Malayali artist community also suffered a lot owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The exhibition is an effort in collaboration with the State government to recover from the setbacks faced by the artist community,” Mr. Krishnamachari said.  267 artists Of the 267 Malayali artists invited to the exhibition, 14 are actively practising art in the Netherlands, France, United States of America, Australia, Turkey, Germany, England, Oman, Kuwait, the U.A.E and so on. Further, 81 artists are working and living in different parts of India. ‘Lokame Tharavadu’ will be held across six venues in the two districts. In Alappuzha, the exhibition will be held across five venues: Kerala State Coir Corporation, New Model Society Building, Port Museum, William Goodcare and Sons Pvt. Ltd., and The Alleppey Company, thus making the gala a blend of art, culture, and heritage. Besides, the exhibition will take place at Durbar Hall Art Gallery, Ernakulam. Parallel to the exhibition, a series of cultural programmes, conferences, and artist talks involving prominent performers, musicians, writers, and academics from Kerala and outside are planned.

26 February 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Joint bid to curb illegal timber trade||The Revenue and Forest departments in Wayanad have joined hands to curb illegal timber trade in the wake of the recent felling of rosewood trees and their smuggling in the district. A joint meeting of senior officials of the departments here recently decided to shift all reserved rosewood logs that have been felled in Wayanad by a timber lobby to the Kuppady timber depot at the earliest. The lobby had cut 82 rosewood trees which were centuries old and dumped them on 15 sites spread over nine villages in the district, D.K. Vinod Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests (Northern Circle) Kannur, told The Hindu after the meeting. “If the logs are stolen or damaged from the site before shifting it to the depot, the land owners will be responsible for it, and they may be prosecuted as per the provisions of the Kerala Land Conservancy Act,” Mr. Vinod Kumar said. According to the Act, the “pattadars” are duty-bound to protect the trees which are government property. They would be liable for any damage to the property and if found guilty, they could get a punishment which can cancel the “patta” or lead to recovery of the amount which may be three times higher than the damage caused to the government, he said. The issue came to light after Forest Department officials seized 54 pieces of illegal rosewood timber logs worth Rs. 60 lakh from a saw mill at Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district on February 9. The logs were transported by one Roji Augustine on behalf of a timber company in the district. Roji is now absconding. As the accused was threatening officials and timber merchants over the phone, officials have asked the district administration to arrest him with police help. District Collector Adeela Abdulla and senior officials of the Forest and Police departments attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/forest-revenue-depts-join-hands-to-curb-illegal-timber-trade/article33937223.ece

26 February 2021||Kannur,KERALA||The Man Who Sold His Skin steals show||The Man Who Sold His Skin captivated the audience on the third day of the Thalassery leg of the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala on Thursday. As many as 24 films were screened on Thursday, including four films in the competition category.  The Man Who Sold His Skin was screened in the World Cinema category. Directed by Tunisian writer and filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, the film portrays the life of a young Syrian man named Sam Ali. Sam Ali flees from Lebanon to escape war, and his desire to travel to Europe to be with his girlfriend forces him to accept a deal in which he has to offer his body as a canvas to a tattoo artist. The realisation that his own body is becoming a canvas for great art work changes Sam Ali’s outlook on life. Another notable film was Karie. Written and directed by Shanavas Naranipuzha, the film deals with caste system in society. It weaves a story around two friends who travel through places to conduct a ritual on behalf of their colleague who works abroad. The film was screened in the homage section. Shot in the background of Malabar, it discusses the complexities of the caste system.  God on Balcony , set in a remote village of Assam, revolves around the story of Khagen, a farmer who struggles to carry the dead body of his wife on his bicycle from the hospital due to the non-availability of an ambulance. Malayalam films Biriyani and Vasanthi received  the audience’s applause. Other films that were screened included Kuthiraivaal, Attention Please, Vaanku , Wife of a Spy , Summer of 85 , Yellow Cat , 200 meters and Needle Park Baby.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-man-who-sold-his-skin-steals-show/article33937219.ece
26 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||‘Deadly curve’ claims nine lives in six months||The accident-prone curve near the Elamkulam metro station on SA Road claimed the life of two young motorbike riders on Wednesday midnight, taking the number of casualties in the area in the past six months to nine. The most accident-prone spot in the city has witnessed eight fatal accidents since September 2020. “All but one victim [an autorickshaw driver who died after he lost control of his vehicle] were young two-wheeler riders, and all the accidents took place at night,” said T.B. Vijayan, Assistant Commissioner, City Traffic Police. The two youths who were killed in the accident around 1.30 a.m. were identified as Vishal, 25, and Sumesh, 22, of Kudumbi Colony, Elamkulam. One of them was employed at a private bank, while the other was into online delivery of goods. Preliminary reports and CCTV footage suggested that the riders were over-speeding, the Kadavanthra police said. In the light of a spree of fatal and non-fatal accidents at the curve between metro pillars 819 and 826, the police had in December 2020 directed Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) to install reflective sign boards and cat’s eye reflectors to enhance the visibility of road markings. Faced with flak for delay in getting them done, following a fatal accident in January, the metro agency had installed reflectors at the curve to forewarn motorists. Although the Kochi Corporation owns SA Road, KMRL is responsible for its upkeep, since the year-long defect-liability period of its resurfacing completed in August 2020 has not expired. Mr. Vijayan said the spree of accidents at the curve after the road was resurfaced points to over-speeding and the need to probably correct the ‘banking curve’, if needed. The help of the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) has been sought to identify potential problems and suggest remedial measures. “Police presence had been stepped up at the area during the past month. Personnel bearing LED light batons were at the spot from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. The accident involving a power-packed high-end bike occurred a few minutes later,” he added. Perhaps a combination of blinker lights, rumble strips on the road, and flexi-tubes having reflectors might help forewarn motorists. Almost all bike riders hit metro pillars or light poles after being thrown off the vehicles. Constructing speed-breakers on the road to reduce riders’ speed might result in accidents involving those who drive carefully as well, since they will be caught unawares, Mr. Vijayan said. Sources in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, the agency that executed KMRL’s metro and road restoration projects, said no change was made in the road’s alignment or the curvature, while resurfacing it. Drunk driving Enforcement RTO (Ernakulam) Shaji Madhavan confided that accidents at the curve involved youth driving in an inebriated state or without helmet, late at night. “The power-packed bike involved in the latest accident was priced over Rs. 2 lakh. A forensic team examined the spot and concluded that the bike had hit the median and lost control. The MVD has sought the permission of the Traffic Advisory Committee to deploy Artificial Intelligence-aided, number plate recognition and speed detection cameras at the locale, to rein in accidents,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/deadly-curve-claims-nine-lives-in-six-months/article33937678.ece
26 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||SC to fix payment mode for apartment owners||The Supreme Court will shortly fix the payment mode for the builder to compensate apartment owners of Alfa Serene, one of the four apartment complexes that were razed for violating Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. The apex court had on Wednesday asked the builders of Golden Kayaloram and Jain Coral Cove, the two other buildings that were demolished, to deposit a portion of the money they owed to the owners. The cases of Alfa Serene and H2O Holy Faith have been scheduled for March 10. Alfa Ventures, builders of the Alfa Serene apartment complex, has submitted a proposal before the apex court for compensating the owners. The company will also take steps to honour the Supreme Court verdict in this regard, sources said. Meanwhile, in an affidavit submitted before the Supreme Court, the company noted that 70 apartment owners had together paid the builder Rs. 32.09 crore for the apartments. It was the Justice Balakrishnan Nair Committee appointed by the Supreme Court to oversee the distribution of compensation that calculated the money paid by the owners to the builder, which is also the compensation component the builder has to pay, the affidavit noted. The State government has paid Rs. 17.5 crore to the apartment owners following the Supreme Court order that each apartment owner shall be paid Rs. 25 lakh each for rehabilitation. Of the 70 owners, 16 chose not to claim additional compensation from the builders, indicated the affidavit. After deducting the compensation provided by the government, Rs. 14.59 needs to be paid to the owners. A Chartered Valuator had estimated the value of the 1.73 acre holding where the apartment once stood at Rs. 14.58 crore. Moreover, an amount of Rs. 45 lakh is in the bank account of the company, which has been frozen, the firm submitted before the court. Once the apex court issues order on payment of compensation, the company will abide by it, company sources indicated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sc-to-fix-payment-mode-for-apartment-owners/article33937671.ece
26 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||NATPAC to suggest measures to prevent accidents||Thiruvananthapuram-based National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) will conduct a detailed study of the accident-prone curve at Elamkulam on SA Road and suggest remedial measures, its Director Samson Mathew has said. This follows a request from the City Traffic Police and the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), in the wake of recurring accidents in the area. A spot inspection will be done and a report submitted to the Kerala Road Safety Authority. It will be forwarded to the agency that maintains the road, which ought to execute remedial measures. “NATPAC has been associated with accident-prevention measures in 140 accident-prone black spots across Kerala. Of them, 66 are on national highways, and the rest on other roads. The agency which owns the road has to improve the engineering and allied aspects of each black spot to prevent accidents,” Mr. Mathew said. Inspection During the past two months, the traffic police had carried out a joint inspection of accident-prone spots in the city along with officials of various agencies, said Aishwarya Dongre, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic, Law and Order). “We are also in touch with NATPAC to improve the state of affairs. This collective effort at lessening accidents will continue. A holistic approach is being adopted, since it was observed that driver’s fault is not the cause for all accidents. Road safety measures were further stepped up in connection with the Road Safety Week observance in January. Apart from awareness programmes through media, police presence was stepped up at night,” she added. Poor road engineering Among those who inspected the accident spot at Elamkulam was P.T. Thomas, MLA. “A major reason for frequent accidents could be unscientific road engineering. I have directed the District Collector to urgently intervene in the issue and ask the district-level Road Safety Committee to allot funds to install surveillance cameras and clearly-visible boards to prevent accidents here. Steps must also be taken to lessen the speed of vehicles on the newly resurfaced stretch,” he said. Mayor M. Anilkumar said he had convened two meetings to discuss ways to avert accidents at the curve. “It is sad that fatalities are continuing, despite readying preventive measures,” he added. Meanwhile, District Collector S. Suhas said he had issued instructions to stakeholders (the police and the Kochi Corporation which owns the road) to take steps to mitigate accidents. “Moreover, an initiative under the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has been envisaged, and it will be implemented as soon as we receive funds,” he informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/natpac-to-suggest-measures-to-prevent-accidents/article33937679.ece

Anilkumar. The Mayor, accompanied by civic representatives and officials, inspected the building on Thursday. It was in 2006 that the construction of the building began. However, work was stalled two years later owing to discrepancies in the estimate. Work resumed in 2015 after revision of the initial estimate to Rs. 18.7 crore from Rs. 12.7 crore. However, it did not progress as expected, said a communication from the Mayor. Meanwhile, litigations broke out between the corporation and the contractor, which further delayed work. Cases are pending in the Kerala High Court, the communication added. While agreeing to wait for a High Court ruling on the Rs. 8 crore claim put forward by the contractor, the corporation and the contractor arrived at a consensus to resume work. The civic body has agreed to pay Rs. 1.82 crore to the contractor who has offered to resume work, the communication said. A time table for the remaining work has been drawn up, and funds will be made available for the purpose. The new office building will have modern facilities and will be a disabled-friendly building.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-corpn-building-will-be-ready-next-year-says-mayor/article33937681.ece

26 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Drive against peddling of tobacco products||The seizure of two loads of banned tobacco products at Perumbavoor earlier this week seems to have exposed a thriving business model centred on rented shop rooms and houses. The Perumbavoor police had on Sunday seized banned tobacco products from 12 shop rooms that eventually filled up two tipper lorries following a drive focussed on rented rooms on the direction of K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Since then, Mr. Karthik has formed a special investigation team (SIT) led by Deputy Superintendent of Police N.R. Jayaraj to probe the incident. “We are after the organised network behind the large-scale smuggling in of tobacco products,” said Mr. Karthik. The rooms from which the products were seized had been shut for long, according to neighbours. Several shop rooms, which were closed down following the lockdown and have not opened since then, seem to be easily available for such clandestine activities. “The 12 rooms seem to have been converted into storerooms for banned tobacco products, which were then surreptitiously retrieved in the night for sale in smaller lots,” said Rahul Raveendran, Station House Officer, Perumbavoor, and a member of the SIT. The police have identified nearly 50 different types of tobacco products popular among migrant workers. Since the seizure from shuttered shop rooms, the police have expanded their surveillance to line buildings with multiple rooms rented out to migrants. Building owners They plan to arraign in the building owners as co-accused to force them to look beyond mere profit while renting out space. “Previously, tobacco products were openly sold along streets. But that has now stopped since we stepped up action along with the Excise,” said Mr. Raveendran. The police, however, remain handicapped by the relatively minor punishment that entails the seizure of tobacco products. It is considered a compoundable offence with a maximum fine of Rs. 10,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drive-against-peddling-of-tobacco-products/article33937810.ece

The court ordered that mobile medical units be pressed into service without fail in colonies where hospitals and primary health centres were located far away. The court directed that the government ensure the roads already formed in colonies were properly maintained. The fund available for distribution among the tribal people under any scheme should be paid to them, and if arrears were there, it should be paid within 30 days.

Sarangi, former Vice Chancellor of Bhubaneswar-based Ravenshaw University; member coordinator Kinnari Thakkar, economic professor at Bombay University; and member Praveen Martis S.J., former principal of St. Aloysius College (Autonomous), Mangaluru. Report soon While the delegation is expected to submit its report shortly after its visit, the college remains expectant of the highest possible grading. The NAAC team met Principal Mathew George and academic council and governing council members, besides visiting various departments. They also had an interaction with students, parents, and alumni. The day’s proceedings were wrapped up with a cultural fete by students. The reassessment and subsequent meetings and interactions between NAAC delegation and the college authorities were held in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol and the pandemic-related guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The number of persons attending the meetings was also restricted. The team will inspect the college ground on Friday morning before concluding its visit in the evening. This is the fourth-level reassessment of the college, which received three-star rating on February 7, 2000, followed by A grade on May 21, 2006, and A grade with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.11 on March 23, 2013. The reassessment by NAAC is usually held every five years. But Maharaja’s College started functioning as an autonomous institution during the 2015-16 academic year, thus making the reassessment due only in 2020, as the accreditation was extended till December 2019. The college had submitted the Self Study Report (SSR) in time, and the NAAC reassessment was scheduled for January last year but was postponed in the wake of the pandemic outbreak.

Found at Parippally According to police officials, Nidhin is mentally unstable and has a history of lifting vehicles parked on the roadside for his personal use and later abandoning them. “All vehicles he stole were retrieved and he has never tried to sell any of them,” an official said. On the day of the theft, he had travelled from Chengannur to Pandalam by foot and then hitch-hiked to reach the Kottarakara bus stand. “He arrived there around 9.30 p.m. and after finding out that the next service to Parippally was at 5.30 a.m., he decided to lift a bus. He took the bypass route to reach Parippally, and after arriving in his destination, he left the bus there,” the official added. Later, Nidhin moved to Palakkad and he was working in a service station when the arrest was made. RAC 354-KL 15/7508 Venad bus from the Kottarakara depot was reported missing on February 8 and later found near Parippally. The driver had parked the bus near the municipal office the day before and the KSRTC authorities could not find the bus anywhere near the depot. After a search to confirm that the bus had been stolen, the officials had filed a case with the Kottarakara police. Later, the bus was found abandoned at Parippally. The police had collected CCTV footage to identify the thief and Nidhin was traced with the help of the cyber cell by tracking his mobile phone tower location.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-held-for-stealing-ksrtc-bus/article33937280.ece

In the meeting attended by high officials from both the districts, it was decided to work together in enforcing the norms. “The district administration and various departments, including the police, Health, Forest, and Excise and the Motor Vehicles Department, should work together for the safety of people residing in the border areas during and after the polls. Regular inspections will be held in the border regions by various department heads,” said Kollam Collector B. Abdul Nasar. Inflow of alcohol It was also decided in the meeting to step up surveillance at check-posts and set up extra check-posts or mobile units if necessary. A WhatsApp group of officials from both the districts will be formed to monitor alcohol-selling outlets and block the inflow of contraband liquor. “The officials from Kollam and Tenkasi should cooperate with each other in all border-related activities. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance of all poll-related instructions and protocol. Excise and Forest officials from both the districts should maintain a good rapport and join forces for conducting the polls in a hassle-free manner,” said Tenkasi District Collector G.S. Sameeran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-tenkasi-collectors-hold-talks-to-ensure-smooth-polls/article33937273.ece
26 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||UDF in a quandary over seat-sharing in Kottayam||As seat-sharing talks in the United Democratic Front (UDF) gather momentum ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections, the assertion of rights by the Congress and the P.J. Joseph group over the seats where the Jose K. Mani-led Kerala Congress (M) had contested previously seems to have put the coalition in a quandary. Of the nine Assembly constituencies in Kottayam, the coalition has almost arrived at a consensus over the candidates in as many as four seats, including Pala. The candidates in four out of the five remaining seats where both parties look to affirm their presence, however, will be finalised only after multiple rounds of discussions. While the Kerala Congress of Mr. Joseph initially sought to contest in all the six seats it had contested previously, the Congress, which looks to expand its presence across the region using the space vacated by the Mani group, is keen on allotting the regional party not more than three seats. They have also not responded favourably to a demand by Mr. Joseph to allot an additional seat instead of handing over the Pala seat to Mani C. Kappan, MLA. Hard bargain “The seats of Kottayam, Puthuppally, and Kaduthuruthy will go to the sitting legislators — Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, Oommen Chandy, and Mons Joseph respectively. At the same time, Mr. Kappan has already given an assurance on Pala. Of the remaining five seats, Vaikom traditionally belongs to the Congress while both the Congress and Joseph group will have to drive a hard bargain for the Changanassery, Poonjar, Kanjirappally, and Ettumanur seats,” pointed out a senior UDF leader. To complicate the matters further, the Kerala Janapaksham (Secular) led by P.C. George, MLA, is persisting with his efforts to join the coalition despite the strong protests at the grassroots, especially at Erattupetta. “In that case, the Poonjar seat too will have to be taken out of the discussions as in the case of Pala,” the leader added. The Left Democratic Front, on the other hand, is learned to have assured the Kerala Congresss (M) of allotting it all of its sitting seats, including Kanjirappally. The Communist Party of India, which previously contested from the seat, is likely to get Changanassery or Poonjar instead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-in-a-quandary-over-seat-sharing-in-kottayam/article33937281.ece

Four out of the six large paintings at the show are different with simple drawings surrounded by a series of words that denote the infinity. The words have been taken from two works of the late Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, Bhoomiyude Avakashikal and Anaswaraprakasam . The latter is a work without full stops that form a major component of the paintings. The expo also includes two sculptures ‘Fate the nascency’, which is a thought process on environment depicted in the form of an eagle ready to take off, and ‘Cogent Arc’, which looks like just a glass box on a pedestal and is a take on the lack of creative thinking in art.

This was going to be a mass convention, where local residents would also share their opinion on the issue, they said. This is the first time that a “river summit” is being held to draw the attention of the authorities. The Kerala River Protection Committee has also come up with its support for the initiative.

26 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||When a poem becomes a musical hit||Purists may not agree, but poetry can also be enjoyed when it is accompanied by music. Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri certainly enjoyed listening to one of his early poems Balyakala Sakhi in G. Venugopal's gentle voice, set to lilting music by Suresh Manimala. Venugopal included it in his first album of poems, Kavyaragam . “I think Balyakala Sakhi is now the most popular of all Namboothiri’s poems because so many people listened to the album, and we all know that very few actually spend time to read poetry,” he told The Hindu over phone. “In one of his speeches, he had thanked me for making the poem popular.” The poem was born from a very personal experience the poet had when he was young. It is sweet and poignant, like first love, the poem’s subject. “It was the first poem that came to my mind when I decided to include Namboothiri in my album,” recalled Venugopal. “I was introduced to him by my cousin S. Vinaya Kumar while I was a school student.” The singer said he wanted to pay the poet for using his poem in the album. “But I didn't know how he would react, so I just made him sit in my car and drove around Thiruvananthapuram city and finally managed to take the cheque out of my pocket,” said Venugopal. “He refused. He made me drive to the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy and asked me to deposit it there.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-a-poem-becomes-a-musical-hit/article33937309.ece

In his representation to Vice-Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj, K.

Boy students were now staying in the academic block of the institution and the adjacent building under the Health Department. Only girls had been given hostel facility. Though land was available for the construction of a boys’ hostel, funds were reportedly not available, Mr. Sivaraman claimed. He said that preliminary steps for the setting up of the institute were taken way back in 2011. Mr. Sivaraman was a member representing the Scheduled Castes. I.C. Balakrishnan, MLA, for Sulthan Bathery, had allocated Rs. 50 lakh. Then United Democratic Front government had issued a special order for the utilisation of funds, he said.

26 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||A bicycle rider etched in collective memory||Widely respected as a poet, scholar and teacher, Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri who passed away on Thursday was a familiar face to the people of Thiruvananthapuram. Until a few years ago, it was not uncommon to see the poet, khadi-clad and riding a bicycle, on the city streets. Some years ago, during an interaction with schoolchildren, he had this to say, “It’s true that I travel by bicycle, but that is because I do not know to ride any other vehicle. I have been wearing only khadi from the age of six because that helps families involved in the weaving of the cloth.” On Thursday, a large number of people, many of them former students, visited Sreevalli, the poet’s home at Thycaud, to pay their last respects. “He was someone who practised what he preached. He never taught me, but nonetheless he was a role model. He used to live near us years ago, and I often came across him riding his bicycle to college to teach. As a human being, he was as pure as a dewdrop,” recalled former Chief Secretary Jiji Thomson. Priest crosses the ocean The poet came across as a mild-mannered, smiling personality, but his progressive and revolutionary ideas and actions often did not sit well with many. Once, during his stint as a priest at the Sri Vallabha Temple at Thiruvalla in the 1990s, he travelled to the U.K. for a lecture. This created a hue and cry with a section demanding his removal as priest as he had dared cross the ocean. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan described Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri as a poet who modernised traditions and harmonised them with the new times. Mr. Vijayan, in a condolence message, recalled two occasions when the “forces of intolerance” attacked the poet; once when his poem was included in the college syllabus, and the other, when, as a priest, he crossed the ocean. His death is a great loss to the culture and language of the State and to progressive values, he said. Eco-campaigner The poet was part of campaigns to save the environment, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member M.A. Baby recalled. He was at the forefront of the environment struggle in Aranmula and penned a poem to express his solidarity, Mr. Baby said. Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri, who taught English at various government colleges across the State, had retired as head of the department at the University College after a teaching career spanning over three decades in 1994. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan condoled the death stating that in Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri’s works, modernity blended with Indianness, evolving a new sensibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-bicycle-rider-etched-in-collective-memory/article33937799.ece

26 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Data combing on for State’s academic diaspora||The Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) has begun data combing for Keralite scientists, social scientists, technologists, and humanities scholars of universities and research institutions abroad. The endeavour is aimed at building a database for its brain-gain and brain-circulation scheme. Commissioned by the State Planning Board, the project aims at attracting and integrating the State’s academic diaspora as short-term teachers, part-time collaborators, and co-supervisors in research. According to council vice chairman P.M. Rajan Gurukkal, the data search covers medical professionals, digital wizards, science-tech hybrid field experts, and specialists in environment, biodiversity, climate change, and disaster management who have been working in global institutions. Focus areas The avenues have been identified in line with the government’s focus on public health, information justice, social security, equitable knowledge economy, and sustainable development, he said. Prof. Gurukkal stressed the need to locate experts in such fields that were relevant for the transformation of higher education to a knowledge economy that depended on production, consumption, and exchange of intellectual property. “The scheme seeks to identify experts in high-tech industries dealing with intangible assets and invite them for redesigning the higher education curricula and reorienting the research domain,” he said. The endeavour is also seen as certain to boost the Erudite Scholar-in-Residence programme that brought Nobel laureates to the universities and colleges in the State. Faced with the task of culling out the Keralite diaspora academics from among luminaries spread across the world, the council will rely on data obtained from the Indian Research Information Network System (IRINS), a web-based research information management service developed by the Information and Library Network Centre. An indirect search through peer contacts of the faculty of universities in the State and premier institutions in the country is another route that the council intends to pursue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/data-combing-on-for-states-academic-diaspora/article33937321.ece
26 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Congress seeks to mobilise fisherfolk against LDF||The Congress on Thursday sought to make political capital out of the “growing mistrust” in the fishing community about the Left Democratic Front government’s exploratory agreements with a U.S.-based firm to trawl the deep-seas off Kerala. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala staged a day-long sit-in at Poonthura here to mobilise the coastal community’s opinion against the LDF and cement the party’s standing among fishers. Mr. Chennithala flourished a freshly caught tuna and said foreign trawlers would soon rob fishers of the ocean’s bounty. A fleet of fishing trawlers would invade their traditional fishing grounds if the LDF came back to power. ‘In abeyance’ The LDF had merely kept in abeyance the proposal. The company planned to recruit local fishers to crew the vessels to circumvent the ban on foreign trawlers, Mr. Chennithala said and added that the government had conspired to facilitate the false flag operation. The Congress expose had forced the government to walk back from the accords. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma and Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan were the prime movers behind the surreptitiously signed secret pact. The political executive owed the fishers an explanation. It had tried to shrug off responsibility by scapegoating officials, he said. In view of the raging controversy, the government had already cancelled the Rs. 5,000-crore “exploratory agreement” the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) had struck with EMCC International to build a network of modern fishing harbours linked to an industrial-scale marine product processing centre in Alappuzha. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran inaugurated the sit-in. All India Congress Committee general secretary Tariq Anwar attended the valedictory meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-seeks-to-mobilise-fisherfolk-against-ldf/article33937319.ece
26 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CM calls for expediting vaccination||The State will appeal to the Centre to make COVID-19 vaccines available at reasonable rates through drug distributors in the private sector so that the vaccination of the general public can be completed at a faster pace. Along with strong containment measures, it was essential that the vaccination of the general public against COVID-19 was completed as fast as possible as this would help reduce disease transmission, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told mediapersons here on Thursday. The pace at which COVID-19 vaccination was moving now, it would take a very long time before the process could be completed and the general public could be fully vaccinated against the disease. At a time when disease transmission was going up and many States were on the verge of a second COVID-19 wave, vaccination process had to be expedited, he said. Kerala, especially, is now paying the price for the better containment strategies it adopted to keep COVID-19 from spreading across the population. A chunk of the State’s population still remained susceptible to the disease, while in the neighbouring Karnataka, nearly 46% of the population may already have been exposed to the virus (according to ICMR sero survey) and hence was immune. Need for extra stock Considering this special situation in the State, Kerala should be allocated additional vaccine stocks, Kerala has written to the Centre. The Health Department is already in touch with the Centre about making vaccination available to a section of the priority groups who had missed receiving the first vaccine dose. Mr. Vijayan claimed that it was because of better data integrity that Kerala appeared to be faring worse when it comes to COVID-19 transmission. If Kerala seemed to be having more cases when the rest of India did not, it just meant that Kerala was effectively detecting and reporting more cases, the Chief Minister claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-wants-private-sector-to-join-vaccination-drive/article33937285.ece

Mr. Viswam, who has been leading the southern leg of the LDF’s Vikasana Munnetta Jatha, was speaking to mediapersons in Attingal on Thursday, the second day of the rally’s three-day tour of Thiruvananthapuram. Endorsing the government’s decision to withdraw cases against people involved in the Sabarimala and anti-Citizen Amendment Act protests, the MP maintained that the government did not err in its handling of the controversy over women’s entry to the shrine. Mr. Viswam dubbed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s visit to coastal areas mere political gimmick. Accusing the Congress of protecting the Italian marines who allegedly killed two fishermen during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s rule, he deplored Mr. Gandhi’s failure to visit the families of the two victims in Neendakara. Referring to the controversy surrounding the deep-sea fishing project, Mr. Viswam said the LDF government would never hesitate to correct any action that did not auger well for the State. The CPI leader added that the Congress, hand in glove with the BJP in most issues, was facing declining popularity. The fall of the Congress government in Puducherry was testimony to its dwindling relevance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/devotees-not-foes-of-ldf-says-mp/article33937803.ece

26 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Yogi, Rahul attacking LDF in one voice: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had spoken in one voice to attack the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala. Both the leaders were in the State recently to campaign against the LDF in the Assembly polls. Mr. Gandhi’s intervention in provincial politics seemed unusual for a national leader. He drove a tractor in Wayanad and swam in the sea in Thiruvananthapuram to voice support to farmers and fishers, respectively. However, he had turned a blind eye to the farmer’s agitation in New Delhi, Mr. Vijayan said. Cong. policies The Congress’s neo-liberal policies had rid farmers of the State support and protection since 1990. It had cast them at the mercy of global market forces. Farmers in Mr. Gandhi’s Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency had suffered the most, he said. The prices of coffee, pepper, rubber and other cash crops plummeted, driving cultivators to despair and poverty. The BJP has emulated Congress's economic policy. Since 1990, an estimated three lakh farmers in the country had committed suicide. The State had bucked the trend due to LDF’s pro-farmer policy, Mr. Vijayan said.  Least corrupt State Mr. Adityanath equalled Mr. Gandhi by portraying Kerala as a land riven with corruption and anarchy. Kerala was the least corrupt State in the country, according to a Transparency International study. In contrast, UP ranked first. Mr. Adityanath said unemployment had forced Keralites to flee to foreign shores. He has no clue about the storied history of the highly successful Malayalee diaspora, the Chief Minister said. Conversely, Mr. Vijayan said 16% of migrant workers in Kerala hailed from U.P. “Had they also fled their home State in search of jobs,” Mr. Vijayan asked. He assured Mr. Adityanath that the workers were in safe hands in Kerala. Unlike U.P., Kerala has not witnessed any communal riots since 2016. U.P. reported the highest number of communal riots, murders, lynchings and crimes against women. Recently, an armed gang killed eight police officers in Mr. Adityanath’s U.P. Both Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Adityanath had resorted to election hyperbole. Keralites were inherently secular and deeply democratic. They would see through the Congress-BJP election hoax, Mr. Vijayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/yogi-rahul-attack-ldf-in-one-voice-says-pinarayi/article33937274.ece

Without naming KSINC MD N. Prasanth, Mr. Vijayan said the move contravened the government’s fisheries policy. It had worked to the advantage of forces intent on causing disaffection among fisherfolk with the administration. The KSINC move had caught the government by surprise. T.K. Jose, Additional Chief Secretary, Home, is inquiring into the circumstances that led to the KSINC entering into an accord with EMCC. ‘No knowledge’ The MD had signed the purported Rs. 5,000-crore exploratory agreement without the Principal Secretary or the Minister's knowledge. The memorandum of understanding was of little legal or contractual value. It was not an enforceable agreement. However, the government cancelled it immediately because it ran against the grain of the LDF government's fisheries policy and was patently anti-fisherfolk, Mr. Vijayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksinc-md-blind-sided-govt-says-pinarayi/article33937320.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A true Indian poet alive to social concerns||Vishnu Narayanan Namboothiri was truly an Indian poet. Not in the constricted sense in which ‘Indianness’ is spoken about these days, but in terms of his deep understanding of the Upanishads, the ancient texts, especially of Kalidasa, and the literary and philosophical tradition in general. Although deeply rooted in the classical tradition, he was among the first in Malayalam poetry to wake up to contemporary social concerns. In that way, you could call him a ‘transitional poet’ who wonderfully integrated in his poetry the classical, romantic, and modernist streams. Themes like ‘loss of identity’ identified with modernism appeared in his poems. And, with poet R. Ramchandran, he collected the pioneering modernist voices in Malayalam poetry in Puthumudrakal in the early days. He stood at the crossroads of classicism and modernism all along. His aesthetics were reflective of the dilemmas of contemporary India, as seen in India Enna Vikaram , even as his sensibility harked back to the classical values. The imprint of Kalidasa was evident in his poetry, including the love poems. But as a Gandhian, he remained alert to the present and was anxious about the erosion of those values in Indian society. He was progressive in a Gandhian sense and his spirituality was ‘cosmic’, not tempered by religious orthodoxy. As a human being, he was unblemished, untouched by jealousy, calumny, and a competitive attitude. That’s precisely why when the Malayali reading class raised the eyebrows at some of his contemporaries for their associations, he was never frowned at. Not even when he became a temple priest post-retirement as an English professor. Empathetic towards the suffering, it was only natural that he sided with poets such as Sugathakumari when there was an uproar to protect the pristine environs of Silent Valley from destruction. Although influenced by poets such as Vyloppilli, the trail he followed was of Vallathol. That is where he should be placed in the Malayalam poetic tradition. ( As told to S. Anandan )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-true-indian-poet-alive-to-social-concerns/article33937294.ece

26 February 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Singamaneni Narayana, noted story writer, dead||Noted story writer with a farmer’s soul Singamaneni Narayana (77) breathed his last here on Thursday after a prolonged age-related illness. He is survived by wife, three daughters, and a son. The last rites will be performed on Friday morning. Born in 1943, Narayana had a deep understanding of the farmers’ sufferings in the drought-prone district. His first story had been published in the ‘Krishna Patrika’ (1960) when he was 17 years. And there was no looking back for him since then, as he went on to pen 43 heart-touching stories that delved into the sufferings of the farmers of the district, who, in the face of recurring drought, water scarcity, and resultant crop failures, were forced to take the extreme step. Hailing from a middle-class family in Bandameedapalli, Narayana had completed his schooling in Anantapur and pursued higher studies in Tirupati. Later, he worked as a Telugu Pundit in various high schools before retiring from service in 2001. Some of his well-known stories and compilations were ‘Joodam’ (1988), ‘Singamaneni Narayana Kadhalu’ (1999), ‘Anantham’ (2007), and ‘Singamaneni Kadhalu’ (2012). He had also written a novel titled ‘Yedari Gulabilu’. In 2017, the government had honoured him with Kala Rathna Award. He was also a recipient of numerous other awards. CPI(M) leader V. Rambhupal and Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy paid floral tributes to Narayana and consoled his family members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/singamaneni-narayana-noted-story-writer-dead/article33937742.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had directed the officials to take up the widening and four- laning of the ‘karakatta’, the stretch leading to the seed access road, the Minister said. The Irrigation Department had been asked to take up the work with an outlay of Rs. 150 crore, he added. Lashing out at the TDP for planting negative reports in the media friendly to it, Mr. Satyanarayana alleged that the same media had never commented when Mr. Naidu chose to ignore development of the Amaravati region. “Who stopped Mr. Naidu from developing the mud bank (karakatta), which is the vital link to the Secretariat? Who stopped Mr. Naidu from building the Iconic Bridge? Had he spent a little time in developing the projects rather than on designs, he would have achieved some tangible progress. People of the region have rejected the TDP as there is no visible development. Mr. Naidu could not complete the widening of the karakatta during his term. He got the Rs. 5500-crore estimation prepared ahead of the elections,” the Minister said. Further, he said the popularity of Mr. Naidu was at its lowest ebb.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-committed-to-developing-amaravati-region-too-botcha/article33937740.ece

26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Task force okays linking Mahanadi with Godavari||The task force on Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) has agreed and approved the preparation of final detailed project report (DPR) on the proposed Mahandi (Barmul)-Godavari (Dowlaiswaram) link by ensuring utilisation of the allocated Godavari waters by Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, en route the link canal of the project. The decision, considered a major foot forward on the interlinking of rivers involving the two Telugu States, has been taken at the 13th meeting of the task force on ILR held in New Delhi on Thursday. The meeting discussed mainly three proposals put forward by the task force chairman based on the draft DPR prepared on the diversion of water from Godavari basin to Cauvery basin. The meeting was chaired by Chairman of the task force Sriram Vedire, who is also Advisor to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Chairman of the Central Water Commission (CWC) S.K. Haldar, Director General of National Water Development Agency (NWDA) Bhopal Singh and several others from the Department of Water Resources and other agencies concerned. The task force deliberated upon several priority links under the Centre’s programme of interlinking of rivers and has taken decisions on how to proceed further on the implementation of such links. The draft DPR on Godavari-Cauvery link was prepared by the NWDA and was circulated among all the Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery Basin States in March 2019. Most of the States conveyed their observations on the draft DPR. On its part, the Telangana government had categorically opposed diversion of Godavari water from Telangana without ensuring utilisation of allocated water within the State first and in case diversion is planned it should be done after diverting/linking excess water in Mahanadi. The Thursday’s meeting discussed the draft DPR at length taking into consideration the comments, objections and suggestions of States to the extent feasible. Chairman of the task force Mr. Sriram has suggested the group to take into consideration two key issues before finalising the DPR. Mr. Sriram said: “The water diversion from Godavari basin, out of allocated share of AP and Telangana in Godavari basin to Krishna or Penner basin will belong to the respective State and it could be utilised as per their planning. However, if such transfers/planning fit into the national perspective, the Centre would extend help in implementing and integrating the two States’ proposals serving their common objectives.” Further, any other water transfer from Godavari to Krishna or Cauvery basin, from out of the unutilised or excess water of other Godavari basin States or by augmentation from Mahanadi or Himalayan river waters, other States in the Krishna or Cauvery basins shall also be considered as the beneficiaries, he suggested. The supplementation from Godavari could be used not only in easing the distress faced by farmers in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu but also allow Kerala and Karnataka use some water in Cauvery basin by substitution. This, he said, should be done only after ensuring the use of allocated waters by Telangana and AP en route the link canal of the interlinking project. “The link will be taken up from Inchampalli as it would benefit the water stressed areas of Telangana en route the link canal as compared to the Janampet location on the Godavari”, Mr. Sriram felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/task-force-on-river-linking-okays-mahandi-godavari-link/article33937657.ece

26 February 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||Viewing Carnatic music from scientific perspective||Classical music, Carnatic in particular, is tagged as fine arts and considered part of humanities subject, but it has a scientific perspective too. A research paper from Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam (SPMVV) not only unearthed the scientific angle behind the South Indian music form, but also bagged the ‘Best Paper Award’ at the global level for the same. The research paper presented by Raghavi Janaswamy, a Ph.D. scholar, and Saraswathi K. Vasudev, professor and head at the all-women university’s Department of Music and Fine Arts, at the 15th International Conference on Classical Music and Music Education (ICCMME 2021) conducted by the World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology (WASET) at Rome (Italy) recently was adjudged the best. In the paper titled ‘Vocal training and practice methods: A glimpse on the south Indian Carnatic music’, the duo narrated some of the traditional training methods with an emphasis on the advanced practice methods for articulating vocal skills, continuity in the voice, ability to produce ‘Gamakams’ and gaining command in multiple speeds. Health benefits “Some sounds are produced from the tongue, some from the throat and some come from deep within. Strengthening the vocal chord is a skill, which we have been imparting to aspiring vocalists. There is immense science behind vocal music,” Prof. Saraswathi Vasudev told The Hindu . While music has a primary role to evoke emotional human responses, mainly the self-evaluative cognitions and attitudes such as self-esteem, self-confidence and self-efficacy, it also has the power to ensure intricate balance between consciousness in the mind and the organ system of human body, the paper concluded. This apart, the duo presented another paper titled ‘Carnatic music Ragas and their role in music therapy’, wherein they dwelt on ‘Raga Chikitsa’, explaining how raga Ananda Bhairavi is used for post operation pain therapy, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is influenced by raga Neelambari and Sankarabharanam and the impact of Hindolam and Todi on normalising blood pressure. “Bagging the international acclaim is certainly music to our ears,” Prof. Saraswathi Vasudev said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/viewing-carnatic-music-from-scientific-perspective/article33937751.ece

26 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Telangana is unresponsive to our pleas’||Notwithstanding the court directive to apportion the assets and liabilities of the Telugu Academy as had existed on June 2 in 2014, between the Andhra Pradesh Telugu Academy Society and the Telugu Academy in Hyderabad, the Telangana government has been unresponsive. The Telangana High Court, on January 22, had directed the Telugu Academy and the governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to bifurcate the Academy as per the provisions of Section 53 (1) of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 within two months. “Despite our repeated efforts to initiate the process of bifurcation, there has been no response from their (Telangana) side. We have been writing letters in vain,” Chairperson of the AP Telugu Academy N. Lakshmi Parvathi said. Speaking to The Hindu on Thursday, she said in a fresh letter addressed to the Chief Secretary of Telangana, she had appealed to release at least part of the joint funds to enable initiate some activities. “Andhra Pradesh has not inherited much in terms of immovable properties, but we have nearly Rs. 300 crore funds. I have asked them to give us at least Rs. 50 crore initially to activate the Academy works,” she said. Calling the court verdict “very positive”, she wondered why it had still not spurred any action from the Telangana side. “We are adopting a very amicable approach. But we also have issues like payment to the staff and other aspects to address,” she said. The court order followed a petition by 17 outsourced employees of the Telugu Academy, all of them appointed on contract/daily-wage basis as data entry operators and hamalis from 2002. Since the Academy was not divided even after the State bifurcation in 2014, they remained under the administrative control of the Telugu Academy in Hyderabad. Though the petitioners are working in the regional centres in the residual Andhra Pradesh, their salaries are paid by the Telangana government. The petitioners said due to their Andhra nativity, they were refused grant of enhanced salary and wages from 2013, while their counterparts in the regional centres in Telangana were given the same. The court asked the Telugu Academy, Hyderabad, to pay wages to the petitioners on a par with the employees in Telangana from December 1, 2019, within six weeks and wanted the Academies in both the States to discuss and agree on the modalities/guidelines for allocation of employees as on June 2, 2014, within two months. The AP Telugu Academy currently has about 60 staff members. A few of them work in Hyderabad and others at the regional centres in Vijayawada, Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur. “For lack of funds, we are unable to print any books. This year, however, we have started with Intermediate books with the help of the Higher Education department and the Board of Intermediate Education,” said Ms. Parvathi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-is-unresponsive-to-our-pleas/article33937745.ece
26 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu seeks probe into Kothavalasa polls||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has appealed to the State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct an inquiry and take stringent action against the officials who erred during the counting process in the Kothavalasa gram panchayat elections in Vizianagaram district. In a letter to the State Election Commissioner on Thursday, Mr. Naidu said that the elections had witnessed “unprecedented violations, manipulations and malpractices.” Elections to the Kothavalasa gram panchayat clearly exposed the violations and manipulations of the ruling YSRCP leaders and a section of officials, he alleged. Boni Tirupati Rao, who was not supported by the YSRCP, had contested for the post of sarpanch there and won the elections by a majority of 268 votes, Mr. Naidu said. “However, the Returning Officer at the counting centre, P. Ramesh Babu, had declared Macha Yerri Ramaswamy, a YSRCP-backed candidate as the winner,” he said. Mr. Tirupati Rao had a majority of 154 votes by the end of the 19th round of counting and secured another 114 votes majority by the end of the final 20th round. In spite of Mr. Tirupati Rao having a clear majority, the Returning Officer had announced Mr. Ramaswamy as the winner, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-seeks-probe-into-kothavalasa-polls/article33937743.ece

In a statement on Thursday, federation president K. Bhanu Murthy and general secretary P. Panduranga Varaprasad Rao cited the example of introduction of biometric attendance system. They said the biometric machines in many schools did not work properly owing to weak signals, and several teachers were unable to regularise their attendance due to low capacity of the servers. Taking exception to the orders issued by the Director of School Education that teachers who had not registered their attendance through biometric system in January should be given memos, they demanded that the order be withdrawn. Citing the app introduced to upload the students’ attendance, they said teachers were struggling with biometrics and apps and this reduced their classroom teaching time. The federation leaders said the objective of bringing in technology should be to ensure transparency and facilitate smooth functioning of schools. But it had turned a burden on teachers in the absence of proper implementation mechanism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/technology-turning-a-bane-for-teachers-says-aptf/article33937847.ece

26 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cleaner air, better sanitation on One Town voters’ wish list||Rising air pollution and a deplorable sanitation system are the two things weighing most heavily on the minds of voters as they look to elect a new municipal council for the first time in 14 years. For people living in One Town area, which comes under Suryabagh area (Zone-IV) of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), cleaner air is something they have been demanding for years. Residents of Kothaveedhi and Town Kotha Road are said to be among the worst-hit when it comes to air pollution in the city limits. “Many residents including myself are suffering from asthma, skin and respiratory issues due to air pollution. The coal dust permeates the air, even inside the houses. Many people have left the colonies despite having their own houses here,” said A Raju, a resident of Kotaveedhi. S. Babu, a resident of Ferry Street, lamented that their pleas have continued to fall on deaf ears. “Governments and administrations have changed, leaders have come and gone, but our problem remains. Though the open conveyors carrying coal and iron ore have now been covered, the pollutions levels have not come down to desirable levels,” he said. Poor sanitation and irregular clearing of drains is another problem that plagues the locals. According to the residents, during rains, the drains overflow in many colonies. Several houses in low-lying areas get inundated every time it rains, they said. “Despite a ban, a number of shopkeepers continue to use plastic. The wastes generated are dumped into the drainages. Sometimes, the drainages are not cleared in time and when it rains, the drains get blocked and sewage water overflows on to the roads,” said G. Markandeya, a resident of Town Kotha Road. V. Lakshmi, a resident of Relli Veedhi, said that a number of times, sewage water has entered her house which is in a low-lying area. A few colonies also face issues with supply of drinking water, she complained.  “Garbage is not cleared properly. The dustbins overflow often and a foul smell emanates. Street dogs and pigs feed on the garbage and it adds to our woes. Many hospitals do not have proper waste disposal system in the area,” said B. Santosh, a resident of Relli Veedhi. Keen contest on cards Among other demands, having a separate hawkers zone is also on the wish list for a number of street vendors from the One Town area. The street vendors often set up shop on the roadside or on footpaths due to lack of adequate spaces. The total electorate in Zone-IV is around 1.98 lakh, including 99,000 women. In the last two Assembly elections, TDP candidate Vasupalli Ganesh was elected. But this time, the contest becomes keener as Mr. Ganesh has pledged his loyalty to the YSR Congress. This opens up a battle between the ruling party and the TDP. Zone-IV has 12 wards, and forms the oldest part of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cleaner-air-better-sanitation-on-one-town-voters-wish-list/article33937870.ece

Chitti Babu on Thursday said rapid disinvestment of public sector units would lead to injustice as the downtrodden sections would be denied reservation facility guaranteed by the Constitution. “The reservation facility to SCs and STs in jobs might not continue if private companies are handed over public sector units such as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, Air India and others, thus impairing the social security of the beneficiaries,” said Mr. Chitti Babu at a roundtable organised by the DBSU and Dalit Ardhik Adhikara Andolan and other organisations. He said meagre allocations to SCs and STs would lead to put a halt to many welfare schemes aimed at providing social security. “The Centre has earmarked only Rs. 1.26 lakh crore for SCs and Rs. 79,000 crore for STs in the Union budget. The allocation has been reduced by almost 50% when compared to that of the precious year,” said Chitti Babu. Resolution passed Moreover, he said, the allocated amount is mostly used for creation of infrastructure, instead of spending on welfare of the beneficiaries. Lok Satta State president T. Raja Rao, Vizianagaram Zilla Abhivriddhi Vedika president P. Shanmukha Rao, Dalita Hakkula Porata Samiti leader Goka Ramesh and others were present in the meeting. The roundtable passed resolutions for allocation of more funds for differently abled persons and exclusive schemes for women hailing from the downtrodden sections of society.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/divestment-will-deny-scs-sts-social-security/article33937775.ece

26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Green scourge plagues Safilguda lake||People visiting the mini tank bund at Safilguda lake in Neredmet area witness a verdant spectacle every day. The spectacle is provided neither by the massive trees lining the lake’s banks nor by the landscaping done by HMDA on the lake bund, but by the water hyacinth weed spread all over the lake with not an inch of respite. Proliferation of the weed speaks for the dysfunctional sewage treatment plant the lake is equipped with, which only partially treats the inflows into the lake. “The lake did not receive much water even during the torrential downpour in October last year. All that enters here is sewage,” said Sumathi, a frequenter to the lake. The lake bund is well developed with walking track, landscaping and seating arrangement, and draws hordes of people for fitness or relaxation. The open gym recently installed by GHMC is a huge success going by the number of people using the equipment. Maintenance of the water body, heavily encroached by several colonies such as Balram Nagar, Dayanand Nagar, and Seetharam Nagar on all sides, leaves a lot to be desired. “We have complained to GHMC several times for de-silting and removal of water hyacinth from the lake, without much result. Due to the weed, the area has an exploding population of mosquitoes,” said Srinivasa Rao, another visitor. To give credit where it is due, GHMC does take lake clean up operations though at irregular intervals, as vouched by locals. On Tuesday too, weed removal was being done at a corner of the lake. This, however, is not enough, as the weed grows back within no time. Controlling the water pollution, and clearing the passage of flood water are the only ways to arrest the scourge. Safilguda lake, also known as Nadimi Cheruvu, is part of a lake system, and receives its flows partially from Ramakrishnapuram lake, and partially from localities nearby. Ramakrishnapuram lake, which is in a pitiable condition despite having been listed as one among the 19 lakes to be developed, is nearly dry. Not much fresh water has entered the lake during the rains, say locals. As part of development and beautification works for the past two years, a walking track has been laid around the water spread area of the lake. It excludes a football ground, part of the several encroachments into the full tank level of the lake. Failure of the efforts to divert sewage is visible from the small ponds of sludge frequented by pigs and buffaloes. “Efforts were made to divert the sewage via the football ground, which had been a private plot inside the lake, the owners of which had forfeited their right. But we faced stiff resistance from locals who did not yield despite several rounds of talks. The alternative they suggested was cumbersome and not possible, leading to an impasse in works,” an official shared on condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/green-scourge-plagues-safilguda-lake/article33937636.ece
26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Parking ticket format prescribed||Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing of GHMC on Thursday prescribed a format for the parking tickets issued to the customers by malls and multiplexes in the city. The ticket should have name and address of the agency along with mobile number, clearly printed on the tickets, the notices issued in the name of the Director, EVDM said. Parking tickets should be issued even in cases where parking fee is exempted. If parking fee is charged, the ticket should be stamped as ‘Paid’ and if exempted, it should be stamped ‘Exempted’. The ticket format also displays details such as date, vehicle number, serial number, ‘In Time’ & ‘Out Time’, duration of parking, shopping bill amount, besides the signature of in-charge on the front side. Overleaf, latest parking rules issued by government in 2018 should be printed. The notices mentioned that the Director, EVDM found certain shortfalls such as parking tickets not being issued to the customers, and complete details along with date & time not being furnished on the tickets. The process of printing tickets in the format mentioned should be completed within a fortnight, after which the Directorate of EVDM will start inspections, and if found lacking in implementation, a penalty of Rs. 50,000 will be imposed as per the Telangana Apartments Act and Rules, 1987, the notices said. As per the government orders issued three years ago with the purpose of regulating the parking fee, no charges should be collected for the first 30 minutes of the parking. Over 30 minutes and up to one hour of parking, no charges will be collected if the customer produces proof of shopping done in the respective mall or multiplex by way of bills. Parking will be charged in case no such bill is produced. For duration over one hour, parking will be free if the customer produces a bill or movie ticket for an amount which is higher than the parking fee for the specific duration.

26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court seeks Labour Secretary’s presence||Expressing dissatisfaction over the government not constituting State Level Social Security Board for workers in unorganised sectors, the Telangana High Court on Thursday instructed the Labour Department secretary to be present for hearing in virtual mode on March 18. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy passed the direction while hearing a PIL plea filed by Congress leader and former Deputy Chief Minister C. Damodar Raj Narsimha. The bench took serious exception to the government’s failure to enforce its orders issued on December 16 last to constitute the board. “It is most unacceptable casual behaviour of officials,” the Chief Justice remarked. Seeking presence of the Labour Department Secretary for the next hearing, the Chief Justice said the court would like to nail down the recalcitrant officers who had an obstinately uncooperative attitude towards implementation of High Court orders. Referring to the board, the bench said its constitution is the government’s responsibility. The board would be of immense utility to poor workers engaged in different unorganised sectors, the bench felt. The petitioner wanted the court to instruct the government to create the board which was pending for past six years. During the previous hearing, the bench instructed the government to constitute the board within four weeks deprecating the casual approach of the officials in its creation. The bench also wanted the authorities to inform it about the status of funds available for the welfare of workers. The Chief Justice Hima Kohli posed a series of questions to the State Labour Commissioner, who appeared for the online hearing. The Commissioner informed the court that he is only holding additional charge of the post, adding that the proposal to constitute the board was already sent to the Labour Department secretary. Declining to accept the contentions of the commissioner, the Chief Justice made it clear that delay in constitution of the board cannot be accepted. She termed the explanations of the commissioner as frivolous and casual.  The court would like to nail down the recalcitrant officers who had an obstinately uncooperative attitude towards implementation of HC orders.

26 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||People will vote out TRS: Jana||Former Minister and senior Congress leader K. Jana Reddy said that no party is indispensable and people would vote out the TRS like they did to the Congress earlier. At a press conference here, he said the ruling TRS is blaming the Congress for all its faults and it cannot escape from public ire faulting others. ‘Arrogant response’ He said the Congress has been cautioning the government on various issues with which people are unhappy with - but the TRS always responded arrogantly. ”When the government is unwilling to listen, how long can we go on criticising them. When we do it repeatedly, they accuse us of being power-hungry," he said in reference to criticism that the Congress had not been seriously fighting against the government. On defections Mr. Jana Reddy rejected the defections from the party as a failure of the leadership. Changes in society, falling morals and rising political ambitions are to be blamed for people leaving the party, he said indicating that ruling parties are encouraging that culture. The senior leader asked the ruling TRS to introspect on employment creation by the Congress party and explain why it failed to implement the unemployment allowance it promised before the elections. Govt. challenged On supply of drinking water through Mission Bhagiratha, he said the government's claims are false. He challenged the government to prove if Bhagiratha is being supplied in 20 or 30 villages he would name. "I will also provide transport for the media and let the government show them," he said. On nominating P.V. Narasimha Rao's daughter Vani Devi as TRS party candidate for MLC elections, he said Congress had made P.V. Narasimha Rao the Prime Minister of the country and no party can provide a better opportunity to that family. Social media cultures He also decried the culture of character-assassination of opponents within the party using social media. It is the responsibility of the leaders to restrain their followers from using abusive language against others within the party, he said. Sometimes leaders are not involved in such practice but when it is done in their name it is better they chide their followers, he said referring to an incident of senior leader V. Hanmantha Rao who was abused. Party leaders have to collectively stop this culture and warn their followers of action or else party will suffer as a whole, he felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/people-will-vote-out-trs-jana/article33937653.ece
26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Complete construction at local body level soon, says Chief Secretary||Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has directed additional collectors who were entrusted with the responsibility of local bodies to ensure completion of construction activities launched at the local body level at the earliest. Several works related to construction of segregation and dumping sheds, vaikuntadhamams and integrated vegetable and non-vegetarian markets are taken up and they should be made functional by next month. The additional collectors should also inspect the gram panchayats and urban local bodies to ensure that streets and drains were cleared on a daily basis. Action would be initiated against the officials concerned if any slackness was found in this direction, he said. The Chief Secretary conducted a detailed review meeting on the progress of works launched under Palle and Pattana Pragati with additional collectors and senior officials of the Panchayat Raj and Municipal Administration departments on Thursday. The State had enacted new legislations for all-round development of gram panchayats and municipalities and these Acts should be implemented in true spirit, he said. The government had created the posts of additional collector exclusively for local bodies’ affairs to ensure that works were taken up and completed in line with the provisions of the new legislations. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was firm that every gram panchayat and urban local body should be made clean, green and hygienic. The government had equipped local bodies with tractors and tankers besides providing Rs. 456 crore funds every month to see that there was no dearth of funds for carrying out these activities. The Chief Secretary wanted the officials concerned to take up works on tree parks, multi-level avenue plantation and complete them within the scheduled time frame. Reminding that the new acts mandated spending at least 10% of the budget on greening activities, he said special effort should be made to ensure survival of plants during summer and steps should be taken to replace the casualties. The additional collectors should ensure that early clearances were given for building construction and at the same time, steps should be taken to see that there were no encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/complete-constructions-at-local-body-level-soon-says-chief-secretary/article33937661.ece

26 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Standard personal accident insurance cover from April 1||The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has mandated general and health insurers to offer Standard Personal Accident Insurance product from April 1. It said this issuing guidelines for the standard product, whose basic mandatory cover features and policy wordings will be uniform. However, the cost of the Saral Suraksha Bima, as the cover will be known, is likely to vary with the regulator allowing insurers to determine premium. The minimum sum insured under the standard policy will be Rs. 2.5 lakh and maximum Rs. 1 crore. The tenure will be one year and the policy can be renewed. It is for those aged between 18-70 years and can be offered as a family cover too. Guidelines issued According to the guidelines, under the base cover benefit equal to 100% of sum insured will be payable on death of the insured person, due to an injury sustained in an accident during the policy period. Similarly, 100% sum insured will have to be paid if the insured person suffers Permanent Total Disablement, “solely and directly due to an accident during the policy period.” The permanent total disablement clause will apply to a number of conditions, including loss of sight or injury that disabled the insured person from engaging in any employment or occupation. Policy coverage Permanent Partial Disablement, as a result of accident during the policy period, is also to be covered under the policy, the guidelines said specifying the portion of sum insured that has to be paid in such cases.

Nageshwar has lamented that the Central government is handing over the valuable public assets to its “cronies” at a pittance in the name of privatisation. Prof. Nageshwar, who is contesting as an independent from Mahbubnagar-Rangareddy-Hyderabad graduates’ constituency in the ensuing elections to the Legislative Council, said such indiscriminate privatisation would weaken the national economy resulting in “corporate loot” of the public assets. He was addressing staff and officers of different central public sector units including ECIL, BEL, BDL, Midhani and HAL during a seminar “privatisation and its true face” here on Thursday. Lamenting that absence of strong public sector would result in private monopolies, he said cartelization of private manufacturers resulted in hike in cement and steel prices. Hyderabad was home to several prestigious central public sector undertakings and the BJP government’s privatization policy would severely undermine employment and economy of the city. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti which criticised the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government’s policies of privatisation during the GHMC elections recently was, however, conspicuous by its silence later, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-handing-over-psu-assets-to-its-cronies/article33937659.ece

26 February 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Traders resent move to ‘close down’ old bus station||Worried about their future, scores of small vendors, petty businessmen and traders of the present bus stand area are running from pillar to post to halt the alleged move of the authorities concerned to close down the existing bus stand after the inauguration of the new bus station, tentatively on March 1. Though the TSRTC authorities are busy making arrangements to start operation of buses from the new ultra-modern bus station at the NSP colony from the first week of March, clarity over the fate of the present bus stand continues to elude the denizens of the city. This has prompted the concerned citizens to form an “Old bus stand parirakshana” committee and launch a phase-wise campaign by involving people from all walks of life above party lines demanding the continuation of the old bus station as a local bus stand. Sources in the TSRTC said the management was yet to take a decision on the existing old bus stand and the entire focus is presently on commencing operation of bus services from the spacious new bus station at the earliest.

If you vote for AAP, your councillor will work with our government for the development of Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The Chief Minister was accompanied by AAP candidate from ward Chauhan Bangar 41E Mohammad Isharaq Khan, candidate from Kalyanpuri 8E Dhirendra (Bunty Gautam), and candidate from Trilokpuri East 2E Vijay Kumar. Addressing people at Seelampur, Mr. Kejriwal said, “AAP is in government for the last six years in Delhi. We have taken all measures to develop Delhi, improve schools for your children, improve hospitals for your families, made bus rides free for women, and provided free electricity. If you vote for us and our councillor wins, we will work together for the development of Delhi.” He said the Congress is being wiped off from everywhere. In municipal election in Surat in Gujarat, Congress has won no seats, he added. “Congress is the B team of the BJP, it has accepted its defeat in front of the BJP. Only AAP is contesting against the BJP in all states. You all have defeated the BJP in Delhi thrice; it is a miracle in itself that you all have voted for AAP three times. Voting for Congress here is of no use, your vote will be wasted,” he said. Addressing the roadshow in Kondli, Mr. Kejriwal stressed the development works done by AAP government in the last six years. “If you vote for us, your councilor will work with us for the development of Kondli. If you vote for BJP, they will play dirty politics instead of working,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/aap-only-party-challenging-bjp-across-country-says-kejriwal/article33937342.ece
26 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Delhi CM’s cover reduced before Surat tour’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s security cover was reduced a day before he is scheduled to travel to Surat in Gujarat for a roadshow, said government sources on Thursday. The decision was taken by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) under the BJP-led Centre as “payback” for AAP’s “commendable performance” in the recent civic polls in Surat where the party secured 27 seats, alleged AAP sources. MHA denies development However, the MHA and the Delhi Police have denied the development. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said the security cover was reduced from six police commandos to two. “As it is, the Chief Minister, who has been attacked several times in the past, had negligible security cover and the decision to further reduce it has been taken by Amit Shah’s ministry. This is a very sad development,” he alleged. Top cop on CM security ID Shukla, Joint CP (Security), said they are providing Z plus category security cover to Delhi CM and it has not been compromised. As per the Z plus category, around 55 Delhi Police personnel are deployed in his security in three shifts. “Apart from the Z plus security, the district police also provide security cover to CM in case of his movement to any location in the city. In case Delhi CM goes out of the city for any reason, then the State concerned is informed to provide adequate security to him,” said Mr. Shukla. He added that at any time of a day, there are six PSOs-three in uniform and three in civil moves along with the CM. Eight policemen are deployed in access control system that mainly means frisking of visitors, two personnel are deployed in outer ring to keep watch on any suspicious movement, a liaison officer that keeps watch on people coming to meet CM.

26 February 2021||New Delhi,||Why resisting the work to translate EIA, Centre asked||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said people in remote areas may not understand the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) if published only in English and Hindi. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the Centre why it was resisting the work to translate the draft EIA in all 22 languages in the Eight Schedule of the Constitution. The court asked what would be the prejudice caused to the government if objections were invited from their own citizens. It asked the government to come up with its stand by March 26, the next date of hearing, on whether the draft EIA can be translated in all the 22 languages for a better consultative process. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma said translation in all 22 languages posed various administrative difficulties and the translations may not conform to the actual content of the draft EIA. The ASG said over 20 lakh responses have been received with regard to the draft EIA and therefore, it cannot be said that the consultative process or participation by stakeholders was skewed. The court was hearing the Centre’s plea seeking review of its June 30, 2020 direction to the Environment Ministry to translate the draft EIA notification in all the 22 languages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/why-resisting-the-work-to-translate-eia-centre-asked/article33937339.ece

26 February 2021||Bhubaneswar,||Orissa High Court notice to govt. over turtle deaths||The Orissa High Court has issued notices to the State government over the death of endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles at different beaches that annually host lakhs of nesting turtles. Treating a media report as public interest litigation, the Orissa HC has decided to revive the issue of threat to lives of turtles. “It is time to revive the issue to ensure that the threat caused to the Olive Ridley turtles that have been visiting the beaches of Odisha over many years are not endangered and that the general health of the coast is improved and preserved. It is a matter of concern that despite several directions having been issued over the years, nothing much appears to have happened to improve the situation,” said a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice B.P. Routray. About 25 years ago, the Orissa HC had dealt with the matter in case of WWF India (World Wide Fund for Nature-India) versus State of Orissa, wherein a detailed order was passed on May14, 1998, the judgment says. Quoting the report, the High Court observed that 800 Olive Ridley turtles have died since January this year at the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary, the world’s largest sea turtle rookery. The court appointed Mohit Agarwal, an advocate, as amicus curiae to assist the court. Notices have been issued through Forest and Environment Secretaries to the Assistant Conservator of Forests, Mangrove Forest Division (wildlife), Rajnagar; Additional District Magistrate, Kendrapara; Deputy Director of Fisheries, Cuttack; and the Kendrapara Collector.

The JSA, which functions as the Rajasthan chapter of the People’s Health Movement, said the 2021-22 budget presented by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had made tall promises with inadequate allocations in the health sector. The much-awaited Right to Health Bill was a welcome announcement, but neither any budget provision was made nor any timeline announced for its launch. Chhaya Pachauli, director of voluntary group Prayas, said the universal health care scheme, stipulating medical insurance of Rs. 5 lakh to every family, would require the State government to spend about Rs. 3,500 crore. “This is something for the next year and we will have to wait to see when this actually happens,” she said. The budget had a range of announcements for the health sector, but it fell short in allocating enough money, said Ms. Pachauli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/focus-on-health-infrastructure-sought/article33937729.ece

26 February 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Four get new liver after recovering from virus||Four people diagnosed with end-stage liver disease have undergone transplants at Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai, after recovering from the novel coronavirus. They were among the 30 people who underwent transplants amid the pandemic. While three of them received the organ from live donors, one person received it from a deceased donor, making it the first “post-COVID-19 deceased donor liver transplant in western India”, said Dr. Vikram Raut, consultant, hepato pancreato biliary and liver transplant surgery, Apollo Hospitals. Tanvi Palande (22), a graduate in electronic engineering, was diagnosed with liver disease in 2012 after contracting jaundice. “She went to Pune to attend Indian Engineering Services classes and her condition started deteriorating there,” her father Dilip, an Assistant Sub-Inspector in Thane, said. Ms. Palande’s mother donated 65% of her liver for the transplant. Dilip Sail (52), a head constable attached to the Mumbai Police, had seen four colleagues succumb to COVID-19. “I was shocked when I was diagnosed with tuberculosis, liver disease, cancer and COVID-19 too before the transplant,” Sail said. His daughter Priyanka (21), an undergraduate student, donated 68% of her liver for the surgery. Dr. Aabha Nagral, consultant, hepatology, Apollo Hospitals, said, “Liver transplantation following a recovery from COVID-19 is a challenge as patients are prone to infections. These four patients had to wait for at least two months for the transplant. The novel coronavirus has an adverse effect on the liver and we have to be careful while administering medication.” Dr. Raut said precautions were taken before the transplants as risk of mortality due to liver disease is 30% to 50% more than the risk of mortality due to COVID-19. He said that prudent intra- and post-operative precautions were taken to prevent possible transmission of the virus from healthcare personnel, adequate availability of blood products, drugs, supplies and infrastructure was ensured, and strict post-operative infection control measures and quarantine protocols were adopted before the transplants. Dr. Raut added that “judicious management of immunosuppression post-operatively” also formed one of the cornerstones for ensuring that the transplants were successful amid the peak of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/four-get-new-liver-after-recovering-from-virus/article33937258.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi police use animation to explain ‘conspiracy’ in riots||Delhi Police Special Cell on Wednesday submitted in Karkardooma court the third supplementary chargesheet in Delhi riots case that has been supported by animation to explain that the riots were the part of ‘large-scale conspiracy’, said a senior police officer. The court has yet to take cognisance in the chargesheet filed. The Special Cell investigating the alleged ‘large-scale conspiracy’ behind the north-east Delhi riots has arrested 15 people under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. A senior police officer said that the third supplementary chargesheet mainly focused on evidence that they got after forensic laboratory report and other technical examinations that were pending in the case. For the first time, the police said, they have used animation to explain how CCTVs in Chandbagh area, where constable Ratan Lal was killed by rioters, were either damaged or turned in other direction around 20 minutes before the riot broke out in the area. In the violence, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahdara) and other policemen sustained serious injuries, while Lal was killed. Pre-planned attack “We have identified the rioters after analysing CCTV footage of the area when they were functioning and with the help of facial recognition system, tallied those with ones seen in mobile videos of the violence and the mobile locations of the suspects. It was clearly seen how all CCTVs in the locality were made dysfunctional, while CCTVs located in other areas were functioning fine. It establishes that the violence was not spontaneous but it was well planned. In CCTV footage, suspects were seen armed with modified weapons made of iron-cutting tools,” the officer added. In one of the cases, during investigation, they found that around 35 cameras located in a lane in Chandbagh area were “dysfunctional” and in a mobile video, a large group of rioters were seen using the same lane. It establishes that the attack was preplanned, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-police-use-animation-to-explain-conspiracy-in-riots/article33937254.ece

A source close to Mr. Tanwar said the morcha is “a platform to raise people’s issues” and not yet a political party. His former party colleague and former chief of the Congress in Tripura, Pradyot Manikya, also joined him on stage at the event held at the Constitution Club here. Mr. Tanwar’s supporters claimed that his outfit was simultaneously launched online from 25 places, including Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Chandigarh, among others. Several retired bureaucrats, including former police officer, S.R. Darapuri, who was arrested during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Lucknow, also attended the launch. “The Opposition is dumb and the government is deaf. So when the politics is between them, the people will suffer. The new political formation has to struggle for the people,” Mr. Tanwar told an audience of mostly his supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tanwar-launches-new-political-platform/article33937620.ece
26 February 2021||Pune,||Modi govt. robbing people: Patole||State Congress chief Nana Patole on Thursday accused the Narendra Modi government of “robbing the common public” by imposing an exorbitant excise duty on fuel when crude oil prices in the world market were low. “Furthermore, in the name of ‘road development’, a cess of Rs. 18 and an agricultural cess of Rs. 4 per litre on petrol and diesel have been levied on the public,” Mr. Patole said. He said between 2004 and 2014 when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power, a Central road fund cess of just Rs. 1 per litre was levied on petrol and diesel. He said, “In contrast, when the Modi government came to power, the cess fund was renamed ‘Central Road and Infrastructure Fund’ and it rose from Rs. 1 to Rs. 18 per litre.” He said the Centre was ‘looting’ people through tolls on national highways. “The Centre must either stop road development cess or stop tolls across the country,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/modi-govt-robbing-people-patole/article33937259.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Biden revokes Trump’s immigrant visa ban||The Biden administration took another step on Thursday to undo the previous government’s immigration policy legacy by revoking Donald Trump’s suspension of new immigrant visas, which had been in effect since late April last year. The order had been extended through to March 31 by Mr. Trump. The revoked order (Proclamation 10014) had suspended the entry of certain immigrants and non-immigrants into the U.S. ostensibly on grounds of protecting the U.S. labour market in the wake of COVID-19. In his proclamation, President Joe Biden said his predecessor’s proclamation, “does not advance the interests of the United States” and that “to the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here”. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world. And it harms individuals who were selected to receive the opportunity to apply for, and those who have likewise received, immigrant visas through the Fiscal Year 2020 Diversity Visa Lottery,” he said. The U.S. issues up to 55,000 immigrant visas (these become “Green Cards” after the recipient enters the U.S.) via its diversity lottery each year to encourage immigration from nationalities that are demographically under- represented in the U.S. Green cards for some 26,000 new arrivals were halted on a monthly basis because of Proposition 10014, as per estimates from the Migration Policy Institute. Pause on H1-B remains Mr. Biden, however, did not revoke a Trump administration pause on H1-B (skilled worker), L (intra-company transfer) and several other work and exchange visitor visa categories ( and dependents of these visa holders) that went into effect on June 24 last year. H1-B visas are predominantly granted to workers in the IT sector, and most of these visas — over 70% — have gone to Indian citizens in recent years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-revokes-trumps-immigrant-visa-ban/article33936948.ece
26 February 2021||Bangkok,||FB bans Myanmar military accounts||Facebook said it has banned all remaining accounts linked to the Myanmar military on Thursday, citing the junta’s use of deadly force against anti-coup demonstrators. The move, which takes effect immediately, applies to the military and entities controlled by the armed forces on both Facebook and Instagram. It also bans “military-linked commercial entities” from advertising on the platforms. “Events since the February 1 coup, including deadly violence, have precipitated a need for this ban,” the social media giant said in a statement. “We believe the risks of allowing the Tatmadaw on Facebook and Instagram are too great,” it added, using the Myanmar name for the country’s armed forces. The junta has steadily increased its use of force against a massive and largely peaceful civil disobedience campaign demanding Myanmar’s army leaders relinquish power. Pages for government offices now run by the junta remain unaffected. Meanwhile, junta supporters wielding knives and slingshots clashed with anti-coup residents in Myanmar on Thursday, the first such showdown between opposing forces as the nation nears a month of military rule. Anti-coup demonstrations continued without incident across the city — students at Yangon University waved the signature red flags of Ms. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/fb-bans-myanmar-military-accounts/article33936953.ece
26 February 2021||COLOMBO,||Gotabaya Rajapaksa to meet families of missing persons||Sri Lanka’s  President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will soon meet families of missing persons who have been protesting to find their relatives’ whereabouts, according to a top official.   “The President is really determined to bring closure to this issue and give the families a solution,” Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Retd.) Admiral Jayanath Colombage told The Hindu on Thursday. Scores of Tamil families in the north and east, mostly women, have been relentlessly agitating by the roadside— they recently marked four years of continuous protest — demanding the truth about their loved ones. This is President Rajapaksa’s first outreach yet to the families of the missing, with a promise of closure. “He [President] wants to listen to them, identify their actual grievances, rather than what politicians might say, and given them a solution. It will happen very soon,” Mr. Colombage said. Mr. Rajapaksa’s initiative coincides with the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council, where members will soon vote on a new resolution on Sri Lanka’s rights record. In a scathing report, the UN Human Rights chief has warned of Sri Lanka’s “deteriorating” rights situation, and sought targeted sanctions against perpetrators, and an International Criminal Court probe into alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka has rejected her report, terming its recommendations “ill-founded”. Key concern Enforced disappearances — during the war and later — have remained among Tamils’ key concerns in the post-war decade, with no government offering a solution that families have found convincing. Addressing the media during his presidential campaign in 2019, Mr. Rajapaksa, war-time Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, said a total of 13,784 people who had surrendered had been rehabilitated, reintegrated, and given employment. But families, who have testified before different governmental commissions and the Office on Missing Persons, maintain that their relatives are not among those released. A month into office, President Rajapaksa told the UN Resident Coordinator that thousands who were reported missing were “actually dead”, heightening their families’ worst fears. According to rights watchdog Amnesty International, Sri Lanka has one of the world’s highest number of enforced disappearances — at least 60,000 since the 1980s. In addition to war-time disappearances, and abductions reported in the following years, this includes Sinhalese youth, who went missing during the armed insurrection led by the leftist-nationalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gotabaya-rajapaksa-to-meet-families-of-missing-persons/article33936956.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Xi hails ‘complete victory’ in China’s fight to end poverty||China on Thursday held a high-profile celebration to mark what its President Xi Jinping described as “a complete victory” in eliminating absolute poverty. Mr. Xi said over the past eight years under his term, 98.99 million poor in rural areas had been lifted out of poverty while all the 832 designated “impoverished counties” and 128,000 “impoverished villages” had been removed from the government’s list. He described the lifting of close to 100 million people out of poverty in eight years as “a miracle” that would “go down in history”, offering “a China example” to developing countries, although he said “no other country” could do so “in such a short time”. China’s elimination of absolute poverty is defined according to the government’s poverty line of $2.30 in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) per person a day, which is higher than the international poverty line of $1.90 PPP. According to the World Bank, China has lifted more than 850 million out of poverty since its reforms began in 1978, unleashing years of double-digit GDP growth. The World Bank defines the poverty line for lower middle income countries at $3.20 PPP and for upper middle income countries, such as China, at $5.50 PPP. According to the World Bank, 373 million people in China are living below the upper-middle-income poverty line of $5.50. Mr. Xi convened a high-profile gathering at the Great Hall of the People to mark the occasion, which has been seen as aimed at burnishing his legacy. Thursday’s event mainly emphasised the last eight years in China’s poverty fight, coinciding with Mr. Xi coming to power in 2012, rather than the four-decade legacy of his predecessors Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, which received little mention. Sustained push The official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary, “In 2020, after eight years of efforts, all of China's nearly 100 million impoverished rural residents living below the current poverty line had shaken off poverty. Over the last eight years, unabated attention and a sustained push from Chinese President Xi Jinping have ensured continued momentum. Under his leadership, efforts against poverty have been woven into every fabric of Chinese life, in which reducing poverty is a consensus and constant call to action."  Key turning point Other reports also emphasised 2012 as a key turning point in China’s poverty fight. Mr. Xi acknowledged that although China had achieved the target of eliminating poverty below its $2.30 threshold, set in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 10 years ahead of schedule, the fight still remained unfinished. “Shaking off poverty is not the finish line, but the starting line of a new life and new endeavour,” he said, with a “rural vitalisation” strategy outlined in the 14th five-year plan (2021-2025) and the ‘Long-Range Objectives Through 2035’ blueprint his government put out last year. China’s State media said infrastructure and connectivity were key factors in reducing poverty in remote impoverished counties, with 1.1 million km of rural roads upgraded or built since 2012 and 4G coverage reaching 98% of the rural poor population. Part of the strategy has also been relocating residents of remote counties and villages, with 9.6 million people moved under the poverty programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-hails-complete-victory-in-chinas-fight-to-end-poverty/article33936951.ece

Money and Capital Markets Minister Nivard Cabraal said the government was hopeful of finalising a $1.5-billion swap facility with China’s central bank. “Within the next two weeks we should be able to finalise it,” Mr. Cabraal told reporters. Official figures show Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves plummeted to $4.8 billion at the end of January, the lowest since September 2009 when they fell to $4.2 billion. Officials said the country was also in talks with China Development Bank for a $700-million loan that would include the equivalent of $200 million being drawn in Chinese currency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-reserves-shrink-sri-lanka-seeks-22-billion-from-china/article33936957.ece

26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pakistan will remain on FATF ‘greylist’||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Thursday decided to retain Pakistan on the “greylist” till the next review of its performance during the June plenary session. At a press briefing, FATF president Marcus Pleyer said although Pakistan had made significant progress, it was still to fully comply with three of the 27-point action plan it had been presented with in June 2018 when it was first put on the “greylist”. He urged Pakistan to make fast progress on them. The three points on which the FATF has sought urgent action by Pakistan pertain to effective steps — in terms of financial sanctions and penalties — against terror funding infrastructure and the entities involved. After assessing the measures taken during the June session, the FATF would verify the implementation and test the sustainability of reforms undertaken by Pakistan to this end. To a query on when Pakistan would be put on the “blacklist”, the FATF chief said it would happen when the country shows progress; it was not the time for such an action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-will-remain-on-fatf-greylist/article33937543.ece

Nick Clegg, head of global affairs, said that the company stands ready to support news media while reiterating its concerns over mandated payments. “Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers,” Mr. Clegg said after Facebook restored news links as part of a compromise with Australian officials. “We recognise quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account.” According to Australia’s competition watchdog, for every $100 spent on online advertising, Google captures $53, Facebook takes $28 and the rest is shared among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/facebook-to-invest-1-bn-to-support-news/article33936958.ece
26 February 2021||London,||Global military spending hits record levels||Global military spending, driven in part by Chinese naval expansion, reached record levels in 2020 despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic contraction, a British think-tank said on Thursday. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said military spending reached $1.8 trillion last year — a 3.9% increase in real terms over figures for 2019. The U.S. remained the world’s largest defence spender in 2020, IISS said, accounting for 40% of $738 billion globally. China, by comparison, accounted for 10.6% or $193.3 billion. Beijing’s military spending was the driving force behind growth in Asia’s overall defence expenditure, and accounted for 25% of the continent’s spending in 2020. The IISS also highlighted Chinese military expansion and the significant growth of its naval fleet, a response driven in part by to Beijing’s ambitions in the South China Sea. Total European defence spending grew by 2% in real terms in 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/global-military-spending-hits-record-levels/article33936954.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Should governments regulate online platforms?||Australia’s new News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code will force platforms like Facebook and Google to pay local media outlets and publishers to link their content in news feeds or search results. The Australian law is being seen as one of the early shots fired in the coming battle by countries to regulate tech giants to take back some of the control they have on global communications. But is it an ideal regulatory model? Won’t regulating the platforms affect free speech? Is regulating platforms the way to save the news media business that is in the doldrums? Jeff Jarvis and Dwayne Winseck tackle these questions in a discussion moderated by P.J. George . Edited excerpts:  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had this to say about the tech companies: “They may be changing the world, but that doesn’t mean they should run it.” However, there has also been criticism that the driving force behind the new code is media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Is the code a legitimate attempt to regulate tech platforms vis-à-vis news, or is it just a way of diverting some cash to media companies? Jeff Jarvis:The Australian law is Rupert Murdoch’s blackmail of technology. This is a link tax — that those who link must pay a fee. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, has testified to Australian legislators that this breaks the web. But Mr. Murdoch wins either way here. He owns 70% of the print news market in Australia. Who gets hurt most is anybody who wants to bubble up from the land of start-ups and create competition. There are ways to have a discussion about regulation against certain outcomes. But in this case, even if you have decided that you should tax the platforms more, why should that money go to entitled publishers? Why not to education or healthcare or Internet access for the poor? There are a lot of other places I can see it going than Mr. Murdoch in Australia or the hedge funds that control the largest media company in Canada and also in the U.S. Dwayne Winseck:There’s absolutely no doubt that the digital platform inquiries that led to this news bargaining code came out of an unholy alliance between the current government and the major media groups in 2017, with Mr. Murdoch’s News Corp and Sky at the front. To get Mr. Murdoch’s and [Chairman of Seven Network] Kerry Stokes’s blessing for a new law on media ownership, the government then made two commitments: to hold a public inquiry into the platforms, and another into public service broadcasters like the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The backing of the major media moguls badly tarnishes the effort and shows the extent to which the local media companies have been able to set the policy agenda in the country. However, we can also see that the Australian process is one of many taking place around the world in the last three to five years, including in India. What this tells us is that the days of voluntary self-regulatory efforts from the large platforms are over. Instead, countries want mandated regulatory requirements. The Australian case tries to deal with two realities. The first is that they have a highly concentrated Internet with Google, for example, accounting for 95% of search queries. Google and Facebook together take 61% of the country’s online advertising. The proposed code would require Facebook and Google to open up their algorithmic black boxes, and their datasets that underpin the advertising market, to regulatory scrutiny. It would also enable the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to compel Google and Facebook to carry certain news services for a yet-to-be specified fee. JJ:Requiring that the platforms not only have to pay for media content but also have to compulsorily carry such content bothers me, since compelled speech is not free speech. DW:You cannot call must-carry laws as compelled speech. Making platforms common carriers is not a good idea but we need to move towards something like fair carriage — like what the Australians are doing by saying certain public interest-oriented journalism must be carried. These ideas are not antithetical to democratic societies. The public sphere requires that a certain range of voices, issues, and values be present. The way to set the terms around what is to be present is through political debate within the context of a democracy and the rule of law, as opposed to abdicating those decisions to the platform’s voluntary efforts and philanthropy. JJ:If you have that kind of regime, then Donald Trump would have had the authority to require Twitter and Facebook to carry him and his incitement. In the U.S., at least, the First Amendment will protect us from that because Twitter and Facebook have free speech rights. If the platforms are required by such a precedent to carry official speech, they can also carry hatred, incitement and all kinds of bad things that Facebook gets accused of having carried in Myanmar. DW:We have to make a distinction between good democratic governments and bad authoritarian incline. JJ:That’s hard to do. DW:I’m quite happy with the kind of European-Canadian international human rights standards for freedom of expression and opinion which is basically that we all have these rights, subject to limits established through the rule of law and which are compatible with a democratic society and overseen by an independent judiciary. The rest of the world need not be held hostage to the American constitutional set-up for freedom of expression. Mr. Morrison has already spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and these countries, along with the European Union, are being seen as next in line to come up with regulation for tech. What’s the long game here? JJ:My fear is that we are seeing in media and politics a moral panic in which old institutions are trying to find a Boogeyman on whom to blame all of society’s problems. That moral panic then gives them licence to do things that in an otherwise sane world wouldn’t occur. We’re going to hurt ourselves in how we treat the Internet and speech on it. It’s important to point out that it’s only because of social media that we have #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo; that the voices too long not heard in the mainstream media run by people who look like me, old white men, are now finally being heard. Part of the problem is that the old voices resent the presence of those voices at the table. So, when we have governments joining together to fight the Internet — when it’s Mr. Morrison talking to Mr. Modi and Mr. Trudeau, when it’s [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel and [French President Emmanuel] Macron complaining about the fact that Twitter took Mr. Trump down — we see old institutions, old governments that are challenged by the Internet taking advantage of the moral panic and trying to stop a wind that I don’t think can be stopped. DW:It doesn’t help to talk generically about the Internet. It’s about this idea that the Internet itself has been hijacked by a small group of companies that are rewiring it. They control audience data, which is the currency upon which this walled-garden version of the Internet works. They also control advertising, which is the money underpinning the so-called free Internet. This rewiring of the Internet was one to bring about the online advertising system with hyper-targeted ads. But it’s been hijacked for disinformation operations, and to fan the flames of political polarisation, hate speech, misogynistic abuse, terrorist propaganda — all the stuff that give rise to the moral panic. I, too, am very uneasy about private corporate actors having the power to de-platform the most powerful politician, the U.S. President. But Mr. Trump is an index of a bigger problem, that something is fundamentally wrong with a conception of freedom of speech that does not draw boundaries around assaults on democracy. There must be a means — an institutional arrangement — by which those assaults can be brought to heel. Critically, the mechanism cannot be left at the mercy of a handful of private corporations. Regarding what needs to be learnt from the Australian law, it does get at the problem of who controls the data upon which online advertising system is based. But instead of trying to rein in this kind of surveillance capital model of data harvesting, it basically gives it the government’s blessing and tries to bring in the Australian media companies into a better spot at the table and give them a bigger share of the pie. So, when Canada, the U.S., and India look at Australia, my hope is they can cherry-pick the good bits. One of the most downloaded apps in Australia now is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s news app. This is being touted as an example of how newspapers exploit the opportunity to end their dependence on news aggregators and social media. However, not all news outlets may have the resources to do this. Where do the smaller media players, and journalism itself, stand in this tussle? JJ:What my fear about this kind of legislation is that it delays the inevitability of media companies learning what they have to learn about this world. It’s great that the ABC is getting an audience. But that also relies on the old model of media: that media were the destinations; that you had to come to us. We’ve got to learn the lesson that social media taught us: we’ve got to go elsewhere. What needs to happen here is that we’ve got to reinvent our fundamental model. What happened in the early days of the Internet is that the platforms took mass media’s own attention-based advertising business model and did a better job of it. However, advertising as an attention-based model is inefficient and insulting and bothersome and ridiculous. Media properties have to understand that they are not in the business of making a product called content and then selling our audience to advertisers. That’s what we did for a century and that’s what the platforms are doing now. Journalism is a service. It has to fundamentally rethink its role in the public conversation. I work under a new definition of journalism and a new mission, which is to convene communities into respectful, informed and productive conversation. We all have to imagine a different future to support a quality public conversation. DW:We have to realise that journalism has always been a public good in an economic sense. Historically, the general public has never, ever paid the full freight of a general journalistic or news service. It has always had to be subsidised, either by wealthy patrons, or by governments in democratic societies through the public service media system — like the CBC here in Canada, the BBC in the U.K. — or by advertising. Now that the advertising subsidy is falling away from journalism, we have to recognise that advertising was never a virtuous means of subsidising the general availability of news. Can we come up with some form of public subsidies? This is difficult, but it’s been done for half a century in some European countries. I would recommend that we do that.  My fear is that we are seeing in media and politics a moral panic in which old institutions are trying to find a Boogeyman on whom to blame all of society’s problems Jeff Jarvis||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/should-governments-regulate-online-platforms/article33936945.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Single party dominance, democracy imperilled||Weeks hence, the nation is set to witness a series of elections to several State Assemblies. State elections normally do not attract too much attention, but as the nation moves inexorably towards single party dominance, the outcome of each and every Assembly Election becomes critical to the end objective. India, more accustomed to glacial changes in political behaviour and attitudes, is today confronting a new phenomenon, viz ., that the winner seeks to take all at any cost, irrespective of a raging COVID-19 pandemic.  Shadows over elections If anyone were to peruse the numerous newspapers, and listen to the different television channels in the country, one would get an impression that India is approaching a new ‘gilded’ era. Unfortunately, electoral politics in the country appears to be out of sync with this portrayal. Threats to the conduct of orderly elections are increasing, more so in some States than perhaps in others, and must not be underestimated. Pressing the stop button is not a viable option as of now, as it is a reflection of the pervasive decline in political attitudes and behaviour in the nation. Violence, money power, and communal attitudes tend to exercise a disproportionately greater influence on the outcome of elections as of now.  A great deal of this is attributable to the prevailing belief that winning elections is the sine qua non of democratic politics, and the raison d’etre for any political party to exist. India’s leading political party, which currently holds power at the Centre and a majority of States, has converted this into a fine art, and makes no secret of its determination to pursue this path. Other parties are attempting to emulate this, but with far less success. Across India, meanwhile, we are witnessing a near daily ritual of individuals belonging to one political party or the other shifting their allegiance and, while doing so, indulging in a diatribe against the party they exited. Electoral majorities as a result, and the character of some State governments, have, hence, tended to change. The shifting patterns of party alignments are, in turn, converting democratic politics into a kind of charade which could damage the fabric of both electoral and democratic politics.   Questions do arise as to what kind of polity will emerge as a consequence of all this. Of serious concern is that elections could hereafter become an instrument to traduce democracy. With all political debate becoming highly polarised, elections could well degenerate into a ritualistic exercise, without truly reflecting the democratic will of the people. Attributing motives is no panacea for what could well lead to the demise of electoral democracy.  Power though proxy Coming to the State-level elections scheduled to be held in the near future, which are confined to the eastern and southern regions of the country — Bengal and Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry, it is only to be anticipated that these elections will witness the finessing of a strategy employed successfully previously, including that of encouraging defections of key Opposition members, an incitement to violence, specially of the communal and sectarian kind, selective use of state agencies to build an atmosphere of fear, to gain an unfair advantage, etc. Such tactics have, no doubt, been employed in the past, but seldom on the scale anticipated in the prevailing scenario.  In the southern States that will be going to the elections, there could be one significant variant, viz. , the objective of achieving power would be through proxy means. In Tamil Nadu, the present State government has earned a not-so-healthy reputation for ‘kowtowing’ to the party in control of the Central government. This is already an issue of unstated and unspoken concern, but the greater fear is that in return for electoral support this time, many more demands would be made, resulting in an acceptance of subalternity, vis - à - vis , Delhi — effectively demolishing all pretence of regional exclusiveness and autonomy. Much the same concern applies to the Union Territory of Puducherry, where the ruling party at the Centre has less than a toehold in terms of influence. In both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, the shadow of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would eclipse everything else in its wake.  From Kerala to the Northeast The election scene in Kerala is markedly different. The principal objective of the ruling party at the Centre would be to reduce the Congress into insignificance while seeking to simultaneously reduce the influence exercised by the Left, even as the BJP can hardly hope to capture power here just yet. A Herculean effort is being made to use the electoral gambit to rope in prominent intellectuals into party ranks, for a future eventuality. Kerala has, however, not seen any communal violence as elections approach, and has also eschewed the ‘Aya Ram Gaya Ram’ syndrome, common to many other States.  In the Northeast, Assam is already a BJP bailiwick, and the attempt here would be to strengthen Central authority in contrast to regional autonomy. This is particularly significant in the backdrop of controversial policies such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens, which created quite a stir and dented the image and influence of the BJP to some extent. The full panoply of divisive politics would be on display here to achieve this objective.  Battleground West Bengal Given the current stakes overall, it is West Bengal, however, that will be the main battleground in the coming elections. Almost all the tactics mentioned would be, or are already on display in the State. This is likely to intensify further as elections approach. Elections are certain to be a no-holds barred exercise, with the BJP and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) battling it out for control of the State, reducing erstwhile ruling parties, such as the CPM and the Congress to irrelevance. Already, in a State where caste identity has seldom if ever been a factor in elections or otherwise, a manifest attempt is being made to whip up caste frenzy, and rallying slogans ‘Vande Mataram and Jai Sri Ram’ by rival groups are being projected as the battle cry of the Forward versus the Subaltern classes.  Meantime, in a State where communal tensions are manifestly evident, the State has been witnessing severe communal violence over many months, some of it as serious, as that seen during Partition. The BJP and the TMC are equally to be blamed for the aggravated communal violence, but the real ‘fall-guy’ has been democracy. With erstwhile dominant political parties having been reduced to bit players, both the BJP and the TMC are picking up more and more of the ‘lumpen elements’ that previously owed allegiance to the Left and the Congress. These are hardly committed supporters, yet exercise a disproportionate ability to vitiate polls.  Again, in the case of West Bengal, the current elections are proving to be highly divisive, with battle cries being raised to vote for the ‘Daughter of Bengal’ against ‘Outsider Elements’, leading to the creation of fresh divisions between the Bengali and non-Bengali segments of the population. Rival groups have had no hesitation to use Durga, the deity, as a pawn — portraying her as the epitome of Bengali identity — with the other side rooting for lord Ram as symbolising national identity. Seldom have elections anywhere deteriorated to such depths. All this is giving fresh grist to communal elements, encouraging the creation of new communal parties such as the Indian Secular Front, muddying waters further.  The danger to democracy What is of utmost concern, however, given the extant circumstances, is that pent-up anger against a distortion of electoral verdicts or confronted with unpredictable results should result in something more serious and dangerous as an open rebellion against participative democracy. Electorates are singularly ill-prepared for such eventualities. History is replete with instances of this kind. There is only a thin line which protects democracy from the ravages of its opponents. The 19th and 20th centuries provide enough examples of how wittingly, or unwittingly, democracy could become imperilled, leading to unforeseen situations. Ensuring that the current status quo is not challenged beyond a significant threshold is critically important for the future of democracy. It behoves all those who believe in progressive politics to ensure that the situation does not get out of hand, and that winning elections through any means can never be an objective. M.K.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The absurdity of the anti-defection law||The events in Puducherry highlight, yet again, the absurdity of the anti-defection law. In what has now become the standard operating procedure, several MLAs from the treasury benches resigned, lowering the numbers required for a no-confidence motion to succeed. This formula has been seen recently in other States such as Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. The anti-defection law was included in the Constitution as the Tenth Schedule in 1985 to combat the “evil of political defections”. The main purpose was to preserve the stability of governments and insulate them from defections of legislators from the treasury benches. The law stated that any Member of Parliament (MP) or that of a State legislature (MLA) would be disqualified from their office if they voted on any motion contrary to the directions issued by their party. Range of the provision The provision was not limited to confidence motions or money bills (which are quasi-confidence motions). It applies to all votes in the House, on every Bill and every other issue. It even applies to the Rajya Sabha and Legislative Councils, which have no say in the stability of the government. Therefore, an MP (or MLA) has absolutely no freedom to vote their judgement on any issue. They have to blindly follow the direction of the party. This provision goes against the concept of representative democracy. There are two broadly accepted roles of a representative such as an MP in a democracy. One is that they are agents of the voters and are expected to vote according to the wishes and for the benefits of their constituents. The other is that their duty to their constituents is to exercise their judgement on various issues towards the broader public interest. In this, they deliberate with other MPs and find a reasonable way through complex issues. The anti-defection law turns the concept of a representative on its head. It makes the MP neither a delegate of the constituency nor a national legislator but converts them to be just an agent of the party. A broken chain in India Look at the contrast with other democracies. For example, in the recent vote on the impeachment of former U.S. President Donald Trump, seven members from his party in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans, voted to convict him. Such a decision does not have any legal repercussion. Of course, the party may take action (it did not). Also, voters may decide to reject the legislator for re-election — and that is the core design element of representative democracy. The legislator is accountable to voters, and the government is accountable to legislators. In India, this chain of accountability has been broken by making legislators accountable primarily to the party. This means that anyone from the party having a majority in the legislature — which is, by definition, the party forming the government — is unable to hold the government to account. Further, all legislators have a ready explanation for their voting behaviour: they had to follow the party’s direction. This negates the concept of them having to justify their positions on various issues to the people who elected them to the post. Eroding legislatures An important consequence of the anti-defection law is the hollowing out of our legislatures. If an MP has no freedom to take decisions on policy and legislative proposals, what would be the incentive to put in the effort to understand the different policy choices and their outcomes? The core role of an MP to examine and decide on policy, Bills and budgets is side-lined. Instead, the MP becomes just another number to be tallied by the party on any vote that it supports or opposes. The framers of our Constitution did not intend this outcome. While introducing the draft Constitution, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar outlined the differences between the presidential and parliamentary forms of government. He said that the presidential form (such as in the United States) had higher stability but lower accountability as the President is elected for four years, and cannot be removed except for proven misdemeanour. In the parliamentary form, the government is accountable on a daily basis through questions and motions, and can be removed any time it loses the support of the majority of members of the Lok Sabha. The drafting committee believed that India needed a government that was accountable, even at the cost of stability. The anti-defection bill weakens the accountability mechanism. Inducing instability What is more, it does not even provide stability. The political system has found ways to topple governments. This includes the methods used in Puducherry this week — of reducing the total membership through resignations. The Constitution was amended to ensure that any person disqualified for defecting cannot get a ministerial position unless they are re-elected; the way around this has been to resign rather than vote against the party. In other instances, the Speaker — usually from the ruling party — has delayed taking a decision on the disqualification. This has led to strange situations such as members who continue to be part of the main Opposition party becoming Ministers (Andhra Pradesh in the term of the last Assembly). The Supreme Court has tried to plug this by ruling that the Speaker has to take the decision in three months, but it is not clear what would happen if a Speaker does not do so. The premise that the anti-defection law is needed to punish legislators who betray the mandate given by the voters also seems to be flawed. If voters believe that they have been betrayed by the defectors, they can vote them out in the next election. However, we have seen many of the defectors in States such as Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh being re-elected in the by-polls, which were held due to their disqualification. Onus is on parties The problem arises from the attempt to find a legal solution to what is essentially a political problem. If stability of government is an issue due to people defecting from their parties, the answer is for parties to strengthen their internal systems. If they attract members on the basis of ideology, and they have systems for people to rise within the party hierarchy on their capabilities (rather than inheritance), there would be a greater exit barrier. These characteristics seem absent in many of the political parties, and we have seen a large number of defections despite the anti-defection law. To sum up, the anti-defection law has been detrimental to the functioning of our legislatures as deliberative bodies which hold the executive to account on behalf of citizens. It has turned them into fora to endorse the decision of the government on Bills and budgets. And it has not even done the job of preserving the stability of governments. The Tenth Schedule to the Constitution must be repealed. M.R.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Inhibiting free speech||When the Delhi Assembly summoned Facebook honcho Ajit Mohan to depose before its Peace and Harmony Committee, it unwittingly provoked a litigation that may have far-reaching implications on federalism, the separation of powers and fundamental rights in India. Parliamentary privileges Parliamentary privileges are a set of rights and immunities that are essential for the functioning of Parliament. The right to free speech in the House, guaranteed to the Commons since 1689, and the right to call for evidence and witnesses, are central to the role of the legislature. In our Constitution, both Parliament and State Assemblies were conferred with the same privileges as the Commons. Apart from discussions about judges, no other speech is barred for legislators in the text of the Constitution. On the face of it, federalism imposes an insuperable challenge to the traditional broad reading of parliamentary privilege. The argument goes: Unlike the House of Commons, the powers of State Assemblies are more limited. If the State Assembly cannot pass a law on a subject, how can it claim a right to discuss it or call witnesses for it? However, this framing is misleading. First, legislation is not the only goal of discussions. Legislatures also have a separate non-judicial power of inquiry which has been judicially regarded as being inherent to the legislature, flowing perhaps from what Walter Bagehot would call the expressive and informative function of the House. Politically, the Assembly is the voice of the people of a State and their discussions are an expression of popular will. Atomic energy is the exclusive preserve of the Union. Does that mean a State Assembly cannot inquire into the possible ecological implications of a nuclear waste site within the State? Cannot State legislatures hear testimony from soldiers and pass resolutions to honour the armed forces? At least four states have passed resolutions against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as affecting their people. Second, the legislative lists frequently overlap and courts resolve any conflict by adopting a test of pith and substance of the law in question. But how would this apply pre-emptively at the inquiry stage when the discussions may or may not lead to legislation? Third, we live in the era of co-operative federalism. How can the Union and the States cooperate if they are barred from even discussing or taking evidence on issues beyond their limited legislative competence? Fourth, there is the delicate issue of whether the courts can or ought to sit in judgment on the proceedings of State Assemblies determining what can or cannot be discussed based on the courts’ view of the topic. No theory of judicial review would justify such a deep dive into the “political thicket” to examine the proceedings of the House, something our Constitution expressly bars. The experiences of Canada and Australia, both common law federal jurisdictions, are also instructive. The Canadian chronicler Maingot hints about restrictions based on legislative competence but is careful to add that they are self-imposed, not court mandated. In Australia, the Privy Council in appeal from the High Court held that “it is hardly possible for a Court to pronounce in advance as to what may and what may not turn out to be relevant to other subjects of inquiry on which the Commonwealth Parliament is undoubtedly entitled to make laws”. In 1399, the Commons recognised free speech in the House as a tradition by reversing the judgment of treason on Sir Thomas Haxey. It is this ancient privilege that found its way into our Constitution. It is a landmark of liberty as it allows elected representatives to challenge the most powerful people of the land on behalf of commoners. This ancient tradition would be effaced if the court were to appoint itself an arbiter of legislative discussions. It is difficult to craft any discernible principle upon which such unprecedented power could be judiciously exercised without inhibiting free speech that is the hallmark of our legislative tradition.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccine inequities||The decision to open up about 20,000 private hospitals across India from March 1 — in addition to about 10,000 government sites — to vaccinate people older than 60 years and those above 45 years with comorbidities will at once increase the number of vaccination sites. Roping in the private sector to support the government programme of vaccinating about 270 million people belonging to the two high-risk priority groups can surely speed up vaccination coverage. At 13 million at the end of six weeks since the vaccination programme began, only a little over a third of health-care and frontline workers have been covered. With the average uptake per session only about 35%, beginning the second phase of the programme could increase this percentage. Even if CoWIN platform glitches and a decline in daily cases are partly responsible for low uptake, the hesitancy to available vaccines among health-care workers, who are one of the most informed and also at greater risk of infection, cannot be overlooked. Whether the elderly and those above 45 with comorbidities will behave strikingly different or take a cue from health-care workers and prefer to wait before queuing up for a vaccine remains to be seen. Crucial to increasing vaccine uptake in private hospitals will be the cost of vaccination, especially when it is available for free at government sites. At a time when vaccine uptake has been low even when offered for free, the only way to increase coverage is by making it easy for people desiring to get vaccinated to have one. While the intent to quickly protect people with comorbidities above 45 years who are at greater risk of progressing to a severe form of the disease or even death is commendable, the insistence on documentary evidence for vaccination should be reviewed if the uptake remains below the desired level. One in three adults in India has hypertension but only about half are even aware of it. It is one in 10 in the case of diabetes; awareness is about 50%. The trend is the same for a few other diseases that make a person eligible for a vaccine. With just over 21% of the population above 45 as per the 2011 Census data, the government can consider vaccinating anyone above that age who comes to a site. Similarly, insisting on prior registration on the CoWIN platform will further worsen inequities; vaccinating people who walk in without registration must be allowed. That less than 10% of people have opted for Covaxin nationally is proof that vaccine uptake is directly related to availability of trial data. The government can still win back trust and improve vaccine coverage by quickly making all vaccine trial data public. Also, timely resolution by the national committee, of serious adverse events and deaths following vaccination and sharing the details will surely inspire public confidence in the vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/vaccine-inequities/article33936929.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Judicial blow||A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of Nepal quite rightly overturned Prime Minister K.P. Oli’s decision to unilaterally dissolve Parliament in December 2020 and which was later approved by President Bidya Devi Bhandari. The ostensible reason for Mr. Oli’s decision, clearly without any merit, was inner party intrigue within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). The Court correctly observed that there was the possibility of the formation of a new government in case Mr. Oli did not enjoy the confidence of Parliament, and therefore ruled his decision unconstitutional. The NCP has since then fractured politically into two factions, one led by Mr. Oli and the other by Pushpa Kumar Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal, both former Prime Ministers who belonged to the erstwhile Nepali Maoists and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), respectively. These parties had merged into the NCP in 2018. But this fracture is not yet formalised even though the Dahal-Nepal faction has “expelled” Mr. Oli from the party. In defence of his decision, Mr. Oli had argued that he required the support of a two-thirds majority to govern the nation and had sought re-elections, but the Supreme Court’s decision has now rendered that moot by restoring the status quo ante as of December 2020. The Court also went on to scrap all appointments made by the government after the dissolution of Parliament on December 20, 2020. Having received such a stinging rebuke by the Supreme Court, the right course of action for Mr. Oli should be to resign on moral grounds, but knowing the combative politician, that is not going to happen. The NCP’s vertical split into two near-equal factions in Parliament should allow the formation of a new government if the Dahal-Nepal faction chooses to support an alternative — it has already pledged support to Nepali Congress (NC) leader Sher Bahadur Deuba if the NC stakes claim to form a new coalition government. The repeated changes in government should not surprise anyone as Nepal has a history of unstable regimes and frequent changes in Singha Durbar’s occupants since the end of absolute monarchy in 1990. But the NCP missed a historic opportunity after it came to power with a two-thirds majority in the bicameral Federal parliament and in six of the seven provinces. Mr. Oli could have used the mandate in 2018 to ensure a stable regime, and governance and development in a country battered by the 2015 earthquake, political instability, and now the COVID-19 threat. His government singularly failed on most counts, and he and other NCP leaders could not work as a cohesive unit. The electorate’s expectations of a stable regime, the first elected one since the promulgation of its Constitution, have been belied yet again due to the failure of the political leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/judicial-blow/article33936930.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Postlude to a riot||How do you observe the anniversary of a riot that drove a deep wedge into the capital of India? Do you recall the number of bodies, the schools targeted, the homes vandalised, or the mosques burnt? While one part of Delhi was decked up and cheery to receive U.S. President Donald Trump that February day in 2020, another was on high alert. Delhi had already started seething with the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which held the prospect of a large community of people becoming disenfranchised. All it needed was a spark to inflame passions. With some politicians doing their bit, the stage had been set. A friend and I went four days after the riots erupted in north-east Delhi, which is home to a large population of urban labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, to the affected areas to see the scale of damage and speak to the people. North-east Delhi is a place which has largely been ignored by administrators. We began our journey from the Metro station at Maujpur where people had targeted each other after, some say, a speech made by a Bharatiya Janata Party politician. The shutters were down in the busy marketplace. Inside a lane, there were burnt auto rickshaws and a small minibus. Small shops selling hosiery and shoes, and a teashop, had been vandalised and set on fire. The main street, charred and lifeless, looked like it had witnessed a hundred little bonfires. The police kept peace that day. People didn’t talk to each other and when they did, they would only whisper, eyes darting here and there. A few kilometers away, schools had been laid to waste. In Chand Bagh, two schools, each overlooking neighbourhoods in which lived different communities, had been set on fire. In one of the many by-lanes, a baker had not lost his graciousness — he offered us tea and biscuits. In his little home above his tiny boulangerie was a room full of women who had fled the day their houses had been targeted. They were wearing the same clothes four days after the violence. The stench of fear and sweat filled the room. Some had lost their identity papers. A community kitchen kept hunger at bay. The queues were getting longer there with each passing day. Shiv Vihar looked like a burnt neighbourhood. Neighbours had turned into strangers overnight and had barricaded themselves. Benches, chairs, wooden beds, and poles had been stacked to block entry to outsiders. Words like ‘Hindustan’ and ‘Pakistan’ were traded easily. People crawled out at night from shelters to reach their burnt homes in search of papers, anything they could lay their hands on. Small hole-in-the-wall enterprises had been charred in vengeance. People showed us their wounds. But amid this cruelty and despair, in the midst of the ravaged land, we saw random acts of kindness. A shopkeeper offered to help the affected women by giving away clothes, including lingerie, which he had stocked. This gentleman later called us during the nationwide lockdown to say that the little money he had earned had kept his kitchen going. Another shoe seller offered huge stocks of chappals. Others helped too, though some were clear that they would only help their own. This is an anniversary I don’t wish to remember. Yet, it is important to recall the day the flames of hatred burnt Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/postlude-to-a-riot/article33936939.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||India’s ‘final warning’ to U.K.||India today gave what diplomatic observers believe to be “the last and final” warning to Britain that if its decision to sell arms to South Africa was final and irrevocable, it would be “an exercise in futility for the (eight-nation) study group to meet.” The final warning has come from the Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Swaran Singh, who said in a statement that the British decision created a new situation in which it was incumbent on the members of the study group to reconsider the utility of the group meeting at all. Expressing India’s regret over the British decision even before the study group had met, Mr. Swaran Singh, however, said if Britain was willing not to make any supply of arms to South Africa till the report of the study group had been considered by the Commonwealth Governments “we would be willing to reconsider our attitude.” Diplomatic observers see in the latest warning India’s desire not to take any precipitate action. India wants every aspect of the issue, particularly the interest of African countries, to be considered. These observers, however, feel that if Britain does not show any flexibility in its attitude, the study group would not only become futile, but certain other consequences would follow. India had on Monday warned Britain that any British supply of arms to South Africa before the study group completed its work could have serious implications for the very existence of the Commonwealth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/indias-final-warning-to-uk/article33936938.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||States can move first on fuel tax cut: FM||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman hinted on Thursday that States need not wait for the Centre to cut high fuel taxes or bicker about who is burdening consumers, even as the Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das expressed hope for a ‘co-ordinated and calibrated reduction’ in the taxes levied by the Centre and the States on fuel. “I wouldn’t be able to say when, it’s a Dharam Sankat ,” Ms. Sitharaman said in response to query by an IIM-Ahmedabad student as to when the government would cut fuel taxes now that petrol prices had crossed three digits. She was speaking at an interactive session with the institution’s students, hosted by the JSW School of Public Policy on the campus. She added later that the government would initiate talks with States and explore what could be done. “If the end consumer should pay less and the burden should be less on them... I agree on that point and I also concede it from the pet point of view that more the fuel costs, more the inflation. You have many arguments. But I strongly believe it’s no longer competitive for anyone to say that ‘Eh, Centre, you reduce first, then the States would come on board,” she said, adding that it was possible that States may not cut rates on their part. “We can bicker about who earns more. Even if you want to say, and you are right if you say, the Centre earns more. Everything that the Centre earns, 40% of it goes to the States. So what I am left with is only that portion, although the total amount is what you see. So there’s just no hiding the fact that there is revenue there (for the Centre and the States),” the Minister said. “If... the consumers should not be bearing so much of a burden on this score, it is both the Centre and States that will have to talk. I am sure people will immediately ask: ‘so, when are they going to talk, when are you cutting down?’ Yes, I concede that’s where action has to be and let us see what we can do,” she added. Earlier in the day, the central bank chief said high fuel prices don’t just affect car and scooter users, but also raise costs for manufacturing, transport and a range of activities, spurring inflation. “There is a need for a co-ordinated and calibrated reduction of taxes... I am sure that going forward, both the Central and the State governments will take some positive decisions in a co-ordinated manner,” he said, adding that though both the Centre and States’ revenues face pressures amid enhanced spending to fight the COVID stress, the impact on inflation needs to be addressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/states-can-move-first-on-fuel-tax-cut-fm/article33936908.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Bad bank’ move will not hit existing ARCs: RBI’s Das||The ‘bad bank’ proposed in the Union Budget will not jeopardise the activity of existing asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) , said Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday. He added that the central bank was in the process of upgrading their regulatory structure. Advocating a durable push for Indian exports through free trade pacts with ‘strategically important economies,’ Mr. Das warned that the recovery in global trade was uneven and sought urgent attention from global policymakers to rein in disruptions in global supply chains caused by a steep surge in shipping costs and delivery times. “Refining and upgrading the ARCs’ regulatory architecture is something that is getting our attention to ensure that they have skin in the game and are very much in business,” Mr. Das said at an interaction with the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Budget proposal for setting up a new ARC, he said, had been mooted by public sector banks, adding that there was scope for a strong ARC formed by the banks themselves. “It’s not really a bad bank (but) an ARC-type entity that will be set up to take over the stressed assets from the books of public sector banks and try to resolve them like any other ARC. So that is targeting a specific set of bad assets which certain groups of PSBs hold. In no way will it jeopardise the activity of existing ARCs,” the governor said. Export worries “Even though merchandise trade has shown incipient signs of revival since end-2020, recovery in services trade is yet to gain traction as subdued cross-border tourism and travel restrictions continue to weigh on the overall performance of the sector. “Uneven global trade recovery led by a few Asian countries and select sectors such as medical equipment and electronic products raises concerns regarding its sustainability,” he said. A crucial impediment to revival of global trading activity was the continued disruptions in global supply chains, accompanied by a steep rise in shipping costs since November 2020 and longer delivery times leading to rising commodity prices, he added. On free trade pacts, he said, “Key considerations should be to identify countries and regions that not only have the potential as a market for domestic goods and services but also have the scope to enhance domestic competitiveness.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bad-bank-move-will-not-hit-existing-arcs-rbis-das/article33936910.ece

26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Norms soon for listed firms in ESG arena’||Regulator SEBI is in ‘active discussions’ with various stakeholders to bring in greater granularity in disclosures by listed companies in the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) space and would soon issue relevant guidelines, SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Thursday. “The proposed guidelines are aimed at achieving a much higher level of transparency and accountability from listed entities in the ESG arena,” Mr. Tyagi said in his speech in SEBI-NISM conference. Initially, at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a concern that climate change and environmental issues may be relegated to the background as the fund raising in itself was perceived as a challenge in these difficult times. “However, we can see that focus on ESG issues globally and in India has only increased in this financial year. In line with the general global trend of ESG becoming more and more prominent for investors, Indian investors also showed increased interest in ESG investment,” Mr. Tyagi said. From three ESG mutual fund schemes at the end of financial year 2019-20, today we have total nine ESG schemes with six of them added only in the last 10 months, he noted. From about Rs. 2,100 crore invested in such schemes in the whole of the last financial year, the amount has increased to about Rs. 3,800 crore in 2020-21 till January 31. “While the trend appears to be on the rise, we still have a long way to go compared to global levels,” Mr. Tyagi said. Initial public offerings in this fiscal were largely from firms in sectors resilient to the pandemic or those which are recovering well, Mr. Tyagi said. A total of 18 IPOs came out this fiscal on the main board till January 2021. He noted that the IPOs were largely from companies in sectors like technology, specialty chemicals, healthcare, certain financial sub-sectors, among others. E-meeting concerns Mr. Tyagi said there had been widespread adoption of technological inputs at corporates in the face of the pandemic, with both board meets and AGMs going virtual. “However, virtual meetings have given rise to new concerns which were earlier not there in physical meetings. These include confidentiality and security concerns,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/norms-soon-for-listed-firms-in-esg-arena/article33936919.ece

It said a weak fiscal position would remain a key credit challenge in 2021. The fiscal deficit for FY21 and FY22 should be lower than projected, supported by stronger revenue generation in the March quarter and higher nominal GDP growth next fiscal. Prospects for fiscal consolidation remain weak particularly given the Centre’s mixed track record of implementing revenue-raising measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fiscal-deficit-aim-of-68-for-fy22-realistic/article33936916.ece

26 February 2021||KOLKATA,||Thumping win for Saurashtra||Avi Barot, Prerak Mankad and Arpit Vasavada’s half-centuries helped Saurashtra to a commanding 149-run win over Bengal in an Elite Group-E contest of the Vijay Hazare Trophy here on Thursday. Asked to bat, the Ranji champion put up a formidable 324 for nine. In reply, last season’s Ranji runner-up, was all out for 175 in 37 overs. Productive stands After losing two wickets for 48 runs, Saurashtra benefited from a 115-run stand between opener Barot (83, 90b, 8x4, 1x6) and Mankad (59, 59b, 5x4, 2x6). Vasavada (91, 59b, 8x4, 3x6) and Chirag Jani (33, 40b, 3x4) then forged a partnership of 70 to put Saurashtra in a position of strength. Ishan Porel (three for 71) was the most successful Bengal bowler. After Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat removed Shreevats Goswami with the second ball, the host’s run chase never got going against some disciplined bowling. Abhimanyu Easwaran (44, 61b, 5x4) and Kaif Ahmed (37, 42b, 2x4, 2x6) were the prominent contributors to the Bengal total. Unadkat captured three wickets, while Mankad, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Kamlesh Makwana took two each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/thumping-win-for-saurashtra/article33937335.ece
26 February 2021||Dunedin,||Guptill shines as NZ edges Australia||Martin Guptill returned to form with a blistering 97 as New Zealand held on for a nail-biting win over Australia in the second Twenty20 International here on Thursday. The Black Caps set Australia a challenging target of 220 after losing the toss but were made to sweat as Australia came within four runs of victory. Both sides took advantage of University Oval's short boundaries in a thrilling match that featured 30 sixes and 434 runs at an average of 10.9 an over. Marcus Stoinis starred for the Australians with 78 off 37 balls, but Guptill's 97 off 50 laid the foundation for New Zealand's win. Black Caps spinner Mitchell Santner also shone amid the batting fireworks, taking four for 31, while Australia paceman Kane Richardson managed three for 43. New Zealand allrounder Jimmy Neesham was another exceptional performer, taking two wickets in the final over when a rampant Australia needed 15 runs for victory. Neesham also scored an undefeated 45, including six sixes.  Sixes record Guptill's innings gave him the record for the most sixes in Twenty20 Internationals with 132, taking him past India's Rohit Sharma on 127. He fell just short of his third Twenty20 century after being caught trying to hit a Daniel Sams delivery out of the ground.  The scores:   New Zealand 219/7 in 20 overs (Martin Guptill 97, Kane Williamson 53, James Neesham 45 n.o., Kane Richardson 3/43) bt Australia 215/8 in 20 overs (Josh Phillipe 45, Marcus Stoinis 78, Daniel Sams 41, Mitchell Santner 4/31).

26 February 2021||Budapest,||Business as usual for City||Bernardo Silva scored once and set up another as Manchester City eased to a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in their Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday, extending its winning run to 19 games in all competitions. City, which is unbeaten in its last 26 matches, has a huge advantage for the March 16 return leg in Manchester after Silva headed in a pinpoint Joao Cancelo cross in the 29th minute to put it in front. Jesus on target The Portuguese midfielder then headed on another Cancelo cross in the 65th minute for Gabriel Jesus to stab in. The first leg was played in the Hungarian capital due to COVID-19 travel restrictions in Germany.    In Bergamo, Italy, Ferland Mendy popped up with a winner in the 86th minute to earn lacklustre Real Madrid a 1-0 win over Atalanta. Real’s task appeared to have been made much easier after Atalanta’s Remo Freuler was sent off in the 17th minute for denying Mendy a goal-scoring opportunity. However, Zinedine Zidane’s side struggled to break down the host.  The results: Atalanta 0 lost to Real Madrid 1 (Mendy 86); Borussia M’Gladbach 0 lost to Manchester City 2 (Bernardo Silva 29, Jesus 65).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/business-as-usual-for-city/article33936921.ece
26 February 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Axar, Ashwin propel India to 2-1 lead as Test hurtles to a two-day finish||Thanks to Joe Root bowling possibly the spell of his life, England started the second afternoon with a spark. But even before the ring of fire at Motera was illuminated to full dazzle, the spark had been extinguished. A combination of a strip that made life difficult for batsmen with every passing over, accurate bowling from India’s spin twins and another ordinary performance by England’s batsmen meant the third Test ended with India registering a facile win to take a 2-1 lead in the four-match series. Seventeen wickets fell for 176 runs on Thursday, resulting in India winning what turned out to be the shortest completed Test (in terms of balls) since World War II. Starting the day at 99 for three after dismissing England for a paltry 112, India was skittled out for 145, finding few answers to Root’s off-spin (five for eight) and Jack Leach’s left-arm spin (four for 54). But Axar Patel and R. Ashwin then took over, dragging the game back India’s way. The spin duo bowled virtually unchanged to wind up England’s second essay in a session for a meagre 81 — its lowest, and first two-digit, total against India. Chasing a target of 49, openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill completed the formalities in 46 balls. Rohit hoicked Root over cow corner for the winning shot 20 minutes after the dinner break. On a day that saw spinners dominate right from the word go, thanks to a deceptive pitch, India taught England yet another lesson in a game that witnessed a spree of records. It was only the second instance of a Test in India finishing in less than two days. Moreover, when Ashwin trapped Jofra Archer in front of the wicket, he became the second-fastest bowler to 400 Test scalps. Nursing a slender lead of 33, India had to strike early in England’s second innings. Axar ended England’s remote hopes of staging a comeback by castling Zak Crawley and Jonny Bairstow within the space of the first three balls. While Crawley was bowled off a straight ball, Bairstow was done between bat and pad. England never seemed to recover. Ashwin and Axar bowled in good areas to let the pitch do its tricks and the England batsmen staged a meek surrender. The ball of the day came when Ashwin sneaked past Ollie Pope’s defences for his 399th wicket. Back in it In the afternoon, Root, the off-spinner, brought England back into the game. Once the industrious Leach had trapped the overnight batsmen, Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma, in the first half hour, Root took over. He dismissed Rishabh Pant, Washington Sundar (bowled by a beauty that turned after pitching on middle to hit the top of off), Axar Patel, Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah to complete his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests. But yet another lacklustre display with the bat resulted in Root having few reasons to smile at the end of the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/axar-ashwin-propel-india-to-2-1-lead-as-test-hurtles-to-a-two-day-finish/article33937023.ece
26 February 2021||JAIPUR,||Shaw, Surya help Mumbai crush Pondicherry||One sent a strong reminder to the national selectors. The other justified their faith in him. Together, Prithvi Shaw and Suryakumar Yadav put up an exhibition of scintillating stroke-play and helped Mumbai score a crushing 233-run victory over Pondicherry in the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day tournament here on Thursday. The former champion’s 457 for four is now the highest total in List A cricket in India. In the process, Shaw also broke the record for the highest score by an Indian in List A. His brilliant 227 not out (152b, 31x4, 5x6) bettered Sanju Samson’s 212 not out for Kerala against Goa in the tournament’s last edition in 2019-20. This is the opener’s second hundred in the competition after his 105 not out against Delhi four days ago. He was also captaining the side in the absence of Shreyas Iyer, who was rested. Astonishing knock Suryakumar, whose admirers include Brian Lara, celebrated his maiden call up to the Indian squad for the upcoming T20I series against England, with an astonishing 58-ball 133 (22x4, 4x6) and added 201 for the third wicket with Shaw off just 103 balls. Before that, Shaw had put on 58 for the first wicket with Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) and 153 for the second with Aditya Tare (56, 64b, 7x4). Pondicherry could not come up with any such partnership and was bowled out for 224 in the 39th over. In the day’s other matches in Group D, Delhi defeated Himachal Pradesh by six wickets with 11 balls to spare, while Maharashtra beat Rajasthan by 44 runs.  Shaw bettered Samson’s 212 n.o. for Kerala against Goa in 2019-20 Mumbai’s 457/4 is now the highest total in List A cricket in India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-crushes-pondicherry/article33937337.ece
26 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Axar naturally gifted: Venkatramana||After scalping his second five-wicket haul in as many Tests on Wednesday, Axar Patel had said that the time spent at the National Cricket Academy at the start of his career was an important moment in his career. In particular he spoke about working with former India and Tamil Nadu off-spinner M. Venkataramana. Speaking to The Hindu , Venkatramana gave an insight into the work he did with Axar. “We did not make any big changes because he was naturally gifted. The focus was on improving his strengths.” On Wednesday the left-arm spinner used his arm-ball effectively, and Venkatramana said, “He could always bowl that at will. The one area we worked on was to put more revolutions on the ball so that he could be more effective. “With his height, it is difficult to use flight so we worked on developing the shape of the delivery and getting drift. “He reminded me of a young Ravi Shastri when he came in. “There are a lot of similarities, they could both be handy with the bat and ball, the angles and I am sure he would have played a key role,” said Venkatramana, who takes care of MRC A in the TNCA first division where Axar played a few games. Venkatramana, who was elated by Axar’s gesture of crediting the work he did, said about the left-armer’s impressive start to his career, “He is always very calm and not overawed by the occasion. He struck to his strength, which is to hit one spot constantly. Lethal “On good batting wickets, he will give you control bowling 30 overs and giving just 60 runs for two wickets. But on wickets like this (Motera) he can be lethal and quickly run through the line-up. “It is a good reward for a long wait and I feel it has come at the right time and the right series for him,” he added.  He reminded me of a young Ravi Shastri when he came in. There are a lot of similarities||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/axar-naturally-gifted-venkatramana/article33937577.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||BFC ends campaign on a disappointing note||Sunil Chhetri scored his 100th goal for Bengaluru FC (BFC) even as the club ended its Indian Super League (ISL) campaign on a disappointing note, crashing to a 3-2 defeat to Jamshedpur FC on Thursday. Following its eighth loss of the season, BFC finished seventh out of 11 teams with 22 points from 20 games. Chhetri scored his side’s second goal with a powerful header but couldn’t inspire a comeback from 0-3 down. The India skipper is the highest Indian goal-scorer in the history of ISL (40 goals for BFC and seven for Mumbai City FC). He is second in the overall list behind erstwhile FC Goa player Ferran Corominas (48). Also, on Thursday, Spanish midfielder Dimas Delgado led the team out for what appears to be his last ISL game for the club. Parth Jindal, BFC Director, tweeted a warm goodbye on Twitter but later deleted it. In the post-match interaction, interim coach Naushad Moosa said that Delgado “will be with the team” but was not sure if the Spaniard figured in new coach Marco Pezzaiuoli’s plans. BFC will next be in action in the AFC Cup playoff on April 14 and all foreign players except defender Juanan and mid-fielder Erik Paartalu have their existing contracts ending in the summer. Delgado joined BFC ahead of its first ISL season in 2017 and has four goals and 14 assists to his name across four seasons. This edition, he played in BFC’s first 11 games before leaving for Spain for personal reasons. He returned for the last two matches against Goa and Jamshedpur. “The reason he left for home is because he lost his dad,” Moosa said. “He had the courage and said he would come back and finish the league. And Sunil thought of giving him the arm band.”  The result: Jamshedpur FC 3 (Eze 16, Kuki 34, Grande 41) bt Bengaluru FC 2 (Fran 62, Chhetri 71).

26 February 2021||London,||Alli, Bale in superb form||Dele Alli and Gareth Bale staked their claims for places in Tottenham Hotspur’s first team with superbly-taken goals in a 4-0 victory over Austrian club Wolfsberg in the Europa League last 32 second leg on Wednesday. Alli has fallen down the pecking order under manager Jose Mourinho, not starting a Premier League game since the opening day of the season, but was clearly in the mood to impress. Sensational The midfielder produced a sensational overhead kick in the 10th minute to give his side the lead on the night, after it won the first leg 4-1 in Budapest. Alli then provided a pinpoint cross for Carlos Vinicius to make it 2-0 five minutes after halftime and was again the provider as Bale, on as a substitute, smashed in a majestic third goal with his left foot. Vinicius, another Spurs player who has found Premier League appearances hard to come by, scored his second goal of the night late on as Tottenham cruised into the last 16 with an 8-1 aggregate victory.  The result:   Tottenham 4 (Alli 10, Vinicius 50, 83, Bale 73) bt Wolfsberg 0.

26 February 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Blame batsmen, not pitch: Rohit||Despite the third Test between India and England ending within two days, India opener Rohit Sharma has stressed that there were no “demons” in the pitch. “If you look at the 30 wickets which have fallen. I don’t see anything the pitch did. It’s what the batsmen did. It’s not just them, we played horribly too. It seemed a normal pitch to me. Very typical Indian wicket,” Rohit said after India’s 10-wicket win. “We didn’t pick the right shots to play. No rough, unlike in Chennai. England batsmen just missed the line against Axar, and we also played well below our skill. We will be equipped to handle these conditions in the future.” Rohit, whose 66 in India’s first innings was the highest in the match, said the “pace of the pink ball” added to the batsmen’s difficulty. “It came on to the bat faster than the red ball. It has got to do with the conditions in the evening. Temperature goes down and the dew [comes in] too. Again, all in all, the pace of the pink ball is slightly faster. We need to adjust to that,” he said. Rohit had high praise for Axar Patel and R. Ashwin. While he referred to Axar “coming out of nowhere and making it to the squad” and producing decisive performances in successive Tests as “brilliant”, he described Ashwin as possibly “ the match-winner in Indian cricket history”. “One of our match-winners or the match-winner in Indian cricket history. He has won so many games for us. Big congratulations to him. Great feat. Hats off to him. Also his contribution with the bat in this series can’t be forgotten.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/blame-the-batsmen-not-the-pitch/article33937025.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Bitterly disappointed: Root||After losing in under two days, England captain Joe Root felt that had his team done better in the first innings after a good start, the outcome could have been different. “We are bitterly disappointed, I feel we have missed an opportunity, more so in the first innings,” said Root. “The position we found ourselves in, at 74 for two, in hindsight, if we would have got 200, that would have been a very good score on that wicket and the game would have looked completely different. We have got to get better and we are going to keep looking to find a way of scoring runs on surfaces like this.”  When put on the spot about whether the pitch was fit for Test cricket, Root deflected the question, saying, “I think that this surface, it’s a very challenging one, is a very difficult one to play on. It is not for players to decide whether it is fit for purpose or not, and that is up to the ICC.” The 30-year-old also felt that the pink ball was a significant factor in the batsmen being beaten for pace. “The plastic coating and the hardness of the seam compared to the red SG ball meant it gathered pace off the pitch if it hit the shiny side and that had a big part to play in things. Credit to Axar for exploiting that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bitterly-disappointed-root/article33937027.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Controlling the mind||Mahabali took the kingdom of the celestials, and Aditi, mother of the devas, was very unhappy. She asked her husband sage Kashyapa what could be done to help their sons. Kashyapa said that if one observed payo vrata one’s wishes would be granted. He told her that he had learnt about this vrata from Brahma. He told her that total control of the indriyas was necessary for the success of the vrata. Achieving control of the indriyas, one must focus all one’s attention on Lord Narayana, for the vrata to yield results. Following her husband’s advice, Aditi did payo vrata for twelve days, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. And of course, she had to keep her mind in control, without letting her attention wander. The indriyas can be likened to an untamed horse. You need a trained charioteer to discipline it. And he uses the reins to control it. In the case of human beings, if the indriyas are like a wild horse, buddhi is the charioteer and the manas constitutes the reins to control it. Diligently, after keeping her indriyas in check, Aditi did the payo vrata. At this point in the narration, sage Suka tells Parikshit that whatever karma one does with shraddha, one will get the desired fruits. When you do something, where you do it and how you do it are also equally important. If one operates within the prescribed framework, the results will be evident. Dasaratha’s performance of putrakameshti yaga is a good example. At the end of the yaga, the yaga purusha gave him the divine porridge, consumption of which by his wives gave Dasaratha sons he could be proud of. At the end of Aditi’s vrata, the Lord appeared before her, told her He knew what her grievance was, and assured her that He would help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/controlling-the-mind/article33937016.ece

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||High on fruit||The pandemic changed the way we consume food. Households, restaurants and even luxury hotel chains gave up on exotic ingredients and looked into their backyards to use local food to survive successive lockdowns. The support for the local was not just limited to food; the Indian fruit wine industry, which for years had been struggling to find shelf space between Shiraz and Chardonnay, realised that its time to shine had come. “Being at home has made people more experimental with their food and drinks. Earlier, everyone preferred to go out for dinners and parties, where they chose from a curated drinks menu that usually overlooked Indian fruit wines. But with the restaurants closed due to the pandemic and supply chains unable to import international brands, they were back in the limelight,” says Akalpit Prabhune, director and chief winemaker of Rhythm Winery. When Akalpit started the Khadakwasla-based winery in 2010, his motto was to showcase fruits grown in various belts of Maharashtra. Stepping out of the grape palate, he started making wine from other fruits that Indians have known for generations. “We started with a strawberry wine made from fruit procured from Mahabaleshwar. Eventually, we added plum, peach, kiwi and Alphonso. All fruits are sourced from Maharashtra, except kiwis which are brought in from Arunachal Pradesh,” he says. In 2019, the company launched two premium wines — Mulberry and Raspberry — which are priced slightly higher compared with the other wines. Available in Maharashtra, Goa and parts of Arunachal Pradesh, the wines are also exported to the United Kingdom and Singapore. “We started exporting to the U.K. in 2018. Our Alphonso wine has been well-received by prime Indian restaurants in London like Ooty, Sindhu and Brigadiers,” he says. In India, the product is found in holiday destinations like Mahabaleshwar and Lonavala. Social media helped the brand penetrate Pune and Mumbai. “People were online a lot. I used the opportunity to make them familiar with our brand name by frequently posting about our winery on Instagram and interacting with our followers by hosting quiz sessions. This worked: we saw more sales from retail stores in the latter part of 2020,” adds Vidita. While social media strategies helped Rhythm Winery grow, it was the emphasis on local produce that worked for Arunachal Pradesh-based Naara Aaba. “The series of lockdowns had affected the distribution of goods, and made many ingredients scarce. This was when the demand for Indian fruit wine increased; we had good response for our kiwi wine,” says Tage Rita, founder of Nabba Aara, one of India’s foremost organic kiwi wines. In the initial days of lockdown, when the work in her winery stopped, Rita turned her attention to other fruits. In October 2020, her company Lambu-Subu Food and Beverages launched Naara Aaba pear and plum wines. Like kiwi, the plum and pear are sourced directly from farmers in Ziro valley, who grow large amounts of the fruit, which go waste due to lack of a proper market. “Our company supports over 300 farmers, out of which 150 come under organised cooperative societies,” she adds. During the COVID-19-induced lockdown, sourcing fruits and getting them crushed in time became a hurdle for wineries. So at Bordi-based Hill Zill Winery, a company that makes sparkling alcoholic beverages from local fruits, the founders — Priyanka Save and Nagesh Pai — took special permissions to run their trucks to fetch harvested fruits. Success for everyone “We support over 150 farmers and cooperatives through our winery. If we had not picked up these fruits in time, the farmers would have suffered huge losses. So we had to reach out to the authorities to allow our trucks to run to Mahalabeshwar and Ratnagiri during lockdown. We had to be mindful about sanitisation and social distancing regulations,” says Priyanka. The efforts paid off, as despite a pandemic, the company surpassed its yearly sales target in October 2020. Hill Zill Winery supplies its drinks under the brand name Fruzzante, made from pineapple, mango, strawberry, chikoo and orange that have 6% alcohol. It has a strong distribution network in Maharashtra. The company is now stepping up to launch in Goa, Puducherry, Punjab, Telangana, and Karnataka. Adds Priyanka, “This is a great time for people and companies to experiment with local products as the focus is on indigenous produce now more than ever.”  liftout tag with dummy text.liftout tag with dummy text.liftout tag with dummy text.liftout tag with dummy||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/high-on-fruit/article33937236.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Stroke of genius||Acurious question or a sudden stroke of inspiration — sometimes this is all it takes to spark a path-breaking discovery. For the first Asian (and Indian) recipient of a Nobel Prize in science, it was a long journey by sea. Sir C.V. Raman’s story is one of extraordinary academic ability, intense curiosity, and unflinching dedication towards science. Born Chandrasekhar Venkata Raman in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruchirapalli in 1888, he sailed through his studies, topping the class and earning accolades all the way. He completed his matriculation at the age of 11, B.A. degree at 15 and M.A. degree at 17 . It is said that his teachers even allowed him to skip science classes because he didn’t really need them. Life-changing journey After several years of work and research, Raman went on his first foreign trip in 1921. He was sent as a delegate of Calcutta University to the International Universities Congress in London. On his return journey by ship, the vibrant blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea perplexed him and made him think deeply. He wondered, “A glass of water does not have any colour of its own. But the same water in the deep sea appears a brilliant blue. Why is this so?” This genius just couldn’t wait to find the answer and started conducting simple experiments aboard the ship itself. An excited Raman wrote to a science journal called Nature, as soon as he arrived in India. In fact, the letter did not carry the address of his house or lab but that of the harbour where his ship had docked. Sensational findings For the next few years, the question continued to preoccupy Raman. He dived deep into research, trying to understand how light behaved when it passed through different substances. On February 28, 1928, an experiment showed a definite, faint greenish glow in glycerine. This meant that the molecules in the liquid were changing the colour of some of the light passing through it. This resulted in the discovery of the phenomenon that was named the ‘Raman Effect’. It created a stir in scientific circles around the world. The breakthrough earned Raman several well-deserved laurels. He was made a knight of the British Empire and was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society of London. In 1930, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. For an Indian educated entirely in India, a country that was still under British rule at the time, this was a stunning moment of triumph. Over the years, the Raman Effect has been used in many areas, including biology, chemistry and medicine. The Raman Scanner, a device used to detect if someone is carrying illegal substances, uses this principle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/stroke-of-genius/article33937969.ece

Mr. Michael continued with his story. “The children were put into a boarding school but, the girl, Cara, was unhappy. She was angry with her father and everyone around her. She kept to herself and had no friends…when the teachers spoke to her, she was sullen. Then, one cold, misty morning, they found her dead in the playground. She had not come back to the dormitory the previous night and no one had missed her. She died of hypothermia.” “But, what’s with this picture?” asked Keya. “Well, that picture was taken by her father before everything went wrong. It’s a beautiful picture… see how he has captured the light, the expression on her face…” “That’s why I wanted to buy it,” said Moti uncle. Secret unravelled “What is she searching for? She messed up the house and our rooms…” said Keya. “I think she was searching for the title deeds of her house. She thought if she got hold of it, she could get back her house.” “Can we see that cottage?” asked Keya. “I know where it is…I can take you there,” said Mr. Michael. “It’s a beautiful part of our hills and as yet untainted…” Dhruv carried the picture. It took them the better part of the hour to get there. They had to park the car and take a narrow pathway up a slope to get to the cottage. Lantana grew wild and the many colours of the wild shrub added colour to the hillside. Finally, they reached the cottage. It was exactly as it was in the photograph. The stone bench stood outside the door. The view was spellbinding. “No wonder she was upset about leaving this place,” said Keya. Dhruv took the picture into the house. The furniture was almost falling to bits. “No one has been able to stay in this house ever,” said Mr. Michael. “Bad stuff keeps happening to them.” Dhruv found a table in the front room, unwrapped the picture and left it standing on the table. He stepped out of the house with a smile on his face. “How do you know so much about this story and the house?” asked Moti uncle. Mr. Michael said sheepishly, “Molony was my grandfather… My father changed his name because he didn’t want to have any connection with the scandal…” “Understandable…” said Moti uncle. They turned to leave. Dhruv turned to take one last glimpse. A weak sun peeped out through the clouds, and a ray of light shone into the house, catching the photograph. He thought Cara smiled.  The End   “What is she searching for? She messed up the house and our rooms...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/summers-end-back-at-home/article33937912.ece

But Meghnath does not fear the lions; in fact, they behave like puppies with him. Ravana’s brother, Vibheeshana, is shocked to see this. He runs to Kumbakarana to tell him about it.  Vibheeshana: Brother, Meghnath is playing with lions!  Kumbakarna: Obviously! He is my nephew; he has no fear.  Vibheeshana: But, he is too young and it is dangerous. You must do something about it.  Kumbakarna: I will let Ravana and Mandodari know. They will take care of it. **** The next day, Mayasura takes the Pushpaka vimaan and flies to Talatalaloka, his kingdom.

Ravana: Son, anything that lifts itself up against gravity, powered by air, can be called an aircraft. This dart plane can also be called a “Paper Glider”. It glides through the air, unlike grandpa’s aircraft which is propelled by fans and engines.  Meghnath: I’ve always wondered how you and grandpa fly such a huge machine! Do we need super powers to control it?  Ravana: Ha ha! Not at all! You just need to know simple air-science. Once you do, you will also be able to fly one.  Meghnath: Really? Can you please teach me now?  Ravana: Of course. But first, let me teach you some basic things about aircrafts, starting with the different parts of the plane (See image). Many of these terms are derived from ships, which were the first big mode of transport that people were familiar with for centuries. ****  Meghnath: Thanks, dad. Before you teach me more, let me go and have a quick snack.  Ravana: Wait. I wanted to talk to you about something I heard — that you are playing with lions. It is very dangerous. You must not do that.  Meghnath: They are not dangerous. I feed and play with them every day. They are my friends. But, dad, they are becoming sadder and weaker. I think they are better off in the forest; it is where they truly belong, just like how planes belong in the sky.  Ravana: I realise my mistake. I will order the soldiers to release them into the wild where they belong.  Meghnath: Thank you, dad! **** That evening, a few thousand kilometres away, a cute little half-human, half-monkey boy wakes up from a deep sleep. He is very hungry.

In fact, the latter are mistreated and not fed either. This is neither a conventional family nor a happy one. The parents are so busy that both twins are called Barnaby, as they don’t have the time or inclination to think of another name. The four siblings — Tim, Jane, Barnaby and Barnaby — find a baby named Ruth at their doorstep but the parents tell them to get rid of her. Reluctantly, they leave Ruth in front of a candy factory. Things get so messy that the siblings decide to send their parents off on a dangerous adventure, and hope that they will be orphaned. But the parents hire a nanny, Linda, to look after them. When the older Willoughbys decide to cut short their trip, they realise they are short of funds and the children are taken away to foster care. What happens next? Do they get back together? What’s been happening to Ruth? What is Linda’s role? Based on a book by Lois Lowry, The Willoughbys is a new animated film on Netflix. And the best part? The entire story is narrated by a cat. Take 3 Although it’s never revealed in the film, the parents’ first names are Walter and Helga.  This film and Sony Animation’s Connected (which will release later) star Maya Rudolph as a motherly figure named Linda. In the Disney film, Mary Poppins , the cat was called Willoughby. In The Willoughbys , the nanny always carries an umbrella as an ode to her onscreen predecessor. She even floats down the stars with it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/family-times/article33937962.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Bindya’s secret Moonbeam||“Ma!” Bindya’s shriek made her mother jump and drop the chapati she was baking on the wood fire in their tiny hut at the edge of the big forest. Blowing specks of grey wood ash off the ill-fated chapati , she hurried outside. Bindya was standing with hands on hips, peering into her vegetable patch. “Look!” Bindya pointed to the carrots, tomatoes, radish and peas she had grown. Her mother’s eyes narrowed. “What happened to all the peas?” “That’s what I want to know!” said Bindya, glaring at Pooch, as the black dog wagged its tail. “It must be the bandicoots,” shrugged her mother. As if on cue, Pooch pounced on the hole. Bindya tugged, but the dog’s fore limbs worked fast, as she dug deeper. “You’ll kill them,” Bindya gave a hard tug and they both fell over backwards. “Here, take this. Consider it your lucky day,” said Bindya, as she took the chapati from her mother and offered it to Pooch. “Allow her to sink her teeth into those pesky bandicoots, that would be Pooch’s luck day!” chuckled her mother. Friends everywhere But Bindya wouldn’t hear of that. She hadn’t told anyone that she’d secretly named the two bandicoots Sun and Shade. And nobody sunk their teeth into Bindya’s friends. Not even Pooch. Bindya’s mother returned to preparing breakfast. She’d barely rolled out another chapati when she heard Bindya shriek again. “Will you let me make breakfast?” thundered her mother and rushed out. Bindya was peering at a hoof-like mark. “It’s probably a goat,” she said to her daughter. But Bindya knew goats didn’t wander about the village after dark. And, in the day time, no goat could get past Pooch. So that night, after everyone went to sleep, Bindya slipped out and waited by her vegetable patch. It was dark, and the howling jackals made her jump, but Bindya didn’t give up. She had to find out who the visitor was. Surprise visitor Suddenly, she heard crunching and munching noises and realised she’d dozed off. She rubbed her eyes and saw the most beautiful sight she’d ever seen. A fawn was munching on green peas. Its white spots sparkled in the moonlight like diamonds in sand. The next morning, when her parents awoke, they were surprised to find Bindya working in her vegetable garden. “Ma, Papa,” said Bindya. “May I have some more vegetable seeds to plant?” Puzzled, her mother asked, “Why do you want to plant more vegetables for someone else’s goats to eat?” Bindya smiled, but didn’t tell them about what she’d seen. She scratched her head as she thought of a name. Moonbeam! The spotted deer was as pretty and gentle as a moonbeam. Bindya hoped her little vegetable garden would be able to feed many more hungry wild animals who came to their village at night in search of food. If they found food in her garden, they wouldn’t go elsewhere. And the angry villagers wouldn’t be hurt or hunt the wild animals.

That means they imitate the sounds they hear. While several other species of birds can listen to and repeat sounds, parrots are the experts. This is because they have the syrinx, a cavity filled with fluid in their chest, placed where the trachea branches into the lungs. Air flows over the syrinx and parrots modify this air to talk, warn, communicate with the flock and to defend their territory.     How long do astronautsreceive training?

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Earthy thoughts||Grammy award winner Ricky Kej believes in ‘Being the change you want to see in this world’. The line continues to inspire his musical compositions, as he creates music with a message. Honoured with UNCCD Land Ambassador, UNESCO  MGIEP Global Ambassador for Kindness, UNICEF  Celebrity Supporter, Earth Day Network Ambassador, Ricky Kej is indeed an unusual musician. He uses powerful visual imagery and lyrics to drive home his point. This is however not the case in his recent release ‘ Dekha Hain’ sung by Hariharan, with powerful lyrics by Avinash Chebbi. The music is off-beat, haunting with dark undertones that suitably convey Ricky’s concern about misuse of earth’s resources. The song opens with images of beautiful nature; then come disturbing images of industrial excesses, plastic waste, stacks of frozen meats followed by images of pleading animals. The lyrics ask: “ Hai kya sahi aur kya galat”. The refrain is upbeat: “ Hain kahin aisa ek jahaan, ae hawa mujhe le chal wahan ”. Musician Hariharan in a social media post acknowledges it as “a very meaningful new track.” The chorus, however, is confusing, since it is in an African dialect. In Ricky’s words, ‘ Dekha Hain’ is a song that shows our relationship with nature. We need to protect and conserve nature for our own survival. The individual choices we make within our own lives will have a long-lasting effect on us, and the future of our species. We cannot wait for governments, politicians and organisations to make a difference. We must, as a society, believe that we can change the world if we just bring about small incremental changes within our own lives.” Ricky’s second release this week, ‘The Sun Rises In Your Eyes’, has a completely different feel to it — sung by Grammy award-winner, the NY-based Lonny Park, and Washington-based hip hop rapper Konshens (born Gabriel Spence) with inputs by Bangalore-based percussionist Arun Kumar. With the recitation of percussion ‘bols’ (konnakol) running through the entire track, Ricky explains “the song is so unlike me, but I had so much fun creating it. Konshens filmed his parts at the Capitol Hill, the morning after the siege, after Joe Biden was confirmed as the 46th President of the USA. Lonnie filmed his parts in the snow of upstate New York, Arun Kumar filmed his parts in the semi-urban streets of Bangalore.” Such different collaborations have always been Ricky’s niche. He says: “I prefer dealing with different musicians as I not only get a great performance, but also get his/her life experiences, training and creativity. I give total freedom to the musicians, as I don’t want to be limited by my imagination and creativity. Different collaborations prove to me how music unites.”  The Delhi-based author writes on Hindustani music and musicians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/earthy-thoughts/article33937509.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The perfect seven swaras||Vani Jairam breezed into the hearts of her Tamil fans with the unforgettable song, ‘Malligai en mannan...’ from the film Dheerga Sumangali in 1972, her magical voice captivating audiences and music directors alike. Soon her voice was the secret behind many chartbusters and Vani Jairam reigned in the South Indian film industry for more than four decades. She went on to sing more than 20,000 songs in over 1,000 films in at least 18 languages. The evergreen hit ‘Yezhu swarangalukkul’  from ‘ Apoorva Raagangal ,’ fetched Vani her first National award. She went on to receive two more for Shankarabharanam and Swathi Kiranam.  Her latest recognition is the M.S. Subbulakshmi Award from the Tamil Nadu Eyal Isai Nataka Manram for the year 2020. Vani says she is elated to receive the honour, especially since the award is named after a legend she has always admired.  Perfect diction Her vocal range, ability to sing a wide repertoire of songs — from heavy classical to folk and romantic numbers, her ability to grasp and reproduce tunes instantaneously, her perfect diction and attention to detail are some of the factors behind her successful playback career. The veteran singer says that she has had an exceptional memory since childhood and the skill to reproduce what she hears. “I would easily pick up songs that were taught to my sisters during their music lessons under Cuddalore Sreenivas Iyengar. I learnt Dikshitar kritis from him when I was five, and at eight I started singing in AIR,” she says. Pt. Ravi Shankar chose Vani Jairam when he scored music for Gulzar’s Meera, and all 14 songs were rehearsed and recorded in a week’s time. Vani got the Filmfare award for this film. “Interestingly, my songs for both Meera and Sankarabharanam were in contention for the National Award in the same year and it was for the latter that I won it,” she says. Recording experience Recalling the early days of recordings, Vani says, “We used to interact with all the musicians in the orchestra. I could absorb the nuances of their playing, the improvisations made by the music directors and, of course, my co-singers. Today, it has become very sophisticated, but it also makes the process more impersonal with voice and instrumental tracks being recorded individually.” Vani’s husband Jairam gave up his job to support her dream, enabling her to pursue her training in Hindustani music from Ustad Abdul Rehman Khan. Khan saab introduced her to Vasant Desai, who launched her voice in the film Guddi and the rest is history. Jairam also started a music recording company, creating some cherished albums. For instance, Vani’s collaboration with Pt. Birju Maharaj and her rendition of Jayadeva’s Gita Govindam set to music by Prafulla Kar where Kelucharan Mahopatra accompanied her on the pakhawaj. In parallel, Vani also began to do full-length devotional concerts, which soon became popular and she has travelled all over the country and abroad with these shows. The little girl sitting in front of the radio listening to Binaca Geet Mala on Radio Ceylon, reproducing the songs she heard, would tell her mother — “One day they will play my songs here.” Her dream became reality when ‘ Bole Re Pappihara’ stayed in Binaca Geet Mala for 16 weeks. The song in raag Miyan Malhar continues to breeze into our ears with an air of freshness even today, in the 50th year of Guddi’s release.  The author is a Chennai-based   freelance writer.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Understanding Rukmini Devi||Had 2021 been a leap year, February 29th would have marked the 117th birth anniversary of Rukmini Devi Arundale. In the discourse around dance, its history and current understanding, her name constantly resurfaces. Rukmini Devi Arundale is not a forgotten figure in history. And nor should she be. But given the nature of these discourses, I wonder if Rukmini Devi is adequately understood and remembered. Many practitioners, scholars and admirers have recently appealed for Rukmini Devi’s legacy to be left alone — saying that she does not need to be feted or critiqued further. While no public figure can escape scrutiny, I wholly sympathise with the frustration of those who knew and understood her. The constant references, both positive and negative, made to Rukmini Devi in the midst of discussions lack nuance, complexity and empathy. However, I don’t agree that it is time to stop talking about Rukmini Devi. It is possibly more crucial now than ever before to talk about her. And to do so with a renewed understanding that involves a fine and much-needed balance between acknowledging her contributions to what is now called Bharatanatyam and ‘Indian classical dance’ as a whole, and critiquing what in retrospect are deemed as shortcomings in her monumental vision for dance. Disenfranchised? Much has been discussed recently about how her vision, wittingly or unwittingly, contributed to the disenfranchisement of the hereditary dance communities. In my view, this tragic disenfranchisement is way more complex and layered than can be attributed to one person, especially since its beginnings, in the form of the anti-nautch campaign, preceded her time. For this reason alone, it is absurd to condemn Rukmini Devi alone for deliberately snatching away an art form from a community of hereditary artistes. However, this furiously polarising discussion is not the focus of this article. Instead, I briefly highlight an aspect of Rukmini Devi’s contribution that is increasingly forgotten in current debates and discussions on dance. One of the most transformative contributions that Rukmini Devi made to dance is to do with its pedagogy. By creating an institution, ‘Kalakshetra’, around it, she literally remoulded the way Bharatanatyam and Indian ‘classical’ dance is learnt, taught and performed all over India and the world. Before the ‘institutionalisation’ of dance, the transmission of knowledge was largely oral, and dependent on the one-on-one relationship between the nattuvanar (or guru) and the dancer (or shishya). While the guru-shishya parampara persists in a modern and somewhat fragmented way, the concept of a classroom full of students from various backgrounds who learn dance from different teachers in one institution is something that Rukmini Devi spearheaded with the launch of Kalakshetra. This model, and variants of it, are now accepted across dance classrooms where many students learn from a teacher or, as is the case with ‘dance schools’ and ‘dance academies’, students learn from many teachers. It is applied across different banis or styles of Bharatanatyam, and is also applicable to other ‘classical’ Indian dance classrooms in India and within the diaspora. In my view, we don’t pause and think enough about how transformative this was for the scope of learning Indian dance. I say Indian dance and not Bharatanatyam because her pedagogic approach actually impacted more than one Indian dance form. In a conversation with me on the reconstruction of Odissi, Aadya Kaktikar said that the Kalakshetra model became the blueprint for the classicisation of other dance forms in India — however problematic such classicisation might be. Aadya explained that the ‘prototypical format’ of Bharatanatyam teaching and performance at Kalakshetra was used by many regional dance forms to upgrade their status to ‘classical’. Wide influence Referring to the reconstruction of Odissi and its swift classification into a ‘classical’ dance form, she suggested that many of the Odissi revivalists like Guru Mayadhar Raut and Sanjukta Panigrahi trained at Kalakshetra and were exposed to and influenced by its pedagogy and presentation. Examples of Kalakshetra’s influence on Odissi are the use of texts like the Natyashashtra and Abhinayadarpana and the replacement of regional names for hand gestures such as ‘dhwaja mudra’ with Sanskrit names from these texts like ‘pataka hasta’. Kaktikar further pointed out that the Kalakshetra style margam facilitated the expansion of the Odissi repertoire from 20-25 minutes into a structured five-piece repertoire. Following Kalakshetra, teachers like Mayadhar Raut also choreographed dance dramas. Even the modern-day re-creation of the Odissi costume is influenced by Rukmini Devi’s Kalakshetra aesthetic. All these modifications played a pivotal role in Odissi achieving ‘classical’ status in 1964. The term ‘classical’ is, as mentioned, deeply problematic. On what basis are some dance forms given this status while others not. This needs further study and investigation, and our generation of dancers certainly must question these terms and attempt to understand the cost at which classicisation has been achieved for dance forms in India and at whose expense this has taken place. But that is a topic for another day. Today, it is undeniable that dance forms cling to their ‘classical’ status and others aspire to achieve it — in the hope of patronage and recognition, both nationally and internationally. In that sense, Rukmini Devi’s ‘blueprint’ has enabled Bharatanatyam and other dance forms that attained ‘classical’ status to become accessible to a huge number of people in India and across the world. Equally, it is undoubtedly true that the entire process of reconstruction/ revival of dance forms has involved marginalisation and exclusion of hereditary dance communities. This cannot be ignored and the discussions on how to make reparations for these injustices must continue. One could argue that such modern reconstructions paved the way for these dance forms to be studied, practised and performed globally, thus making them inclusive in a different way, though that may well be scarce consolation to the hereditary custodians. If Rukmini Devi’s vision for Kalakshetra is indeed seen as a transformative ‘blueprint’ for classical Indian dance, then this in itself is no small contribution to the Indian and global dance world. The moral and aesthetic complexity that surrounds her role in the history of dance need not be reduced to something simplistic and one-sided. How to approach and understand the ambiguous nature of the transformation of traditional dances and Rukmini Devi’s place in that discourse is one of the central challenges of our time. In the midst of the debates around Rukmini Devi's commissions and omissions, it is nevertheless important to remember that it is because of her vision that many, many of us all over the world can dance today.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Of movements and emotions||The 31st edition of the annual Pt. Durgalal Festival, hosted by Uma Dogra of Samved Society for Performing Arts, was a three-day virtual event. On the opening day, Suhani Singh, trustee, Samved shared memories of the earlier editions that featured eminent musicians, dancers and theatre personalities and the joy of performing to a live audience. The event also marked the première of ‘Nirvana through Dance’ — a video documentation of Pt. Durgalal’s art and legacy, directed by Indrayanee Mukherjee, senior disciple of Uma Dogra. Knitting together interesting anecdotes from the life of the Jaipur gharana maestro with inputs from renowned artistes like Pt. Birju Maharaj, Pt. Sajan Mishra, Geetanjali Lal and wife Bala Lal, photographer Avinash Pasricha, and dance writer Leela Venkatraman, the film was a tribute by Uma Dogra to her guru. The film began with a poem by Dogra and clippings of Pt. Durgalal reciting ‘bols’ and performing ‘chakkars.’ Durgalal was just 10 when he came to Delhi. Under the watchful eyes of his brother and guru Devilal, Durgalal acquired mastery in Kathak, tabla, pakhawaj and vocal music. Leela Venkatraman recalled the vibrancy he lent to performances by improvising on stage. “There was so much clarity in his padanth that one could listen to it for hours. I remember the three-hour tatkar he did to guitar music at one of his shows in the U.S.,” she said. Pt. Birju Maharaj praised his uttan and recalled an incident when he and Durgalal accompanied Gopi Krishna on percussion for a Doordarshan programme. Speaking about his death at the early age of 42, Dogra said, “By breathing his last on stage, guru-ji proved he lived for Kathak.” Fitness for dancers The second day featured an interactive workshop, ‘The Dancing Body,’ conducted by Odissi exponent Surupa Sen of Nrityagram. As the workshop was held online it facilitated participation from across the globe. The session focused on fitness, a prerequisite for dancers. The third day featured Odissi and Kathak performances by Arushi Mudgal and Swati Sinha. Arushi began with ‘Vasanth - Advent of spring’, an excerpt from Ritusamhara of Kalidasa with music composed by Pt. Madhup Mudgal and choreographed by Guru Madhavi Mudgal. Arushi depicted Spring as Cupid incarnate. The piece had immense scope for abhinaya. Beautiful imageries of bees humming, birds flying, a cool breeze blowing and young lovers enjoying the koel’s call added to the visual appeal. Complex patterns The Jhinjhoti pallavi with musical motifs and complex movement patterns and sequences was presented next by Arushi. The pallavi also had sculpturesque poses characteristic of Odissi. The concluding Odia abhinaya piece, ‘Dine na dakibu’, was about Radha addressing Krishna’s flute and telling it not to call out to her during the day. Choreographed by the legendry Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra, Arushi conveyed well the emotions in the lyrics. Swati Sinha, disciple of Rajendra Gangani, included all the integral elements of Kathak in her performance. In ‘Nachat ban ke tu Krishna’, the viewer could almost feel the mild fragrance in the gentle breeze blowing in all directions. Composed and choreographed by Rajendra Gangani in raag Mishra Maand, Rupak taal, the piece carried his signature style. Seamlessly blending bandishes (thoda, tukda, paran, kavith, uttan) and tatkar, the presentation had both expressions and rhythm; well-suited to the shortened duration of virtual performances. Keeping up with the mood of the song, Swati moved gracefully like a deer towards the mike to recite the bols. In the Vidyapati pad in raag Yaman, taal Addha and Deep Chandi, set to music by Gangani, Swati was in her element displaying myriad emotions. The nayika is advised to keep her face covered. Hearing that the moon has been stolen, the king of the land is searching for the culprit and may mistake her face for the moon. But she need not worry. The moon has spots while her face is blemishless. In ‘Ambervadan,’ Swati transcended the physicality of the art with her sensitive and mature portrayal. The live orchestra comprising Yogesh Gangani on the tabla, Samiullah Khan on vocal, Mohammed Ayub on the sarangi, Vinay Prasanna on the flute and Praveen Parihar on padanth was highly supportive and spontaneous.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The first film on Tyagaraja||The internet has this habit of suddenly throwing up a gem or two and a recent find is a digitised copy of the song book of the 1937 Tamil film Bhakta Sri Tyagaraja . It is the first of three films made on the composer, the others being Chittoor V. Nagiah’s Thyagaya (1946) and Bapu’s Tyagayya (1981).  The Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen identifies Saint Films as an Indian genre, which taps the country’s long tradition of bhakti poets. The first phase of the talkies was when the maximum number of movies were made in this category. Indian theatre had already made full use of saintly lives given that there was ample scope for drama, emotion, miracles and above all, plenty of songs. Since the talkies in India faithfully emulated the stage almost till the 1970s, it was no wonder that they too, at least till the 1950s, dwelt on the Hindu pantheon and canon. It also helped that the first wave of filmstars were almost all classical musicians and theatre artistes, prized more for their ability to sing than to act. This was essential for any film on a saint. English biography The 1937 Bhakta Sri Tyagaraja was no different. The key role was played by Madirimangalam Natesa Iyer (1900-1953), who, while a disciple in music of Umayalpuram Swaminatha Iyer, was more importantly a student of noted Harikatha exponent Tirupazhanam Panchapakesa Sastrigal. For all his exalted status among the Carnatic musicians, it must be noted that they had the sketchiest details of Tyagaraja’s life. When the practice of his Aradhana gained ground in the early 1900s, funds were wanting. To aid this, Harikatha exponent Tillaisthanam Narasimha Bhagavatar fashioned a biography of Tyagaraja, filled with a lot of pathos, wondrous happenings and much myth. By 1927, when the first ever English biography of Tyagaraja was serialised in The Hindu by M.S. Ramaswami Iyer, all of that Harikatha was accepted as reality. The brief outline of the film as given in the song book follows the same narrative. Tyagaraja’s father is portrayed as having to migrate from Tiruvarur to Tiruvaiyaru owing to extreme poverty, which is a complete falsehood given that he was a hugely respected and honoured court discourser on the Ramayana. There is the evil (and almost entirely fictitious) brother Jalpesa, being goaded by his wife. And then there is Raja Serfoji, wanting Tyagaraja to sing in his praise and, when the latter refuses, ordering his imprisonment. He later relents of course. If all of these travails were not enough to make the Prophet Job pale in comparison to Tyagaraja, the film concocts Ganapatigal, a diabolical Vedic scholar, who out of extreme jealousy at Tyagaraja’s success, torments him further. “Watch how he suffers,” says the write-up in ghoulish delight. Songs and screenplay The book lists a total of 32 songs out of which one is a verse by Sadasiva Brahmendral (‘Chinta Nasti Kila’), another is a piece sung by the thieves as they set about waylaying Tyagaraja and his entourage en route to Tirumala. A third is ‘Swamiki Sari,’ the Devagandhari composition in Tyagaraja’s praise by his cousin and disciple, Manambucchavadi Venkatasubbier. The rest are all Tyagaraja compositions. Strangely, four songs with almost certain personal references by the composer — ‘Anyayamu Seyakura,’ ‘Giripai,’ ‘Paritapamu’ and ‘Nadupai Palikeru’ — do not feature. The screenplay is credited to M.P. Sundararaja Iyer, who as per film historian Randor Guy, was a well-known attorney at law. The film was made in Bombay by Sagar Movietone, the director being Virendra C. Desai, later the husband of actress Nalini Jaywant for a while. It would appear that much of the production depended on T.P. Kalyanarama Sastry, son of Tiruppazhanam Panchapakesa Sastrigal, the guru of Madirimangalam Natesa Iyer. Apart from being assistant director, Kalyanarama Sastry also essayed the roles of Serfoji and Bobbili Kesavayya, an arrogant itinerant musician who went around challenging people and who was quelled by Tyagaraja. According to Prof. Sambamoorthy, it was Syama Sastri and not Tyagaraja who defeated Kesavayya. The film appears to have grafted the story of one of the Trinity to another. The role of one of Tyagaraja’s disciples was played by a Rajagopala Iyer. This may have been Maruthuvakkudi Rajagopala Iyer, a fellow student with Natesa Iyer under guru Umayalpuram Swaminatha Iyer. The role of Tyagaraja’s wife Kamalamba was essayed by a Smt Kamala, which for all we know may have been a screen name. The book’s front cover has a photo of Madirimangalam Natesa Iyer as Tyagaraja. The back cover (surprise!) has a photo of Sita, who played the role of Jalpesa’s wicked wife. In those days, it was the vamp who got most of the publicity anyway.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Celebrating the strings||When an artiste passes away, only the mortal leaves the world, not the art that entertained and enlightened thousands of admirers. The passing away of veena vidushi Prabhavathi Ganesan, among the senior-most disciples of veena legend Chittibabu, has left a void in the music world. She will be remembered by rasikas for her creativity and immaculate performances. Prabhavathi started her tutelage at a very young age under Chittibabu and her training was similar to the ‘gurukula’ system. In an earlier interview, she had called her guru an amazing teacher, who showed tremendous patience and personal care. Prabhavathi had told me about her guru’s significant stint as a veena artiste in South Indian films.  She had spoken of her guru’s veena soundtrack for director Sridhar’s Tamil film Kalaikkovil . “I also played the veena for that track. During my initial days, I used to follow my guru’s style a lot, but later, I created a style of my own, adhering to the tradition and integrating the specialities of my guru’s method.” Prabhavathi gave immense importance to the sahityam, bhavam and gamakam, which added value to veena music. ‘Raghuvamsa sudha’ in Kathanakuthuhalam, popularised by Chittibabu, was played with the same spirit by Prabhavathi. The high point was her rendition of the kriti with a spate of fast-paced sangatis. About her concert routine, the artiste said, “With marriage, family and children I limited myself mostly to radio concerts. Once my children grew up, I had more time and started giving live concerts in sabhas.” . Prabhavathi often spoke of how stalwarts like T.N. Seshagopalan, Lalgudi G. Jayaraman and T.V. Gopalarkrishnan had helped her evolve her style. “I tried to observe and imbibe the best aspects from them, which helped me understand the nuances of the music besides helping me create a niche for myself in the field.” Her duet concerts with veena artiste Revathy Krishna were much appreciated because of the perfect coordination that the players demonstrated even though they hailed from different schools of training. Her RTP, which blended the two ragas, Mohanam and Kalyanavasantham, during her concert at The Music Academy in 2014 was praised by aficionados. Prabhavathi also cut a few CDs such as ‘Blissful Veena,’ ‘Veena Lahari’ and ‘Amba Janani.’ Her concert for ‘Veena Mahotsav 2017’ can be viewed on YouTube. Prabhavathi always wished that more youngsters would learn the veena. It seems her wish has come true — we see a lot of youngsters now playing the veena with great competence and confidence.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The dancer’s song||S.Rajeswari, who was recently honoured with the M.S.Subbulakshmi award by Tamil Nadu Eyal Isai Nataka Manram, had to make a difficult choice. In 1967, at the Central Music College (where Rajeswari was a student), veena vidwan S. Balachander was conducting a lecture-demonstration. Totally oblivious to everything aroundher, Rajeswari began to hum while listening to the demonstration. A young woman sitting right in front of her turned around. It was the legendary Bharatanatyam dancer, Kumari Kamala, who was so taken by Rajeswari’s singing that she insisted she visit her home. I travel back in time to Pollachi, 1946. There was general excitement in the air. As the entire country was getting ready for a new birth, the Subramanian household welcomed a third daughter, Rajeswari, who went on make her own place in the music world. She had the advantage of growing up in a home where her two older siblings were already receiving training in music. When she was five, the family moved to Madras and then began her musical journey. Rajeswari acknowledges the great role that her teachers played in laying a strong foundation in classical music and shaping her as a singer. Training under stalwarts She began learning from Thanjai Balasubramaniam and later trained under Ramnad Krishnan. When Ramnad Krishnan became too busy with performances, Rajeswari came under the tutelage of Madurai Krishna Iyengar. At about the same time, she received training in Thevaram and Thiruppugazh from Dharmapuram Swaminathan. Later, S. Rajam and D.K. Jayaraman also trained her. When she joined the Central College of Carnatic Music, she was once again blessed to learn from stalwarts like T. Brinda, K.V. Narayanaswamy, T.M. Thiagarajan, T.K. Govinda Rao and ‘Sandyavandanam’ Srinivasa Rao (the then Principal of the college). It was in college that she met Kamala. The meeting changed her destiny. Her father encouraged Rajeswari to make her own decision. His only advice: “Do not stray from the lessons you have learnt.” She was at a fork in the road and she made the choice to join Kamala. Until Kamala left India in 1975, Rajeswari was her voice just as Shammi Kapoor famously said, “Rafi was my voice”. She learnt the finer nuances of singing for dance and if Kamala conveyed bhava through dance, Rajeswari did so through her singing. She had begun to perform solo concerts at the age of 11. She was all of 15 when she first sang at The Music Academy. So, when she made her foray into dance music, she continued to perform concerts. In 1979, she joined her alma mater as a lecturer and later became Principal. In parallel, her singing career too progressed. In 1983, former Chief Minister MGR attended the performance of Vempatti Chinna Satyam’s production ‘Srinivasa Kalyanam’ in which Rajeswari sang for the veteran dancer. So impressed was MGR with the singing that he instituted an award for dance-musicians and Rajeswari became the first recipient of the Kalaimamani State Award for dance-music. In 1996, she was chosen by ICCR, New Delhi, to teach music for four years at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Indian Culture in Mauritius. It was a challenging as well as enriching experience. But when Rajeswari returned to India in 2000, the concert offers began to dwindle. She continued to teach, train and sing. She even released a set of 13 cassettes that contain basic lessons in Carnatic music. She soon won many accolades, the most significant being the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2012. The strong foundation in music enabled her to improvise or even compose at short notice. She recalls an incident when a rasika  came backstage before a programme, wanting Kamala to dance to a composition he had written on Lord Muruga. Rajeswari set it to tune during the interval and Kamala danced to it spontaneously. Humbled to receive an award named after the iconic M.S., Rajeswari says it reminds her of the appreciation that she got from M.S. and DKP.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Moving with the times||Learning Kathakali in the 1970s, teenaged Sadanam K. Harikumar was disturbed by certain “skewed” portrayals of epic heroes in the dance-theatre. One such was Arjuna’s belittling replies to a love-struck Urvashi. “We know the Pandava prince as a proud warrior,” says Harikumar , pointing out that the pre-eminent Kalakeyavadham play taught in classrooms too portrays him so. “Yet into the second half of that story, Arjuna comes across as an insipid person!” This lingered in Harikumar’s mind for one-and-a-half decades, till he came up with Sapamochanam (1989). Its lyrics evoked a new-age sensibility and the choreography revelled in novelties. In the process, the famed episode from the Mahabharata got a suitable twist in which Urvashi outshone Arjuna. Over the past 32 years as a Kathakali playwright, Harikumar has written many stories. Besides the occasional tweaks to plots and characters, a sizeable number of scripts displays a feminist spirit. They are not just a celebration of womanhood, but are sometimes a take on transgender struggles and victories. The latest being Shikhandi , the multifaceted Harikumar’s 19th experimental production. The four-and-a-half-hour work premièred recently, coinciding with the 68th anniversary of Sadanam Classical Arts Akademi, which he heads in Pathiripala, Palakkad district. Compare and contrast  Shikhandi conjures up a climax that deviates from Vyasa’s masterpiece. The eponymous transgender was, in the previous life, a beautiful princess named Amba. She suffered a tragedy in her prime: a botched marriage with King Salwa. All because the valorous Bhishma entered the wedding venue, overpowered her fiancé, and took her and her two sisters away by force, to be made wives of his half-brother Vichitravirya. Today, that ‘villain’ is lying on a bed of arrows. At the Mahabharata war, Shikhandi has felled him. Here, beyond revenge, Harikumar’s protagonist betrays compassion. On second thoughts, Shikhandi returns to the man and responds positively to a hand extended by Bhishma. A pensive raga in the air caps the poignancy. “Well, but for his vow of celibacy, Bhishma would perhaps have tied the knot with Amba when she returned to him after being disowned by Salwa. Amba too would have thought she finally got the ideal man,” says Harikumar, a disciple of the unorthodox Kathakali maestro Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair (1916-2007). “Originally, this end wasn’t in my mind. It happened while writing. Choreographically, too, it appeared viable.”  Sapamochanam also stands out for being high on emotion. Urvashi, indignant owing to Arjuna’s disinterest in her, curses him to become a eunuch. Unlike in the epic, Urvashi herself offers shapamoksha as a way out. This, after Arjuna says he could only see a mother in Urvashi, who has been a wife of his forefathers. The maid’s fury melts in a jiffy: she senses a son’s warmth for the first time in her promiscuous life. And lets Arjuna lie on her lap, patting him to sleep. As theatre researcher Renu Ramanath notes, “It is unique for a Kathakali production to end with a lullaby!” Encouraging responses Harikumar’s fresh approach to Kathakali has sustained him as an actor-dancer, vocalist and make-up artist. Says nonagenarian literary critic M. Leelavathy, “Kathakali has immense scope to conceive tender scenes with emotions beyond valour and vengeance. Harikumar manages to liberate lovers of the art form from age-old concepts about women as meek or insignificant objects.” But some scholars find his verses prosaic. “I don’t mind,” smiles the 63-year-old Harikumar, who is also a painter, sculptor and Carnatic musician. “A Kathakali work in the 21st century should not sound archaic. Neither should its dance be mere repetition of age-old technique.” From the beginning, Harikumar’s works have reiterated this. They are about novel facial designs, costume, gestures, patterned movements and, above all, catering to the young generation. If his Chitrangada , staged a decade ago, dealt with blurred sexual identities, other Puranic characters such as Kali, Asti, Surpanakha and Hidumbi in subsequent plays portrayed the labyrinths of the female psyche. The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/moving-with-the-times/article33937542.ece
26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Pushing boundaries||Praveen Sparsh’s recent passion project, ‘Unreserved,’ puts the mridangam in non-traditional settings and marries it with sounds recorded in public spaces, creating a cohesive piece perhaps in a genre of its own. To hear music in noise — or what the vast majority interprets as noise — is but one of the abilities that this perceptive young musician possesses. Whether traditional Carnatic concerts or funkier music collaborations, film and theatrical productions or creating his own tracks, Praveen straddles several creative spaces seamlessly. And as an accompanist he has earned the respect of a wide array of artistes for whom he has played the mridangam, including S. Sowmya, T.M. Krishna, Aruna Sairam and Bombay Jayashri. Praveen, 28, also known as Thanjavur Praveen Kumar, is the grandson of mridangist Thanjavur Upendran, and great-grandson of thavil exponent Valangaiman Shanmugasundaram Pillai. Articulate, soft-spoken and thoughtful, the qualified engineer hides a steely resolve behind his impassive countenance. No topic is off-limits and he ruminates over each question carefully before giving a reply. The training years Praveen’s family never intended for him to take up music. Seeing the child tap on everything constantly, his mother, K. Kumutha, Upendran’s daughter, casually enrolled him in a group mridangam class, where the teacher identified his potential. Praveen then learned from Nellai Balaji for four years before joining Guruvayur Dorai — first learning from Dorai’s senior student Uzhavoor P.K. Babu before starting lessons with Dorai himself. After winning The Music Academy’s Spirit of Youth competition at 14, Praveen went on to bag the Best Instrumentalist Award at the regular season the same year. Sowmya says Praveen’s remarkable sense of proportion belies his age. “It is particularly difficult to play for padams, but he plays sensitively, enhancing it and making it stand out. If I were to perform an exclusive padam concert, I would choose only Praveen.” Veena exponent Kannan Balakrishnan, for whom both Upendran and Praveen have played, says, “Praveen echoes his grandfather in his playing.” T.M. Krishna says, “I think of Praveen for any ‘alternative’ idea or project. There is an unusual warmth in his presentation — even while playing aggressively, he never sounds harsh. He never over-projects his playing, but its impact is felt in the entire music.” For Praveen, the difficulty in the art is not in executing techniques or lessons. “It is in achieving the impact you have felt while listening to others. Merely reproducing what they did sounds flat. You keep listening to get a grip of the feeling, but then you add your creativity to achieve that impact.” Peers as influencers As to what he strives for in a concert, Praveen says, “I try to listen, react appropriately, and I egg on the other artistes — the trigger should be inspiring enough to kindle and take off from. The idea is to be an ensemble — support and influence decision-making healthily to make some magic happen together.” Besides obvious aspects such as concert duration, the music performed, the pace, and the mood of the artistes and audience, the other percussionists on stage influence Praveen’s tani avartanams. The sessions begin as a blank slate and he then builds on it. Praveen says that Krishna has had a significant influence on his music. “I learned to connect with the vocalist and the violinist. He helped me to listen to everyone on stage better and get used to the different kalapramanams, particularly the slowest ones, and to realise that it actually makes sense to not play sometimes.” “Carnatic musicians on stage are often seen in a pecking order,” points out Praveen. “The vocalist is first, the violin second, the mridangam third, and the ghatam, kanjira or morsing fourth. But each one of these artistes is individually talented and immensely skilled. What happens if you take that hierarchy away and mix it up? I have been learning that from Krishna anna . Why is violin and percussion called ‘support’? The goal is to artistically collaborate on stage — very difficult to achieve but it can happen.” Praveen has scored and played music for Gowri Ramnarayan’s productions. Gowri says, “Scoring music for plays requires complete erasure of ego. Praveen does that, always putting the needs of the art first. For someone so young to assimilate a range of emotions and make music appropriately is remarkable.” In these difficult times, Praveen is not afraid to engage in discussions on sticky subjects, whether gender and caste discrimination or the specific repertoire for instrumental music. This ability to speak his mind sets him apart as much as his intuitive music.  The author writes on classical music   and up-and-coming musicians.

26 February 2021||February 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The still small voice||In 2018, The New York Times published an interesting essay, titled, ‘Ibsen wrote An Enemy of The People in 1882, Trump has made it popular it again’ (Rachel Shteir). The essay investigates the journey of the play and discovers how it had made its way back to theatres in the US after almost five decades. Goodman Theatres last staged the play in 1980, Guthrie Theatre in 1976, similar is the case with Red Orchid Theatre, and CASA 0101. Each of these productions wanted to tell the story of their turbulent times — political to ecological — of “horrific life under majoritarian rule”. Ibsen provided them the preamble. In 2006, marking his death centenary, Ibsen was read and performed from Oslo to Beijing. The relevance and reach of this great playwright remain undiminished. The play has been a favourite with Indian theatre groups as well. Its strong anti-establishment position attracted the renowned Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray, who based his critically acclaimed film, Ganashatru, (1989) on An Enemy of The People . The play has re-entered the Kannada stage as Janashatru , conceived and directed by well-known writer and director Surendranath. Loaded with contemporary resonances, the director, conferred the Norwegian Ibsen Fellowship of 2019, will make eight different versions of Ibsen’s play and stage it in different parts of Karnataka. The first of the eight was staged at Ranga Shankara recently. Powerful comment  An unfussy set design and a compact team of five executed the 60-minute play to great effect. A hybrid model — switching between storytelling and enactment — the play turned out to be a powerful comment on the manipulative politics of India today. Janashatru stays close to the original plot, barring small exceptions such as rechristening characters and giving regional touches to a foreign plot. The play omits the character of Katherine, Dr. Stockmann’s wife, yet manages to address the questions and dilemmas arising from this strand of the story. With sharp narration and a brisk turn of events, Janashatru exposes the connivance of the capitalist-politician-media in the new world, burying truth under multiple layers of falsehoods. The ‘game’ of profits is played to chilling effect, Surendranath contrasting the cold-bloodedness of a political-economic strategem with the avalanche of emotions in the final, iconic speech of the doctor. Ibsen doesn’t hold just a set of people responsible for the moral-ethical decadence of society, he implicates the citizenry as well. The stage therefore is co-habited by the audience who sit at the other end. This consensus — guided by placards held by the fifth member of the cast — says Ibsen, and therefore Surendranath, is an extremely pernicious development. Echoing Mark Twain, “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform,” a warning bell is sounded, but the “falcon cannot hear the falconer”. The unthinking mob, the slow and steady isolation of the doctor, the collusion of vested interests… the play achieves all this with restraint. The play’s greatest achievement is the manner in which it captures the current state of affairs, how it makes environment the most intractable political issue, and how the public continues to believe that ecological concerns are highly exaggerated. What one can hold against the play is the self-righteous tone of the final speech. This, however, was also noted as a flaw in Ibsen. If it is protracted in this Kannada version, it is perhaps because of the economy of expression of the rest of the play. Each of the actors put out a moving performance. Surendranath’s Janashatru is a very important play for our times. It shows quiet courage and strong conviction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-still-small-voice/article33937538.ece
26 February 2021||New Delhi,||North House passes resolution to retain makeshift temple||The House of the BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Thursday passed a unanimous resolution to retain the prefabricated Hanuman temple that had recently come up at Chandni Chowk and triggered a controversy. An old temple in Chandni Chowk was demolished in January as an “encroachment” under a court order. Nearly a month later, a temporary structure had come up overnight near the site on the median verge of a street, leading a war of words between the AAP and the BJP. In the resolution passed by the North House, both AAP, the principal Opposition, and the Congress have given their support, North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash said. “We wanted to find a way to resolve this issue amicably, and with a unanimous resolution passed in the House today [Thursday], we have found that way out. Leader of the Opposition from the AAP and Leader of Congress, both have signed on the resolution,” he said. The decision was taken during a meeting of the North House on Thursday. On Tuesday, an “all-party meeting” of senior leaders of the North body was held to seek consensus before putting a proposal in its House for getting a “legal status for the prefabricated steel structure, which Mr. Prakash had claimed was “made by devotees of Ramji and Hanuman ji”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/north-house-passes-resolution-to-retain-makeshift-temple/article33937244.ece
26 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘NIC proposals on DU UG courses to be put before statutory bodies’||Delhi University acting V-C P.C. Joshi said that recommendations of the NEP Implementation Committee on a four-year programme for undergraduate courses will be put before statutory bodies “very soon.” Among other recommendations the NIC has suggested a multi-disciplinary learning that would include skill enhancement and research. “While a date has not been fixed yet, the recommendations will be placed before the Academic Council very soon,” said Mr. Joshi. Mr. Joshi added that the proposed programme was more flexible and dynamic than the erstwhile FYUP. “The proposed programme is not comparable to the FYUP which was there earlier. The previous one was much more rigid. The new programme is more flexible and dynamic. Students will get more options under the new programme and it is more empowering,” said Mr. Joshi. The NIC, which has held 14 meetings since October 8 has recommended a holistic curriculum, including teaching of Indian and international languages, ethics and culture apart from “social and emotional” learning. The proposed programme will allow students to pursue a three-year honours or a four-year honours in a discipline or a four-year honours in a discipline with research. According to the recommendations, the social and emotional learning will be an interdisciplinary course, which promotes well-being and health, while ethics and culture would entail an interdisciplinary course, which would include the experience of community service. The committee also recommended renaming the B.A. Programme course to BA (Honours) Humanities and Social Sciences while the B.Sc in Physical Science, Life Science or Mathematical Science Program to B.Sc (Honours) in the respective subjects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nic-proposals-on-du-ug-courses-to-be-put-before-statutory-bodies/article33937248.ece
26 February 2021||New Delhi,||Air quality in Delhi ‘poor’, says CPCB||The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida was in the ‘poor’ category on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. “A further increase in wind speed and boundary layer height is forecast for February 27 with slight increase in temperature. This is likely to influence AQI positively and AQI is forecast to fall well within ‘poor’ category on February 27 and 28,” said a statement by government-run monitoring agency SAFAR. The speed of surface-level winds was “low”, which led to accumulation of pollutants near the surface. Also, the “mixing layer height”, which is the height from the ground level up to which pollutants can be dispersed, was “moderate”. This led to lesser accumulation of pollutants near the surface. The AQI of Delhi was 298 on Thursday, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin, which is an average of the past 24 hours. The values for Gurugram and Noida were 251 and 292.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/air-quality-in-delhi-poor-says-cpcb/article33937246.ece

Over 2,000 petrol and diesel vehicles will be switched to electric vehicles,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. A proposal for the shifting of existing vehicles to EVs was initiated by the Environment Department about a month back and was later approved by the government. The switch is part of the Electric Vehicles Policy 2020 of the Delhi government. “It is our Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s dream to make Delhi pollution-free. The Delhi government’s decision of switching to electric vehicles is a historic one,” Mr. Sisodia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-govt-departments-to-switch-to-e-vehicles/article33937249.ece
