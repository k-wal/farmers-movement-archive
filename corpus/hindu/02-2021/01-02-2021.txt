01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Talks only after Centre creates conducive atmosphere: farmers||Farmer leaders on Sunday said the unions would not take the initiative to resume dialogue with the government until the Centre created a conducive atmosphere for talks. The leaders also demanded that the government restore the Internet services at the protest sites, lift the barricades and de-escalate tensions to create the right atmosphere for the talks. The demands came as the police stepped up security at the three sit-in sites around Delhi, closely guarding entry to the sites even as the number of protesting farmers swelled through the day. Amarinder initiative In a related development, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has called an all-party meeting on February 2 to evolve a consensus on the way forward on the issue of the farm laws and the farmers’ agitation in the light of the recent developments in Delhi. In an official statement, the Chief Minister said the crisis can be tackled effectively and the farmers’ interests be protected only through the collective efforts of all Punjabis and the political parties of the State. Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement at an all-party meeting that the proposal to suspend the three laws for 18 months still stood, Buta Singh Burj Gill, head of a Bharatiya Kisan Union faction in Punjab, said: “Prime Minister had spoken on the three farm laws for the first time saying that suspension of laws was a good proposal and talks must resume. We too are ready for talks, but the government must de-escalate the situation, restore Internet services, lift the barricades and stop attacks at the sit-in sites.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/talks-only-after-centre-creates-a-positive-atmosphere-farmers/article33712828.ece

01 February 2021||MYSURU,||Ex-CM: Not sure if tie-up in MCC will continue||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said he did not know if the Congress-Janata Dal (S) alliance in the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) council will continue. Speaking to reporters, he sought to make it clear that the Congress had no alliance with any party in the State. However, when his attention was d rawn to the alliance with the Janata Dal (S) in MCC in 2018, he said it was at the local level and added that he wasn’t sure if it would continue. Mr. Siddaramaiah’s statements come ahead of the mayoral polls. The 65-member MCC is a hung House, with the BJP having 22 members, Congress and JD (S) 19 and 18 members respectively. The Congress and JD (S) entered into an alliance after the MCC polls in 2018 to share power. While the Congress’ Pushpalatha Jagannath secured the post of Mayor during first term, JD (S) member Tasneem was elected Mayor for the second term. As the per the understanding, the Congress is scheduled to secure the post of Mayor for the coming term while the JD (S) will have its Mayor during the last two terms. With the Congress-JD (S) alliance collapsing at the State level, the understanding between the two parties in the MCC had come under a strain, paving the way for the BJP to woo the JD (S). BJP leaders are keen to have the first Mayor of Mysuru by joining hands with the JD (S). However, Congress leaders, including former Minister Tanveer Sait, recently reaffirmed that the alliance with the JD (S) would continue. The JD (S), meanwhile, is keeping its cards close to its chest. Former Minister and JD (S) MLA S.R. Mahesh recently convened a meeting of the party councillors and said the party would prefer to sit in the Opposition. Later, he said the party would not take any decision on an alliance with any party till the State government announced reservation for the posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor. He had said that both the Congress and the BJP were “political rivals” of the JD (S).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ex-cm-not-sure-if-tie-up-in-mcc-will-continue/article33713220.ece

Sasikala, close aide of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, using a car flying the party flag after she was discharged from Victoria Hospital in Bengaluru. Speaking to a TV channel, senior AIADMK leader and T.N. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said, “She cannot claim the right [to use the flag]. Without any association or without even being a primary member of the party, how can she use the party flag? This is not acceptable in law. The party’s General Council has also decided that she does not have any association whatsoever with the party.” Earlier in the day, speaking to presspersons in Bengaluru, T.T.V. Dhinakaran, Ms. Sasikala’s nephew and founder of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), justified the use of the party flag, saying: “Sasikala is the general secretary of the AIADMK. The case is pending in court and so she has displayed the flag.” Mr. Dhinakaran also said the AMMK was a movement to “retrieve” the AIADMK and Ms. Sasikala would continue to fight the legal battle. AIADMK’s deputy coordinator and Rajya Sabha member K.P. Munusamy also condemned the use of the party flag by Sasikala, who was not a member of the party. “Jayalalithaa is the permanent general secretary of the party and resolutions in this regard have been passed in the executive committee and the general body of the party,” Mr. Munusamy told reporters at Kaveripattinam in Krishnagiri. ‘Not part of AIADMK’ Asked why Ms. Sasikala had not been removed from the party, Mr. Munusamy said, “Following the demise of Jayalalithaa, a membership renewal camp was organised and Sasikala did not renew her membership then. How could someone, who is not part of the party, be removed?” Maintaining that the AIADMK would never merge with the AMMK, he said the party leadership would consider taking in Mr. Dhinakaran, if he offered an apology letter for acting against the AIADMK and made a request.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aiadmk-leaders-object-to-party-flag-on-sasikalas-vehicle/article33712770.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM vows to modernise farming||Breaking his silence over the vandalism at the Red Fort on Republic Day by a group of farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said, “The country was saddened to see the National Flag being insulted”. In his first radio broadcast, Mann Ki Baat , of 2021, Mr. Modi said his government was “committed to modernising agriculture and the efforts of the government will continue in that direction in the future as well.” The Prime Minister talked about the country's fight against COVID-19 and how the Made in India vaccine had not only made India self-reliant ( Atma Nirbhar ) but had also become a moment of self-pride ( Atma Gaurav ). Recounting the developments in January including India’s remarkable comeback in the four-match Test series in Australia, Mr. Modi said: “Amid all this, the country was saddened by the insult to the tricolour on January 26 in Delhi. In times to come, we have to infuse new hope and novelty. Last year, we displayed extraordinary patience and courage. This year too, we have to work hard to attain our resolves. We have to take our country forward at a faster pace,” he said. Vaccine success Referring to vaccination exercise, Mr. Modi said it was the world largest and fastest vaccination drive. While India had vaccinated over 30 lakh front line corona warriors in 15 days, he said, the U.S. needed 18 days and the U.K. 36 to reach this figure. India’s decision to send vaccines to several countries had generated worldwide appreciation and displayed its capabilities and self-reliance in the field of medicines. Noting that the country is approaching its 75th year of Independence, the Prime Minister urged people, especially the young, to write about freedom fighters and incidents associated with their struggle. Reading out the comments of a resident from Munger in Bihar, the Prime Minister mentioned about Tarapur Martyr Day, when the British had mercilessly killed several of a group of brave young patriots on February 15, 1932. The incident didn’t not received as much publicity as it should have, he said. Speaking of the recent announcement of Padma award winners, he said the tradition of conferring the honour on unsung heroes that was started a few years ago had been maintained. Mr. Modi said his monthly broadcast was an opportunity to learn many new things and mentioned a vegetable market (Bowenpally) in Hyderabad which was generating electricity from vegetable waste; a gram panchayat in Panchkula (Haryana) which used waste water to irrigate fields, the people of Tawang (Arunachal Pradesh) making Mon Shugu, a form of eco-friendly paper; a young woman entrepreneur growing strawberries in Bundelkhand region, women in Jabalpur successfully running a rice mill after taking over the reins and the all-woman crew of Air India commanding the longest flight from San Francisco to Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-vows-to-modernise-farming/article33712779.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||Full seating, staggered shows in cinema halls||After the Union Home Ministry cleared full occupancy of cinema halls from Monday, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry has asked the theatres to stagger show timings to prevent crowding in the common areas. In a fresh standard operating procedure, the Ministry has directed cinemas to ensure that the starting and ending time and intermission of a show did not overlap with those of a show in another screen in a multiplex. The cinemas in containment zones cannot function. The State governments and Union Territory administrations can impose additional measures on their own assessments. “These are normal restrictions that we have to follow in these abnormal times. And hopefully, soon we will be able to do away with these restrictions too,” I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar said while releasing the SOP. The Ministry said the usual rush to buy popcorn or a visit to the washroom during the intermission has to be discouraged. “Audience may be encouraged to avoid movement during the intermission. Longer intermissions may be used to allow the audience seated in different rows of the auditorium to move in a staggered manner,” the SOP says. Mr. Javadekar clarified that the audience would be allowed to take food items purchased outside the hall back to their seats. Other measures include use of masks, provision of sanitisers at entry and exit points and thermal screening of audience and staffers.

01 February 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata will be left all alone soon: Shah||Highlighting a series of defections from the Trinamool Congress to the BJP in the past three months, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that by the time of West Bengal Assembly election, Chief Minister and Trinamool chairperson Mamata Banerjee would be left all alone. “In the past three months, so many leaders from the Trinamool Congress have joined the BJP. Mamata ji should contemplate why this is happening … By the time polls are held, you [Ms. Banerjee] will be standing all alone,” Mr. Shah said in a virtual address before a public gathering in Howrah. He referred to the defection of MLAs, along with Suvendu Adhikari, to the BJP in December. He said that 10 years ago, the Trinamool government came to power on the slogan of Maa, Maati, Maanush (mother, earth, humanity), but the party had resorted to “extortion, corruption and appeasement”. During his address, the Home Minister welcomed the Trinamool leaders, including former Minister Rajib Banerjee, who joined the BJP on Saturday, and expressed the hope that they would contribute to the BJP slogan of Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal) a reality.” Mr. Shah said Ms. Banerjee had taken the State to a far worse situation that it was 10 years ago during the Left Front regime. The Home Minister raised the non-implementation of the Central schemes of Ayushman Bharat and the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. The Trinamool government was not implementing the schemes because these were run by the Centre, and said their implementation would be ordered at the first Cabinet meeting of a BJP government in West Bengal. The Home Minster said the Chief Minister had agreed to implement the PM Kisan scheme and sent a letter that she was willing to disburse the benefits of the scheme to the people. “ Didi , do you think that people of the State won’t realise your cunningness. You sent us a letter, but did not give details of the bank accounts in which the money should be deposited,” Mr. Shah said. The Home Minister accused the Mamata Banerjee government of working towards Bhajita Kalyan (welfare of the nephew). The only agenda of Ms. Banerjee was to make her nephew Chief Minister, he said. Five defectors from the Trinamool, including Rajib Banerjee and Prabir Kumar Ghosal, MLAs, who joined the BJP, were present. Mr. Banerjee said the State government had launched a Duare Sarkar (government at the doorsteps) scheme because the government did not reach the people in the past 10 years. Union Minister Smriti Irani accused the Trinanool government of corruption in COVID-19 and Cyclone Amphan relief. She said the people would never forgive the Chief Minister for calling those returning from other States “Corona Express.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-will-be-left-all-alone-soon-shah/article33712792.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||RS to wind up session on Feb. 13||The Budget session of the Rajya Sabha has been rescheduled and will conclude two days before schedule. The decision was taken at a meeting Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu had with the floor leaders of parties. The first part of the session will now conclude on February 13, with the House meeting on that Saturday, instead of February 15. In the monsoon session of Parliament, too, the two Houses had sat over the weekend. But in a loosening of the COVID-19 protocol this time, the weekend break for both the Houses had been restored. The schedule, said sources, has been changed in accordance with the members’ request, as it gives the Standing Committees more time to peruse the Budget and come up with their reports before the start of the second part of the session. The floor leaders, according to sources, asked for more time to discuss the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to the joint sitting of the Houses and the Budget. Mr. Naidu told Ministers to keep their speeches brief when moving a Bill for consideration, or while replying at the end of the debates, so that members got more time to speak. The meeting discussed allocation of sufficient time for members of small parties and groups. “Mr. Naidu has promised that the best possible effort will be made to give a reasonable amount of time for members of such parties,” one of the MPs who attended the meeting said. The meeting was attended by the Ministers of Parliamentary Affairs, Finance, External Affairs, Railways, and Housing and Urban Affairs; the Leader of the Rajya Sabha Thawar Chand Gehlot; the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad; and Congress leaders Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh. Those who attended included former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Samajwadi Party leader Ramgopal Yadav, Biju Janata Dal leader Prasana Acharaya, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader A. Navneeth Krishnan, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Tiruchi Siva, Janata Dal(U) leader R.C.P.Singh, Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader K. Keshava Rao, YSR Congress Party leader A. Vijayasai Reddy, Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Elamaram Karim, and Telugu Desam Party leader Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-to-wind-up-session-on-feb-13/article33712794.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Iranian visitors come under scrutiny||A letter recovered from the blast site near the Israeli Embassy in New Delhi threatened revenge, a police officer said on Sunday. The seven-line handwritten note had eight spelling mistakes. The officer said that security agencies were verifying more than 150 Iranian nationals who came in January and also 20 who left after the low-intensity explosion. No suspect has been identified yet. The letter recalls two “Iranian martyrs” Qasim Soleimani and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who were killed in January and November, respectively, of 2020. On Sunday, regular traffic resumed on A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Road where the low-intensity improvised explosive device blast occurred on January 29. The site of the blast was covered in a white tent. The letter, written in English, was addressed to “The Terrorist, Devil of Terrorist Nation Ron Malka” and was written by someone who identified himself as Sarallah India Hezbollah. Mr. Malka is the Israeli Ambassador to India. According to sources, the police questioned some persons, including a few Iranian nationals and a cab driver who dropped two persons near the blast site just before the explosion. Teams from the National Bomb Data Centre of the National Security Guard and the Delhi Police’s Special Cell visited the spot for a post-blast analysis on Saturday. The investigating agencies are checking the Internet Protocol detail record of the area to find out if the perpetrators used the Internet to communicate instead of phone calls. They are also checking the CCTV footage of nearby hotels. The dump data of mobile phones, which were active hours before and after the blast, are also being examined. Data are being collected from the cab services of the persons who were dropped in the locality just before the blast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iranian-visitors-come-under-scrutiny/article33712781.ece
01 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Tourism investment may go more local in Kerala||A strategic shift in investment in tourism, with a greater role for the local bodies, is being explored by Kerala Tourism in the post-pandemic era. “Our investment model is in contrast to the one successfully followed in most parts of the world, where local governments are encouraged to play a bigger role and to attract more investment. This assumes significance in the context of community-centred Responsible Tourism gaining greater prominence,” says V. Venu, member secretary, Kerala State Planning Board. The COVID-19 outbreak has hit the tourism industry severely, rendering thousands jobless, and closing down hotels and service operations. Kerala Tourism is looking for ways to keep the State ready to welcome visitors as the world recovers from the pandemic-induced shutdown. For higher growth The three-day global conference Kerala Looks Ahead (KLA), scheduled to start on February 1, will discuss the need for a shift in investment in tourism. Reputed stakeholders will chart out strategies at the conclave to put the Kerala brand on a higher growth trajectory. The meet will examine the changing international trends and compare Kerala’s experience with those of similar competing destinations. The principal themes to be explored by the online meet include ‘Changing trends in international tourism,’ ‘Scope of Responsible Tourism,’ ‘Segmentation in domestic tourist arrivals,’ ‘Government investment in tourism,’ and ‘Skill development in tourism.’ “Kerala Tourism enjoys the status of a global brand due to consistent growth over decades aided by far-sighted policies and a robust public-private partnership. Now, the sector is in the grip of pandemic-induced uncertainties. The strategies for the future must be carefully worked out,” says V.K. Ramachandran, vice chairperson, Kerala State Planning Board.  The session will draw attention to issues such as giving due attention to north Kerala and supporting small and local enterprises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tourism-investment-may-go-more-local-in-kerala/article33713126.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Many protesters missing after rally’||Buta Singh Burj Gill, head of a Bharatiya Kisan Union faction in Punjab, said on Sunday that farmer unions had set up a committee to provide legal aid to the protesters in police custody after the violence during Republic Day. At a press conference, Mr. Gill said the unions had identified 163 people who were in custody. Mr. Gill added that many people taking part in the tractor rally were still untraced, and accused the Union government and the police of not cooperating with the farmer unions to find their whereabouts. He said the committee would also investigate this and a clearer picture would emerge in a couple of days. He said the farmers were holding peaceful demonstrations, but the government seemed bent on vitiating the atmosphere and had snapped water supply and Internet services, besides putting barricades on both sides at the Singhu border. On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s offer that the government was just a phone call away, Mr. Gill said there was so far no official communication to the farmer leaders on the resumption of talks, and the unions would not take the initiative till the government created a conducive atmosphere. Earlier, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, responding to Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar’s tweets on the three farm laws, said the tweets were a mix of “ignorance and misinformation”. In a series of tweets, the Minister countered Mr. Pawar, saying “The new laws facilitate promotion of additional choice channel for farmers with choice to sell their produce to anyone, anywhere with hassle-free movement in & outside the State to realise competitive & better net price for their produce.” Volunteers blocked The Delhi Police on Sunday denied entry to volunteers (sevadars) at the Singhu border protest site claiming that outsiders are prohibited for security reasons. A group of women, who used to help in langars (community kitchens), were also refused entry. A senior officer said the venue was being closely guarded by the police and the paramilitary personnel. Around 50 companies of security personnel have been deployed. Joginder Singh, a resident of Ramesh Nagar in Delhi, said, “I requested a police officer to allow me after verification that I am not a protester and I am here only for seva but he ignored my request.”  (With inputs from      Saurabh Trivedi)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/legal-aid-set-up-for-detained-farmers/article33712772.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||India delivers 2 cranes for Chabahar||In its latest push to develop Iran’s Chabahar port project, India handed over two 140-tonne cranes for loading and unloading equipment to the Iranian government on Sunday. The cranes, part of a full consignment of six Mobile Harbour Cranes (MHC) worth about $25 million were sourced from Italy and formally released at a ceremony at Chabahar’s Shahid Beheshti port after official talks between India and Iran. India’s plans to invest further in the port project are seen as an indicator that the government expects some easing up in U.S. sanctions in the upcoming months, once the new Biden administration begins to address its policy on re-entering the Iran nuclear deal. Sources told The Hindu that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will also hold a quadrilateral meeting in Delhi with officials from Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan and “another Central Asian countries as observer” to discuss Chabahar connectivity and transit trade opportunities. “We are happy to supply the port of Chabahar with two cranes… This can solve some of the problems in loading and unloading cargos,” MEA Joint Secretary for Iran-Pakistan-Afghanistan J.P. Singh said, according to Iranian news agencies. He also pointed out that the port has handled 75,000 tonnes of wheat donated by India to Afghanistan so far, along with other operations. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said the MEA delegation had also held “political consultations” with their Iranian counterparts. “Recent international and regional developments attach particular importance to this round of general political dialogue,” tweeted MFA official Rasoul Mousavi, indicating that the possible shift in the U.S.’s Iran policy was discussed. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Shipping and Ports had said the delivery of the cranes “shows India’s commitment to the strategic connectivity of Chabahar port project that will provide access to markets in Central Asia,” explaining that the consignment was part of a bilateral contract between India and Iran signed in May 2016 for $85 million to equip and operationalise the port. The MEA delegation’s visit comes a month after transport officials of India, Iran and Uzbekistan held their first “Trilateral Working Group Meeting” on the joint use of Chabahar Port.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-delivers-2-cranes-for-chabahar/article33712796.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST mop-up for Jan. sees a new high of Rs. 1.2 lakh crore||India’s gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues hit a record high in January with inflows of nearly Rs. 1.2 lakh crore, 8% higher than a year ago. As per official data till 6 p.m. on Sunday, six hours before the deadline for remitting taxes for economic activity undertaken in December, Rs. 1,19,847 crore had been collected as GST. This number, subject to further revision, marks the highest indirect tax revenues for the exchequer since the GST regime was launched in July 2017. Import revenue grows “During the month, revenues from import of goods were 16% higher and the revenues from domestic transaction [including import of services] were 6% higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement. That GST revenues had remained above Rs. 1 lakh crore for the last four months with a steeply ‘increasing trend over this period are clear indicators of rapid economic recovery post-pandemic’, the Ministry said. “Closer monitoring against fake billing, deep data analytics using data from multiple sources, including GST, Income tax and Customs IT systems, and effective tax administration have also contributed to the steady increase in tax revenue over last few months,” it added. The State Bank of India’s research team had predicted GST revenues of about Rs. 1.21 lakh crore in a report last Thursday, attributing the surge to the ‘combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post-pandemic and the nationwide drive against GST evaders and fake bills along with many systemic changes introduced recently, which have led to improved compliance.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gst-revenues-touch-about-rs-12-lakh-crore-in-january/article33712800.ece
01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Garbage-to-power plant in veggie market gets PM’s pat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Sunday radio address - Mann Ki Baat - has mentioned about the garbage to power plant being commissioned inside the Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Agriculture Market in Bowenpally where vegetable and fruit waste is being used to generate power to the extent of 500 units a day and 30 kilos of green manure. This is being done by making use of 10 tonnes of left over market waste. The power generated is being used to light up the market and also to run the canteen in the premises enabling the market committee to make substantial savings in power bills. ‘Isn’t it amazing” that the Bowenpally vegetable market instead of letting the vegetable rot, spreading unhygienic conditions - is utilising it to generate power, he said. “This is the power of innovation, it was nice to learn about it. This is the journey of turning garbage into gold,” the Prime Minister remarked while explaining how the traders decided to make use of the vegetable waste usually left to rot in markets elsewhere. CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) has designed and patented the high rate biomethanation technology based Anaerobic Gas lift Reactor (AGR) for this Rs. 3 crore project funded by the Department of Biotechnology and the State government’s Agriculture Marketing Department. ef scientist A. Gangagni Rao and his team had already commissioned 20 such projects across the country and 10 more are under construction. While the Bowenpally vegetable market garbage to power plant story has been featured in these columns few days ago (Jan.18), the pioneering work being done by the IICT team from the pilot project stage was also reported extensively here over the years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/garbage-to-power-plant-in-veggie-market-gets-pms-pat/article33712815.ece
01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Vaccinated woman health worker dies||A 55-year-old female Healthcare Worker (HCW), who received COVID-19 vaccine in Macherial on January 19, has died on Saturday night after complaining of shortness of breath, giddiness. The State’s Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that ‘the cause of death is clearly indicative of underlying morbidities and not due to COVID vaccination’. The woman, who is a resident of Kasipeta mandal in Mancherial district, received the vaccine on January 19 afternoon at a Primary Health Centre (PHC) in the same locality. On Friday, 11 days after the vaccination, she complained of shortness of breath and giddiness. She was initially admitted at a private hospital in Mancherial and was later referred to Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), at 6 p.m. of Saturday. She died at NIMS at about 11 p.m. of Saturday. “Death occurred due to cardio-respiratory arrest triggered by multiple morbidities such as Kyphoscoliosis with restricted lung disease, respiratory infection with type 2 respiratory failure , accelerated hypertension with left ventricular failure,” Dr. Srinivasa said. The senior officials said that post-mortem examination (PME) will not be conducted on her body as it is not treated as an Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) death. AEFI committee investigation too will not be conducted. From January 16 to 30, Covishield was used in the State. In earlier cases of AEFI deaths of two HCWs who took the vaccine, District AEFI committee conducted investigation. A 42-year-old male healthcare worker in Telangana who received COVID-19 vaccine in Kuntala Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC), Nirmal district, on January 19, died at around 2.30 a.m. of January 20. The male HCW who did not have any co-morbidities has suffered from Myocardial Infarction (MI), also known as heart attack. This is the first such case reported in the State. In the second case, a 45-year-old female healthcare worker who got vaccinated at Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) in New Shayampeta, Warangal Urban, at about 12 p.m. of January 19, has died in the early hours of January 24. PME was conducted in both the cases and district AEFI committees examined the deaths. Officials said that in case of AEFI deaths, viscera, body fluids and a part of a few organs are collected and sent to Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), and National Institute of Virology (NIV)-Pune, for further examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccinated-woman-health-worker-dies/article33712751.ece
01 February 2021||Hassan,||‘3-language policy is not applicable to Central govt. offices’||The Union Ministry of Home Affairs has said that the three-language policy is not applicable to offices of the Union government. The ministry gavethis response to a question filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act on the recent CRPF event at Bhadravati in Shivamogga district, where the plaques unveiled to mark the foundation stone-laying ceremony were only in English and Hindi. Goutham Ganesh M.H., a B. Tech student in Bengaluru, had filed an application before the Union Home Ministry under RTI, asking if the ministry had noticed that the three-language policy not being followed at the programme. The reply furnished by the ministry on January 29 stated that “as per the provision of the Official Language Act, 1963, and the Official Language Rules, 1976, the provision of bilingual policy is applicable in the offices of the Central government”. Home Minister Amit Shah laid the foundation stone for the 97th battalion of the Rapid Action Force in Bhadravati on January 16. The content of the programme engraved on the plaques unveiled on the occasion was only in English and Hindi. The banner on the dais was also inHindi. Kannada activists and leaders from the Opposition parties, including former Chief Ministers H.D. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah, said that Kannada was ignored at the programme. Hundreds of people took to social media to criticise the Centre on this issue, while Karnataka Rakshana Vedike conducted a Twitter campaignon the issue. ‘Need amendments’ Mr. Ganesh told The Hindu that he had observed the developments following the event at Bhadravati and sent the questions to the Home Ministry on January 24. “As the programme was held in Karnataka, Kannada should have got prominence. But the Union Home Ministry has defended its stand citing the rules. I think the only solution could be amendments to the Articles from 343 to 351 of the Constitution which declare Hindi as the official language,” he said. He added that the elected representatives of the State should raise the issue and demand suitable amendments so that all languages are treated equally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-language-policy-wont-apply-to-central-offices/article33712753.ece
01 February 2021||IDUKKI,||Tiger cub gets hunting lessons from humans||For the first time in the country, the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) has taken up the training of a tiger cub to equip it to naturally hunt its prey in the forest environment. The tiger cub was found abandoned inside the forests bordering Tamil Nadu on November 21. It was in a weak condition and medical care and food supplements were given to it in a nearby temporary shelter. While efforts were on to search for its mother, including in Tamil Nadu forests, the cub was monitored round the clock by a team led by two veterinary doctors. Mother untraced Slowly, the cub regained health. “Either its mother is dead or the cub was abandoned as it was not healthy,” Project Tiger field director Anoop K.R. said. “We wanted it to be with its mother,” he said. When that did not happen, it was decided to train the cub to hunt naturally in the wild. The training will go on for two years. Carnivorous animals have a natural instinct for hunting and in Odisha, a domesticated tiger had disappeared into the forests and survived there, according to Mr. Anoop. “It eats meat now and 90% healthy,” PTR deputy director A.P. Sunilbabu told The Hindu . Initially, it is being trained to hunt chicken. The training is given as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority of India (NTCA) guidelines. In a few days, it will be shifted to a new cage where it will not feel the presence of humans and will thus be free of human smell. Normally, when a tiger cub is rescued from the forest, it is shifted to a zoo. However, the training in the PTR is designed to release the cub in the forests where it will have to hunt for survival. Unlike in other forests, the PTR has a large area of grasslands with herbivores. The chance of territorial conflicts for supremacy is also remote as it has a wide area. Reports of man-animal conflicts are rare in the buffer zone as fodder and water are available inside the PTR. In 15 acres Mr. Sunilbabu said nearly 15 acres of wild forest area had been marked and would be fenced off for the training. A caretaker would oversee the training and a doctor would monitor the health of the cub. When the tiger turns two, it will be released into the PTR. P.S. Essa, former director of Kerala Forest Research Institute and a wildlife expert, said the training would equip the cub to survive in the wild.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tiger-cub-gets-hunting-lessons-from-humans/article33712757.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||Why can’t House panel study farm laws, asks Congress leader||The Congress on Sunday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government of trying to “silence” all those who report the truth on the farmers’ agitation with arrests and sedition charges, while the government was yet to act upon the “perpetrators of violence on January 26”. Senior party leader Jairam Ramesh also asked why the government could not allow a Parliamentary Standing Committee to “examine” the farm laws if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was willing to suspend their implementation for 18 months. “Prime Minister says 3 farm laws are on pause for 18 months. This is as usual being too clever by half. Why not give a Parliament Committee the same time to examine them and report back to Parliament?” Mr. Ramesh asked on Twitter. The principal Opposition party up stepped its attack on the government after a freelance journalist, Mandeep Punia, was arrested at the Singhu border protest site late on Saturday night for allegedly “misbehaving” with police personnel. The arrest also comes just days after serious charges were filed in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Haryana against senior journalists, including Rajdeep Sardesai, Mrinal Pande, Anant Nath, Paresh Nath, Siddharth Varadarajan, Vinod Jose and Zafar Agha, as well as Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. Slamming the government for adopting intimidating tactics against journalists covering the farmers’ protests, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Those who fear truth arrest honest journalists.”  Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said journalists covering the farmers’ movement were being arrested, cases were being slapped against them, and the Internet was being shut down in many places. “The BJP government wants to trample upon the voice of the farmers, but they have forgotten that the more you suppress, the more voices will rise against your atrocities,” she said. Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury tweeted, “I do strongly oppose this kind of tyranny of this Govt against our #Food Givers. Shame #BJP, Shame Shame #BJPdeestroys Democracy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-cant-house-panel-study-farm-laws-asks-congress-leader/article33712777.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||CPI(M) condemns spate of FIRs filed against journalists||The CPI(M) Central Committee, the highest decision-making body of the party, strongly condemned the recent spate of cases registered against journalists. At the end of a two-day meeting of the committee, the CPI(M) in a statement said the Union Home Ministry had intensified attacks against journalists “who have been reporting truthfully the events connected with the farmers protests”. “Such efforts to intimidate and terrorise journalists have been going on for some time under the BJP administrations in many cases,” the statement said. Since January 28, FIRs have been filed against nine Indian journalists on charges of sedition and nine other provisions of law, including promoting communal disharmony, insulting religious beliefs and assertions prejudicial to national integration. “Reputed senior journalists have been slapped with these charges on the basis of their personal tweets on social media. This is reprehensible and smacks of efforts to browbeat, intimidate and harass the media,” he party said. The party has reiterated again that the three farm laws need to be repealed. It said that once the laws are scrapped, the government can hold deliberations with farmers and all other stakeholders. The party hoped the Union Budget to be tabled in Parliament on Monday, will raise government expenditure. Party congress With the West Bengal and Kerala Assembly elections scheduled for April, the CPI(M) party congress that was scheduled at that time has been postponed to 2022. This gives the general secretary Sitaram Yechury an additional year in the post. Party sources said that this was not unusual. In 2009, when Prakash Karat was holding the post, the party congress was postponed as the schedule clashed with the Assembly elections in the two key States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-condemns-spate-of-firs-filed-against-journalists/article33712785.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||HAL completes Sukhoi order, last two jets to roll out soon||Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) has manufactured the last two of the 272 Su-30MKIs aircraft contracted from Russia and is all set to deliver them to the Indian Air Force (IAF). “One aircraft is certified and inducted for BrahMos modification. Another aircraft has been produced and planned to be certified by February-end,” an HAL official said. The delivery formalities for acceptance by the customer are being finalised. India had contracted the Su-30s from Russia in batches, and of them, 222 were assembled by HAL at its Nashik plant under transfer of technology (ToT) since 2004. Of the 272 fighters, 40 are being modified to carry the air-launched version of the supersonic cruise missile BrahMos. The IAF has started receiving the aircraft and has deployed some at the Thanjavur airbase last year. Last of major projects “This is the last of the major ToT projects of HAL,” R. Madhavan, Chairman and Managing Director, said. It has completed manufacturing the British Hawk advanced jet trainers. For the Dornier aircraft, the full design and manufacturing licence is with India. Last July, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approved the procurement of 12 Su-30MKI aircraft from Russia to be licence-produced by HAL at an estimated Rs. 10,730 crore. These are meant to replace the Sukhois in the inventory that had crashed over the years. On the progress on this, a defence official said the Russians had quoted a very high price and negotiations were under way. While the Sukhoi assembly line would largely wind down, the aircraft overhaul division at Nasik would continue the repair and overhaul of the MiG series and the Su-30s. Over the years, HAL has developed a vendor base of over 2,000 micro, small and medium enterprises for the Sukhoi project. HAL is currently in the process of ramping up capacity to overhaul the Su-30MKIs from 15 a year to 25. A major upgrade programme for the entire fleet is under negotiation with Russia to give the aircraft better radar, avionics, weapons and so on. Initially, it was envisaged that all upgrades would be incorporated at one go in every aircraft, but given the cost and time it would take to cover the entire fleet, the IAF has decided to go for capability upgrades in phases. ‘Pressing upgrades first’ “Some of the most pressing upgrades will be taken up in the first phase,” the defence official said. Some of the modifications being pursued locally are already under way. While manufacturing of Su-30s comes to an end, HAL is now gearing up for the order of 83 indigenous light combat aircraft (LCA) Tejas-MK-1A, the deal for which is expected to be signed at the Aero India show later this week at an estimated Rs. 47,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hal-completes-sukhoi-order-last-two-jets-to-roll-out-soon/article33712788.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Medical board on abortion ‘unfeasible’||A panel of doctors to decide on termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks as proposed in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Bill, 2020, is “unfeasible” as 82% of these posts are lying vacant in the country, finds a new study. The MTP Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha in March 2020, and is likely to be brought before the Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session. The Bill proposes several amendments, including the constitution of a medical Board in every State and Union Territory, which will decide on pregnancies beyond 24 weeks in cases of foetal abnormalities. Each Board will have a gynaecologist, a radiologist or sonologist, a paediatrician, and other members prescribed by the governments. The report analysed district-wise availability of specialists, including surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists, physicians and paediatricians. It found that for each of the years between 2015 and 2019, the shortfall in these posts hovered between 71% and 81.8%. For 2019, for a total of 21,296 vacancies in the country, only 3,880 were filled, that is, there was a shortfall of 81.8%. The data is based on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s Rural Health Survey, which provides details of vacancies filled at secondary healthcare centres. Similar data for urban areas were unavailable. The study has been brought out by the Centre for Justice, Law and Society at the O.P.

01 February 2021||Indore,||Indore District Magistrate seeks forgiveness||Indore District Magistrate Manish Singh on Sunday said he had apologised to God for the local administration’s action of dumping homeless people outside the city in the cold weather, which had led to a massive public outrage. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had also criticised the administration’s action, terming it a “blot on humanity”. Actor Sonu Sood, who came into the spotlight for helping migrants return to their homes amid the COVID-19 lockdown last year, urged Indore residents to help the homeless people. Facing flak over the incident which took place on Friday, Mr. Singh, while attending a religious event at a Ganesh temple in Khajrana area here on Sunday, said he apologised to god on behalf of the administration. “Whosoever might have been at fault in this incident, but we are officers and we can’t run away from our responsibility. Hence, we prayed to god to forgive us for our mistakes,” Mr. Singh told presspersons. On Friday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan suspended an Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) official after videos of homeless people being driven out of the city and dropped near a village went viral on social media. The civic body has also removed two temporary employees from the job. When contacted, Additional Municipal Commissioner Abhay Rajangaonkar stated, “We are conducting a detailed investigation into the incident. All facts will come to light after the inquiry.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indore-district-magistrate-seeks-forgiveness/article33712775.ece
01 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Modi praises solo effort at lake clean-up||The untiring efforts of a 69-year-old man, paralysed below his knees, towards cleaning up Vembanad Lake, have earned recognition from the highest office of the country. In this month’s edition of his radio programme,Mann Ki Baat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed the commitment of N.S. Rajappan, a differently abled man from Kaippuzhamuttu, near Kumarakom, Kottayam. For several years, Mr. Rajappan has been earning a living by collecting plastic bottles floating on the lake and the streams linked to it. During the speech, Mr. Modi spoke about an elderly person, “who makes us realise our responsibilities. In Kottayam of Kerala, there is an elderly ‘divyang,’ N.S. Rajappansahab. He cannot walk due to paralysis, but this has not affected his commitment to cleanliness,” Mr. Modi said. “Taking inspiration from Rajappanji, we too should, wherever possible, contribute to cleanliness,” Mr. Modi added. In response, Mr. Rajappan said he was so happy that the Prime Minister had acknowledged his efforts. Mr. Rajappan was afflicted with polio at the age of five and has been paralysed since. Living alone in a partially damaged hut on a riverbank in Arpookkara panchayat, Mr. Rajappan is dependent on his sister’s family for food. Mr. Rajappan shot to fame after a local YouTuber published a small video on his life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-hails-solo-effort-at-lake-clean-up/article33712762.ece
01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||TS schools, colleges to start classes after hiatus||Schools and colleges are set to resume physical classes from Monday, after a gap of over 10 months, with strict adherence to COVID safety protocols. The School Education Department took the decision to start classes only for students of standards IX and X, from 9.30 a.m. to 4.45 p.m. in districts, and 8.45 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Hyderabad. Junior, degree and post graduate colleges and universities will function as per their regular timings. To review the preparedness, Education Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy held a meeting with District Education Officers and District Intermediate Officers on January 28. Officials stated that all students would be thermal-screened before entering classrooms that would be sanitised daily. “With much of the syllabus covered through online classes, the focus of classroom learning would be on completing the uncovered syllabus, revision of subjects and clarifying doubts,” a junior college lecturer said. At the review meeting, the Minister stated that parents of about 60% school students had already given their consent to send their wards to schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/schools-and-colleges-to-resume-after-a-hiatus/article33713103.ece
01 February 2021||Bengaluru,||New norms issued for transfer of lecturers||To bring in more transparency to the existing system, the Karnataka government on Sunday issued new guidelines for transfer of lecturers. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who holds the Higher Education portfolio, announced that the transfers would not exceed 15% of the total number of teaching faculty. The transfer process of lecturers in government degree, engineering, and diploma colleges would be done through counselling. A separate notification had been issued by framing a new procedure for transfer of teaching staff of degree and technical colleges, he said in a press release. Those lecturers who have worked for four years at the same place were eligible for transfer. “The transfer process which was on the back burner for many years will be initiated and counselling dates will be announced soon,” said the Deputy Chief Minister. Mandatory transfer Nine per cent of the total teaching staff would be mandatorily transferred. Three per cent would be considered for transfer in case of husband-wife, 1% would be transferred in case of widows, divorcees, who had to look after the specially abled, military, and para-military services, 1% in the physically challenged category and 1% in those who are ailing with serious health issues, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-norms-issued-for-transfer-of-lecturers/article33712871.ece

AEFI committee investigation too will not be conducted. From January 16 to 30, Covishield was used in the State. In earlier cases of AEFI deaths of two HCWs who took the vaccine, District AEFI committee conducted investigation. A 42-year-old male healthcare worker in Telangana who received COVID-19 vaccine in Kuntala Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC), Nirmal district, on January 19, died at around 2.30 a.m. of January 20. The male HCW who did not have any co-morbidities has suffered from Myocardial Infarction (MI), also known as heart attack. This is the first such case reported in the State. In the second case, a 45-year-old female healthcare worker who got vaccinated at Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) in New Shayampeta, Warangal Urban, at about 12 p.m. of January 19, has died in the early hours of January 24. PME was conducted in both the cases and district AEFI committees examined the deaths. Officials said that in case of AEFI deaths, viscera, body fluids and a part of a few organs are collected and sent to Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), and National Institute of Virology (NIV)-Pune, for further examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccinated-woman-health-care-worker-dead/article33713079.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Bengaluru school portals remove fee structure||Many schools in the city have removed the fee structure from their websites and internal portals. This follows the announcement by Department of Primary and Secondary Education on January 29 that school managements can charge parents only 70% of the tuition fees for the current 2020-21 academic year. Parents allege that this is a move to hike tuition fees as the government has banned school managements from accepting donations or charging optional fees for certain facilities, such as extra-curricular activities or transport. A woman whose son is enrolled in a CBSE-affiliated school in north Bengaluru said that the school had removed the fee structure from the portal as the tuition fee comprises only a portion of the total amount she has to pay. “The school charges fees under 21 sub-heads. Collecting only 70% of the tuition fee will reduce the total fee structure by half. The management probably wants to increase the tuition fee and tweak the breakup of sub-heads,” she said. While many schools affiliated to the State board calculate tuition fees by taking into account their recurring expenditure, which includes the salaries of their staff, central board schools charge a significant chunk for their infrastructure and extra-curricular fees. B.N. Yogananda, a member of the Karnataka State Private Schools Parents Associations Coordination Committee, said that they had received several complaints that schools were trying to hike tuition fees. “If school managements try to increase the tuition fee or charge parents under other categories, we will complain to the district-level committee,” he said. He urged parents to check the fee they paid in the last academic year (2019-20) and pay only 70% of that amount. SSLC students in a spot The State government had said that school managements will have to refund the excess fee or adjust the amount against the next academic year’s fee if parents had already paid it in full. However, an adjustment in the fee for the next academic year is not a feasible option for SSLC students in Class X. Parents, who have already paid the full amount, have demanded a refund. Parents who are planning to shift their children to other schools have also demanded a refund.  The school charges fees under 21 sub-heads. Collecting only 70% of the tuition fee will reduce the total fee structure by half.

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. likely to postpone Census to 2022||The office of the Registrar General, in reply to a Right To Information query from The Hindu filed in November, said the schedule, or the questionnaire, of the NPR was “being finalised” and the information about the expected date of the first phase of the Census was “not available.” The entire process had become controversial after Parliament approved the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December 2019 that sought to give citizenship to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014. However, the rules required for implementing the CAA have not been framed so far — more than a year after the passage of this key legislation. Diplomatic sources believe that strong opposition from Bangladesh is one of the factors that led to the CAA remaining on hold. Tens of thousands of people hadtaken to the streetsacross the country protesting against the Centre’s decision to update the NPR, which is considered the basis for the preparation of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) that could potentially exclude millions of people born in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-likely-to-postpone-census-to-2022/article33712767.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A bullet through an island’s heart||Zone 3 — on 52 sq km of pristine forest — will be a nature zone, further categorised into three districts: an exclusive forest resort, a nature healing district and a nature retreat, all on the western coast. There will be ‘underwater’ resorts, casinos, golf courses, convention centres, plug-and-play office complexes, a drone port with fully automated drone delivery system, nature cure institutes and more. An international airport capable of handling all types of aircraft will be central to this development vision because “all successful case studies and references” studied by the visioning team indicate that an international airport is key for development. The only jetty on the island will be expanded and a marina will be developed next to the tourist entertainment district. A 100 km greenfield ring road will be constructed parallel to the coastline from east to west and will be supplemented with a mass rapid transit network with stations at regular intervals. The vision plan is not in the public domain, even though it is said to have been finalised months ago. The comparison with Singapore, for instance, is one key. It has a map of Little Andaman overlaid on Singapore’s, along with the following statistics: “The population density of the Andaman and Nicobar is 47 people per sq km while it’s (sic) 7,615 persons per sq km in Singapore. Its per capita income is $1,789 compared to Singapore's $55,182.” ‘Blocks’ to development There are certain factors, the vision document notes, that could prevent Little Andaman from becoming the new Singapore — factors that are “stopping us from developing these into veritable jewels for the country”. These include lack of good connectivity with Indian mainland and global cities, a fragile biodiversity and natural ecosystems and certain Supreme Court notifications that pose an impediment to development. Another key factor is the “presence of indigenous tribes and concerns for their welfare”. There are other concrete obstacles that the vision takes note of: 95% of Little Andaman is covered in forest, a large part of it the pristine evergreen type. Some 640 sq km of the island is Reserve Forest under the Indian Forest Act, and nearly 450 sq km is protected as the Onge Tribal Reserve, creating a unique and rare socio-ecological-historical complex of high importance. The vision needs 240 sq km (35%) of this land and the solutions suggested are simple and straightforward — de-reserve 32% of the reserved forest and de-notify 138 sq km or 31% of the tribal reserve. And if the tribals become an impediment, the vision suggests that they “can be relocated to other parts of the island”. The vision document has maps with no legends or explanations and uses inappropriate photographs plagiarised from the Internet. It talks of conservation of national park/wildlife sanctuary on Little Andaman when none exist here and it has no mention of the geological vulnerability of the place, which was amongst the worst-affected in the earthquake-tsunami combination in 2004. The waves hit Little Andaman so hard that on December 26 the breakwater there was not just breached, it was physically displaced and it’s orientation changed. Ships could not berth for weeks thereafter. The plan has no financial details, no budgeting, or inventorisation of forests and ecological wealth and no details of any impact assessment. The nature resort complex proposed at West Bay on the western coast is to have theme resorts, floating/underwater resorts, beach hotels, and high-end residential villas. It is today a secluded and difficult to reach part, one of the most important nesting sites of the globally endangered Giant Leatherback sea turtle which is being studied by the Dakshin Foundation, the Andaman and Nicobar Environment Team and the island administration’s Forest Department. Forest Dept.’s concerns In a note dated September 26, 2020, Divisional Forest Officer, Little Andaman, raised serious concerns about this vision on grounds of ecological fragility, indigenous rights and vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunamis. The note said such large diversion of forest land would cause obvious environmental loss leading to irreversible damage (more than 2 million trees stand in the forest land sought for these projects), that habitats of various wild animals including endangered sea turtles would be affected, and that the impact could not even be assessed because there was no environment impact assessment report and neither were there any detailed site layout plans for the proposed diversion. This note of dissent was a minor irritant and was ignored in the plan and vision that seeks to alter the nature of an ancient island bigger than Chennai and Mumbai in area. The vision document, described by conservationists as a first bullet through the heart of the island, is to be followed by a second one soon. A meeting is to be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary on February 4 to initiate the denotification of the Onge tribal reserve on Little Andaman.

Along with the redevelopment of Central Vista and construction of a new Parliament, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has proposed a garden along the banks of the Yamuna near Purana Qila to mark 75 years of Independence. The CPWD had launched a design competition in November 2020 for the structure, which can be a tower or a sculpture. A total of 98 entries had been received, according to the CPWD’s website, and the results were to be announced in December-end. The deadline was then pushed to Sunday, January 31. Officials said designs had been shortlisted and a winner would be finalised within a month. When announcing the competition, the CPWD said the structure could be a maximum of 134 metres in height. “The structure should be iconic in design and represent the national Capital. For example, at present India Gate prominently signifies Delhi. The proposed iconic structure being built in the independent India should now become a new symbol of the Capital,” the CPWD’s brief had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/design-for-new-structure-to-be-revealed-in-a-month/article33712786.ece

Yediyurappa to immediately intervene and resolve the dispute between the workers and the management of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) at the Bidadi plant, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Sunday said he would raise the issue in the Assembly to bring pressure on the government. “The employees of Toyota have been protesting for about three months. The State government should have resolved the issue by now. If the problem cannot be resolved by the Labour Minister, the Chief Minister should intervene,” he said during his visit to the protest site at Bidadi, near here, to meet the protesting workers and their families. He said the government should immediately intervene since the families of workers were in a dire situation as they have not received salary for three months. Mr. Siddaramaiah spoke to Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar on the phone and urged him to resolve the dispute immediately. “Deputy Chief Minister and Ramanagaram district in-charge C.N. Ashwath Narayan conducted a conciliatory meeting between the workers and the management. The meeting lasted 20 minutes and he declared it successful. If the meeting was successful, would the workers still be sitting in protest?” he asked. The Congress leader also said that he had told the management representatives, who met him recently, to sort out the dispute amicably. “Water, power, and land has been given to the company by the State. The workers should be treated fairly. The management should respect the law of the land. Being a Japanese company, it cannot forcibly try to implement Japanese law here. Though we welcome foreign investment, we expect them to comply with the local laws,” he said. He also pointed out that despite D.K.

01 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||IFFK to open with Bosnian film Quo Vadis, Aida||Bosnian film Quo Vadis, Aida set around the Srebenica massacre of 1995 during the Bosnian war, will be the opening film of the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala to be held from February 10. The film looks at the impending massacre through the eyes of Aida, the UN translator in Srebenica, whose family is also among the citizens of Srebenica trying to get shelter in the UN camp. The Srebenica massacre, in which more than 8,000 Muslims perished, was one of the most gruesome incidents of mass violence during the Bosnian war. Many stories For Bosnian filmmaker Jasmila Zbanic, this is not her first attempt at telling the many stories associated with that protracted war that changed the face of her homeland. In 2006, she made Grbavica , which talked about the systematic rape of Bosnian women by Serb soldiers during the war. The film went on to win the Golden Bear award at the Berlin International Film Festival that year. Her latest film too featured at the competition section at the Venice International Film Festival and was chosen as Bosnia's entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 93rd Academy Awards. At the IFFK, the film will be screened at the Nishagandhi theatre, as the opening film. Meanwhile, the registration of delegates for the IFFK, which opened on Saturday, is moving at a slower pace compared to the previous years. As on Sunday morning, 24 hours after the registrations opened, only around 1,000 registrations, out of a total of 2,500 passes available, were done. Compared to this, in the previous years, more than 1,000 registrations were done in the first hour of registrations opening, even when close to 10,000 passes were available. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases in recent days seems to have tempered the enthusiasm of film buffs. No rush The organising of the festival in four phases across four regions in Kerala also seems to have reduced the rush for delegate passes for the festival happening in the capital city. On Saturday, some delegates experienced issues with the payment gateway after the registrations opened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iffk-to-open-with-bosnian-film-quo-vadis-aida/article33712763.ece

01 February 2021||C. JaisankarTIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||African catfish invade markets, raise concern||Sale of African catfish, a banned variety, has raised serious concern among people in the city. Factoring in the health hazards posed to the consumers, the Central government issued a ban on catfish farming in 2000. Breeding, transportation and sale of the invasive species in the market were also banned. The ban was implemented across the country as the carnivorous fish was posing a threat to indigenous fish varieties. Though the fish traders are aware that the sale of catfish, which is often called devil fish, ‘Theli’ in Tamil, is illegal, it is openly sold in fish markets in the city. It is available at Gandhi Market and Kasivilangi Market. Most of the fish traders market it is as a farm fish. There are takers for the catfish as it is one of the cheapest varieties. One kg of fish sells for Rs. 100 to Rs. 150. The traders market it live by putting them in open containers filled with water. There are customers for live fish. “It is disheartening to see the fish markets in Tiruchi teeming with catfish. The ignorant people, who are unaware of the danger and health issues, buy it as it is available in plenty and at a cheap rate,” says N. Jamaludeen, a consumer activist. Catfish survives even in sludge, and is reared in ponds by fish farmers in rural areas. They leave catfish hatchlings into lakes as they have a high growth, survival and breeding rate. Inland fishers prefer catfish as they grow faster and fetch a good price. Mr. Jamaludeen said officials should create awareness among the people of the ill effects of eating catfish. The traders should also be sensitised. Punitive action should be taken against those selling the banned fish, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/african-catfish-invade-markets-raise-concern/article33713331.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Mint Street, by-lanes in utter shambles||The nearly 3-km-long Mint Street in the Royapuram Zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation is not only known as one of the oldest business hubs in the city but is also notorious for its congestion. Narrow carriageway, chock-a-block buildings, a huge influx of people, movement of tricycles and cycle rickshaws and the existence of innumerable lanes and by-lanes are cited as the reasons for the congestion and chaos. While these make up for the character of the locality that remains unchangeable, the state of the roads can improve the situation, say residents and shopkeepers. Damaged roads on many stretches of Mint Street and adjacent areas have of late worsened the congestion in the locality, they say. Two spots where this is glaring are the intersections with Audiappa Naicken Street and Anna Pillai Street. The roads are completely damaged at the intersections. C. Ravi, an autorickshaw driver, says the intersections were dug up a few months ago. “I do not know what the work was. However, the intersections have not been repaired since. The vehicles coming from all four directions slow down at the intersection, leading to utter chaos,” he says. Digging up a stretch, primarily for underground drainage maintenance, and leaving it unattended or inefficiently repaired is the key reason for the poor condition of the roads in the locality. The stretch from the intersection at Nyniappa Naicken Street to Ekambareshwarar Agraharam Street is a case in point. In the middle of the stretch, the road was dug up to repair the drain, which has been covered with concrete, rendering it uneven. Manholes, either protruding a few inches above the road or sitting a few inches below, are common along the stretch. “Two-wheeler riders somehow manage. But cars have to completely slow down every few metres, resulting in traffic congestion,” says A. Anbu, a hawker on the street. Anna Pillai Street, NSC Bose Road and Govindappa Naicken Street are some roads where driving remains a challenge. For instance, Anna Pillai Street is fully damaged for a few hundred metres near the Arunachlaleswara Varadaraja Perumal Temple. Worsening condition K. Ankit of Amman Koil Street, who runs a business, says NSC Bose Road was unusable during the recent rain. “The road remained damaged even before the rain, and the condition worsened further. The road has not been repaired since,” he says. Frequent patchworks worsened its condition rather than improving it. “The quality of patchworks is poor and these spots make the road uneven,” he says. Even the newly laid stretch on the northern side of Mint Street has not been properly done. “It was laid recently. However, it is dotted with cavities that are a few inches deep wherever manholes are located,” he said. An official from Zone 5 of the Corporation said the repair work in the locality had already begun, and would be completed at all the places soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mint-street-by-lanes-in-utter-shambles/article33712932.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CMRL may have to cut fares to attract more passengers||In two weeks, a Chennai Metro ride will help commuters travel from the northern part of the city — Wimco Nagar — to the Chennai airport in the south in just a little over an hour. The phase I extension project from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar, opening five years after the construction began, will have stations at Tondiarpet, Kaladipet and Tiruvottiyur. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited, since the stretch faced heavy traffic congestion during peak hours, it would improve mobility for people and bring down travel time. “Initially, the number of passengers travelling may be a little low, but eventually it will pick up,” an official said. But since the fares of Metro Rail are high, ranging from Rs. 10 to Rs. 60, the stretch may not draw commuters in large numbers, sources said. 5% increase expected “We are expecting a 5% increase initially in the number of people using the system. Maybe when the pandemic is over and everyone is back to office, it can increase a little more. But the fares have to be brought down for more people to travel,” an official said. Jeyanthi V., a commuter, said a small section of people travelling from places like Tiruvottiyur to the Madras High Court may use this; then, there will be some travelling to places like Central and Guindy. “Since there is good connectivity of suburban trains too and it is cheaper as well, I’m not sure how many will prefer to use the Metro, unless they bring down the fares. A public transport that wants to connect all parts of the city should be affordable to all. If they reduce fares, certainly people will be willing to travel, since it is clean and maintained well. Perhaps, it will help those from the southern and central parts of the city to travel to the north easily,” she said.  If they do reduce fares, then certainly people will be willing to travel since it is clean and maintained well Jeyanthi V Commuter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmrl-may-have-to-cut-fares-to-attract-more-passengers/article33712938.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Attempt to misuse intelligence machinery by ex-IGP thwarted||After an attempt was made by a former Inspector-General of Police to engage officers of the Special Branch-CID to check the prospects of star candidates in the upcoming Assembly election, an alert has been issued, cautioning the State intelligence machinery against intrusion by unauthorised persons. According to sources in the police headquarters, a retired IGP allegedly made calls to some detachment officers of the SB-CID, a sensitive wing dealing with the collection of intelligence, including threat perceptions to VIPs, political developments and other related issues, and asked them to check the prospects of prominent personalities in select constituencies. Strange request Baffled by the strange request, deputy superintendents of police/inspectors informed the Chief of Intelligence about the former official wanting them to check the prospects of certain personalities in the ensuing Assembly election. They said that when the staff asked the caller to identify himself, he said he was a retired IGP. “The issue was promptly brought to the notice of the Chief of Intelligence, who issued an alert, warning detachments of the SB-CID of disciplinary action if they carry out instructions from unauthorised persons. In case of any such call, the staff were told to immediately communicate the details to the police headquarters,” a senior police official told The Hindu . “Ahead of the election, political parties and their leaders consider intelligence inputs on the prospects of their parties/candidates crucial. Intelligence officials have been warned against disclosing classified information to any official, serving or retired, who may attempt to access details they are not entitled to [access],” an official said. It is routine practice for Central/State intelligence agencies to informally assess the prospects of parties or select candidates ahead of Parliamentary/Assembly elections, but these are for professional reasons and not at the behest of any request made by the authorities, police sources added.

This was 93% of the 70.27 lakh children targeted, according to the figures released by the Health Department. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami inaugurated the campaign at his camp office by administering the polio drops to a few children in the presence of J.

01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Portrait of Thyagaraja, once an integral part of Aradhana||As yet another Thyagaraja Aradhana is about to start on Monday, albeit with restrictions, a portrait of the saint-composer that is in the possession of the family of nagaswaram player Tiruveezhimizhalai Subramania Pillai conjures up the faction-ridden days of the festival at Thiruvaiyaru. In the portrait, Thyagaraja is seated without a tambura. Instead, he holds a jebamala . Every year, this portrait would be taken from Tiruveezhimizhalai to Thiruvaiyaru to be carried in the procession as part of the Aradhna conducted by Periya Katchi. This faction was led by Narasimha Bhagavathar, the elder brother of the Thillaisthanam lineage of Thyagaraja’s disciples. “So long as my grandfather was alive, he would perform puja in the evening. We are continuing the tradition,” says S. Raghunathan, grandson of Subramania Pillai. Narasimha Bhagavathar and his younger brother Panchu Bhagavathar conducted the festival together between 1904 and 1910, until they fell out. “They started organising the festival separately. The faction of Panchu Bhagavathar was known as Chinna Katchi ,” says music historian V. Sriram, who has written extensively on the subject. The portrait was actually in the possession of violin maestro Malaikkottai Govindaswamy Pillai, one of the key leaders of the Periya Katchi . He handed it over to Subramania Pillai in 1931 before his death. “It was used for pada purappadu [the procession] on the last day of the Aradhana. Govindaswamy Pillai handed over the portrait to Subramania Pillai and his younger brother Natarajasundaram Pillai,” says musicologist B.M. Sundaram. Besides the portrait, Govindaswamy Pillai gave the thoda , an ornament, gifted to him by the Tiruchi-based jeweller Ragunatha Tawker, Mr. Sriram says. Several musicians, especially nagaswaram and thavil players, associated themselves with the Periya Katchi , though they were not allowed to perform on the stage. Mr. Sriram says a faction — Pengal Katchi — emerged after Bangalore Nagarathnamma, who bought the land and constructed the temple for Thyagaraja, entered the scene in 1921. She had the support of the Periya Katchi in the beginning, but organised a separate event when the two factions denied her an opportunity to perform during the festival. In 1940, ICS officer S.Y. Krishnaswami succeeded in uniting all the factions, which then started using a panchaloka idol of Thyagaraja for the procession. “Nagarathnamma made multiple prints of the portrait of Thyagaraja without the tambura and distributed it to everyone. I have come across families that have received a copy from her,” says Mr. Sriram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/portrait-of-thyagaraja-once-an-integral-part-of-aradhana/article33712950.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Prime Minister to visit Chennai on February 14||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Chennai on February 14 when he will inaugurate the Chennai Metro Rail project’s Washermenpet-Wimco Nagar line, an extension of phase I, among other schemes. Five years after laying the foundation stone of the Chennai Metro Rail, the nine-km stretch from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar is now ready for its opening, though it should have been completed last year. The inauguration of the line was delayed because of the lockdown. This stretch will have eight stations at Washermenpet, Sir Thiyagaraya College, Tondiarpet, New Washermenpet, Toll Gate, Kaladipet, Tiruvottiyur Theradi, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar. At present, Chennai Metro Rail is gearing up to finish the final inspection and receive the mandatory approval from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS). This inspection will take place from February 5 to 7 and following this, the certificate of approval from CMRS will be sent. Sources said though the construction of stations has been in progress, it was going to be quite difficult to finish all the work in another two weeks. “Especially, in stations like Tiruvottiyur Theradi and Tondiarpet, there is a lot of work left to be done,” he said. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they have increased manpower in all the stations to ensure the construction and installations of systems were done before the inauguration. “We have been testing the trains too for the last two months.We are waiting to get the certification for signaling safety—mandatory to run trains in the automatic operation mode—and this will come from the signaling contractor on 3 February,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/modi-likely-to-open-phase-i-extension/article33712927.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Former top executives of ITNL arrested||Former top executives of IL&FS Transportation Networks India Ltd (ITNL), Mumbai, were recently arrested by the Economic Offences Wing of the police on charges of cheating a Chennai-based private company. According to sources, Ramchand Karunakaran, former managing director, and Hari Sankaran, former vice-chairman and director of ITNL, were arrested in Mumbai on January 27. Accused remanded They were produced before the Special Court for cases under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interest of Depositors Act and remanded in the Saidapet sub-jail. They were booked for alleged offences of cheating and criminal breach of trust in the repayment of Rs. 200 crore invested in debentures by the complainant, 63 Moons Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Chennai. The complainant company said that in 2014 and 2015, ITNL notified the issuance of 1,000 and 2,000 non-convertible debentures with a face value of Rs. 10 lakh each, aggregating to Rs. 100 crore and Rs. 250 crore respectively, on private placement basis. The complainant company alleged that the information memorandum was supported with credit ratings by reputed credit rating agencies and highly inflated balance sheets by its statutory auditors, who falsely created a picture that ITNL and IL&FS were highly profitable. To lure investors, ITNL falsely promised guaranteed annual return of up to 11.8% payable half yearly until redemption to its investors against their deposits with ITNL. The complainant relied on the representations and assurances made by the ITNL and key managerial personnel and invested Rs. 200 crore in debentures. Default in payment In 2018, IL&FS defaulted on its financial obligations and subsequently, ITNL defaulted in the payment of interest on debentures. Investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office exposed the alleged role of key management personnel in mismanagement in the lending business. Money was lent to the entities without due diligence. The complainant company alleged that it lost Rs. 200 crore due to fraudulent representations of the accused. Acting on this, the Economic Offences Wing booked cases against the company and the accused under sections 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 409 (Criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 120B (Criminal Conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act 1997.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-top-executives-of-itnl-arrested/article33713278.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A business hub amid squalor||The air in the intersection of Mulla Sahib Street and Thirupalli Street, located closer to Mint Street, carries a stench of decaying garbage. The spot has two huge garbage containers, adjacent to a transformer, providing enough forage for stray cattle. Shopkeepers in the vicinity say that although the conservancy workers visit the area daily, the garbage bins are not cleared for several days. “Garbage trucks rarely come to this spot. Conservancy workers, pushing tricycles, occasionally clear only a part of it,” says Mukesh, who works at a nearby shop. Similar is the situation on Amman Koil Street, Anna Pillai Street and Govindappa Naicken Street.  Overflowing sewers Apart from the failure to clear garbage, residents and shopkeepers complain of overflowing underground sewers. A shopkeeper on Amman Koil Street says sewage had overflowed from a manhole located near the Dharmanath Jain Temple until recently. “Workers would visit and fix the issue once in a while. However, it would recur the very next day. Luckily, the issue has not recurred for the past few days. We hope this continues,” he says. A senior official of the Corporation said that although the locality generated a huge quantity of garbage, workers did a fair job of keeping the area clean. “If we have better cooperation from shopkeepers and residents, we will be able to do better,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-business-hub-amid-squalor/article33712934.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Revamp electronic voting system: CCE||The Citizens’ Commission on Elections (CCE), a body of eminent persons with domain knowledge to delve into critical aspects related to elections, has recommended that the voting system should be subjected to independent review and the integrity of the election should be subjected to independent audit with the findings made public. The CCE was constituted in March 2020 to draw upon expert advice and come up with suggestions to ensure that elections were free and fair. The CCE comprises former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur as its chairman; retired IAS and former CIC and vice-chairman of CCE Wajahat Habibullah; former judge of the Madras High Court Hari Paranthaman; economist Arun Kumar; civil society activist Dr. John Dayal; senior journalist Pamela Philipose; IIT-Delhi professor Dr. Subhashis Banerjee; retired IAS officer Sundar Burra and former IAS office and coordinator M.G. Devasahayam. In its interim report, the CCE recommended that the VVPAT system should be redesigned to make it fully voter-verified. “The voter should be able to approve the VVPAT printout before the vote is cast, and be able to cancel if there is an error. The integrity of the VVPAT slips and the EVM machines during the entire time after polling and before counting and auditing must be ensured in a manner that is verifiable by all (and especially the candidates). There should be no trust requirement on the custody chain,” the report said. ‘Redesign software’ The CCE said EVM’s cannot be assumed to be tamper-proof and the voting system should be redesigned to be software and hardware independent in order to be verifiable. “The decision-making processes within the EC need to be much more logical, rigorous and principled compared to what it was for the 2019 parliamentary elections,” it said. The committee demanded a stringent audit of the vote count before the results are declared. The audit should not be based on adhoc methods but by counting a statistically significant sample of the VVPAT slips according to rigorous and well-established statistical audit techniques. “The audit may in some cases — depending on the margin of victory — require a full manual counting of VVPAT slips,” it said. Among the other recommendations of the CCE was that a law was needed to decide on what needs to be done if the audits revealed a problem.  The voter should be able to approve the VVPAT printout before the vote is cast, and be able to cancel if there is an error Citizens’ Commission on Elections||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revamp-electronic-voting-system-allow-audit-cce/article33712921.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Poll results will end CM’s political career’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday said the upcoming Assembly election would not only put an end to the AIADMK regime but also to the political career of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. “I am criticising the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister not out of personal vendetta. Their political activities are wrong and their government is driven by selfishness,” he said while taking part in ‘ Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin’ (Stalin in your constituency) at Nazarathpet in the Avadi constituency, Tiruvallur district. Reacting to Mr. Palaniswami’s criticism that he held the ‘ vel ’ (a trident) only to deceive the people, Mr. Stalin said it was presented to him by the people, the temple priests and the district secretary in Tiruattani. “I just held it. Are we saying that one should not have faith in god? In his dialogues for the film Parasakathi , our leader Kalaignar [Karunanidhi] wrote not against temples, but against temples becoming asylums of scoundrels,” he said. “What is Mr. Palaniswami’s problem? Why is he afraid of the ‘ vel’ ? Does he fear that I will annihilate him? People will do that politically,” Mr. Stalin said. Talking about a photograph in which he is seen with late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, Mr. Stalin said it was shot during the staging of a play, Murase Muzhangu , to celebrate the DMK’s victory in the 1971 Assembly election. “MGR advised me to concentrate on my studies, saying that I should show equal interest in politics and studies. Has Mr. Palaniswami, who is talking about MGR, even seen him?” Mr. Stalin asked. He said Tamil Official Language Minister K. Pandiarajan should change the name of his Ministry to “Hindi Development” because he was promoting Hindi. “He has his roots in the RSS. He was with the BJP before joining the DMDK. Now he is with the AIADMK. He will certainly go back to the BJP after the defeat of the AIADMK in the Assembly polls,” he said. Demands apology Mr. Stalin demanded an apology from the IT wing of the AIADMK that had accused him of “enacting a political drama” over the financial assistance given by the government to Arani-based Ezhilarasi. During an interaction with Mr. Stalin in Tiruvannamalai district, Ms. Ezhilarasi had complained that though the government had announced a solatium of Rs. 2 lakh after her mother was killed in a gas cylinder blast, the amount had still not reached her. He had promised to help her. “It happened on January 29 and was watched by the ruling partymen. The amount was credited to her bank account immediately. The IT wing then accused me of staging a drama, saying the amount was given to her two months ago,” Mr. Stalin said. “I have proof that the amount was credited to her account only on January 29. If the IT wing has the courage, let it file a case against me,” he said. Mr. Stalin said he was ready to tender an apology if he had lied about the incident. “Otherwise, I will move the court against the IT wing,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poll-results-will-end-palaniswamis-political-career-stalin/article33712911.ece

They had wrapped these capsules in polythene or rubber covers and tied with a thread, according to a release from Chennai Air Customs. Eight held The names of the eight passengers were given as Ganakavalli, Nishanthi, Kala Peradeep Kumar, Jayaraj, Jegatheesh, Ghabar Khan, Mohammed Hikkam and Thasleem Fathima. All of them arrived from Dubai and Sharjah. On suspicion that they may be carrying gold, the officials held them. They found that the passengers had swallowed these capsules before departure. “They voluntarily requested in writing for taking suitable action under the Customs Act to recover the capsules containing gold paste,” the press release said. Accordingly, they were admitted to the Stanley Government Hospital to recover the capsules under expert medical supervision. The process of recovery was cumbersome and they were fed with a heavy diet to facilitate ejection in a natural way,” the press release added. Cumbersome process It took eight days to finish this process. Totally, they got 161 capsules weighing 2.8 kg and worth Rs. 1.28 crore from the stomach of passengers. Eight bundles of 61 capsules were seized. Separately, they got three gold chains, eight gold bits, eight gold rings, two bundles of gold paste from their handbags and pant pockets. Finally, they got 4.15 kg of gold worth Rs. 2.17 crore and seven passengers were arrested. Further investigations are on.  All of them arrived from Dubai and Sharjah.

01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools to reach out to parents over resumption of classes||The government’s decision to permit students of Classes 9 and 11 to return to schools from February 8 is something that most institutions expected. While schools reopened for Classes 10 and 12 on January 19, the School Education Department has rolled out the reduced syllabus in the last few weeks for the current academic year for Classes 9 to 12. Ashok Shankar, general secretary, CBSE Schools Management Association, says that in the next one week, the schools will ask parents of students of Classes 9 and 11 whether they will send their children back to the campus. “We expect many students to start attending in-person classes, as is the case with students of Classes 10 and 12. Many students have said they are happy to be back on campus, and we are ready to welcome more students with all safety measures in place,” he says. Based on how many students are expected to return, schools will have to start preparing their campus for the additional strength and scale up safety measures. When schools reopened for Classes 10 and 12, the government issued a Standard Operating Procedure to ensure the health and safety of students and teachers, “While mask-wearing has been easy to implement, we are constantly reminding the students of the need to maintain physical distancing during hours in between classes so that they do not move around or sit together in groups,” says a teacher of a private matriculation school. The Standard Operating Procedure has mandated that not more than 25 students be seated in a classroom at a time and attendance not be made compulsory since schools that were running online classes can continue them. “More clarity is needed at the earliest on the academic schedule for the next two months. We still have no information about when the board exams will happen or how many working days we will have for the current academic year,” says Patric Raymond, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation. This will help teachers plan their schedule better for the next few months and give the students a better direction, he reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-to-reach-out-to-parents-on-resumption-of-classes/article33712914.ece

Palaniswami should prevail upon the Centre to withdraw the order against the admission of students in the two courses.  “It has been proved a lie the claim of the Centre that the ‘Institute of Eminence’ status would not pose any threat to the 69% reservation. It has also exposed the drama of the AIADMK government that had said that it would protect the reservation,” he said. Recalling the announcement of the university that students could not be admitted to the programmes supported by the Centre, since reservation was not acceptable to the government, Mr. Stalin said it had not revealed under whose direction it was issued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-two-courses-at-anna-varsity-stalin-tells-centre/article33712939.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘DMDK will continue its alliance with AIADMK’||DMDK treasurer Premalatha Vijayakant on Sunday said the party would remain in the AIADMK alliance, adding that as a woman, she had sympathy for former AIADMK interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala, who has been released from prison and discharged from hospital. “I have never met Sasikala but I support her as a woman. She has been discharged today and there is no need to talk about whether my opinion is against the AIADMK or not. So far, we have remained in the AIADMK alliance. However, it is not beneficial to delay seat-sharing talks, as the election is fast approaching. There is a good chance that the alliance will win big,” she said. “The AIADMK leadership has said Sasikala will not join the party. Like you all, I am also waiting to see if there will be any change in the AIADMK,” she added. On the PMK’s demand for internal reservation within MBC quota, she said, “All of us belong to some caste or the other. If one caste asks for separate 20% reservation, then all castes have the right to demand similar quotas. I leave it to your imagination to see what will happen if every caste makes a similar demand.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmdk-will-continue-its-alliance-with-aiadmk/article33712905.ece
01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Speaking the language of the customer||Valliamma, who sells colourful beads in Mamallapuram for a livelihood, is keen to make her trade lively for tourists. Speaking in multiple languages — fluent English, Tamil, Hindi, a little French, Italian and German — is her strength, and she has not stopped despite the dullness brought on by the lockdown. “I could not study after Class 5. I started to sell beads from the age of 10. Foreigners stayed in hotels here, and I used to try and talk to them in English, saying, ‘Sir, want some beads, marbles and red coral?’ If I did not know how to ask something, I used to ask them to teach me English. That is how I slowly learnt the language,” the 24-year-old said. Practical lesson Residing in Pooncheri, Valliamma, mother of a three-year-old boy, said she managed to pick up words from foreign tourists. “I can greet tourists in French and Italian. In French, I say ‘ bonsoir ’ or ‘ ça va ’. I mainly learned to say the cost of the beads in these languages so that it helped me communicate with them,” she said. When she saw Indian tourists, she spoke the language of the State from where they came. “I speak to tourists in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and also in English. Some of them are surprised to see me, a woman from the Narikuravar community, speaking in fluent English,” she added. But not all is well for people like her who rely on tourists to make a livelihood. Valliamma said her business was badly hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. “We used to travel to Agra and Delhi by train to purchase stones. Mamallapuram gained more popularity after the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “However, sales were hit owing to COVID-19 and the lockdown. We had no business after the lockdown and stayed at home for nine months,” she added. She said a few persons from Chennai distributed essentials such as rice, oil and dal to a number of families, helping them during the lockdown. “Sales were good when we had an inflow of foreign tourists. It has been picking up slowly in the last one month. I earn Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 a day, but on some days I earn nothing. It will take at least two years for business to return to normal,” Valliamma added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speaking-the-language-of-the-customer/article33712941.ece

01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sasikala can’t contest polls till 2027||Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala, who got released from prison recently after serving a four-year sentence in a disproportionate assets case, can neither contest an Assembly election nor a Parliamentary election till January 27, 2027, though there is no legal bar on her leading a party. Section 8 of the Representation of the People (RoP) Act of 1951 lists instances where a person will suffer disqualification from contesting elections if he/she gets convicted for certain offences. Section 8(1)(m) brings a conviction under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act of 1988 under the ambit of disqualification. The provision also states that if a person has only been fined by a court of law for offences such as indulging in terror activities, rape, subjecting women to cruelty and promoting enmity between two groups, listed under Section 8(1), he/she will stand disqualified for six years from the date of such conviction. But if he/she has been imprisoned for those offences, then the disqualification will begin from the date of such conviction and continue for a further six years from the date of release from prison. Since Sasikala was imprisoned besides being fined, she will stand disqualified for six more years from the date of her release. The trial court had found her guilty under sections 109 (abetment of an offence) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, read with sections 13(1)(e) [being in possession of wealth disproportionate to known sources of income] and 13(d) [criminal misconduct by public servant] of the PC Act of 1998.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sasikala-cant-contest-polls-till-2027/article33712912.ece

01 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City’s first Miyawaki forest turns one||As the first Miyawaki forest in Chennai turns one this week, the Greater Chennai Corporation wants the residents’ associations to notify details about unused spaces in their neighbourhood for raising a similar forest. The Corporation aims at raising 1,000 such plantations. It has already raised Miyawaki forest in about 20 locations in the last one year in the city. The first Miyawaki forest was created in Kotturpuram near the MRTS station after clearing 1,600 tonnes of debris one year ago. Over 2,210 saplings were planted and the trees and shrubs have shown significant growth in one year, thriving on the compost derived from household waste. Rich harvest After one year, the Miyawaki forest has produced banana fruits, hibiscus flowers, papaya and drumstick pods, with 70 jackfruit trees, 40 tamarind trees and 50 neem trees vying for space. The 70 jackfruit trees are expected to form a part of the canopy that includes 400 trees belonging to eight local species. Officials said the trees were selected from among those found in Chennai. “We finalised 39 species of trees and shrubs. Four distinct layers are expected to be formed after seven years.” The canopy has 400 trees on top, a second layer of another 410 trees, a sub-layer of 410 trees and 800 shrubs at the bottom. The growth has been 10 times faster and the density of greenery has been 30 times more than the usual. The land was readied for plantation by utilising 80 tonnes of compost, 18 tonnes of coir pith, 12 tonnes of cow dung and two tonnes of straw. Residents of the area have not been permitted to visit the Miyawaki forest. “We will permit students to study the Miyawaki forest,” said an official. Buzzing with birds “Butterflies and birds have increased in the area. The details about the Miyawaki forest in Kotturpuram have been given in a board inside the area. The font size is small and is not visible from the outer boundary of the Miyawaki forest. We request the Corporation to place the board at the boundary so that residents are able to read the technical details about the Miyawaki forests,” said R. Saravanan, a resident. After seven years, the Miyawaki forest in Kotturpuram is expected to absorb 43 tonnes of carbon dioxide and release 200 tonnes of oxygen, officials said. The Corporation plans to hold a meeting with residents on Monday. It has decided to launch programme to create awareness of green spaces in every residential area in the 15 zones of the city, motivating residents’ associations to support such initiatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/citys-first-miyawaki-forest-turns-one/article33712920.ece

Vaccines are being administered to the frontline workers as a token of gratitude for their work in COVID-19 management, she said. “Doctors, nurses, paramedics, conservancy workers and police are given the vaccines first because they worked as the frontline warriors.

In a memorandum to the Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani, the Association president Raja Shanmugham said that nearly 95 % of units in the garment sector were MSMEs. Subsequent to the lockdown last year, the government announced financial and other supportive measures and the Tiruppur garment sector had revived and exports were at the normal level. However, with hike in cotton yarn prices and disruptions in availability of the yarn, the exporting units, especially the smaller ones were hit hard. Since this trend could affect the entire garment sector, the industry needed positive intervention from the government. Hence, Mr. Shanmugham said, the government should announce the RoDTEP and include additional sops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garment-exporters-seek-rodtep/article33712969.ece

01 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||BJP’s growth is a threat to U.T.’s autonomy, says Veerappa Moily||Senior Congress leader and AICC observer Veerappa Moily has called upon the rank and file of the party to remain vigilant and ensure that the BJP does not grow in Puducherry as it could destroy the very identity of the Union Territory. Addressing a Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) meeting here on Sunday, he said the Puducherry government had not only been confronting the COVID-19 pandemic but also Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi. “We should all stand in solidarity with Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy because the intention of the BJP is to destroy the separate identity of Puducherry,” he said. “Late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wanted the development of Puducherry as a separate State according to the wishes of its people. But now the intention of the BJP is to destroy the separate identity of Puducherry and its autonomy. They will be lost if the BJP is encouraged in the Union Territory in the forthcoming elections,” Mr. Moily said. The BJP would withdraw all powers and hence every vote in this election should be against the BJP, he said. Mr. Moily called upon the rank and file to protect democracy and federalism because the development of Puducherry would be assured only under the rule of the Congress. Care and attention The development of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) and the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Karaikal were all possible because of the care and attention the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) gave to Puducherry, he said. A Congress government, which would be elected again, would file a damage suit against Ms. Bedi for her attitude and disruption of all the welfare schemes. The Lt. Governor had proved her negative agenda by obstructing the development of the Union Territory in all the sectors, he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjps-growth-is-a-threat-to-uts-autonomy-says-veerappa-moily/article33713286.ece

Nadda said here on Sunday. Addressing a public meeting at the AFT grounds during his day-long visit to galvanise the party for the polls, Mr. Nadda said: “We will win 23 plus seats [in the 33-member house with three nominated MLAs] in the polls. Corruption will end and development work will start after the polls.” The BJP government would take up the revival and modernisation of the textile and sugar mills, disburse pending salaries in public sector undertakings, construct new flyovers and take up railway projects, he said. Thousands of people in Puducherry had benefited from the Centre’s schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana and Ayyushman Bharat scheme, he said. Accusing the United Progressive Alliance of neglecting the Union Territory, he said when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, Puducherry was given a grant of 70%. “When Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy was a Minister in the UPA government the grant was reduced to 30%. The UPA then waived a Rs. 5,000-crore loan of Jharkhand but failed to do anything for Puducherry. The region’s debt increased substantially,” he charged. He also flayed the Congress for not holding the local body elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-will-secure-more-than-23-seats-in-puducherry-nadda/article33713283.ece

01 February 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Bad roads cause hardship to residents||After the rains stopped, 90 % of the roads had turned dusty with cracks and potholes, leading to hardships to residents and motorists. With the north east monsoon, the city and peripheries experienced severe rainfall during November-December 2020. When the rains stopped, the unseasonal rainfall for about 10 days in January led to chaos. Many dwellings were inundated. Low lying areas were under water for about a week or even more. The Corporation authorities used 150 giant size motors to pump the rain water out. Though there was relief, thickly populated zones and low lying areas such as Dhanasekaran Nagar, Muthammal Colony, Ram Nagar, Kurinji Nagar, Bryant Nagar among others continued to have nightmares to tell. While the civic authorities were promising to give relief soon, motorists complained of vehicles getting damaged especially on the Thoothukudi-Tiruchendur stretch, George Road and the Agsar paint roundabout. As the corporation was carrying out road works under Smart City Project, main roads like VVD Road, VE Road, Tiruchendur Road were not fit for driving. Motorists with orthopaedic and spondylitis issues have to take the risk of breaking their neck or back, DMK MLA Geetha Jeevan said. When The Hindu contacted Corporation Commissioner V P Jayaseelan on Sunday, he said that they have drained the rainwater completely. Preliminary assessment of damages to roads have been taken. A proposal to the tune of Rs. 18 crore had been sent to the State government for approval for laying roads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bad-roads-cause-hardship-to-residents/article33713336.ece
01 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Many healthcare staff hesitant to have COVID-19 vaccination||After the exclusive vaccination roll-out for healthcare workers undertaken until January 31, other front-line warriors, including municipal workers and the police, are slated to receive a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from February 1. But less than 50% of healthcare workers in Tiruchi have volunteered to take the vaccine, reports say. And, even among them, those from private hospitals were more in number, when compared to their counterparts in government health care facilities. According to the data furnished by the Collectorate on January 28, as many as 2,439 out of 3,100 inoculated healthcare workers were from private establishments. The healthcare workers from the government hospitals numbered only 661. In a hurry? Why are healthcare workers hesitant? “With the advent of technology, we now have a vaccine which usually takes decades to prepare but readied in months. Even if technology allows us to manufacture vaccines faster, conducting human clinical trials is a long process. Experts condemn this hurry and fast-paced move because the details of the efficacy of phase three trials of Covaxin are not transparent,” says A. Mohamed Hakkim, Emergency Physician practising at a private hospital in the city. The efficacy trials of these vaccines haven’t been made public or subjected to peer reviews, Dr. Hakkim says. The inhibition of healthcare workers was explainable and justified, he believes. However, senior health officials say while doctors came forward to take the vaccination, paramedical staff such as nurses and other support staff, were unwilling. Speaking to The Hindu , M.S. Ashraf, former national vice-president, Indian Medical Association, said the paramedical staff had been influenced by uncorroborated messages on social media, and were apprehensive. “They read such news on their smartphones and decide against taking the vaccination. I took Covishield on January 17, and have so far had no side effects. While doctors are taking the vaccine to set a precedent, they cannot compel the staff,” he says. However, vaccination is the only way to protect oneself from the viral infection, he adds. Dr. Ashraf says the significant drop in COVID-19 cases in Tiruchi district and across the State has allayed the fear of contracting it. “They do not understand that a second or third wave is possible. It is our duty to address this apprehension,” he adds.  Why they are wary  Efficacy trials haven’t been made public or subjected to peer reviews, says a doctor  Many are influenced by uncorroborated messages on social media and are apprehensive||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-healthcare-staff-hesitant-to-have-covid-19-vaccination/article33713325.ece

01 February 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||Tiruvarur police dismiss allegation of excesses||In an apparent departure from convention, the Tiruvarur police on Sunday publicly refuted allegations levelled by the Opposition parties in connection with the skirmishes that broke out between protestors and law-enforcers during the recent tractor rally in Tiruvarur in support of the agitating agriculturalists in New Delhi. The call for the rally was made by All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee. The Opposition parties organised a demonstration here demanding the release of three persons - one each from Dravida Munnetra Kazahgam, the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxists) - on charges of unlawful assembly, causing damage to public property, preventing police personnel from executing their duty, attempt to murder, and uttering unparliamentary words. A policeman used a public address system fitted to a mini-goods carrier and read out what appeared to be an official statement of the police department. Earlier, R. Mutharasan, State secretary, CPI, claimed that he had received information that a senior police officer in Tiruvarur district, who is a sympathiser of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), had prevailed upon the police to act against the farmers who were opposing the Farm Laws. K. Ponmudi, deputy general secretary, DMK and former Minister, said the farm laws were against the interests of agriculturalists and would affect the general public too. Intensification of the protest had become a necessity, he said. The demonstrators raised slogans condemning the police for the ‘high handedness’ in dealing with the Tiruvarur tractor rally and demanded that the cases foisted against the participants be withdrawn and the arrested persons released. Just when the participants were about to disperse from the demonstration venue, the policeman read a statement of the department narrating what had happened during the tractor rally organised by the Opposition parties and the AIKSSC, Tiruvarur district unit, without securing permission. He explained how the police force had handled the situation patiently even after some women police personnel sustained injuries when the barricades were pushed down by the participants.

The meeting was in protest against an agitation organised by the SDPI in support of the farmers’ rally in Delhi on January 26. A person dressed up as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was featured at the SDPI protest and the workers had spoken critical of him, said police sources. As the meeting attended by BJP functionary Kalyanaraman was progressing, 12 SDPI workers marched towards the venue, claiming that Mr. Kalyanaraman insulted Prophet Muhammad in his speech. They were removed by the police. Later, another group of SDPI workers arrived at the place and threw stones. The police used mild force to remove them. More than 25 SDPI workers were arrested in connection with the incident.  Deputy Inspector General of Police (Coimbatore range) K.S. Narenthiran Nayar and Superintendents of Police from Coimbatore rural, the Nilgiris and Erode camped at Mettupalayam. Mr. Nayar said that 350 persons were detained for staging road blockade at various places around Mettupalayam. Earlier in the day, Coimbatore rural police kept ‘Vellore’ M. Ibrahim, president of Tamil Nadu Ekathuva Prachara Jamaat, under preventive detention. He had come to Coimbatore to attend a fund-raising event for Ram temple and the BJP meeting at Mettupalayam. The detention was made as some organisations had announced that they would not allow Mr. Ibrahim to attend the BJP meeting. He was released in the evening. Coimbatore city and rural police sounded alert across the district following the tension at Mettupalayam. Meanwhile, members of SDPI and Popular Front of India staged a road blockade in front of Coimbatore Rural SP's office late on Sunday, demanding the arrest of Mr. Kalyanaraman and the release of those arrested at Mettupalayam.

The villages and the seashores are fascinating tourist spots. But the scenic beauty of the places is sadly disturbed by incomplete projects — Kanniyakumari-Thiruvananthapuram four-lane work; underground drainage system in Nagercoil and roads dug up for the work have not been relaid; and a new water supply scheme for Nagercoil. Many roads are in a very bad condition with a lot of potholes. Occurrences of accidents with considerable damage to vehicles have become common. So, the district administration and corporation authorities are requested to expedite the projects. G. Stanley Jeyasingh, Nagercoil.   The Indian Red Cross Society, Tirunelveli Chapter, seems to be inactive since March 2020 when the election for the management committee representatives was announced but later cancelled due to administrative reasons by the president, the then Collector. As such, the laboratory for testing blood on the Red Cross premises in Palayamkottai, run by the committee, was also closed. Since very nominal fees were collected for blood sugar and other tests, it was a boon to many people. From March 24, the office and the laboratory are under lock and key till date. As spread of COVID-19 has come down, I request the authorities to open the laboratory and the IRCS office. Rajakumar Arulanandham, Palayamkottai.

The police officials involved in nabbing the culprits deserve appreciation with promotion, cash reward and merit certificate with public felicitation. They displayed courage by gunning down the mastermind. I suggest that all residents’ associations in Tamil Nadu must interact and cooperate with police by exchanging information about suspicious persons, mainly migrant workers who are mainly involved in construction sector and other menial work. Besides, people must strengthen their own security by installing CCTV cameras, hiring talented private security personnel with canines.  A.M.N. Pandian, Tirunelveli.    It is heartening to learn that among the corporation personnel who were honoured during the Republic Day celebration in Tirunelveli were officials who ensured drinking water supply when the Tamirabharani was in spate and sanitary workers. In January, when the Tamirabharani was in spate due to heavy rains and the drinking water supplying wells on the riverbed were submerged, there was no drinking water for the people. Water was distributed through tankers. As soon as the flood reduced considerably, corporation personnel worked day and night to revive water supply to houses. Every morning, two women push a tricycle fitted with waste bins and blow a whistle to sound an alert for bringing out the waste from the houses. These people deserve all appreciation from the residents. Baby Harline. J, Palayamkottai.    In Eruvadi, Tirukkurungudi and Kalakkad, paddy is cultivated.

Sanitary workers collect the waste in this area and dump here. The corporation has not made any arrangement to clear the garbage through lorries or tractors for more than a month. Last month when the Corporation announced that grievances can be sent through WhatsApp, the residents jumped into a conclusion that their problems would be addressed immediately. Unfortunately, our WhatsApp complaint lodged on January 9 and subsequent reminder remain unheard. Hence I request the civic authorities to take action immediately as the month-old garbage stinks. V.

As there is only one shelter for passengers, they are forced to sit on the dirty floor or keep standing for long. The discomfort is more pronounced during rainy and summer seasons. There is no toilet for women, and men find themselves forced to relieve themselves in the open due to which a stench emanates. The shelter is also poorly lit and looks unsafe.

01 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Shiv Sena criticised for attempts to raise border issue||Most speakers in the district-level Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in Kagwad in Belagavi district criticised attempts by Shiv Sena leadership to raise the border issue. Prabhakar Kore, president of the sammelan and KLE Society chairman, said that such attempts were politically motivated. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other leaders are raking up sensational issues for political benefit. “Shiv Sena leaders are raising the issue just to help the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti in its campaign for the Belagavi City Corporation elections. They will not succeed. We should stop paying attention to such tactics. We should neglect them,” he said. He felt that Mr. Thackeray’s demands that Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka should be merged with Maharashtra were meaningless. Equally inappropriate is the counter demand by Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi that Mumbai should be merged with Karnataka as it has a lot of Kannada speakers. According to him, the whole idea of reorganisation of States based on language was old. “There is no need for such an idea now-a-days when people of different languages reside in different States. There are innumerable Kannada speakers in Maharashtra and a similar quantum of Marathi speakers in Karnataka. They use the two languages for trade and every day communication. This should not be taken as a factor for seeking reorganisation again,” Mr. Kore said. The reorganisation of States on linguistic basis is a settled matter. Maharashtra government or Marathi-speaking groups in Karnataka should not raise it any further, he said. Manu Baligar, Kannada Sahitya Parishat president, asked Shiv Sena and MES leaders not to provoke peace-loving Kannada speakers. “Provoking the Kannadiga is to wake up a sleeping lion. Don’t try to do that,” he said. “People of Belagavi and other border areas have rejected the divisive politics of MES and Shiv Sena. People of Karnataka want to live in harmony with groups speaking multiple languages. No one should disturb this atmosphere,” he said.

01 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||BJP accused of getting HDMC polls postponed purposefully||Some former members of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation have said that the BJP is purposefully postponing elections to the urban local body. Congress leaders Deepak Chinchore, Yasin Haveripeth and others told journalists in Dharwad on Sunday that the BJP was using “dirty tactics” to see that the elections are not held this year. The term of the HDMC elected body ended two years ago. As per law, elections should be held within six months after the term of an existing body expires. However, some BJP leaders, including some former corporators, have approached court seeking postponement of elections, they said. They said that MLA Arvind Bellad and the HDMC commissioner and the Dharwad Deputy Commissioner are exercising powers in the absence of an elected body. Mr. Chinchore said that the court had directed the Urban Development Department to issue a notification for delimitation and reservation of seats in six weeks. But, the BJP leaders are filing objections to reservation and delimitation of wards. They want the polls to be postponed indefinitely, he added. Mr. Chinchore also accused the BJP of interfering with the process of delimitation and reservation of wards to see that non-BJP areas are being mixed with other areas to see that other party candidates did not win. Going by these trends, the entire delimitation process is going on unscientifically. The officials should not succumb to political pressure but abide by the order of the court and focus on scientifically, and in a transparent manner, effecting delimitation and reservation, he said.  ‘The term of the HDMC elected body ended two years ago and, as per law, elections should be held within six months after the expiry of term’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-accused-of-getting-hdmc-polls-postponed-purposefully/article33713063.ece

01 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Flower exports may not bloom by Valentine’s Day||Pandemic-hit Karnataka’s flower exports will take some time to recover, while the domestic market is limping back to normalcy after COVID-19 brought the floriculture sector to a complete halt from April to September. Though some growers have slowly started exports from October, infrequent flights and high freight charges have made exports unviable. Also, lockdowns and restrictions that still exist in certain key markets have further dampened the sentiments of the market, according to International Flower Auction Bangalore (IFAB), a common platform for flower growers and buyers that follows the Dutch system of auctions. Karnataka exports cut flowers to places such as Japan, the Middle East, Singapore, Russia, Australia, U.K., New Zealand, Taiwan, Holland, Germany, Spain, and China. M. Vishwanath, Managing Director, IFAB, told The Hindu: “We don’t see our exports market recovering even during Valentine’s season this year as both logistics and customer markets are yet to be ready after the pandemic.” According to him, the flower market was virtually closed down for six months as customers “did not even want to touch flowers”. As a result, farmers who grew carnations, gerbera, roses, and other varieties started disbudding to stop flowering. Also, whoever was at the end of crop years (roses yield for five years, gerbera 2/3 years, and carnations 2 years) removed the crops to cut cost, while some others abandoned their farms unable to manage without income. Some also repurposed their polyhouses to grow capsicum, cucumber, greens, and other vegetables, and now are slowly switching back to floriculture. It costs Rs. 2 lakh per annum to maintain a hectare of polyhouse farming, said Mr. Vishwanath, who is also Joint Director, State Horticulture Department. “We saw roses and other flowers being sold at Rs. 2 or Rs. 2.5 per stem, mostly below the cost of production, when we resumed operations of IFAB on May 7. But, we got good price in October, November and part of December thanks to marriage and festival seasons. Some 300 flower growers sell their produce on our platform,” he said. Roses, on an average, can fetch Rs. 5 to Rs. 16 per stem depending on the demand in the domestic market, while a stem of rose can fetch up to Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 in the export market. Karnataka has 18,000 hectares under floriculture cultivation, (more than 80% of it is open cultivation and the remaining is polyhouse farming), accounting for 14% of India’s total area under flower production, 20% loose and 13% cut flower production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flower-exports-may-not-bloom-by-valentines-day/article33712893.ece
01 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Spending on SC/ST welfare fails to reach even halfway mark||The Social Welfare Department, which receives the largest share in the budgetary allocation, has not seen expenditure of even 50% of the allocated sum in the first nine months of the financial year 2020-21. The expenditure on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes welfare, by various departments routed through Social Welfare, has been 47.5% so far. Of the total allocation to the SC special programme of Rs. 17,863.16 crore, the expenditure by the end of December was Rs. 8,431.59 crore (about 47%). With respect to Tribal Sub Plan, Rs. 3,722.49 crore was spent of the total allocation of Rs. 8,267.30 crore (about 48%). Owing to COVID-19, the State had reduced the total allocation by about 7.5%, from Rs. 27,699.52 crore to Rs. 25,616.83 crore. Of the total allocation, the department has an allocation of Rs. 3,106 crore, down from the original allocation of Rs. 3,988 crore. The rest of the amount is distributed to 36 departments, which would in turn take up welfare works for SCs/STs. While the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj and Minor Irrigation Department have spent 68% and 70% respectively, the Social Welfare Department has been able to spend only 43.63%. A senior official, who attended a review meeting by Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu last week, said the Minister had been upset with the “poor expenditure” even as the fiscal year was coming to an end. About 70% of the expenditure is completed by December, and COVID-19 impacted this, the official said. The Minister was upset with officials when they pointed out certain expenditure have been shown as made under the “deemed expenditure”. He said he would not approve such expenditure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/spending-on-scst-welfare-fails-to-reach-even-halfway-mark/article33712891.ece

Kumaraswamy on Sunday asked the Congress not to bother about the relationship between the JD(S) and the BJP in light of the tie-up between them in the Legislative Council. The BJP and JD(S) have arrived at an understanding over the post of Council Chairman, with the BJP already getting its nominee M.K. Pranesh elected as Deputy Chairman. “When we were in the coalition, the Speaker of the Lower House was from the Congress. We had discussed the issue of Chairman in the Legislative Council in the coordination committee. Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda had proposed the name of senior member Basavaraj Horatti to Sonia Gandhi. Despite that, they did not agree,” he told presspersons in Bagalkot. “The Congress broke the alliance and said the alliance was a setback for them. Then why should they bother about the decisions we take?” On the JD(S) contesting in the byelections to Belagavi Lok Sabha and Basavakalyan and Maski Assembly constituencies, he said the party was yet to decide on the matter. “We will consult our workers. There will be no alliance with the BJP in the bypolls.” Mahadayi solution In light of the Mahadayi issue cropping up again, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the current situation was best suited for finding a solution to the long-standing problem as the BJP rules at the Centre and in Goaand Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-rules-out-bypoll-tie-up-with-congress/article33712886.ece

01 February 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||Renovation of Ambedkar’s school picks up pace||Little is known about the connection the town of Dharwad shared with the architect of Indian Constitution Dr B.R. Ambedkar. Ambedkar not only stayed in Dharwad for some time but was also responsible for establishing a hostel and cooperative society for the oppressed class. . The hostel, which was in a dilapidated state, was renovated by Dr B.R. Ambedkar Educational and Charitable Trust in 2010, and renamed as Ramatai Ambedkar College Boys Hostel. The same campus now houses Buddharakkitha School and two other educational institutions. The government is developing the premises apart from building a Ambedkar Memorial Hall in a phased manner at a total cost of Rs. 36 crore. Work, which had slacked during the lockdown, is picking up pace again. Ambedkar’s first visit to Dharwad was reportedly in search of “the Mahar from Dharwad” (as mentioned in records of the Bombay government) who raised the lone voice for right to education for all. This man had approached the Bombay Native Education Society, seeking admission for his son, which ultimately led to the British government issuing orders allowing admissions to all. Secretary of Dr B.R. Ambedkar Educational and Charitable Trust F.H. Jakkappanavar told The Hindu that the incident of the ‘Mahar from Dharwad’ dated back to 1856, which had made Ambedkar curious, but he could not trace him.  However Ambedkar’s association with Dharwad continued for several years. In 1929, Ambedkar came to Dharwad with his wife Ramatai and during this period motivated his two followers to set up ‘Machigar Cooperative Credit Society’. He also procured two acres of land from the then district collector for building “Depressed Classes Students’ Hostel”. “Tulasaraddy Mudiraddi of Hebasur then donated Rs. 4,000 to build the hostel. While the British government provided 50% of the expenses, the rest was borne by Ambedkar with support from the locals,” said Mr. Jakkappanavar. However, when Ambedkar got busy with the Round Table Conference, he asked his wife to visit Dharwad. “Ramatai visited the hostel along with B.H. Varale and was shocked to see its sorry state. She sold her ornaments, purchased grocery, cooked for the students, and was in regular touch till she passed away in 1935,” Mr. Jakkappanavar said. It was in 1969 that former Minister B. Basavalingappa built Buddharakkitha School on the premises. But, over a period, the premises was in a state of neglect before a new team of trustees took over the responsibility. Ambedkar’s grandson Prakash Ambedkar is now the chairman of the Trust and visits Dharwad regularly. During former Chief Minister Siddaramiah’s tenure, an estimate of Rs. 25 crore for building a memorial and other structures was sanctioned. The subsequent Congress-JD(S) coalition government released Rs. 4 crore for the second phase, which is nearing completion. Recently, Deputy Chief Minister and Public Works Minister Govind M. Karjol inspected the premises and announced that work on the second phase of the memorial hall built at a total cost of Rs. 10 crore would be soon completed.  The government is developing the premises apart from building a Ambedkar Memorial Hall in a phased manner at a total cost of Rs. 36 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/renovation-of-ambedkars-school-picks-up-pace/article33712890.ece

Savadi said on Sunday that the government will roll out electrically operated city buses in the State on a trial basis in February. If the trial starting from Bengaluru is successful, buses will be introduced in phases in other cities in the State, he said. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating a bus stand for city buses of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) in Udupi, the Minister said that 350 electrically operated buses will be run first in Bengaluru on a pilot basis. The government will get those buses on a lease through bidding. The Union government is encouraging and supporting States to introduce electrically operated buses to reduce the pollution level in cities. An electric bus would cost about Rs. 2 crore. Of this sum, the Union and the State governments together gave a subsidy of Rs. 88 lakh, with Rs. 55 lakh being the Union government’s share and Rs. 33 being borne by the State government. Investors in electric buses will be paid an agreed amount per km basis. The Minister said that the State now has more than 26,000 electrically operated vehicles. The government is waiving road tax for electric vehicles to encourage their use in large numbers. The Minister said that the government has fulfilled nine of the 10 demands of employees of the State-owned transport corporations put before the government last year. The operating cost of buses can be reduced by using ethanol blended fuel. He said that steps will be taken to name the bus stand being constructed for outstation KSRTC buses in Udupi after the former Minister late V.S. Acharya. Chairman of the KSRTC M. Chandrappa said that amid facing the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 and increasing fuel cost, the KSRTC is giving good service to people without hiking travel fare. It took steps to ensure that its employees are paid full salary during the COVID-19 period. Udupi MLA K. Raghupati Bhat said that both the private and government sector buses in Udupi are providing good service to people. They should not resort to unhealthy competition. He said that the Transport Department should take steps to introduce colour coding for autorickshaws being operated in the jurisdiction of the city. The bus stand for city buses inaugurated on Sunday has been constructed at an estimated cost of Rs. 3.95 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/electric-city-buses-on-trial-run-from-this-month/article33713207.ece

01 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Scribes should help connect govt., bureaucracy with people: Minister||Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa said on Sunday that the government is committed to releasing funds required for the development of four roads in Kombaru village, Kadaba taluk of Dakshina Kannada. Speaking at a village stay programme of journalists at Kombaru, the Minister said that the such an initiative, third in the series, taken by Dakshina Kannada Union of Working Journalists (DKUWJ) is worth emulating by journalists in other parts of the State. The Minister said that the journalists instead of “criticising each and everything” should focus on organising such village stays to help connect the government and bureaucracy with the people.  The Minister said that arranging interactions of local people with the elected representatives and officials during the village stay will help address several issues. The Minister said that the funds required for the development of roads in Kombaru will be released in due course of time. After the DKUWJ organised its second village stay at Madappady village, Sullia taluk, about a year ago, the government has sanctioned Rs. 2 crore for the development of a road connecting Madappady village. He released a hand book on the second village stay of journalists organised in Madappady village. Minister for Fisheries, Ports and Inland Transport, S. Angara, who also represents Sullia Assembly constituency covering parts of Kadaba taluk, said that his constituency required the construction of 186 bridges and 118 foot bridges. Of the 278 village roads under his constituency, 16 roads are being upgraded as major district roads for handing them over to the Public Works Department. In all, 124 bridges have been built in Sullia Assembly segment till date since 1994, he said. During his interaction with people, Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada K.V. Rajendra said that the district administration will attend to the petitions submitted to the government at the programme within a month. If some issues cannot be addressed, the administration will specify the reason why they cannot be addressed immediately, he said and added that some issues pertaining to policy matters cannot be addressed at the district level alone. Mr. Rajendra said that people’s participation also mattered in the development of villages.

01 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Forest Dept. readying to tackle any possible summer fires||With the day-time temperatures soaring high, the Forest Department is bracing for a possible outbreak of summer fires across the M.M. Hills-BRT Tiger Reseve-Bandipur-Nagarahole landscape and has deployed additional manpower to cope with any exigencies. A regular feature in the landscape which has mostly dry deciduous and scrub forests that are bone-dry by the second week of February, the authorities have also completed the mandatory burning of fire lines that tend to act as ‘fire-breaks’ in case of any conflagration. At Bandipur Tiger Reserve that has a history of major fires in summer, the authorities have completed the controlled burning of fire lines extending to almost 2,400 km. S.R. Natesh, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said that there were rains in the first week of January that helped build up moisture and delayed vegetation turning dry to certain extent. In such places, the controlled burning was taking place now, he added. In addition, the authorities have recruited 435 fire watchers on a temporary basis as their first line of defence in the event of an outbreak. They are mostly recruited from the villages surrounding the reserve and have stakes in preventing the outbreak of fires. Besides this, the authorities have sought the assistance of the Indian Air Force who have promised to be on standby in the event of any outbreak that threatens to go out of control. For instance, vast swathe of forests in Himmavad Gospalswamy Betta range were reduced to cinders and a fire was spreading out of control when the IAF pressed in two choppers that air dropped water using bambi buckets to douse the fire in February 2019. With regard to deployment of fire vehicles, they will be in place after the completion of the Aero Show in Bengaluru at Yelahanka from February 3 to 5, according to Mr. Natesh. At M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary which is seared by extreme heat, about 500 km of fire lines have already been cleared through controlled burning to help check the spread of fire. Besides, 110 local villagers drawn from various tribes, have been recruited on a temporary basis and deployed across different divisions to act as fire watchers. This is part of the regular fire prevention protocol that is followed by the department across the State, said V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. He said the deployment of 110 temporary fire watchers is in addition to 140 guards deployed in 35 anti-poaching camps set up across the 906 sq km. Though inadequate, Mr. Yedukondalu said the forest watchers have been deployed in high risk areas that are prone to fires like Ramapura and Hoogyam. The authorities have also sought the assistance of the Fire Department who have positioned rapid response vehicles at Kollegal and Cowdahalli so as to reach the fire-affected areas. Besides, the authorities have requisitioned 40 fire blowers that will add in combating any conflagration. Similar arrangements are also in place at Nagarahole and BRT all of which have a history of forest fires during summer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forest-dept-readying-to-tackle-any-possible-summer-fires/article33713230.ece
01 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Roots, tuber mela on Feb. 6, 7||A roots and tuber mela will be held in the city on February 6 and 7 to reinforce their importance as a natural source of nutrition. The mela will be held at the Nanjaraja Bahadur Choultry from 10.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and is being organized by Sahaja Samruddha, an organization popularising indigenous paddy and conservation of agro-diversity in association with Rotary Club of Mysore (West). The focus will be to sensitize the urban community towards the benefits of tuber consumption and explore more value addition and include them into the cultivation. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha said Jenu Kuruba, Betta Kuruba, Soliga, Irula, Kunabi tribes are participating in the mela along with their tuber collection. Farmer groups from different parts of the State will showcase various kinds of tubers, food items and value added products that will also be up for sale. Rare roots and tubers like air potato, purple yam, black turmeric, and arrow root seed material will be available for sale at the mela. A contest on cooking with roots and tubers will be organised for the public on the concluding day and the mela will be an introduction to the nutritional value of tubers and roots to the younger generation, said Mr. Krishnaprasad. Citing experts, he said roots and tubers are rich in carbohydrates and provide almost one-third of energy from an equivalent weight of rice or wheat owing to their high moisture content. From the cultivators’ point of view they are beneficial because roots and tubers can adapt to diverse variety of soils and local environmental condition, he said. The mela will be inaugurated Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar and N.M. Shaji of Kedaram Tuber Conservation at Wayanad will be the chief guest. He will display 120 varieties of tubers including rare varieties recovered by tribals.

01 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Will Mandya’s jaggery make it to the PDS?||Amid being chosen in ‘One District, One Product programme, a Centre-sponsored initiative for micro food processing enterprises, plans are now afoot to supply jaggery produced in Mandya, the sugar bowl of Karnataka, through the public distribution system (PDS) under which beneficiaries get subsidised foodgrain. As a support to the ‘Alemanes’ or the jaggery-producing units that manufacture nearly one lakh tonnes of jaggery in Mandya annually, district in-charge Minister Narayana Gowda urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to bring Mandya jaggery under the PDS, making it available to beneficiaries across the State at fair price shops at a subsidised cost. A response from the CM is awaited and the proposal is expected to be discussed in the Cabinet before a decision is taken. Mandya has around 591 alemanes in sugarcane producing areas. Sources in the Agriculture Department said Mandya has the highest number of jaggery units in the State. Sugarcane is cultivated in 42,500 hectares in Mandya and nearly 45 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was produced annually. Under ‘One District, One Product’ of Atmanirbhar Bharat, steps have been taken to rejuvenate existing jaggery units and encourage setting up of new ones, giving financial support to those coming forward to be part of the programme. Financial and technical support was being offered to micro food processing units under Atmanirbhar. Each jaggery unit can expect a loan ranging from Rs. 5-10 lakh. Plans are also afoot to raise a sum of Rs. 25-30 crore loan to help the units. Mandya Joint Director of Agriculture Chandrashekar told The Hindu that the application format for seeking financial aid for the modernisation of alemanes was uploaded three days ago. The same will be communicated to the units, who can seek loans according to their requirements by submitting the applications online. On learning about the project, many units and food processing organisations (FPOs) are making enquiries to avail of the benefit and are keen to produce organic jaggery. Hopefully, all of them may make use of the funds, rejuvenate and set up new units, improving jaggery production, he said. “The focus is on improving their income and the proposal for its inclusion in PDS is one such step,” Mr. Chandrashekar said. The thrust is on alemane operators to switch over to chemical-free jaggery production by adopting latest technologies. At a meeting in Mandya recently, attended by the Mr. Narayana Gowda, Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, and others, the district officials said chemical-free jaggery production will help farmers improve their income besides increasing the chances of their product identified for exports. Ms. Symalatha sought brand building and promotion of organic jaggery produced in Mandya. She suggested production of export-quality jaggery to expand the market for the product. Sources said nearly 6 to 7 lakh tonnes of sugarcane produced in Mandya goes toward jaggery making. Around one quintal of jaggery was produced crushing one tonne of sugarcane.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-mandyas-jaggery-make-it-to-the-pds/article33713225.ece
01 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Projection of 11% growth in economy a lie, says ex-CM||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday dismissed as a “lie” the 11% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate projected by the Centre in the Economic Survey 2021-22. “They have lied in the Economic Survey,” he told reporters in Mysuru while accusing the Narendra Modi-led BJP government of lying to conceal its “total failure” in handling the country’s economy. Mr. Siddaramaiah pointed out that the GDP, which was growing at a rate of 8% to 9% during the reign of Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister, had started falling gradually ever since Mr. Modi assumed office in 2014. The country’s economy, which has contracted by 7.7% during 2020-21, had grown by just 4.2% during the preceding year of 2019-20, which was before COVID-19 struck, he said. “The economy is in the doldrums,” he said, adding that the Centre was misleading the public by claiming that the economy would grow by 11%. He added that unemployment in the country, which used to be just 2% to 3%, has now reached 9.2% in urban areas and 8.9% in rural ones. Mr. Siddaramaiah attacked Mr. Modi on the continuing rise in prices of petrol and diesel andwondered why the Prime Minister was not addressing the difficulties faced by the public, who are being forced to spend a lot on fuel. “Should he not tell people in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ why petrol now costs Rs. 90 alitre?” he asked. He recalled that petrol used to cost no more than Rs. 60 per litre and diesel less than Rs. 50 per litre, while LPG was available for between Rs. 350 and Rs. 400, when Dr. Singh was PM. “Why is it so high now when the price of crude oil has come down from $110 per barrel to just $45 to $46?” he asked. On the farmers’ agitation in the national capital, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the “BJP goondas” were responsible for fomenting trouble at farmers’ demonstrations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/projection-of-11-growth-in-economy-a-lie-says-ex-cm/article33712888.ece

Dhruvanarayan on Sunday rued that spending on Scheduled Castes sub plan and tribal sub plan this year has been dismal. Ever since the rules for the Karnataka Scheduled Castes Sub Allocation and Tribal Sub Allocation Act, 2013, were framed in 2017, the State government had been allocating between Rs. 20,000 crore and Rs. 30,000 crore for SCSP and TSP every year and the progress report had shown that utilisation of funds had ranged between 93% and 96% during 2017-18 and 2018-19. But, for 2020-21, the utilisation remained a measly 47.5% till end of December 2020, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said. Addressing a press conference here, he said during 2017-18, a total of Rs. 27,859 crore was allocated for SCSP and TSP. Of this, Rs. 27,341 crore was released and Rs. 26,109 crore was spent, accounting for utilisation of 95%. Similarly, during 2018-19, Rs. 28,842 crore was allocated and Rs. 27,904 crore was released. Of this, a total of Rs. 26,841 crore was spent, accounting for utilisation of 96%, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said, sharing copies of the progress reports. “If utilisation of funds does not cross 90% by March 31, the Congress will launch a State-wide agitation and hold demonstration in all district and taluk headquarters, he cautioned. He accused the BJP government of also diverting funds released for SCSP and TSP to other purposes like Bengaluru Metro and construction of bridges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dismal-utilisation-of-funds-this-year-dhruvanarayan/article33712894.ece

Yediyurappa’s inspection of a few roads developed by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. (BSCL) on Saturday did little to convince residents and motorists that projects will be completed any time soon. Activists and residents pointed out that he only inspected roads where work had been completed while many thoroughfares in the Central Business District remain dug up, with work progressing at a snail’s pace. The BSCL has taken up 43 different works at a total cost of Rs. 1,039 crore, which includes the development of 36 roads under TenderSURE norms, K.R. Market junction improvement, integrated mobility and redevelopment of Shivajinagar Bus Terminal and the redevelopment of Cubbon Park. Of the roads taken up for development under TenderSURE, work is in progress on a majority of stretches. Mr. Yediyurappa stated that they will be completed by June 2021. However, citizens are sceptical, given the progress so far, especially on Miller’s Road, Infantry Road, Queen’s Road and Palace Road. The slow progress in the Central Business District has greatly inconvenienced pedestrians, as footpaths have either been dug up or filled with debris. Pedestrians have to jostle for space with vehicles that have to ply on a reduced carriageway riddled with potholes, with construction material and debris dumped along the sides. Devendra G.R., an autorickshaw driver, said the roads are so bad that he is constantly spending money on repairing and replacing worn-out parts. A scrap dealer, who has a shop on Miller’s Road, said his health has deteriorated. “We are exposed to a lot of dust, as one side of the road has been dug up. Even a mask doesn’t seem to be helping. I am always tired and prone to headaches.” Motorists said that if they could avoid CBD, they would. “On some roads, such as Infantry Road and Queen’s Road, both sides have been dug up. The carriageway of roads has reduced by almost half, increasing my commute time,” said Krishna Gowda, who commutes from Nagasandra to Infantry Road. Allaying concerns about the delay in completing the works, BSCL Managing Director Rajendra Cholan claimed that, over the past three months, all the inter-departmental issues had been ironed out. BSCL had prepared a micro plan, and set realistic deadlines. He attributed the slow progress to delays in getting police permission and shifting of utilities. “These issues have now been sorted out,” he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-of-smart-roads-has-residents-motorists-worried/article33712873.ece

The target was to administer the drops to 64,07,692 children. Pulse Polio immunisation campaign was supposed to be held on January 17, but was postponed in view of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout on January 16. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, along with Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, inaugurated the campaign in the city at the CM’s home office ‘Krishna’. While Udupi district recorded the highest coverage with 99.44%, BBMP recorded the lowest at 81.52% with 8,79,804 of the targeted 10,79,218 children being administered polio drops. Udupi was followed by Mandya district that achieved 97.57% coverage. At least 23 districts recorded coverage of over 90%. The Health Department had set up as many as 32,908 booths across the State for parents to take their children for polio vaccination. A total of 49,338 teams comprising 1,10,179 vaccinators had been deployed for the drive. To help tourists, commuters and those in transit, the department had set up vaccination booths with 1,934 transit teams at railway stations, bus stops, metro stations, and airports. Mr. Sudhakar said there will be a mop-up round from February 1 to 3 for those who missed out on Sunday. For the next three days, vaccinators will make door-to-door visits to administer the drops to children. “To augment staff for the polio immunisation drive, COVID-19 vaccination has been temporarily suspended till February 3,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pulse-polio-drive-905-of-children-in-karnataka-covered-on-day-1/article33712875.ece

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||While many Ministers and politicians often shy away from talking to presspersons, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar(in picture)is known to share a camaraderie with journalists. He is not only familiar with all the reporters covering the beat, but is also now seasoned enough to guess what type of questions come from which quarter. Earlier this week, when there was a heated debate on the school fee issue, the Minister was flooded with questions at a press meet. When this reporter began asking questions, he said with a mysterious smile, “I know you have two questions.” While he did not say what his guess was, it left this reporter wondering if indeed we were so predictable a tribe.      Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who went on Bengaluru city rounds inspecting projects in the Central Business District on Saturday, took an unscheduled break in between and went into Koshy’s restaurant on St. Mark’s Road for coffee(in picture). He was accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Revenue Minister R. Ashok, and Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj, among others. As the politicians savoured coffee, two buses and tens of cars that were part of the Chief Minister’s convoy blocked the busy St. Mark’s Road, throwing traffic out of gear. Traffic was blocked till the Chief Minister and his entourage came out. Vehicles piled up for nearly a kilometre and commuters were seen roundly cursing politicians and their whims.   Amid the heated debate in the State over Hindi getting prominence at government programmes, Minister for Animal Husbandry Prabhu Chavan(in picture)caught the attention of the media recently by referring to notes written in Hindi at his two official meetings in Hassan. The Minister kept the meeting agenda and information about his department in Hindi, while he interacted with the officers in Kannada. The reporters, who noticed his notes in Hindi, asked him why the meeting points were not in Kannada. The Minister, who looked embarrassed, said he was from a border area where the influence of other languages was unavoidable. “But I speak Kannada and I conducted the meeting in Kannada,” he said in his defence.

Sources said that Ms. Gouri had earlier informed her willingness to step aside from the post due to ill health and that the party's State meeting held here on January 30 and 31 accepted it. A.N. Rajan Babu has been elected as the new general secretary of the party. Although Ms. Gouri vacated the general secretary's post, she has been made the president of the party. Since 1994 She had held the post of the general secretary for more than two decades ever since the formation of the party in 1994. Ms. Gouri did not attend the party meeting due to poor health. The meeting also entrusted Mr. Babu to hold discussions with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) over the induction of the JSS into the front and on seat-sharing for the upcoming Assembly elections. Voice of dissent Meanwhile, a section of the JSS leaders opposed to Mr. Babu said that he had backstabbed Ms. Gouri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kr-gouri-removed-as-jss-general-secretary/article33713144.ece

Electricity Minister M.M. Mani will inaugurate the facility at Vandiperiyar on Monday. The 11-kV underground cable is 5.65 km long and cost Rs. 1.65 crore, which was paid by the Tamil Nadu government. Power connection In 1980, the KSEB had allotted an overhead 11-kV power connection to the Mullaperiyar dam through deep forest. But the powerline was a threat to wild animals and the government decided to disconnect it 19 years ago. Also, trees fell on the line due to heavy winds and electricity supply was constantly disrupted. Operating shutters The KSEB officials said that the underground cable would ensure undisrupted power supply to the Mullaperiyar dam. In an emergency situation, dam authorities would be able to operate the shutters smoothly. After the KSEB power connection was stopped, Tamil Nadu was operating the dam shutters with the help of a generator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-underground-power-cable-to-mullaperiyar/article33713177.ece
01 February 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||Cheengery Mala woos adventure tourists||The picturesque Cheengery Mala, a new addition to the tourism map of Wayanad district, has become a favourite destination for adventure tourists. The District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) gave a facelift to the destination to tap the adventure tourism potential of the Cheengery hills near Karapuzha dam. The Revenue Department had handed over eight acres to the DTPC for the purpose. The destination was opened for tourists on December 21, 2020. “The department has spent Rs. 1.04 crore for the first phase construction work at the site. As many as 4,670 tourists had visited the site till January 29,” P.P. Praveen, Manager, Marketing and Events, DTPC, told The Hindu . A 500-metre trekking though the leisure trail and a 1.750-km guided trekking to the hilltop are the major attractions of the new destination. Other facilities An entrance plaza, cafeteria, VVIP launch, ticket counters, parking area and a toilet block have also been set up on the hill slope as part of the project. A spectacular view is awaiting tourists when they reach atop the hill, around 2,200 ft above median sea level. They would get a 360-degree view of Wayanad from the hill top, and major tourism destinations in the district such as Karapuzha reservoir, Chembra peak, Edakkal caves, and Banasura mountains are visible from there. When other trekking destinations in the district such as Chembra peak under South Wayanad forest and Brahmagiri mountains under North Wayanad forest divisions would close to tourists at the advent of summer and monsoon owing to security reasons, Cheengery Mala will be open for tourists round the year, Mr. Praveen said. The DTPC is planning to set up outstay facilities such as tents for tourists on the hill slope from the first week of February. “The trial run was a huge success and we are planning to set up 10 tents, each tent for a three-member group, at the leisure zone,” Mr. Praveen said. Facilities such as sleeping bags, food and power supply to tourists would be provided at a nominal rate, he added. “We have submitted a master pan of Rs. 1 crore to the government for the second phase development activities of the site including erecting chain link fences around the site, development of parking area, road widening works and setting up security arrangements like installing CCTV cameras,” Mr. Praveen said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cheengery-mala-woos-adventure-tourists/article33713111.ece

Inaugurating the Aishwarya Kerala Yatra being led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala at Kumbala in Kasaragod on Sunday, Mr. Chandy said every allegation raised by Mr. Chennithala proved to be true and he would lead the procession as a winner. The last five years of Kerala had been wasted. The government’s claim that it had made great progress was not true, he said. The government was facilitating back-door appointments thereby scuttling the prospects of youngsters who were on the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) rank list. He said the UDF stood firmly with the believers in the Sabarimala issue. There was no change in that stance. If the UDF came to power, it would protect the rituals at the temple. The LDF did not want to solve the Sabarimala issue. The problems were caused by the government when it challenged the devotees. “We need to know whether the government will respect the sentiments of the people,” Mr. Chandy said. Mr. Chennithala said the State was ruled by the underworld. Smuggling in gold, drugs and dollars brought in crores of rupees illegally to Kerala. He said the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was now trying to pit Hindus against Muslims and Christians against Muslims. “I do not understand why Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the party secretary are so anti-Muslim,” he said. Stating that it was a struggle to maintain secularism, he warned Mr. Vijayan against playing the “communal game”. While the Panakkad family had a tradition of preserving secularism, the LDF was inciting communalism, he said. P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, said the UDF would rule the State for the next five years. He was dismissive of the LDF’s victory in the local body election. “That will not be the case always,” he said. ‘Creating rift’ Mr. Kunhalikutty said the CPI(M) should stop trying to create a rift between the Indian Union Muslim League and the Congress. He also accused the Left party of toeing the Bharatiya Janata Party’s line in this regard. The solar scam case, for long relegated to the back-burner, was now being brought to limelight and handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation, for political gains. The previous UDF government was transparent, did a lot of good things, and there was team work, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chandy-rues-5-wasted-years/article33713147.ece

Detailed project reports are ready for the ventures that hold out prospects of a bright future for over 5,000 pineapple farmers in the State. Bottled water VAFPC managing director Shibu Kumar said the proposed projects would be a major diversification for the company that now produced fruit pulp and the Jive brand of fruit drink. The company is also coming up with its brand of bottled drinking water soon and will also commission a bottle-moulding unit for packing the drink. Bromelain has therapeutic applications and is a natural mixture of proteolytic enzyme. It can be extracted from the fruit or the stem of the plant. The extract is found to reduce the side effects of antibiotics. Meanwhile, the fruit processor has also sought permission from the State government to produce wine from pineapple, Mr. Shibu Kumar said. The processing unit is expected to be fully operational in February after a shutdown of around two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/efforts-under-way-to-produce-nutraceutical-from-pineapple/article33713134.ece

A spokesman for the forum said on Sunday that Rs. 2 crore had been included in the State budget 2021-22 for beginning preliminary work for the project, including the preparation of a detailed project report (DPR). 20 projects Kalamassery MLA V.K. Ebrahim Kunju said Rs. 10 crore had been considered for the Kangarappady playground, of which Rs. 2 crore would be made available in 2021 through the budget allocation. He said the Kangarappady playground was among the 20 projects in the constituency that had found a place in the State Budget. ‘More space needed’ He said a DPR could be prepared, but the municipality might have to find more space for the playground, a stadium and associated facilities at Kangarappady. The People’s Forum spokesperson said there was widespread protest against the municipal authorities towards the end of 2020 just ahead of elections to the local bodies, as the former council wanted to use about 1.5 acres of open space at Kangarappady for building houses for the weaker sections under the LIFE Mission project. The open space was being used by youngsters for playing various games, including football, said ward councillor K.K. Shashi. Kalamassery municipal chairperson Seema Kannan said she was looking into the files, and that the new council was keen to see the project through.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dpr-on-playground-to-be-prepared/article33713141.ece

01 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||A Kottayam native all set to return home||Decades after a wide belt of rubber trees invaded the tropical hills of Central Kerala, a mission is now on to restore a native species that has been lost among these plantations. The Social Forestry Division, Kottayam, has launched a unique search to trace the last remaining Sago Palms (cycus circinalis) in Kottayam, which have been largely wiped out from the region primarily due to the plantation drive in the 1980s. Locally called ‘Eenthu’, the plants were once sighted commonly in the household backyards across the hilly regions of Kottayam and contributed to the local community’s food security, especially in times of penury. “By the time we became aware of the perilous position of the species, its population in Kottayam was confined to a handful of mature specimens. Hence, a drive is now on to trace and protect the species,” said G. Prasad, Assistant Conservator of Forests and a botanist. The species, according to him, is pollinated by insects and wind. As to how the Sago Palms in Kottayam gave way to rubber, a senior official with the Rubber Board in Kottayam attributed it primarily to the Rubber Plantation Development programme of 1979. “The planters were being given a subsidy of Rs. 6,000 per acre, which was much higher than the value of land in some areas of the Malabar region. To avail themselves of the benefit, the farmers were stipulated to limit the presence of trees other than rubber to just eight per acre and this was how Sago Palms retreated from Kottayam. The drive, at the same time, was not so intense outside Central Kerala and hence, the majority of the species outside Kottayam were saved,” he explained. Relationship with locals Explaining the unique relationship between the Sago Palms and the local community in the olden days, Pallikonam Rajeev, a local historian of Kottayam, said its disappearance from the mainstream marked the end of a tradition. “The leaves of Sago Palms were widely used for decorating the venues of functions including marriages and temple rituals while the flour from its seeds was a staple food for majority of the families,” he said. Following a search that began about one and half years ago, the officials have now succeeded in collecting a few Sago Palm saplings from the Ponthenpuzha forests, Erumeli and Kanjirappilly. These plants are now being carefully tended at a nursery adjacent to the Parambuzha forest office near Kottayam. The department is also encouraging the public seeking information about Sago Palms in their neighbourhood, if any.

The ‘Puzha Nadatham’ was organised under the aegis of the Kerala Nadi Samrakshana Samiti in the wake of the destruction caused to the river in the name of disaster management recently. The participants were unanimous in their view that the river was in a sad state, and that it needed to be protected to restore its natural flow. The immediate trigger for the nature walk was the action taken by the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), removing big boulders from the river and converting it into a plain ground for around 3 km. The reason cited was the floods of 2018 and 2019 after the boulders and floating tree trunks created a dam effect in the river. The Samiti had intervened to stop further destruction of the river with the help of local residents. “It is now impossible to put the river back to its natural state now,” T.V. Rajan, State general secretary of the Samiti, had said. District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao had claimed ignorance of the destruction of the river, when the Samiti members visited him recently. He had said that the DDMA had only sanctioned funds, while it was the Department of Irrigation that carried out the work, without any scientific studies. Koduvally block panchayat president Thomas Kulathoor, who was part of the Puzha Nadatham, said the panchayat would make efforts to “regrow” vegetation on both banks of the river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greens-on-a-mission-to-restore-natural-flow-of-chalippuzha/article33713115.ece
01 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Cong. firm on taking over seats of Mani faction, LJD||The exit of the Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) and the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) from the United Democratic Front (UDF) has prompted the Congress central leadership to stand firm on taking over the seats vacated by the two parties for the Assembly polls. As a reason for the decision, senior Congress leaders cite the decline in the number of legislators from the party over the past few elections. In the 2016 Assembly election, the Congress contested in 87 seats and won only in 22. In comparison, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) won from 22 of the 24 constituencies it contested. In the 2011 polls, the Congress managed to secure 39 out of the 82 seats it contested even as the UDF captured power with a margin of three seats. Already some of the UDF constituents are eyeing more seats after the Jose faction of the KC(M) and the LJD made their way out of the coalition. The KC(M) had contested in 15 seats in the 2016 polls while the LJD, then Janata Dal (United), in seven. The KC(M) won six and the LJD drew a blank. Joseph factor This time, the Congress State leadership will have to convince P.J. Joseph, who is leading the residual faction of the KC(M). In the 2016 election, his faction had contested in four seats. According to sources, the State leadership of the Congress has been asked to reason with the UDF constituents on the necessity of putting its own nominees in the seats previously offered to the Jose faction and the LJD. The winnability quotient of the Congress candidates is better in segments with Christian and Hindu voters. Also, the leadership has been mooting the idea of its senior leaders entering the fray so as to counter the propaganda of the CPI(M) that the Congress is playing a subservient role to the IUML in the coalition, sources say. The other constituents of the UDF have already started clamouring for a share of the electoral pie. The Congress will have to tactfully deal with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Kerala Congress (Jacob), and Communist Marxist Party (CMP) while finalising seats.  The KC(M) contested in 15 seats in the 2016 polls and the LJD, then Janata Dal (U), in seven||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-firm-on-taking-over-seats-of-mani-faction-ljd/article33713143.ece

01 February 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||BEML sell-off bid: staff to intensify stir||The Central government’s move to disinvest 26% shares in the profit-making mini ratna public sector company Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. (BEML) has met with strong opposition not only from thousands of employees, but also from the State government. Although there was an attempt to privatise BEML by the first Narendra Modi government in 2016, the Centre had to abandon the move following opposition. The employees of BEML’s Kanjikode unit have been staging a protest against the latest move to sell off the mini ratna PSU since the Central government invited an expression of interest in the first week of this month. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking the Centre to withdraw the move, especially as BEML was performing well in global competition. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government appears adamant on disinvestment. The BEML Employees Association is planning to strengthen their protest against the Centre’s move. People’s court A people’s court is being planned at Kanjikode on February 5. Former Army officers, judges and economists will take part in the people’s court. A human chain will be formed from BEML unit at Kanjikode to Instrumentation Ltd. on February 17. BEML Employees Association general secretary S. Gireesh said that a two-day vehicle rally would also be organised through the Palakkad town in February to spread awareness among the people. Models of the heavy equipment built at BEML’s Kanjikode unit will also be displayed in the town as part of the agitation against disinvestment. Rs. 10,000-cr. orders The Centre is going ahead with disinvestment move at a time when BEML has secured orders worth more than Rs. 10,000 crore through global tenders. A company engaged in the manufacturing of heavy military vehicles, rail and metro coaches, and mining and construction vehicles, the BEML has four units across the country — Bengaluru, Kolar, Mysuru and Kanjikode. The Kanjikode unit near here, functioning on 375 acres of leased land given by the State government, manufactures army vehicles, passenger railway coaches, and metro coaches. It has 350 permanent employees and 150 contract workers. Trucks, bogies BEML’s Kanjikode unit has already churned out 1,500-odd heavy military trucks, 300 railway coaches and 500-odd metro bogies. The unit is equipped to produce 500 metro bogies a year. “Disinvesting BEML, especially when the company is soaring by bagging global tenders, is deplorable. It is going to strike a severe blow not only on the work force, but also on our general economy,” said Mr. Gireesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/beml-sell-off-bid-staff-to-intensify-stir/article33713275.ece

01 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Firm owes Rs. 64 lakh in pole rent to Corpn.||Even as the city Corporation has decided to increase the rent on Galvanised Iron (GI) poles laid by telecom companies, the civic body is pursuing revenue recovery proceedings against Reliance Communication Limited which has not paid the rent for its poles since 2017-18 despite multiple reminders. According to information from the finance wing of the civic body, the company owes the Corporation a total amount of Rs. 64 lakh in rents for GI poles and Electronic Display Panels (EDP). 4,000 poles Reliance Communication had put up 4,000 poles and 89 EDPs in different parts of the city. No rent payment for these have happened from the company's side after the payment of a part of the rent in 2017-18. Since then, the Corporation has been sending notices to the debt-ridden company, to no avail. “We have done prompt follow-up and issued notices at regular intervals. In November 2020, the Corporation initiated revenue recovery proceedings. Since the company is now debt-ridden, the National Company Law Tribunal is taking up a resolution plan. So, whenever funds get credited to the company, it is distributed to all those institutions to which it owes money. We decided to go ahead with the revenue recovery, rather than wait for these meagre amounts. Recently, we came to know that they had approached the taluk office with an offer to make a part of the payment, but the Corporation is pressing for full payment of the dues,” said a Corporation official. The pole rents were fixed at Rs. 150 and EDP rent at Rs. 1,000 in 2015-16. In 2017, the Corporation council decided to hike the pole rent to Rs. 5,000. However, this move was opposed by companies including Reliance Jio, citing the fact that it was too high compared to the rents fixed by the other urban local bodies. As the finance committee found that the maximum rate in other local bodies is Rs. 500, it was decided to increase the pole rent to Rs. 500 and EDP rent to Rs. 1,600 in a council meeting held in December 2019. In the council meeting held on Saturday, it was decided to increase the pole rent further to Rs. 750, while keeping the EDP rent fixed. Jio pays rent Meanwhile, Reliance Jio which has 37,522 poles in different parts of the city has paid the pole rents till February 2021. EDP rents are not applicable to the company. It will not have to pay the revised rent at Rs. 750 per pole for the previous year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/firm-owes-rs-64-lakh-in-pole-rent-to-corpn/article33713311.ece

The decision seems to have been taken in the wake of apprehensions over adherence to COVID-19 protocols. Trust authorities say limiting the Pongala to the temple premises could not preclude overcrowding for entry, thus creating problems for crowd management. People could offer Pongala at their houses, they said. A high-level meeting chaired by Minister for Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran last week had decided that the annual Pongala, billed the largest congregation of women, would be held within the premises of the temple in compliance with COVID-19 protocols. Rituals such as ‘Kutthiyottam,’ ‘Vilakkukettu,’ and ‘Thalapoli’ held as part of the 10-day festival commencing on February 19 have been dropped. However, it was decided to hold ‘Annadanam’ at Amba auditorium of the trust adhering to the green protocol and COVID-19 guidelines. Food was supposed to be made available in packets. Regulated Entry inside the temple compound for offering Pongala was to be regulated through online registration, on the lines of norms implemented by the police and the Travancore Devaswom Board for worship at the Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala. It was decided that rituals in connection with the temple festival would be held as per tradition while avoiding crowding in view of the peculiar situation prevailing.  Rituals such as ‘Kutthiyottam,’ ‘Vilakkukettu,’ and ‘Thalapoli’ have been dropped||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/attukal-pongala-to-be-confined-to-pandara-aduppu/article33712870.ece

01 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Teachers see dilution of UGC salary norms||A section of college teachers in the State have accused the government of diluting salary norms laid down by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Following the delay in implementing the pay revision as recommended by the seventh Central Pay Commission, which had come into effect on January 2016, teachers affiliated to various service unions have formed a United Forum of College Teachers (College Adhyapaka Aikya Sangham) to campaign for their demand. Minister’s promise While Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has promised that the revised salaries will be sanctioned in February with arrears merged into the provident fund (PF), lingering issues continue to worry the teaching community. Shaju K.Y., Vice Principal, Christ College, Irinjalakuda, who is convener of the 2,060-member strong forum, said it would take months for the offices of the Deputy Directors of Collegiate Education to process the revised salary due to the absence of a uniform system for the purpose. “Our basic pay scale has remained unchanged for the last 14 years since the implementation of the sixth UGC scheme in 2006. Other employees of the State government have benefited through three wage revisions during the period,” he said. He criticised the government decision revising the criterion for sanctioning teaching posts through an increase in teaching hours. While it was decided that no regular post would be created for workload less than 16 hours, the collective feared the move would lead to the loss of nearly 3,600 posts within a few years. On incentives The organisation also cried foul over the government’s move to refrain from sanctioning incentives for teachers possessing higher qualifications, including PhD. They claimed the UGC norms made assistant professors holding doctorate degrees eligible for five non-compounded advance increments at the entry level of recruitment, while those holding MPhil were entitled to two advance increments. “While Tamil Nadu and Telangana have implemented the provision, the government here has been reluctant to adhere to the norm,” a professor working in a college in Kottayam alleged. However, Higher Education Department sources said the UGC had withdrawn the provision, probably because there were sufficient teaching job aspirants with PhDs and other high qualifications now. The incentive was originally intended to attract such candidates to the teaching posts, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/teachers-see-dilution-of-ugc-salary-norms/article33713148.ece

01 February 2021||Nivedita Ganguly,ANDHRA PRADESH||City sees surge in startups catering to sustainable living||With sustainability becoming the buzzword, and the pandemic witnessing a sudden demand for healthier and organic food products, several startups have come up in the city catering to this segment. For over two years, T. Anupama has been growing microgreens at home and using it in salads and recipes. The first thought of starting an enterprise of home delivering microgreens came to her when she saw a shift in people’s preference towards a wholesome lifestyle in the past one year. After much deliberation, she finally launched Greens by Anu. “The initial response has been very encouraging,” she says. She grows about 15 varieties of microgreens. Anupama was one of participants at the day-long Natural Living Expo organised by Women’s Wing of Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Sunday at Hotel Palm Beach. The past one year has seen a shift of focus on eco-friendly packaging and that has helped Visakhapatnam-based House of Folium to scale up its enterprise of selling eco-friendly cutlery. Founded by S.V. Vijay Lakshmi, a former software engineer, the company sells plates, bowls, forks and spoons made from sugarcane pulp. According to her, there has been a gradual change happening across the food industry in the city with restaurants and especially home chefs consciously preferring eco-friendly cutlery over plastic ones. Over the past couple of months, House of Folium has also catered for parties of 200 people with their green products. With smoothie bowls becoming a favourite breakfast option, Tanvi Somani’s food startup of Rainbow Bowls is already seeing a steady rise in number of subscribers since she launched it a month ago. The chia seed smoothie bowls come in various flavours and can be ordered through a five-day or monthly subscription basis. “Healthy food has been perceived as boring, but I have hardly ever felt that way. I wanted to address this space with smoothie bowls that are nutritious with no dairy products or added sweeteners. The response in the past one month has been truly overwhelming,” she says. Ms. Tanvi shortly plans to start dinner bowl subscriptions too. D. Sirisha started making natural bio enzyme cleaning products a year-and-a-half ago after noticing that pet dogs were allergic to floor cleaning products with toxic chemicals. With the free time during the pandemic induced lockdown, she started experimenting and thus she started Eco Clean, her own brand of bio enzyme cleaners. The idea, Sirisha says, is to provide sustainable alternatives to everyday products. “Eco Clean is an effective alternative to harsh chemicals in cleaning agents. It can be used for cleaning floors, vessels and also clothes,” she says. This is presently available in one litre bottles. The expo was inaugurated by GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana. Devina Jain, the president of Navy Wives Welfare Association (NWWA) was the guest of honour, for the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/city-sees-surge-in-startups-catering-to-sustainable-living/article33713366.ece

Though the role might not have changed much, the force has tripled its capacity since then. Be it on the assets side, technology or manpower, said Additional Director General of Indian Coast Guard, Eastern Seaboard, V.S. Pathania. Interacting with The Hindu , on the eve of the Indian Coast Guard Day, he said from a modest beginning on February 1, 1977, with just seven ships, two small corvettes and five patrol boats leased from the Indian Navy, it today has 156 ships, 62 aircraft and over 20,000 men and officers. He indicated that by 2025, the target was to have a force strength of at least 200 ships and 100 aircraft. Speaking about the fleet strength on the eastern seaboard, which covers a distance of over 2,834 km of coastline from West Bengal to Tamil Nadu, he said there are about nine high endurance versatile ships, one high endurance special role vessel for fighting pollution on sea, 21 water jet propelled fast interceptors and 13 high speed quick response vessels. “This apart, we have about nine hovercraft, 10 Dornier surveillance aircraft and three helicopters,” he said. But according to him, the game-changer will be induction of multi mission maritime aircraft and HAL developed AHL (Advanced Light Helicopter) in the force. The ALH will phase out the ageing Chetaks, said Mr. Pathania. “We will have some of the new air assets deployed on the eastern seaboard and we are also expecting at least two new OPV (offshore patrol vessels) and one FPV (fast patrol vessel), shortly. According to him, ICG is the fourth biggest Coast Guard force in the world today. Mr. Pathania also said that under the phase-I of the CSS (chain of static sensors), 46 coastal radar stations have been set up, and under Phase-II, 38 static radar stations and four mobile radar stations are being set up. “On the eastern seaboard, we will have about 17 radars under the second phase,” he said.

First PVSM Mr. Pathania also said that ICG was awarded the first PVSM (Param Vishist Seva Medal), since its inception. It was awarded to the current Director General of Coast Guard Krishnaswamy Natarajan, for his efficient handling of MT New Diamond, the 3-lakh MT crude oil tanker that caught fire off Sri Lanka coast in November, last. Explaining the role of ICG, he said, “Though our jurisdiction of operation is limited to 2.01 million sq km of EEZ (exclusive economic zone) our search and rescue operation extends to over 4.6 million sq km.” Mr. Pathania said that incorporation of ‘preventive and measured response’ concept has ensured that more then 6,000 fishing boats and about 40,000 fishermen being escorted to the safety of harbour by the ICG, during the 11 cyclones that hit the Indian coast, last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/coast-guard-got-more-teeth-after-2611-says-official/article33713254.ece

01 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||It is a battle against YSRCP’s ulterior plans, says Naidu||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday exhorted the general public and the party cadres to get ready for the local body elections what he described as a ‘fearless battle against the YSRCP’s ulterior and oppressive plans’. Addressing the party cadres through video-link, Mr. Naidu asked them to see that there were no unanimous elections. “The contestants should fight the polls bravely and they must not surrender to the suppressive tactics of the YSRCP leaders. Nobody should be afraid of the bind-over cases and the kidnappings. The election is the only opportunity to bring back normalcy in the villages,” said Mr. Naidu. ‘Choose efficient leaders’ The TDP president also appealed the voter to elect the ‘efficient leaders’ as sarpanches. “The real Grama Swaraj as envisaged by the freedom fighters would be a reality only when the TDP supported candidates win this election. It is high time the atrocious activities of the ruling party were stopped. Till now, 50% of the nominations have been filed and there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people to fight against the ruling party’s oppression,” said Mr. Naidu. Stating that the local body polls should be seen as ‘a big test for the leadership at the village level’, Mr. Naidu said that future leaders would emerge from the panchayats alone. “There were many leaders who started as sarpanches and went on to become the MLAs and MPs. It would be the sarpanch alone who would preside over the Grama Sabha in a village. The first person in the village would sarpanch only,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/it-is-a-battle-against-ysrcps-ulterior-plans-says-naidu/article33713261.ece

01 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three new ports to boost maritime trade||The State government’s plan to construct landlord ports at Bhavanapadu (Srikakulam district), Ramayapatnam (Prakasam) and Machilipatnam (Krishna) is intended to give further boost to the maritime trade being largely done now by the State’s only major port at Visakhapatnam and the thriving private ports at Krishnapatnam (Nellore), Gangavaram (Visakhapatnam) and Kakinada (East Godavari). According to official sources, the Krishnapatnam, Ganagavaram and Kakinada ports together are handling over 100 million tonnes (mtT) of cargo every year on an average. The Krishnapatnam port alone is handling 55 MT and it is followed by the Gangavaram port which accounts for about 35 MT. The Kakinada deepwater port is handling approximately 15 MT a year, up from a maximum of 4 MT two decades ago. The government recently got three additional berths constructed at the Kakinada port at a cost of Rs. 300 crore taking their total number to nine. The public sector port at Visakhapatnam is handling about 65 MT every year. Tenders are under preparation for the Bhavanapadu and Machilipatnam ports. With a draft of 19 metres, the proposed Bhavanapadu port has been planned to accommodate vessels of 1.20 lakh to 1.80 lakh Dead Weight Tons (DWT) whereas the Ramayapatnam port (with 15.50 metres draft) was designed to receive vessels weighing up to 85,000 DWT. The first phase of the Bhavanapadu port is estimated to cost Rs. 3,700 crore while the cost of the first phase of the Ramayapatnam port is pegged at about Rs. 3,750 crore. The long-pending port at Machilipatnam is the costliest of all (first phase) entailing an expenditure of roughly Rs. 5,840 crore. The State’s only captive port in the Ravva oil field in East Godavari district continues to be of strategic importance by virtue of export of substantial quantities of oil and natural gas by Cairn Energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-new-ports-to-boost-maritime-trade/article33713264.ece

Releasing a copy of the letter to the media here on Sunday, the MP pointed out at the large difference in the rates of interest being charged by the public sector and private banks for loans to buy luxury cars and tractors. “A loan for buying a luxury car can be obtained at an annual interest rate of 7% with lower downpayment and longer term of repayment. However, the banks are charging somewhere between 12.5% and 14% rate of interest with a shorter repayment period for tractor loan,” said Mr. Rangaiah. The debt burden in the farm sector, he said, was claiming 10,000 lives a year in India.“None knows the reason for this antipathy towards farmers,” the MP said. “A farmer repays around Rs. 9 lakh for a loan of Rs. 5.75 lakh taken for buying a tractor costing Rs. 6.35 lakh,” he said .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/slash-interest-rate-on-tractor-loan-mp/article33713258.ece

Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar on Sunday announced that theatre managements will be allowed to screen films at full capacity, even as he encouraged maximum ticket booking online and giving ample time between shows. COVID-19 protocols must be followed, he said. While film exhibitors from the State welcomed the move, they pointed out that it is the Telangana government which will have to take a call. Murali Mohan from the Telangana State Film Chamber of Commerce told The Hindu that the body has been speaking to the government on the issue of operating film theatres at full capacity. “There have been relaxations outside containment zones, but the matter is still in the hands of the State. No order from the State government has come,” he said. Loss recovery Single-screen theatre owners and managers welcomed the Centre’s move and said that permitting 100% capacity would help them mitigate losses. “For many months, we were shut and the losses were increasing. To allow 100% occupancy is a good decision. We hope that the Telangana government will issue orders allowing full capacity. If the movie is good, there is no doubt that theatres will be full. For instance, today [January 31], we had to turn back a lot of people because we had sold out 50% of the tickets,” said Srinivas Reddy, manager of a single-screen theatre at RTC Crossroads. Meanwhile, M. Vijender Reddy, proprietor of Venkateshwara Theatre in Miryalguda, also welcomed the move. He said over 450 single-screen theatres will stand to benefit from operating at full capacity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/exhibitors-laud-centres-100-capacity-move-await-state-nod/article33713088.ece
01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘PM wants waqf lands free of encroachments’||Vice chairperson of National Commission for Minorities, Atif Rasheed, expressed concern over the alleged inability of the Telangana State Waqf Board to remove encroachments from Muslim endowment properties. Mr Rasheed was speaking to the media on Sunday where he touched upon several issues such as waqf properties, and Telangana Minorities Residential Educational Institutions Society (TMREIS) . Describing the encroachments on waqf properties as ‘saddening’, Mr Rasheed said that there are around 3,000 properties in the State which have been encroached. If freed from these encroachments, these land parcels have the potential to generate Rs. 5 lakh crore, he said. Mr Rasheed said that he met officials and members of the TSWB, even as he claimed that the Muslim endowments panel has remained largely ineffective in increasing income and removing encroachments. He expressed concerns that the board does not have a full-time Chief Executive Officer. Mr Rasheed said that during his interaction with TSWB officials, bestowing judicial powers was a demand which was made. “It is the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that waqf lands be free of land grabbing and encroachments,” he said. Mr Rasheed urged the Telangana government not to get buckled under ‘political pressure’ and take action against encroachers and said that he would take the issue of encroachment to the Centre and recommend a task force be constituted to look into the issued. He said that per the PM Jan Vikas Yojana, Rs. 883 crore has been sanctioned for the State out of which Rs. 263 crore has been released. These funds are being used for 11 common services, construction of hostels and residential schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/prime-minister-wants-waqf-lands-free-of-encroachments/article33713100.ece
01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fingers crossed before Budget||The Telangana government is keeping its fingers crossed over allocations to be made to the State in the Union Budget 2021-22 to be presented in Parliament by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday. The government is apparently not harbouring any hopes of big announcements forthcoming in the Union Budget. The officials concerned are waiting for the allocations that the Centre would make in response to the series of representations made to different Union Ministries seeking expeditious release of funds to the State. Given the shadow cast by the coronavirus pandemic on Central revenues, uncertainty prevails over whether the MPs from the State would mount pressure on the Centre for conceding the requests made by the State. This was corroborated by the comments made by TRS MPs over continuance of friendly relations with the Centre. The MPs could confine themselves to requesting the Centre to make sector specific allocations in the event of allocations not matching expectations. One of the major demands was expeditious release of entire GST compensation dues as the State is more financially strained than the Centre. Finance Minister T. Harish Rao said in a recent letter to the Union Finance Minister that tax devolution during the current year (up to December) was lower by Rs. 3,733 crore compared to the devolution during the corresponding period last fiscal. The nagging issue of proliferation of the centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) was another area that need to be addressed. Instead of reducing their number, these schemes had been grouped under 28 umbrella heads. Following the recommendation of the sub-group of CMs on the rationalisation of CSS, of which our CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao is a member, it was decided by the Union government that a facility of optional schemes would be provided to the States. Under this facility, States would have flexibility of portability from the optional schemes to any other CSS within the budgetary allocation for the State, Mr. Rao said in his letter. Though the decision was taken in 2016, it was yet to be implemented. “I request that the Union Budget 2021-22 may offer a bouquet of optional schemes to States,” he said. Mr. Rao also requested the Centre to enhance the monthly pension under the National Social Assistance Programme from Rs. 200 to at least Rs. 1,000. One of the important concerns of the State with regard to Central taxes was the increasing resort to the levy of cesses and surcharges, the proceeds of which were not shareable with States. “Most of the cesses and surcharges are levied for the purposes included in the State list impinging on the autonomy of State. A beginning may be made in the Union Budget 2021-22 to merge some of the cesses with basic rates,” he said. The State government could reiterate its request for linking agriculture with rural employment guarantee scheme, setting up of ITIR, regional ring road and a turmeric board in Telangana besides expediting the ongoing works on national highways and railway lines.  I request that the Union Budget 2021-22 may offer a bouquet of optional schemes to States. A beginning may be made to merge some of the cesses with basic rates.

01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Counselling soon to allay fears on vaccine: Eatala||With 25-30% healthcare workers reluctant to take the COVID vaccine in Telangana, the government is planning to establish a ‘counselling’ mechanism to address their fears, as some have registered for the same but did not take it, said Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Sunday. “The spread of rumours, unscientific and unreliable news is responsible for such fears. People need more confidence and courage. I volunteered to take the vaccine to give confidence and dispel such fears,” he said and urged the medical fraternity to also chip in. “It is also the duty of the medical fraternity to dispel those fears. It is they who can clear the air. They must use social media and mass media to spread awareness about the efficacy of the vaccine,” he asserted, while addressing a special virtual talk on COVID vaccine, organised by the Telangana State Federation of Chambers of Commerce & Trade (TSFCCT). Mr. Rajender pointed out that even after so many years of penicillin use, which saved millions of lives, checks were done for any reaction before it was given even today. “It has been in use since 1928 but we still keep reading here and there about common allergic reactions, including rashes, hives, itchy eyes, swollen lips, tongue, or face,” he said. Corona vaccines behave differently in different countries and environments. However, like all vaccines, they have been rigorously tested for safety before being authorised for use. “It may not be a 100% efficient vaccine but definitely serves the purpose. If anyone has any doubts, they can consult their doctors before taking the vaccine,” he explained. “The TS government is committed to make the vaccine available to everybody but the Central government is in ‘full control’ and the Union Health Minister has been requested to allot more doses, as the vaccine is being developed locally here in Hyderabad to be given out to more people,” he said. “We are looking for permission from the Health Ministry. We have received eight lakh doses so far and the vaccine does not cost more than Rs. 200,” he said. TS had fared well on all fronts be it recovery or in curtailing deaths due to COVID and the efforts to contain the pandemic will be continued with the same vigour till normalcy is restored. “From the perception of death if contracted by coronavirus, we have reached the stage that nothing will happen. But, this journey has been hard and tough. It was possible due everyone’s effort,” remarked Mr. Rajendra. TSFCCT, a professional body of 11 lakh traders involved in 29 kinds of businesses, assured to play its role in creating confidence among people about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine to dispel any fears, said talk organiser Prakash Ammanabolu. Office bearers A. Prakash, C. Nand Kumar, M. Murali Krishna, and Venu Vinod also participated.  It may not be a 100% efficient vaccine but definitely serves the purpose. If anyone has any doubts, they can consult their doctors before taking the vaccine.

01 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||For the complete elimination of leprosy in India||That leprosy is alive and thriving in India is evident from the fact that 60 % of the global cases are registered in our country. A case is diagnosed every 5-6 minutes, of which 10 % are children. Explaining the surge, Prasant Kumar Naik, Chief Executive, LEPRA India says, “When the cases fell below 1 % per 10,000 population, the government of India declared the disease as ‘eliminated’, and we became complacent, which led to the disease making a comeback in the States like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat and overall, spiking the numbers.’ Initiated by French humanitarian Raoul Follereau in 1953 to coincide with Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary on January 30, Anti-Leprosy Week is celebrated on the last Sunday in January. At the forefront is LEPRA India, a non-governmental organisation set up in 1989 and headquartered in Secunderabad. Figuring it out Leprosy — renamed as Hansen’s disease after Norwegian scientist Gerthard Henrik Armuer Hansen — is a slow-growing bacterium called Mycobacterium leprae that attacks the nerves, leading to loss of sensation. Unlike the common belief, leprosy doesn’t cause disfigurement and disability, explains Naik. Admitting it’s called ‘poor people’s disease, Naik says the lack of a nutritious diet and living in an unhygienic environment with no proper health facilities makes the marginalised more susceptible to the disease. “The stigma and discrimination are far more damaging,” says Naik, adding, “This is a completely curable and the least infectious disease in the world but the misconception around leprosy is very high.” LEPRA, which primarily works towards identifying the cases faced a slight setback during the pandemic where the health workers couldn’t go out much but Naik feels because this is a disease that spreads slowly, a drastic spike may not have occurred. Naik feels a subject on leprosy should be brought back in medical colleges. “Most doctors in corporate hospitals cannot detect the disease, it’s the leprosy-trained health worker from his ramshackle place who can identify. There’s no dearth of resources but nobody has the knowledge,” rues Naik. LEPRA’s role LEPRA’s two-phase work module involves more of morbidity management, reducing disability and providing life-long support and finding and arresting the diseases quickly so that it doesn’t lead to disability and spread. “A good diet can reduce disability. Leprosy is not the disease of the bones but the nerves, hence we need specialised physiotherapists. Reconstructive surgery (RCS) is another element in the entire process of treatment. Sivananda Rehabilitation Home in Kukatpally is the biggest facility in India that takes up RCS free of cost for leprosy patients,” adds Naik A former Mining Engineer, Naik has been a successful entrepreneur before “stumbling on the NGOs” as he puts it.  This is a completely curable and the least infectious disease in the world but the misconception around leprosy is very high.

01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||FTCCI for priority to MSMEs, boost to rural digital infra||Top priority for MSMEs, accelerating spending on rural digital infrastructure to make work from anywhere possible and simplification of tax system as well as moderation of rates are aspects the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) look forward to in the Union Budget 2021-22 scheduled to be presented on Monday. It also appealed to the Centre to refrain from imposing COVID related cess. “If levied, it will be very negative on manufacturing and service sectors,” the Federation said. A release on budget expectations of the umbrella body of trade and industry bodies said MSMEs should get top priority and incentivised as they had been worst-affected due to the pandemic. “Given the state of economy, there perhaps was no area that does not need a shot in the arm, but we still hope the MSMEs and start-ups in the manufacturing space find special attention from the Finance Minister,” the release said. Appealing for tax exemption to companies making products in India, FTCCI called for more investments in infrastructure, warehousing and transport-related investments towards easing logistics for small and medium businesses. It wanted the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme to be extended to other key sectors, beyond the 10 presently covered. Stating that Work from Home post COVID had emerged a necessity, the more than a century old federation said the budget should accelerate spending on rural digital infrastructure, thereby making work from anywhere a ‘true possibility’. “This will not only ensure development of rural economy but also help decongest cities.” In the backdrop of more businesses foraying online, it expected the government to provide incentives towards digital infrastructure for small businesses in tier II/III towns to promote e-commerce and ease of doing business. On tax measures, FTCCI said, “The various slabs for income tax as well as indirect taxes need to be moderated. Compliance mechanism also needs to be simplified.” For Telangana, the federation wanted allocation of funds for pending railway projects and infrastructure development at Kakatiya Mega Textile Park in Warangal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ftcci-for-priority-to-msmes-boost-to-rural-digital-infra/article33713102.ece
01 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Scan QR codes for home loans: Arvind Kumar||The government has asked banks and financial institutions processing loans for purchasing property to accept the building permit order and registration certificate being issued for constructions up to 500 sq. mts. since online permissions are being allowed under the new TS-bPASS (Telangana State Building Permission, Approval and Self-Certification System), to provide hassle-free services to citizens. State Level Banking Committee convenor has been instructed by Municipal Administration and Urban Development secretary Arvind Kumar to advise banking institutions to scan the QR codes provided in the online building permissions and instant registrations being made, available under the new system instead of asking for signed building plan permission copies from Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) concerned. In his detailed communication to the convenor, a copy of which was made available to the media, he explained that under the new rule: Instant Registration - Any construction coming up in plot size of 63 sq. mts or 75 sq. yards of ground or ground plus one floor up to seven metres in height do not need any permission. The owner, however, has to register online on payment of a token amount of Re.1 and duly self-certifying the title, size of plot and floors. It does not require any completion or occupancy certificate. Any plot bigger than the permitted size indicated above should not be split for this provision and this cannot be misused to make constructions in government plots, prohibited or disputed land, following which action will be taken for violations. Instant Approval - For plot sizes up to 500 sq. metres and proposed building height of up to 10 metres, building permissions will be processed as per TS-bPASS online according to provisions of the Master Plan, Detailed Planning Scheme or the Local Area Plan. This will be in adherence to prevailing building rules and in the manner prescribed. If the required information is provided with all necessary details, instant online approvals are given. For these two categories, the government has dispensed with issuing digitally signed building copies and this self-certification based system is based on the Central government’s ‘Ease of Doing Reforms’ system. Even if the applicant submits a building plan, TS-bPASS will only issue a registration certificate and building permit order as applicable, he said. At the same time, the government will conduct post-verification to ensure that applicants adhere to the permissions given and all the certificates showcased are in order. For plot sizes above 500 sq. metres and proposed building height of more than 10 metres, a single application is sufficient to be submitted online for obtaining no objection certificates from multiple government agencies as part of the ‘Single Window’ system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scan-qr-codes-for-home-loans-arvind-kumar/article33713104.ece

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Nizamabad was dealing with a compliant filed by D. Pandu Ranga Rao, a resident of Makloor in the district. The complainant stated that he bought a Samsung Galaxy A 20S in November 2019 and it malfunctioned the very next day. He handed over the phone to Big C which then carried out minor repairs. However, the phone continued to malfunction. Mr Rao stated that instead of handing over the phone to the authorised Samsung service centre for repairs, it was sent to Mobiy Zone in Narayanguda which cited reasons for not repairing it. Warranty period Taking the evidence placed on record into consideration, the commission noted that the phone was in warranty period and that Mobiy Zone rejected the repair for damages to the phone, including the handset being ‘bent’ and damage to the front camera. In an ex-parte order, the commission stated, “The opposite party No.2 failed to repair the hand set despite of National Manufacture warranty insurance cover for one year... The complainant after spending his hard earned money purchased the subject hand set but he suffered mental agony for its non working condition and physical harassment by running around service center (sic).” It directed the opposite parties to refund Rs. 11,221 and pay costs of Rs. 3,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mobile-retail-chain-repair-centre-to-refund-cost-of-handset/article33713086.ece

Mr Achary was in the town to oversee the arrangements to provide requisite amenities to the poor people to be affected by the Gollapadu channel modernisation plan in the KMC limits at the site earmarked for alternative housing at Velugumatla near here. As part of his daylong visit to the town, Mr Achary interacted with poor people mainly hailing from Backwards Classes and other weaker sections at Ramachandraiah Nagar in the 11th division. Some aggrieved local residents told Mr Achary that a demolition drive conducted by the administration in 2014 in the locality rendered them homeless. Deena, a daily wage worker, deplored that her house was dismantled in the name of a demolition drive in 2014. "We have been living here since 2001 and our pleas to spare our house from demolition went unheeded," she rued, alleging that their consistent pleas for sanction of pattas to the authorities had gone in vain. A lorry driver of the locality alleged that some influential persons who constructed high rise buildings and apartments by encroaching the NSP lands were spared from the demolition drive in the past." A building constructed by a private educational institution in the NSP lands was regularised as per the GO 59," he charged, alleging that the GO served the interests of some influential persons. "Our applications with all requisite documents as per the provisions of the same GO were squarely rejected," the lorry driver lamented. Giving vent to his anger, another aggrieved person alleged that a rowdysheeter is resorting to intimidating tactics at the behest of some greedy persons as part of their nefarious game plan to remove poor people from the locality to serve the interests of affluent sections. Responding to their representations, Mr Achary warned those "playing havoc" with the lives of poor people depriving them of roof over their heads and trying to evict them by "force." I will speak to the higher ups of the State administration and police department to check alleged harassment of poor people by some rowdy elements in the town, he said, adding the NCBC will use its constitutional powers to safeguard the rights and interests of BCs and other marginalised sections. Later, Mr Achary reviewed the provision of amenities at the site earmarked for construction of alternative houses for the displaced persons of the Gollapadu channel modernisation plan at Velugumatla. Joint Collector N Madhusudhan Rao, Municipal Commissioner Anuraag Jayanthi and other officials were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/urban-displaced-pour-out-their-woes-to-ncbc-member/article33713296.ece

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||How prepared are govt. officials ahead of D-Day||Tough task It was not easy for GHMC authorities to arrive at the number of ex-officio members eligible to vote for the election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor in the newly-elected civic body. The identification of ex-officio members became complicated as it had to be verified whether the legislators and MPs, who constitute them, were on the electoral rolls of GHMC and participated in the election of chairmen of other municipalities. The first factor was easy to scan but the latter took considerable time. In instances featuring ministers P. Sabita Indra Reddy, Ch. Malla Reddy and some others, they were found to be ineligible to vote though their names figure in rolls because they had already exercised their right in some other municipality. The same was the case with Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy. But, in case of Minister Satyavathi Rathod, she was found eligible though she had nothing to do with GHMC. Questions over readiness Questions are being raised on the preparedness of schools and colleges for holding classes from February 1. Finance Minister Harish Rao, who made a surprise visit to a social welfare junior college at Andole in Sangareddy district on Saturday, expressed dissatisfaction over the lackadaisical attitude of officials in taking up works in spite of instructions issued well in advance. This is not an isolated incident and similar reports are coming from different districts. Non availability of funds to pay wages is said to be one of the major reasons behind the delay in commencement of works while staff were also said to be looking out for funds to buy sanitisers and other essentials. These problems could have been avoided had the government given clear instructions about utilisation of grants given to the institutions. First time The State government has initiated the tradition of felicitating employees retiring from service on the day of superannuation and ensuring they are being dropped home in government vehicles on the last day of work. Retirement day will not forthwith be a closed door meeting with group of employees, but an occasion to share with all employees. Seven employees who retired on Saturday were given a warm send off in the presence of senior officials led by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar. The Chief Secretary has instructed the officials concerned to design a standard operating protocol for conducting such felicitations every month. Hopefully, the programme continues as it will be a fitting gesture for the services rendered by the staff for decades.  (N. Rahul and M.

01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Volunteers prevented from entering Singhu protest site||The Delhi police on Sunday denied entry to volunteers (sevadars) at the Singhu border protest site claiming that outsiders are strictly prohibited due to security reasons. After the Friday afternoon violence between the protesters and the ‘locals’, the police turned the site into a fortress with five layers of barricades. 50 companies deployed A senior officer said the venue has been closely guarded by the police and the para military personnel. They have deployed around 50 companies of security personnel. Joginder Singh, a resident of Ramesh Nagar in Delhi, said he used to visit the protest site every Sunday to do ‘joda seva’ but the police have denied entry to him. “I requested a senior police officer to allow me after verification that I am not a protester and I am here only for seva but he ignored my request. A policeman told me to take a long route through nearby village to reach the site.” A group of women sevadars, who used to do service in langars, arrived by a car but were also refused entry. “We are in the 50s and can’t walk for 2 km and more to reach the site. It is all government conspiracy to demotivate volunteers coming to help the protesters but it won’t work as there is always a way out of every tough situation,” said Surinder Kaur, a woman from Burari. A small group of YouTubers including freelance journalists were also turned away at the last barrier. “Visitors from the Delhi side, even mediapersons, are finding it difficult to reach there as the vehicles are being stopped around 2 km before the protest site. The police are asking for media cards. They are refusing entry since we don’t have them,” said a freelance journalist who did not want be identified. There is a blanket order not to allow free movement across the protest site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/volunteers-prevented-from-entering-singhu-protest-site/article33713009.ece

01 February 2021||Chandigarh,||Punjab CM calls all-party meeting on farm laws||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has called an all-party meeting on February 2, to evolve a consensus on the way forward on the issue of the farm laws and the farmers’ agitation in the light of the recent developments in Delhi. An official statement on Sunday said the meeting would discuss the situation arising out of the recent developments in the ongoing farmers’ agitation in Delhi, especially in view of the violence during the Republic Day and at the Singhu border. The Chief Minister said the crisis triggered by the farm laws was a matter of concern for the entire State and its people. Only through collective efforts of all Punjabis, and all the political parties of the State, could the crisis be tackled effectively and the farmers’ interests be protected, he added. “Our farmers are dying out there at the Delhi borders for more than two months now. They are being beaten by the police and assaulted by goons. They are being harassed by being deprived of basic amenities,” the Chief Minister pointed out, adding that with a large number of farmers from Punjab at the receiving end of this battering, it was imperative for all parties to come together to evolve a cohesive strategy on the issue.  ‘Time for unity’ The Chief Minister hoped that all political parties in Punjab, which was the worst affected by the prevailing crisis, would put aside their differences to find a solution to the problem, which touched every Punjabi. “This is not the time to stand on ego but to come together to save our State and our people,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-cm-calls-all-party-meeting-on-farm-laws/article33713011.ece
01 February 2021||Chandigarh,||Deploy Punjab police to protect State farmers, say Cong. and AAP||Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and the Aam Admi Party (AAP) have written to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, seeking deployment of State police to protect farmers from Punjab agitating at Delhi’s borders. Mr. Bajwa also mentioned “missing farmers from Punjab” after the violence of January 26 in the national capital and urged the Chief Minister to use the State’s resources to ensure their safety. Mr. Bajwa said there are reports that over 100 farmers from the State have been missing since the events of January 26 and there had been no word to the families on their status or present condition. “As the custodian of the State, I urge you to use all available resources available to the government of Punjab to trace these farmers and ensure their return to their families. It is extremely worrying that Punjabi farmers have been detained with no information being shared with their families or lawyers,” he wrote. Mr. Bajwa added that violence was unleashed against protesting farmers on January 29 at Delhi’s Singhu border by mobs, which make it evident that farmers are under threat from various groups who wish to malign the peaceful protests. “Given the present situation, I further urge you to deploy Punjab Police personnel immediately to make certain the safety of our farmers,” said Mr. Bajwa. AAP leader Raghav Chadha has also written to Capt. Singh, seeking police security for the protesting farmers. Meanwhile, trashing AAP’s demand as “arbitrary, absurd and irrational”, Capt. Singh on Sunday said the AAP had clearly lost all sense of Constitutional and legal propriety, and was completely ignorant even on the law laid down by the highest court of the land. “This demand is not only completely illogical and frivolous, but against all principles and rules of the law,” he said. Mocking the AAP’s “senseless demand”, the CM pointed out that, as per a Union Home Ministry directive and a Supreme Court order, the Punjab Police cannot stay in another State for more than 72 hours even for a protectee, which the farmers are in any case not. Capt. Amarinder termed the letter from AAP as nothing more than a tactic by the party to divert public attention from its own role in the Red Fort violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/deploy-punjab-police-to-protect-state-farmers-say-cong-and-aap/article33713015.ece
01 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Khaps hold panchayat in U.P. town||Panchayats in western Uttar Pradesh continue to draw massive crowds. On Sunday, the scene shifted to Baraut town of Baghpat district where a panchayat of different khaps was called in response to the eviction of elderly farmers from a sit-in protest on the Baraut-Saharanpur highway. Appeal to farmers Held after the emotional outburst of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait at the Ghazipur border, the panchayat saw the participation of Desh khap, Chuabisi khap, Chaugama khap and Thamba khap among others. After the meeting, Desh khap head Surendra Chaudhary made an appeal to the farmers to move to Ghazipur border in turns. He said the Additional District Magistrate and Circle officer of Baraut attended the meeting and promised that the cases against the farmers would be taken back and their belongings would be returned. “The ADM regretted the forceful removal of farmers at night,” he said. The farmers were removed from the protest site on Wednesday after the National Highways Authority of India made a complaint to the administration that the construction work was getting delayed because of the protest. A local source said the administration tried hard to put a spanner by invoking Section 144. “Even the tent houses were reluctant to provide material because of the administrative pressure but the sheer number of farmers that peacefully attended the meeting forced the administration on the back foot,” he alleged. FIR lodged Circle Officer Alok Singh said no farmers were named in the FIR lodged by NHAI. “It is against unidentified persons and no specific site has been mentioned. It will continue to hold and be investigated,” he said. Mr. Singh said that some belongings like mattresses and tents were seized from the spot and would be returned to the elders. “Farmers have decided to provide moral support to farmers sitting at Ghazipur border,” he said. On violation of Section 144, Mr. Singh said a decision would be taken after consultation with the administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/khaps-hold-panchayat-in-up-town/article33713017.ece
01 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Won’t let grains become a commodity, says Rakesh Tikait||The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said on Sunday that farmers would not let “grains become products to be stored in the treasury”. “ Bhojan ko dibbaband karne ka prayas hai . The farm laws would help corporates to make food a ready to eat commodity. They will make profits but won’t share it with the farmers. Had that been the intent, the government would have made law on guaranteeing the MSP by now,” Mr. Tikait said. He said the farmers respect the offer of the Prime Minister for talks, but they should not be held under “any conditions and pressure”. “The PM should know that he is the Prime Minister of farmers as well. We should work for a solution where the dignity of both the PM and the farmers remains intact,” he said Mr. Tikait further said those officials who allowed miscreants to enter Red Fort should also be investigated. On the Delhi police notice that asked Mr. Tikait to answer on the Republic Day violence in the Capital, Dharmendra Malik, BKU media-incharge, said they were in talks with lawyers and would respond accordingly. Meanwhile, as the number of farmers continued to swell at the Ghazipur border, Delhi police heightened security at the border on Sunday. Multiple layers of concrete barricades and concertina wires have been added. BKU sources said the administration might have feared their movement towards Delhi on Budget day. “"As already decided, we have no such plans,” said Rajvir Singh, Vice President, BKU. The support for BKU is now not only pouring from western Uttar Pradesh but farmers from Bundelkhand and eastern parts of the State are also trickling in.  ‘My concern is MSP’ Responding to PM’s appreciation of strawberry cultivation in Jhansi in Mann Ki Baat, Lalloo’ Ram, a farmer from Jalaun, said he hadn't heard of strawberry. “It may be a good thing, but my concern is that I get the MSP for dalhan (pulses). Did he say something about it,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/wont-let-grains-become-a-commodity-says-rakesh-tikait/article33713013.ece
01 February 2021||guwahati,||‘Many Northeast wildlife habitats understaffed’||Many wildlife habitats in the Northeast are understaffed, without trained manpower and proper infrastructure, the Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) report of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has said. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had a fortnight released the MEE report covering 146 national parks and wildlife sanctuaries across the country. Sixteen protected areas in the Northeast, minus the major ones such as Assam’s Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park, were included in the evaluation done in 2018-19 with technical assistance from the Wildlife Institute of India. Of these 16, two were rated ‘very good’, seven ‘good’, five ‘fair’ and two ‘poor’. The MEE of 324 other national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the country had been done earlier. The MEE has marked Meghalaya for fairly good management practices while the evaluated wildlife sanctuaries in Assam were found to have “extremely poor” infrastructure, thus adversely affecting their management. The best managed among the 16 evaluated protected areas in the region was found to be Meghalaya’s Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary because of the continuity of a management plan since 2001 “irrespective of who’s posted”. The report largely attributed the significant reduction in biotic interference in the sanctuary to community support. On the other hand, the 397 sq km Yordi Rabe Subse Wildlife Sanctuary in West Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh was found to be the worst managed as it has been running with casual staff only. The sanctuary is known for its biodiversity, including the tiger, leopard, clouded leopard, Mishmi takin, black-necked crane and Asiatic black bear. “The infrastructure is lacking in almost all aspects, i.e. protection camps, patrolling equipment, monitoring and survey equipment, etc.,” the report said in reference to Yordi Rabe Subse.  ‘No training’ Some of the protected areas had adequate staff but were hamstrung by the lack of trained manpower at all ranks, the MEE report said. The frontline workers of Manipur’s Keibul Lamjao National Park, for instance, were found to have had no training in wildlife management especially in the park’s specialised freshwater ecosystem. Eco-tourism had not attained its objectives and there were no visitor facilities and updated eco-tourism management plan in all evaluated sanctuaries of the Northeast, the report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/many-northeast-wildlife-habitats-understaffed/article33713238.ece
01 February 2021||GUWAHATI,||New players queer pitch in Assam||Major political parties in Assam are wary of the challenge posed by a new regional entity, particularly in eastern Assam, dominated by indigenous communities. The Congress, keen on wresting power from BJP and its regional allies, has been wooing the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) as well as jailed peasants’ rights activist Akhil Gogoi’s party, Raijor Dal (RD). The focus is more on AJP, considered a stronger force than RD. The two have so far resisted offers to join the Congress-led grand alliance, comprising the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) headed by MP Badruddin Ajmal, the Anchalik Gana Morcha led by journalist-turned-Rajya Sabha Member Ajit Kumar Bhuyan and three Left Front parties. “We want all the regional forces to unite and maintain a distance from the national parties,” AJP president Lurinjyoti Gogoi said, indicating that his party was inching closer to a pre-poll alliance with RD. Cong., BJP worried Both the Congress and the BJP-led alliances have targeted at least 100 of the 126 seats in the Assam Assembly with the elections to be held by May. But they are wary of AJP and RD denting their performance in about 45 seats across eastern Assam. BJP has downplayed the perceived threat from either AJP or RD or any alliance they might cobble up. “They are no factors at all,” senior BJP leader Pawan Sharma said. But AJP, in particular, is believed to have consolidated enough support to pose a challenge to the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the larger of the two regional allies of BJP. AGP and AJP were born, 35 years apart, from the same sub-nationalist groups avowedly against “illegal immigrants” and cater to the same sets of voters. AGP has been on overdrive for almost two months to not let slip its support base. “We have been connecting with our voters and our feedback is that we can maintain our position or do better,” AGP president Atul Bora said.  We want all the regional forces to unite and maintain a distance from the national parties   Lurinjyoti Gogoi AJP president||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/new-players-queer-pitch-in-assam/article33713018.ece

01 February 2021||Mumbai,||Exhibitors welcome 100% occupancy in theatres||Film exhibitors, producers and cinema hall owners on Sunday hailed the Centre’s decision to permit movie theatres across the country to operate at 100% capacity from February 1. The insiders said the move would help the industry recover from COVID-19-induced losses. On Sunday, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar released a new set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to help functioning of cinema halls with adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols. Adequate distancing, face masks and sanitisation of auditorium after every screening are among the SOPs issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, after the government allowed cinema halls to operate at 100% occupancy from Monday. Digital booking of tickets and staggered show timings to avoid crowding will be encouraged, the minister said. The Producers Guild of India, headed by producer Siddharth Roy Kapur, took to Twitter and wrote that lifting of the occupancy cap was a necessary step to revive the industry. “We welcome the decision of @MIB_India to allow 100% capacity in cinemas from February 1 and extend our sincere gratitude to Honourable @PrakashJavdekar ji and everyone involved in facilitating this important step in our industry’s recovery,” the Guild tweeted. The Multiplex Association of India also took to Twitter and shared that they were grateful for the decision and thanked actor-BJP MP Sunny Deol for his support. “We are deeply grateful to Hon. Minister @PrakashJavdekar & @MIB_India for allowing 100% seating capacity in Cinemas from 1 Feb. We would like to extend our gratitude to Hon. MP @iamsunnydeol for his leadership and support,” the tweet read.  Theatres in Maharashtra opened last November, whereas cinema halls in Tamil Nadu and Kerala resumed operation in early January. Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Limited, said allowing 100% occupancy in cinema halls would give the multiplex industry a “much needed boost.” “This move would give confidence to the producers to release their much awaited films and audiences to return to the cinemas to watch their choicest movies in the company of their loved ones,” Mr. Dutta said. Alok Tandon, Chief Executive Officer — INOX Leisure Ltd, said relaxation of seating norms was a “vital prerequisite” to help rebuild cinema exhibition in the country. Mr. Tandon said the decision would now encourage producers to roll out their release slate of films. “This would ease the apprehensions in the minds of content producers and studios, who may now announce the release dates of their movies. We now look forward to the State Governments to provide us the nod to implement the revised guidelines,” he said in a statement. Bihar-based exhibitor Vishek Chauhan said the industry needs to plan a proper release strategy. “What we can’t afford is to overcrowd, clash our films on holidays — Eid, Independence day, Diwali. The first film to bell the cat would probably beSooryavanshi, which the industry has been waiting for to bring the audiences back to theatres. Once its release date is announced, within a week, 20 films will be announced. This is a great news for exhibitors. Finally Bollywood has no excuses left,” Mr. Chauhan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/exhibitors-welcome-100-occupancy-in-theatres/article33712996.ece

NMMC is hoping to retain the title of cleanest city in the State for the sixth consecutive year. Last year, the city was also adjudged the third cleanest in the country. NMMC Commissioner Abhijit Bangar informed the civic body’s eight nodal officers that he will be reviewing work under Swachh Survekshan from February 1 to 5. Mr. Bangar also instructed the officers to inform housing societies generating over 50 kg of garbage per day to treat it on their premises. He said, “Time-bound targets will be set for officials to complete pending work. Ward offices have been ordered to levy fines against the use of banned plastic materials. The beautification work, with an emphasis on slum areas and gaothans, is expected to end by January 31. We are also forming a special team at the headquarters to look into matters pertaining to the survey.” In the survey, of the total 6,000 marks, 1,800 is allotted for feedback from residents. Last year, this component accounted for 1,500 marks. The civic body is gearing up to score maximum marks in this section by installing dustbins at every 200 metres and beautifying gardens, walls, roads, and spaces under flyovers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/swachh-survekshan-nmmc-to-conduct-mock-survey/article33712987.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||Farmers at Singhu face food and water scarcity due to road blocks||With a fresh wave of supporters pouring in from Punjab and Haryana to the farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border, there were several complaints of poor connectivity and difficulties in getting supplies due to roadblocks on Sunday. Jasmeet Gill, a farmer who arrived at the site on Sunday morning along with 20 tractors, said more farmers from Punjab will reach Singhu in a few days. According to Mr. Gill, there were no Internet issues or problems in supplies in December last when he was here. “On Sunday, there was a scarcity of water and other supplies, including food. There is no Internet too. The routes leading to leading to the protest site were blocked by the police,” said Mr. Gill. A group of farmers from Sangrur said, earlier, locals from nearby areas in Haryana and Delhi provided water and other items but were now unable to do so due to restrictions put in place by the police. “We are not going to be deterred by these roadblocks. We have already stocked up for many weeks. There is a little problem of water for bathing and washing purposes, but we are arranging other sources,” said Nachhattar Singh, a protester. A young protester Satbir Singh from Ludhiana said, “The movement has gained worldwide attention but due to the absence of the Internet, we are unable to update people in the country and abroad.” In the backdrop of a violent protest by ‘locals’ on Friday, the protesters ramped up vigil — carrying sticks and taking regular rounds — at the site on GT Karnal Road near the Delhi-Haryana border. “They were people from BJP trying to scare us. Now, we have made arrangements to meet any situation. More volunteers are now patrolling and vigil has been enhanced with more than one person from each tractor-trolley keeping watch at night,” said Manjeet Bajwa, a volunteer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmers-at-singhu-face-food-and-water-scarcity-due-to-road-blocks/article33712985.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘BJP spreading doctored video of CM on farm laws’||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said that the BJP has been spreading an edited, doctored version of an interview of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on social media in which he is made to be seen supporting the three new agriculture laws. “It’s unfortunate that the BJP has to doctor a video to get public support for their farm laws. They are using Mr. Kejriwal’s name so that his voice may lend some credibility to the laws,” Mr. Sisodia said. He alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP have not been able to convince the country that the farm laws are beneficial and are resorting to defame the farmers. “The people of the country have realised that the people behind the Red Fort violence were from the BJP and not farmers. They have lost all credibility,” Mr. Sisodia alleged. Discredit protest The public has exposed the attempts of the BJP to try and create chaos and discredit the farmers’ protests. The public now has hate for the BJP and the PM has lost the trust of the country, Mr. Sisodia alleged. “The BJP knows that the public has a lot of faith in Mr. Kejriwal. The BJP has failed in all its machinations against the farmers, hence, they plotted a new scheme by riding on Mr. Kejriwal’s popularity and putting words in his mouth. Aam Aadmi Party will take legal action against the BJP for their cheap tactics,” Mr. Sisodia said. At a press conference, Mr. Sisodia showed the real interview of Mr. Kejriwal along with the doctored video, highlighting the tampered parts in the video. He said that he was initially angered at the BJP’s tactics but later felt pity for them. “Despite having their government at the Centre and in many States as well as having PM Modi as their leader, they have lost people’s trust and hence, they have to use Arvind Kejriwal’s fake video to save the farm laws. Today, the BJP’s credibility is at all-time low,” Mr. Sisodia said. Mr. Sisodia also alleged that the BJP had been sending goons to the borders to try and derail the peaceful protests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-spreading-doctored-video-of-cm-on-farm-laws/article33712977.ece
01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||None of farmer leaders called for probe turn up, allege police||None of the farmer leaders, who had been asked by Delhi Police to join the investigations last week, turned up till Sunday evening, said an officer. He said notices were sent to 44 farmers’ leaders to join the probe on violation of terms and conditions for the tractor rally on Republic Day. “We again called them up, asking them to join the investigation at the earliest. We are waiting for their reply. On Sunday, we have sent notices to 70 tractor owners after the vehicles were identified from the footage that we got from the public and CCTVs,” the officer added. The process of issuing notices is taking time as many people were from outside the city and we are sending letters to their addresses, he added. Delhi Police teams are investigating in several locations outside the city, including Punjab and Haryana, to apprehend the accused. They are also looking for those who hoisted flags at the Red Fort. Sources said the police have blocked several groups on social media, which were active during the violence. FSL gets evidence The Forensic Science Laboratory teams visited Ghazipur, Red Fort and ITO areas and collected evidence, including a big rope, which was used to climb on Red Fort.  The police have received 1,700 video clips related to the violence so far. The Crime Branch is also examining dump data of mobile phone calls and registration numbers of tractors. The investigators are analysing footage and photos taken from drone-mounted cameras and carrying out 3D mapping of the area vandalised at the Red Fort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/none-of-farmer-leaders-called-for-probe-turn-up-allege-police/article33712983.ece
01 February 2021||New Delhi,||Illegal construction: Sonu Sood moves SC against HC order||Actor Sonu Sood has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court’s order dismissing his appeal against a notice issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) over alleged illegal construction at his residential building in Juhu. Mr. Sood’s petition stated that his application for conversion has been approved by the BMC Municipal Commissioner subject to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority’s permission. It said the high court order dated January 13, 2021, has been passed without considering the provisions of Section 43(1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, and his application for conversion of residential premises into a residential hotel was submitted in 2018 before the department. The plea contended that their application for conversion be directed to be decided by authorities. “The petitioners have already stopped the work of internal renovation which require no permission as per the provisions of Section 43 of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, therefore, the respondents may kindly be restrained from demolition of the renovation work already done in the building,” the plea by Mr. Sood and his wife said. Mr. Sood further stated that if the application of the petitioners for conversion is approved, the financial loss due to demolition will not be recovered in any manner and would cause miscarriage of justice to the petitioners. The HC, while dismissing the actor’s appeal and application, said, “Law helps only those who are diligent.” Mr. Sood’s lawyer had sought a time of 10 weeks to comply with the notice issued by the BMC in October last year, and requested the HC to direct the civic body to not initiate demolition action. The high court, however, refused and said the actor had ample opportunity in the past and if required, he could approach the civic body. Mr. Sood had approached the high court earlier this month challenging an order of a city civil court at Dindoshi that had dismissed his suit against the BMC’s notice issued over alleged illegal construction. The actor, in the interim application in HC, had sought an order restraining the BMC from taking any coercive action against his property in Juhu. “The petitioner has not made any changes in the building that warrants permission from the BMC.

Following the arrest, a group of journalists protested outside Delhi Police headquarters in New Delhi, demanding the immediate release of Mandeep Punia. A case was registered against him at Alipur police station. He was sent to Tihar prison after being produced before a Magistrate, a senior officer said. On the day of the incident on Friday, the police had put up barricades at the border. However, some people including the journalist, tried to remove the barricades, the police said. On the same day, there were clashes between farmers and a large group of men, claiming to be locals, who hurled stones at each other. Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s Press Corps, Press Club of India and the Press Association also condemned the brutal police action against Mr. Punia and another scribe Dharmender Singh, who were picked up by police on January 30 evening from the border. “We demand that Mr. Punia should be freed immediately, and no journalist should be disturbed while carrying out their duties at any place. Such crackdowns impinge on the media’s right to report freely and interferes with our right to freedom of expression, and freedom of the press as guaranteed by the Constitution of India,” the joint statement by group of journalists read. ‘Police use brutal force’ The police used brutal force while picking up Mr. Punia and did not share his whereabouts to other media colleague entire night, the journalists alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/journalist-arrested-from-singhu-for-misbehaving-with-policemen/article33712986.ece

Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that considering the disturbed and dangerous political situation in the country, the Congress needs a dynamic and powerful leader like Mr. Gandhi at the helm to lead the party forcefully, to counter the communal, authoritarian and undemocratic forces trying to take the country on the path of destruction.

01 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jan. recorded maximum cold wave days in 13 years||Cold wave continued in the Capital on Sunday with the minimum temperature touching 3.1 degrees Celsius. The IMD said this January, there have been seven “cold wave” days, which is the maximum number of such days in January since 2008. The minimum was five degrees colder than the normal for this time of the year. The maximum temperature was 25 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees warmer than the normal for the season. In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to four degrees Celsius. A severe cold wave is when the minimum temperature is two degrees Celsius or less. In 2008, 12 cold wave days were recorded. There was only one cold wave day each recorded in 2020 and 2019. The minimum temperature has been below normal as cold and dry northwesterly winds have been barrelling through the plains, leading to cold wave conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jan-recorded-maximum-cold-wave-days-in-13-years/article33712978.ece

This protection to the farmers is essential in the light of recent attacks on them, engineered and executed by goons from BJP.” Mr. Chadha said: “Our farmer brothers and sisters are at daily risk of being attacked.

01 February 2021||Moscow,||Russia arrests 4,400 Navalny supporters||Police detained more than 4,000 people across Russia and blocked off the centre of Moscow on Sunday in a massive clampdown on protests demanding the release of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Thousands of protesters defied government warnings to rally from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg in a second weekend of mass demonstrations over the arrest of President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critic. Mr. Navalny was detained at a Moscow airport in mid-January after flying back to Russia from Germany where he was recovering from an August poisoning he blames on the Kremlin. The 44-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is being held in a Moscow detention centre and faces years of potential jail time in several different criminal cases, despite calls from protesters and Western governments for his release. In moves not seen in years in Moscow, authorities locked down the centre of the capital on Sunday, with hundreds of police lining the streets, central Metro stations closed and the movements of pedestrians restricted. Protesters, who had hoped to gather outside the headquarters of the FSB security service, were instead scattered to various parts of the city as organisers made last-minute changes in locations. AFP journalists saw dozens of protesters detained and taken into police vans. It was unclear amid the chaos how many people took part in the demonstration. Independent monitor OVD-Info said at least 4,027 people had been detained across the country, after reporting more than 4,000 detentions during similar protests last Saturday. It said 1,167 were detained in Moscow and 862 in Saint Petersburg, as well as at least 82 journalists across the country. U.S. slams ‘harsh tactics’ U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Twitter condemned “the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists by Russian authorities for a second week straight.” The Russian Foreign Ministry hit back, accusing the U.S. of “gross interference” in its affairs and of using “online platforms controlled by Washington” to promote the protests. Hundreds marched through the centre of Moscow, chanting “Freedom!” and “Putin is a thief!” before arriving outside Matrosskaya Tishina prison where Navalny was being held. “If this is happening now to a person who is famous in Russia and the world, it could happen to anyone in the future,” protester Philip said at the Moscow rally. Several dozen were detained at the prison, with police chasing down protesters in the snow outside the complex. Mr. Navalny’s ally Helga Pirogova told AFP that Sunday’s protest in Novosibirsk was potentially bigger than the week before.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-arrests-4000-navalny-supporters/article33712743.ece
01 February 2021||Washington,||Trump parts ways with impeachment lawyers||Former President Donald Trump has parted ways with his lead impeachment lawyers just over a week before his Senate trial is set to begin, two people familiar with the situation said on Saturday. Butch Bowers and Deborah Barbier, both South Carolina lawyers, are no longer with Mr. Trump’s defence team. One of the people described the parting as a “mutual decision” that reflected a difference of opinion on the direction of the case. Both insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. One said new additions to the legal team were expected to be announced in a day or two. The upheaval injects fresh uncertainty into the makeup and strategy of Mr. Trump’s defence team as he prepares to face charges that he incited the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. However, all but five Senate Republicans this week voted in favour of an effort to dismiss the trial before it even started, making clear a conviction of the former President is unlikely regardless of his defence team. Greg Harris and Johnny Gasser, two former federal prosecutors from South Carolina, are also off the team, one of the people said. Divergence of opinion According to a different person with knowledge of the legal hires, Mr. Bowers and Ms. Barbier left the team because Mr. Trump wanted them to use a defence that relied on allegations of election fraud, and the lawyers were not willing to do so. Mr. Trump has struggled to find attorneys willing to defend him. He is set to stand trial the in week of February 8 on a charge that he incited his supporters to storm Congress before President Joe Biden’s inauguration in an attempt to halt the peaceful transition of power. Republicans and Mr. Trump aides have made clear that they intend to make a simple argument in the trial: Trump’s trial is unconstitutional because he is no longer in office. While Republicans in Washington had seemed eager to part ways with Mr. Trump, they have since eased off their criticism, weary of angering the former President’s loyal voter base.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-parts-ways-with-impeachment-lawyers/article33712745.ece
01 February 2021||Hong Kong,||Britain opens visa scheme for millions in Hong Kong||A new visa scheme offering millions of people in Hong Kong a pathway to British citizenship went live on Sunday as the city’s former colonial master opens its doors to those wanting to escape China’s crackdown on dissent. Anyone with a British National (Overseas) passport and their dependents can now apply online for a visa allowing them to live and work in the U.K. After five years, they can apply for citizenship. The immigration scheme is a response to Beijing’s decision last year to impose a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong to snuff out the huge and often violent democracy protests. Britain has accused China of tearing up its promise ahead of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover that the financial hub would maintain key liberties and autonomy for 50 years, and has argued it has a moral duty to protect its former subjects. “We have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of the scheme this week. The website for visa applications went online at 5 p.m. in Hong Kong (0900 GMT). China furious China has reacted with fury to the visa offer, announcing that it would no longer recognise the passports as a legitimate travel or ID document. The move was largely symbolic as residents tend to use their own passports or ID cards to leave the city. But Beijing said it was prepared to take “further measures”, raising fears authorities might try to stop people from Hong Kong from leaving for Britain. On Sunday, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China’s State Council said it strongly condemned the Britishviolating its promise not to give BN(O) passport holders right of residence. “This is a flagrant offence of China’s sovereignty, and we firmly oppose it,” it said. In a commentary, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency accused Britain of having a “colonial mentality”. Applications soar The visa offer is available to a huge number of people — about 70% of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million population. Applications for BN(O) passports have skyrocketed more than 300% since the national security law was imposed last July, with 7,33,000 registered holders as of mid-January. Britain predicts up to 1,54,000 Hong Kongers could arrive over the next year and as many as 3,22,000 over five years, bringing an estimated “net benefit” of up to £2.9 billion ($4 billion). The BN(O) passport is a legacy of Hong Kong’s return to China. Many Hong Kong residents at the time wanted Britain to grant them full citizenship but China was opposed to the move. The BN(O) was a compromise, allowing Hong Kong residents born before 1997 the right to stay in Britain for six months at a time, but with no working or settling rights. Stella, a former marketing professional, plans to move to Britain with her husband and three-year-old son. “The national security law in 2020 gave us one last kick because the provisions are basically criminalising free speech,” she told AFP, asking to use just her first name. Under the visa scheme, those hoping to move must show they have the funds to sustain both themselves and their dependents for at least six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/britain-opens-visa-scheme-for-millions-in-hong-kong/article33712740.ece

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the acquittal of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and three other men last year, triggering outrage from the U.S. Pearl was the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was abducted and beheaded by jihadists in Karachi in January 2002 while researching a story about Islamist militants.

01 February 2021||Wuhan,||WHO team visits Wuhan market to find virus clues||A World Health Organization team looking into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday visited the food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was linked to many early infections. The team members visited the Huanan Seafood Market for about an hour in the afternoon. The market was the site of a December 2019 outbreak of the virus. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market. The market has since been largely ruled out but it could provide hints to how the virus spread so widely. “Very important site visits today — a wholesale market first & Huanan Seafood Market just now,” Peter Daszak, a zoologist with the U.S. group EcoHealth Alliance and a member of the WHO team, said in a tweet. “Very informative & critical for our joint teams to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 as it started to spread at the end of 2019.” Earlier, the team members were also seen walking through the Baishazhou market — one of the largest wet markets in Wuhan — surrounded by a large entourage of Chinese officials. The members, with expertise in veterinary medicine, virology, food safety and epidemiology, have so far visited two hospitals at the centre of the early outbreak —Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and the Hubei Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital. The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus’s origins.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-team-visits-wuhan-market-to-find-virus-clues/article33712749.ece
01 February 2021||New York,||Biden seeks minimum wage hike||When President Joe Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal earlier this month, few were surprised by the plan’s hefty price tag or sweeping scope. More striking was Mr. Biden’s inclusion of a measure to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15. The move, backed by leading Democrats, including left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, establishes the fight for higher wages as a top priority for the new administration, potentially leading to one of Washington’s boldest adjustments in U.S. social and labour policy in decades. The fate of the initiative — which so far lacks support from Republicans — will help determine whether Mr. Biden delivers on a core pocketbook issue as U.S. income inequality widens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Sanders called the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour a “starvation wage” as he unveiled the proposal for an increase in Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-seeks-minimum-wage-hike/article33712738.ece
01 February 2021||Washington,||GOP Senators offer cheaper stimulus plan||A group of 10 Republican Senators have urged President Joe Biden to propose an alternative to his massive COVID-19 relief plan, arguing that their approach could garner the bipartisan support he has said he seeks. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said on Twitter that she had joined the group, which asked the President in a letter on Friday for a meeting to discuss their plan. “We’ve received the letter and we certainly will be reviewing it,” Brian Deese, director of the President’s National Economic Council, told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. He said Mr. Biden was “open to ideas” but that action was needed immediately. The Republicans’ plan, according to reports, would be around $600 billion, which is far smaller than the President’s $1.9 trillion proposal. Many Democrats may find the Republican’s alternative plan difficult to accept.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gop-senators-offer-cheaper-stimulus-plan/article33712813.ece

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The farm laws need political resolution||The deadlock between protesting farmers and the government on the contentious farm laws have taken an ugly turn, with incidents of vandalism during the tractor parade by the protesting farmers on January 26. It is as yet unclear as to how the peaceful protest for the last two months was allowed to take a violent turn by the farmers’ union leadership as well as the police administration given that the police were aware of the plans and had approved the parade. Shadow of mistrust While responsibility must be fixed for the administrative lapses and action taken against erring antisocial elements, the events again point out to the growing mistrust and breakdown of any dialogue between the two sides. Attempts by a section of media and representatives of political parties to use the incidents of vandalism to vilify and malign the two-month-old peaceful agitation will only add to the mistrust between the government and the farmer unions. Such a situation is unlikely to lead to any meaningful outcome despite best intentions. Even though thousands of farmers have been protesting peacefully for more than two months at different sites on the Delhi border, the issues raised by the farmer representatives are not just limited to the demand for guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the repeal of the three farm laws passed during the monsoon session of Parliament, in September last year. They are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. A resonance of anger While an impression has been created that the agitating farmers only represent the interests of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, these issues have found resonance across several States in the country where large mobilisations of farmers have been protesting peacefully. There are large variations across States in the way the MSP-led procurement operations are conducted; but there are also variations in States in terms of the role and functions of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). Despite these differences, these mobilisations represent the anger against the political economy of agricultural reforms. The genuine fear of corporate takeover and withdrawal of the state go beyond the three Acts. It is essentially about the trust deficit between the state and the farmers who see the actions of the state as allowing greater control by the private sector which will ultimately dispossess them from the meagre resources and land that they have. These impressions are not entirely unfounded if one is to go by the experience in different States such as Bihar in abolishing the APMC system. But these fears also gain strength at a time when the economy is slowing down and the agricultural sector has seen severe distress in the last six years, starting with the twin droughts of 2014 and 2015. With a decline in agricultural wages and falling farm gate prices and farm incomes in the last three years, these Acts represent a pattern of state withdrawal from support to the agricultural sector. Flaws in legislating This is precisely why any attempt by the government to resolve the deadlock has to go beyond the nitty-gritty of the three laws; it has to start from instilling trust in the government’s actions and rhetoric of reforms. With a hardening of positions by the farmers and the government’s representatives, any possibility of resolutions through a dialogue with the unions remains a distant possibility. Even the attempt by the Supreme Court of India to appoint a committee has failed to elicit any positive response from the farmers. The failure of dialogue and mediation by government ministers and the Supreme Court committee is partly a result of the flawed understanding of the government that this issue is a regional issue concerning only a section of farmers. The attempt by both farmer unions as well as the government to exclude other political parties out of such dialogues and discussions is unlikely to resolve the issues which concern every State of the country ruled by different political parties. But it also reflects the process of legislating on important issues without taking into account the concerns of various stakeholders. These pieces of legislation were announced as part of the COVID-19 pandemic relief package when the country was going through a period of severe economic disruption as a result of the lockdown. Not only was the timing wrong, but even the attempt to force these pieces of legislation without any discussion in Parliament created an impression of stubbornness on the part of the government to deny any form of dialogue and consultation. The failure to consult State governments, which are important stakeholders, has also created the peculiar situation where six large States have now passed separate pieces of legislation in their State legislatures negating the three central Acts. Budget session as opportunity The commencement of the Budget session from January 29 presents another opportunity to bring back these pieces of legislation in Parliament. An Act of Parliament can only be repealed and amended through Parliament. It is this supreme authority which has the power to resolve this issue despite negotiations outside. While dialogues and negotiations at a time when Parliament was not in session made sense and proved useful in clarifying the concerns of various stakeholders, it is now time to let Parliament take a call. In any case, the Supreme Court has “suspended” the “implementation” of three farm laws for the time being and the government has also offered to put the laws in abeyance for one and half years. While the offer of putting the implementation of the Acts in abeyance for 18 months may have been a strategy to delay the implementation until the Uttar Pradesh legislative elections due in one and half years, it does offer the government the possibility to build larger consensus for the reforms in new form. That will imply repealing the Acts as have been passed in Parliament currently and starting the process afresh with the parliament standing committee steering such larger deliberations. Need for diverse opinions A parliamentary standing committee with representations from different political parties will not only give it more legitimacy but will also allow diverse opinions from States and political parties to be represented. For the government, which is willing to suspend the implementation for one and half years, it will also allow it time, space and the political forum to convince the States and farmers about the benefits of such reforms. More than that, it will be an opportunity to bridge the trust deficit between the government and the protesting farmers. For a government which is serious about reforms in agricultural marketing, repealing the Acts in the current form and starting the process afresh will only reaffirm its seriousness and commitments to the agricultural sector and the farmers of this country.

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Building a robust healthcare system||In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been vociferous demands to strengthen the country’s public health system. Many erudite articles have stressed the need to revamp the system quickly so that we are better prepared to handle such emergencies in the future. Once the present crisis is over, however, public health will go into oblivion, as usual. Governments are already behaving as if things are fine and enough has been done on the health front. Not surprisingly, the efficacy of the public health system varies widely across the country since it is a State subject. How good a public health system is can easily be judged just by looking at certain health parameters such as Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio and Total Fertility Rate for which annual surveys are conducted through the Sample Registration System. Poor health indicators With the numbers given in the chart, it is doubtful whether India will be able to achieve Goal 3 (good health and well-being) of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. India failed to achieve the earlier Millennium Development Goals because of the poor performance of the northern States. It is surprising that the Government of India does not hold them responsible and accountable for poor performance but is satisfied with the average. Equally surprising and disappointing is that these State governments themselves are indifferent to their poor performance. Since health is a State subject, the primary onus lies with the State governments. Each State government must focus on public health and aim to improve the health indicators mentioned above. It is disappointing that some of the States have skewed priorities such as cow protection and ‘love jihad’. More mothers are perhaps dying for want of care than cows. Are these governments not concerned? Unless they give health the highest priority, rapid improvement is not possible. Instead of talking in generalities, they must start looking at numbers. To start with, the above parameters are good enough. Their close monitoring at the highest level may improve things. These data are revealing. The northern States are performing very poorly in these vital health parameters. In Madhya Pradesh, the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births is as high as 48 compared to seven in Kerala. In U.P. the Maternal Mortality Ratio is 197 compared to Kerala’s 42 and Tamil Nadu’s 63. The percentage of deliveries by untrained personnel is very high in Bihar, 190 times that of Kerala. Another vital parameter that has an impact on poverty, Total Fertility Rate, is very high in Bihar (3.2) against the stabilisation rate of 2.1. Tamil Nadu and Kerala have done so well that their population will decline over the years. This has been made possible thanks to the effective Maternal and Child Health and Family Welfare services provided by these States. Some of these States are performing so poorly that they are comparable to the poorest countries in the world, pulling down the average for India. The Government of India is just looking at the averages which are somewhat reasonable thanks to the excellent performance of well-governed States. Unless all the States perform well, there will be no dramatic improvement in the health system . It is sad this is the outcome despite Finance Commissions pouring non-Plan funds into these States in addition to substantial Plan allocation from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the Empowered Action Group States. More money does not and cannot produce results. Only clear focus and better governance can. Tamil Nadu’s example How did the southern States achieve this? It is because of enlightened political leadership which was interested in the health and well-being of the people. I vividly remember the family planning drives and innumerable camps organised to eradicate cataract in the 1970s. The district administration was spearheading these health initiatives because of the government’s focus and drive. The government encouraged a healthy competition among the districts by giving prizes to the well-performing ones. By the 1990s, family planning drives were no more necessary, and all that was needed was some fine-tuning of the Maternal and Child Health programme. The result is that the Total Fertility Rate of Tamil Nadu is among the lowest in the country (1.6) comparable to that of Germany (1.57) and Japan (1.43). In addition to a clear focus by the political executive, Tamil Nadu has the advantage of a public and preventive health structure. A good administrative structure could therefore deliver to the demands of the political executive, benefiting the people of the State. The governments — both at the Centre and the Empowered Action Group States — should realise that public health and preventive care is a priority and take steps to bring these States on a par with the southern States. The Government of India has a vital role to play. With his huge mandate and popularity, the Prime Minister should get involved in this fundamental task of improving the health of the people. Public and preventive health should be his focus by holding the Empowered Action Group States accountable to the SDGs. They must be asked to reach the levels of the southern States within three to five years. Volumes have been written and hundreds of studies have been conducted on what needs to be done in each of these States. One wonders whether they are even read. Instead of slogans and promises, hard work is needed. Perhaps what was started in Tamil Nadu as early as the 1970s needs to be done in these States now. When Chief Ministers are focused on health and the district health administrations are held accountable, performance is bound to improve. An important measure that can make a difference is a public health set-up in these States that addresses primary and preventive health. Many studies have stressed its importance to deliver better with the given resources. Tamil Nadu manages its public health set-up with just about 150 public health professionals. Therefore, it cannot be difficult for other States to build a public health cadre quickly. Giving health importance Unless we invest in human capital, FDI will not help. It will only increase the wealth of the already wealthy and accentuate income disparity. Investing in health and education is the primary responsibility of any government. It is time the governments — both at the Centre and States — gave health its due importance. Announcing piecemeal schemes may help to get publicity but will not make a lasting improvement. Improving health of such a large population requires concerted efforts over years. The southern States started early and are enjoying the benefits, but they can still do more to reach the level of developed countries. The Empowered Action Group States must start in earnest at least now. There are no short cuts; only persistent and focused efforts at the highest level of government will improve preventive care and primary healthcare. R.

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Mahatma and the empowerment of the other||Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary (January 30) may have just passed, but it is not just an occasion to celebrate his life and his message once more, or to simply add to the Gandhian biography, so to speak. We should think of Gandhi as a noble spirit who continues to be among us and who contributes to the betterment of our world. Therefore, the task before us is how we, individually and collectively, can understand and take forward the Gandhian nobility of spirit in today’s world. If there is only one idea that Gandhi should be remembered for and identified with, it is the idea of empowerment of the other. Different opinion as right Undoubtedly, the essence of Gandhi’s political philosophy is the empowerment of the other, irrespective of gender, race, class or creed. That is why Gandhi understood democracy as a socio-political institution which seeks to empower the other by asserting its right to speak freely and to act differently. As such, Gandhi viewed the empowerment of the other as a right to express a different opinion than that of the majority and to be heard openly and transparently. One such idea is captured by Gandhi’s statement, that “The spirit of democracy is not a mechanical thing to be adjusted by abolition of forms. It requires change of the heart... The spirit of democracy requires the inculcation of the spirit of brotherhood... democracy is not a state in which people act like sheep. Under democracy, individual liberty of opinion and action is jealously guarded.... (https://bit.ly/39Ap5fY)” In his quest to defend the otherness of the other, Gandhi invited individuals to rule themselves against their weaker natures by becoming self-governing agents. But he also looked for the creation and cultivation of a public culture of citizenship that guaranteed everyone the right to opinion and action. The empowerment of the other is a value which needs to be created and cherished. In other words, empowerment, for Gandhi, was an act of empathy and affinity, not a mode of social interconnectedness taken for granted. Therefore, as a transformative force, the empowerment of every citizen is an experience of conscience underpinning the harmony between ethics and politics. The Gandhian appeal to the ethical is in fact a way to civilise modern politics from within, by shortening the circuit of conquest, domination and violence. By addressing the question of the otherness of the other, Gandhi was trying to cultivate the individual’s capacity for ethical citizenship and empathetic friendship. From Gandhi’s perspective, non-violence encouraged an awareness, which moved the individual away from a monistic egocentricity and closer to a pluralistic shared suffering. Moreover, this state of awareness called for a common horizon of humanity, which strengthened the process of thinking about the otherness of the other. What is so fascinating and relevant with the Gandhian approach to politics is that Gandhi understood the civilisational process of freedom-making as an inclusion of the other as the other. His work as manifesto As a matter of fact, we can read and understand Gandhi’s seminal work, Hind Swaraj , as a manifesto for the otherness of the other. Here, Gandhi introduces his readers to a new model of civilisation which takes humanity to a higher moral level. While pointing to utilitarianism as a false mode of existence which dismisses totally the otherness of the other, Gandhi suggests his own idea of moral interconnectedness and empathetic pluralism. For Gandhi, civilisation has to give primacy to moral progress of humanity, rather than just generate tendencies towards futility and violence. Truly, what is so relevant about Gandhi’s view of civilisation is the strong conviction that civilisation should help humanity realise the path of righteousness and compassion, by putting morality before materialism. Gandhi was aware of the importance of pluralism of ideas and values because of the dissimilarities and differences that exist. A mode Unsurprisingly, Gandhi’s idea of empowerment of the other is feasible only in a political community where people have the art of listening. In other words, the art of listening, as much as the freedom of speech, is a mode of laying emphasis on the otherness of the other against all forms of tyranny. Accordingly, we can consider as tyrannical an individual or a society which refuses to the other the right to speak and the time and space to listen. If tyranny is the enemy of empathy, then the project of caring for the otherness of the other would suggest a mode of sensibility that rejects the logic of domination and conquest of the other. Through his readings of human civilisation, Gandhi showed us that he was well aware of the dangers of the conquest of the other. That is why he refuses to reject the otherness of the other in the situation of intolerance and exclusion. Gandhi did not consider social, political or even religious marginality as a curse, but more as a constructive asset which helped the individual maintain critical distance from all traditions of thought while entering a dialogue with any form of otherness. Shared humanity Undeniably, Gandhi replaced the linear and monolithic discourse of reality with his dialogical vision of civilisation and political life. Thus, by bringing beauty out of the ugliness of modern civilisation, he forged a new form of solidarity — that of shared humanity — as a tool for the survival of the otherness of the other. As such, Gandhi’s experiments with truth made him conscious not only of his similarities but also of his dissimilarities and differences with others. Seventy-three years after his death, what Mahatma Gandhi continues to teach us is that all life is interconnected, and a human spirit which remains indifferent to the otherness of the others, including the natural world, has no nobility left in it.

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Numbers and public health||One of our readers, Deepesh Goel, posed a number of questions about the numbers that were cited in the article “The time for — not mass but targeted vaccination” (January 26). He was also not sure of the methodology used by the authors, M.S. Seshadri and T. Jacob John. The newspaper has a clear and considered position for commissioning articles on a range of subjects, and public health is no exception. While a newspaper does not opt for detailed footnotes and endnotes, as the emphasis is on the ease of reading, there are stringent measures to ensure accuracy. The act of verification is central to this endeavour.  State of endemicity The first question Mr. Goel asked was about the reference to the daily new births across the country. The article contended that of the total daily new births, 54,000 infants survive. It further said that “we add 54,000 susceptible subjects daily to the pool”. Mr. Goel’s question was, if the article adds each new birth to the susceptible pool, shouldn’t it warrant the removal of non-COVID-19 daily deaths from the numbers? The authors, who are respected virologists, say that when there is a steady state of endemicity, there is more or less a constant number of daily infections. That is how 54,000 new births are added to the pool, which is a standard well-accepted epidemiological principle. They are not talking about percentages or proportions; hence, there is no need to look into the number of non-COVID-19 deaths. Mr. Goel felt that it would have helped if the source of the assertion “Nowadays, we mostly test symptomatic individuals, who account for only about half of total infections” had been given, as there have been many studies during the pandemic with each giving a different fraction of the symptomatic. The authors relied on a recent meta-analysis in the Annals of Internal Medicine on the proportion of patients who are asymptomatic. In cross-sectional studies, the proportion is 25% and in longitudinal studies, it is 75%. The authors used the average of 50%. The study they relied on is titled ‘The Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Infections That Are Asymptomatic: A Systematic Review’, and its authors are Daniel P. Oran and Eric J. Topol. Mr. Goel also felt that that it was erroneous to conclude that India is very close to reaching the endemic state when the article itself had pointed out that the daily infections may be 56,000. In the light of low mortality certification, which is only 20%, the reader felt that the authors had failed to take into account the under-reporting of COVID-19 cases. The authors argue that it is highly unlikely for symptomatic cases to go unreported in the context of widespread public knowledge about the seriousness of COVID-19 and the efforts put in by the government to identify every case by mass testing. The reader was not sure how the authors concluded that our COVID-19 case fatality is 1%. He argued that fatality around 1% is the official figure based on reported COVID-19 deaths and that it should not be used in arithmetically adjusted data of reported deaths. The authors argue that we are close to or have already reached endemicity, which is endorsed by two sets of mortality numbers. The ratio between the arithmetically corrected value for the reported cases versus the numbers derived from mortality was 56,000 versus 40,750, which indicates the same trend. Predicting the curve It should also be kept in mind that the authors have a track record in predicting the curve that the pandemic took since March 2020. From recommending universal adoption of the practice of wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus to interpreting sero-surveys and COVID-19 curves, their articles in the edit pages of this newspaper have been consistently prescient. In their article, “Imperatives after India’s September virus peak” (September 29, 2020), they clearly indicated that the virus would continue till March 2021 before turning endemic. Their recommendation for targeted vaccination in India has a context. Europe, Brazil, and the U.S. are opting for universal vaccination because of an ongoing epidemic spread. Journalistically speaking we are in a hybrid phase, where news consumers get their information both from digital platforms and print platforms. The Hindu should consider providing references and citations in hyperlinks in its Internet edition. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/numbers-and-public-health/article33712731.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The problem of ageing dams||Dams and reservoirs are believed to secure our water needs for the future. However, data and studies show that they can threaten our water security. Here is how. It is not a secret anymore that India’s dams are now ageing and concomitantly, reservoir water is being replaced by soil, technically known as silt or sediment. Becoming obsolete India is ranked third in the world in terms of building large dams. Of the over 5,200 large dams built so far, about 1,100 large dams have already reached 50 years of age and some are older than 120 years. The number of such dams will increase to 4,400 by 2050. This means that 80% of the nation’s large dams face the prospect of becoming obsolete as they will be 50 years to over 150 years old. The situation with hundreds of thousands of medium and minor dams is even more precarious as their shelf life is even lower than that of large dams. Krishna Raja Sagar dam was built in 1931 and is now 90 years old. Similarly, Mettur dam was constructed in 1934 and is now 87 years old. Both these reservoirs are located in the water-scarce Cauvery river basin. As dams age, soil replaces the water in the reservoirs. Therefore, the storage capacity cannot be claimed to be the same as it was in the 1900s and 1950s. To make matters worse, studies show that the design of many of our reservoirs is flawed. In a paper, ‘Supply-side Hydrology: Last gasp’, published in 2003 in Economic & Political Weekly , Rohan D’Souza writes that the observed siltation rate in India’s iconic Bhakra dam is 139.86% higher than originally assumed. At this rate, he wrote, “the Bhakra dam is now expected to function for merely 47 years, virtually halved from the original estimate of 88 years”. Similarly, the actual siltation rate observed for the Hirakud, Maithan and Ghod dams are way higher at 141.67%, 808.64% and 426.59%, respectively. Studies in later years showed similar findings. Almost every scholarly study on reservoir sedimentation shows that Indian reservoirs are designed with a poor understanding of sedimentation science. The designs underestimate the rate of siltation and overestimate live storage capacity created. Therefore, the storage space in Indian reservoirs is receding at a rate faster than anticipated. Reservoirs are poised to become extinct in less than a few decades with untold consequences already under way. Consequences When soil replaces the water in reservoirs, supply gets choked. The cropped area begins receiving less and less water as time progresses. The net sown water area either shrinks in size or depends on rains or groundwater, which is over-exploited. Crop yield gets affected severely and disrupts the farmer’s income. In fact, the farmer’s income may get reduced as water is one of the crucial factors for crop yield along with credit, crop insurance and investment. It is important to note that no plan on climate change adaptation will succeed with sediment-packed dams. The flawed siltation rates demonstrated by a number of scholarly studies reinforce the argument that the designed flood cushion within several reservoirs across many river basins may have already depleted substantially due to which floods have become more frequent downstream of dams. The flooding of Bharuch in 2020, Kerala in 2018 and Chennai in 2015 are a few examples attributed to downstream releases from reservoirs. The nation will eventually be unable to find sufficient water in the 21st century to feed the rising population by 2050, grow abundant crops, create sustainable cities, or ensure growth. Therefore, it is imperative for all stakeholders to come together to address this situation urgently. J. Harsha is Director, Central Water Commission, Government of India.

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Growth with inequality||The Economic Survey for 2020-21 is an expansive attempt at reviewing the developments in the Indian economy during the current financial year and providing an outlook for its near-term prospects. Spread over 700 pages, the survey opts for a self-congratulatory tone while highlighting the policy achievements of the government in steering the economy through the treacherous shoals of “the most unfathomable global health emergency experienced in modern history”. Citing an approach that used ‘graded public health measures to transform the short-term trade-off between lives and livelihoods into a win-win that would save both lives and livelihoods over the longer term’, the survey asserts that India established a globally unique model of strategic policymaking in containing the COVID-19 pandemic while helping the economy recover quickly from its deleterious impact. There is no denying that the country appears to have not only flattened the curve but also, crucially, so far avoided a bruising second wave of infections seen in much of Europe and the U.S. While it may be debatable as to how much of the turn in the pandemic’s progress could be attributed wholly to proactive policy measures, the survey’s contention that India has turned the crisis into an opportunity to strengthen its long-term growth potential through ‘seminal reforms’ sounds off-key, especially given the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the new farm laws as well as the plight of the struggling small and medium-scale industries and informal sectors. The survey goes on to forecast that the economy is currently experiencing a V-shaped recovery that would enable GDP to expand, even by a ‘conservative estimate’, by 11% in real terms in 2021-22. Still, to achieve that level of real growth, retail inflation must moderate substantially to average 4.4% or less over the 12-month period through March 2022, given that the survey has projected nominal growth at 15.4%. Also, while batting for a fiscal push to support the reviving economy, it posits an upside to the growth prognosis predicated on, among other factors, a rapid roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines and a recovery in demand in the battered services sector. However, the document fails in providing an honest assessment of the on-ground economic situation by overlooking key aspects including the extent of unemployment even as it hints at the level of rural joblessness, which followed the return of millions of urban casual workers in the wake of last year’s hastily implemented lockdown. This it does by taking credit for a record 311.92 crore person-days of work generated over the last 10 months under MGNREGA. And in contending that growth should be prioritised over inequality in tackling poverty, when the pandemic has exacerbated the gap between the rich and the poor and the Finance Minister is set to present her Budget, the survey seems to privilege wealth creation over all else.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/growth-with-inequality/article33712717.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Instability in Italy||The resignation of Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, amid infighting in the ruling coalition, has pushed the country, one of the worst-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, into another phase of political instability. Mr. Conte, a former law professor who first formed the government in 2018, resigned after a small coalition partner, Italia Viva, led by former PM Matteo Renzi, left after differences over the way the government was tackling the outbreak and its plans to spend the $243 billion EU virus fund. Italy, which has seen more than 65 governments in the last 70-odd years, is no stranger to political instability. But the difference now is the unfolding of the crisis amid the struggle to contain the virus infection that has claimed over 85,000 Italians; hundreds of people are dying every day. The vaccination programme, which the government rolled out in recent weeks, has been criticised for being too slow (the government has blamed drugmaker Pfizer for poor supply). Parts of Italy are still under lockdown. The economy, which was battling multiple crises even before COVID-19 struck, is estimated to have contracted by 8.9% last year. All these point to an unprecedented crisis which demands a bold response plan from the country’s leaders. But its politicians, as the fall of the government shows, are busy fighting one other. Mr. Conte, who has retained over 50% approval ratings as PM despite the health-care and economic crises, often struggled to navigate the treacherous waters of coalition politics. He was picked by the populist Five Star Movement in 2018 to head the government which it formed with the far-right Lega Nord. After the Lega Nord exited the coalition in 2019 in the wake of a corruption scandal, Mr. Renzi, who was then leading the centre-left Democratic Party, supported Mr. Conte to form another government. Since then, Mr. Renzi, who left the Democratic Party and formed Viva Italia, grew critical of Mr. Conte’s leadership. Their differences have led to the fall of Mr. Conte’s second government in less than three years. The current crisis could be as much about Mr. Conte’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis as it is about their power struggle. The ball is now in President Sergio Mattarella’s court. He could ask Mr. Conte to form another government or entrust some other leader with enough support with the job. If no party manages to win a majority in Parliament, the President could call snap elections. That is the last thing Italy wants now, and its politicians should realise that their first priority should be to arrest the infection wave, step up the vaccination programme and lift the economy out of the deep contraction it is in. For that, the country needs a stable government with a plan of action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/instability-in-italy/article33712726.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Science Congress||There is a tradition among scientific men that they should affect a pose of superiority over laymen, that they should not engage in any conversation with them on scientific subjects, much less enter into a controversy over such subjects. The duly initiated alone, under this tradition, ought to be taken into account as though they form a special universe unto themselves. Fools undoubtedly rush in where the angels fear to tread; and, if the tradition of exclusiveness so long inculcated among scientists is intended merely to be a safeguard against the intrusion of folly, we must say it has done perhaps more harm than good. The tendency on the part of scientists to hide their light under a bushel, consequent on this spirit of exclusiveness which may easily degenerate into a sort of intellectual snobbishness, is calculated, not only to protect them from the obtrusion of fools, but also to diminish their light and check progress. The scientist and the observant layman do not move in altogether mutually exclusive regions. There are many spheres of contact between them which they ought to explore together or, at any rate, compare the results of their separate exploration thereof. Such joint activities are sure to prove fruitful fields of activity for both. That, we take it, is the meaning of the new spirit which animates the modern man of science in the West, which makes him take the fullest advantage of the non-technical as well as the technical Press and which makes him lecture to lay audiences on the results of his learning and of his research.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-science-congress/article33712727.ece

Gandhiji has more than once emphatically declared that cow worship is an essential and distinguishing feature of Hinduism.

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ask Us Jan 19||Q.I am a government employee drawing over Rs. 50,000 in gross salary. I need suggestions on investing up to Rs. 10,000 a month with some tax-saving benefits Ibnu Rahman A.Before starting out on other investments, it may be good for you to build an emergency fund equal to about month’s worth of family expenses. This can be done through savings in a bank fixed deposit or post office deposit. This will be useful to handle emergencies you haven’t budgeted for. If you have dependent family members, get a pure term insurance policy to take care of them in your absence. Contributions to life insurance plans are eligible for tax exemptions under Sec. 80C of the Income Tax Act that allows you to claim tax exemptions on investments of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh made in select avenues during the financial year. Get health insurance if medical expenses are not covered by your job. Having made these investments, you can actively look at other options to grow your savings. Where you invest will depend on two things — when you need the money and if you are willing to risk capital losses for higher returns. If you need the money within 3 years, post office fixed deposits are a good option. For 5 years, National Savings Certificates offer good rates with section 80C benefits on the investment. If your holding period is longer, you can consider the Public Provident Fund — a 15-year scheme with tax benefits both on the investment and the annual interest credited to your account. Both principal and interest are guaranteed in these options. If you are willing to risk your capital for a higher return in the long run, you can consider starting systematic investment plan (SIPs)in one or two equity linked savings schemes. These are equity mutual funds that invest in the stock market, carry a 3-year lock-in period and are also eligible for Sec. 80C benefits on the initial investment. Q.I am planning to invest in the share market. How can I a analyse a firm? Vinu Michael A.Having some allocation to the stock market can be good in the long run, as returns from shares usually beat inflation. But the return is quite highly dependent on the prices at which you buy them and the period for which you are willing to hang on to them as stock prices go through a roller-coaster. Today, you may be aware that the Nifty50 and Sensex30 are at all-time highs never seen before. The valuation ratios or prices that investors are willing to pay for every rupee of profit are at an all-time high too. This makes it risky for first-time investors to make a beginning in stock market investing. Investors buying shares now will need to be prepared for the prices of the stocks they own falling quite sharply (even 40-50% going by previous crashes) and staying there for an extended period. However, your ability to earn good returns from stocks depends on your willingness to stay the course through such bear markets in order to capitalise on future increases. If you are still keen to buy shares, you can start by investing in index mutual funds that own a basket of stocks making up indices like the Nifty50 or Sensex30 to get a real-life feel of market volatility. Usually, it is difficult for ordinary investors to earn better returns than the indices in the long run unless they are experts at analysing companies and good at timing the markets. If you would still like to pursue stock market investing as a passion, start by reading books written by investing stalwarts both from India and abroad. How to invest right and prosper by A.K. Narayan, Stocks to Riches and Value Investing by Parag Parikh, Beating the Street and One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, the annual newsletters by Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway are some useful ones. There are also many blogs and online forums – Fundoo Professor, Valuepickr and Dr. Vijay Malik’s blog are some that come to mind. Get into the habit of reading company annual reports and business papers and media to keep track of corporate events. Attend investor awareness webinars held by SEBI. Take your first steps into shares very carefully, by allocating a very small portion of your savings to a stock that you have done thorough homework on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ask-us-jan-19/article33712716.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||ATKMB roars back for stirring win||An astounding, lion-hearted comeback earned ATK Mohun Bagan (ATKMB) a stirring 3-2 win over Kerala Blasters (KBFC) in an Indian Super League clash at the Fatorda Stadium on Sunday. The remarkable victory takes ATKMB to 27 points from 14 games and within three points of leader Mumbai City, while Blasters’ shocking collapse sees it remain ninth. KBFC made its attacking intentions clear from the get-go and stormed ahead in the 14th minute courtesy of a sensational strike from Gary Hooper. Sandeep Singh played a diagonal ball from the right flank and Hooper chested it down before unleashing a phenomenal top of the boot finish from 31 meters out. Roy Krishna, ATKMB’s top-scorer this season, got into the game around the half-hour mark. He first got a fine header off Prabir Das’ cross that sailed just wide and followed it up with a venomous strike a couple of minutes later. ATKMB looked inept in attack otherwise. Kibu Vicuna’s side doubled its lead soon after the break when Costa Nhamoinesu knocked in Sahal Abdul Samad’s corner. It was only the second this season ATKMB was staring at a two-goal deficit, but it did not deter the side. Marcelinho, making his debut for the Mariners, offered ATKMB a lease of life by bombing down the centre and fighting his way past Jeakson Singh before placing it past the ‘keeper in the 59th minute.  The momentum had swiftly shifted in ATKMB’s favour and it equalised six minutes later. Blasters’ captain Jessel Carneiro handled the ball in the box and Krishna drilled the penalty into the right corner. The Mariners were relentless in their pressure and Blasters’ defensive wall slowly began to crack. Krishna made the most the jumpy backline as he created a chance out of nothing to seal the deal. He stole the ball from Sandeep and then streaked past Jeakson before curling it into the back of the net. The 87th-minute goal, his ninth, put the tie to bed.  The results: Hyderabad FC 2 (Sandaza 28, Chianese 83) bt Chennaiyin FC 0; ATK Mohun Bagan 3 (Marcelinho 59, R. Krishna 65-pen, 87) bt Kerala Blasters 2 (Hooper 14, Nhamoinesu 51).

A much-improved second half from Chennaiyin notwithstanding, Hyderabad scored once in either half, through Fran Sandaza and Joel Chianese, to climb to third position with 22 points from 15 matches. Chennaiyin remains sixth with 16 points. Fine strike Spaniard Sandaza put Hyderabad ahead with a fine strike in the 28th minute. A one-two between Joao Victor and Sandaza saw the latter go past the central defender Deepak Tangri and unleash a deft left-footer past ‘keeper Vishal Kaith. But for the goal, both teams played largely uninspiring football and it was more or less even. Getting better Chennaiyin head coach Csaba Laszlo brought on Edwin Vanspaul and Fatkhulo Fatkhulloev for the second period and his team’s play lifted. Minutes after the restart, defender Eli Sabia strode forward, exchanged a pass with Esma Goncalves, and struck fiercely from distance, but it crashed off the crossbar after beating ‘keeper Laxmikant Kattimani. Chennaiyin had a golden chance to equalise, in the 78th minute, when Lallianzuala Chhangte’s exquisite cross from the right found forward Rahim Ali. All that Ali had to do was to direct the ball goalward, but he sliced it wide. Hyderabad soon doubled the lead, with Victor’s second assist of the match enabling Chianese to come up with a clinical finish into the corner of the net. The goal ensured a comeback was beyond Chennaiyin.  The results: Hyderabad FC 2 (Sandaza 28, Chianese 83) bt Chennaiyin FC 0.   ATKMB 3 (Mercelinho Leite Pereira 59, Roy Krishna 65-pen, 87) bt Kerala Blasters 2 (Gary Hooper 14, Costa Nhamoinesu 51).

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘100th Test at Chennai very special’||Joe Root is all set to join a pantheon of 14 England cricketers who have played 100-plus Test matches, when he leads his side in the opening match of the four-Test series against India at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on February 5 (Friday). The 30-year-old from Yorkshire, who made his Test debut in Nagpur eight winters ago scoring 73 and 20 not out, and has 584 runs from six Tests against India at 53.09, spoke to The Hindu ahead of what promises to be a memorable occasion. Excerpts:   On the landmark: It's great to come full circle and be back here [in India]. The way it started on that first tour in 2012, it was a real eye-opener for me, learning to play spin, playing with some great players and strong opposition. To come back to Chennai and play my 100th Test is very special. I can’t wait.  Batting in India: You’ve got to be prepared to bat for long periods. When you get in, especially in the first innings, you've got to really make it count. That’s what we’ll be aiming to do. Hopefully, we can stay in the game for as long as possible and take every Test deep against a quality side. You've got to be patient, especially as an English player when you are used to playing mainly against seam. You've got to be accepting [of the fact that] the ball will turn and pass the bat. You're allowed to get it wrong on occasions, but you've got to stay calm and be quite clear about where you're going to score your runs. I think it's really important to be able to trust your defence and also have clarity of where you want to score your boundaries.  Wicket-taking struggles of the past: In the past we have struggled to take 20 wickets, especially away from home. But I think we've discovered a way of doing that (take 20 wickets). We've also become more consistent and we make big first innings runs. We have now gone six or seven times past the 400 mark in the last 12 or so Tests, which is a great achievement and something that we need to keep doing if we're going to seriously compete in away conditions.  On the team: We've got a very ambitious group of players who are willing to learn and want to get better all the time. We are open to new thinking and learning from other sides and players who have had success in similar conditions.   England’s 100-club  Colin Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott, David Gower, Ian Botham, Graham Gooch, Michael Atherton, Graham Thorpe, Alec Stewart, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, James Anderson and Stuart Broad||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/100th-test-at-chennai-is-very-special-root/article33712805.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||MPCA, KSCA not happy with knockout format||The Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) have expressed displeasure with the knockout format for domestic competitions, especially the way the Plate Group winner is placed.  The Hindu understands that both the associations have written letters to BCCI secretary Jay Shah after the conclusion of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy league stage, sharing their grievances. “To maintain competitiveness of knockout rounds, we have suggested that either the Plate teams should not be allowed to participate in the knockouts or the Board should do away with the Plate/ Elite system and accommodate the Plate teams along with other teams,” Rohit Pandit, MPCA chief administrative officer, told The Hindu on Sunday. Madhya Pradesh narrowly missed out on qualifying for the knockouts (on net run rate). Karnataka’s argument Karnataka, on the other hand, has stressed on the need for the Elite league teams to be ranked higher than Plate teams. “In the Mushtaq Ali knockouts draw, the Plate Group winner was placed higher whereas the two sides from Elite who qualified No. 2 from their respective groups were placed No. 7 and 8,” a KSCA official said, preferring anonymity. Karnataka, after qualifying seventh-best among Elite Group teams, ended up drawing leader Punjab in the first quarterfinal, and lost. It will be interesting to see if the BCCI pays heed to its affiliates’ suggestions while finalising the format for the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Unlike in the past, the BCCI had not shared the knockouts draw with the teams at the start of the Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The teams in the Plate Group, with the addition of 10 new teams in the last couple of years, have been far from competitive against the domestic regulars. Even after the conclusion of last year’s Ranji Trophy, some of the domestic stalwarts had pointed to the need to avoid diluting the Ranji Trophy knockouts by letting a team from the Plate Group feature in the quarterfinals.  Karnataka has stressed on the need for the Elite league teams to be ranked higher than Plate teams. Karnataka, after qualifying seventh-best among Elite Group teams, ended up drawing leader Punjab in the first quarterfinal, and lost||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mpca-ksca-not-happy-with-knockout-format/article33712856.ece
01 February 2021||Coimbatore,||Gill takes crown with a round to spare||Team JK Tyre’s star Gaurav Gill (co-driver Musa Sherif) raced to yet another title win in the FMSCI INRC Rally of Coimbatore for four wheelers at the Kethanur windmill farm here on Sunday. It was his third title win in a row this season and was enough to seal the championship crown with a round to spare. Going into the final day with a little over a minute’s lead over his nearest rival Dr. Bikku Babu (Bonny Thomas), the three-time APRC champion chose to play it wise in both the stages. Issues continue The minor issues that cut short his speed the other day chased him today as well but the experienced star kept his cool right through to emerge a clear winner. “It was very dry out there and the roads were extremely rough, but I was lucky to have some really strong JK tyres that could withstand the rocks and boulders around. “Even though we had some electrical issues that hampered our progress, we nursed our car well and managed to win,” said Gill. “It was a learning curve for us since it was our first gravel rally with this spec of the car. It is a great result for us,” he added. Bikku thrilled Bikku, the INRC 2 winner who was on MRF Tyres, was thrilled having finished second overall. “In Arunachal we were doing really well till we had a brake issue but this time we did our job to the best of our ability and it worked.” After testing his skills on the stages on Saturday, Bikku decided to go hard today and earned the applause of the crowd. “I am happy to have done well here because Coimbatore has always been my second home,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gill-takes-crown-with-a-round-to-spare/article33712858.ece
01 February 2021||Chennai,||Foakes eager to make his chance count||The ball hisses past the bat and rears like a cobra raising its hood. And you got to be quick... in fact, very fast. You need to be an artist with an incredible skillset to stand up to spinners in the sub-continent. Catches go down in a millisecond and a match changes course. It’s a job of a specialist. One of the finest wicketkeepers of our times, England’s Jack Russell rates Ben Foakes the ‘best ’keeper in the world while standing up’. India’s Wriddhiman Saha would disagree but it still is high praise for the 27-year-old Foakes. With Jos Buttler slated to fly back after the first Test, Foakes is looking at three Tests as a wicketkeeper-batsman, considering England is looking at Jonny Bairstow as a specialist batsman these days. Interesting career Foakes’ brief career with England is interesting. He started his Test journey in Galle, 2018, and scored a hundred (107) on debut. He then travelled to the West Indies in 2019 where he was less successful with the willow, and found himself in international wilderness. He still averages 41.50 in five Tests while his keeping has always been exceptional. In a chat with the media here on Sunday, Foakes spoke about the “excitement and anticipation” about playing in India. “It is an incredible place to play,” he said. “I have spent a lot of time in the sub-continent. Had success in Sri Lanka. India is a bit different,” he added.  Foakes dwelt on the intense competition for the slot of a wicketkeeper-batsman and talked about working with Buttler, his competitor, “You got to help each other out and do your best when you get your chance. Healthy competition is good.” On the challenges of keeping wickets in the sub-continent, Foakes said, “You got to stand up for long hours, concentrate for long periods, and you know that the ball will turn sharply and you got to react quickly.” And he understands the nature of the beast when it comes to selecting a wicketkeeper. “However good you are as a ’keeper, you got to contribute with the bat.” Watch Foakes behind the stumps. You will see an artist in action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/an-artist-while-standing-up-to-the-stumps/article33712803.ece
01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Dominant Tamil Nadu cruises to the title||After losing the title last year by a solitary run to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu got the job done in commanding fashion this year as it defeated Baroda by seven wickets to clinch its second Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the Motera stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Tamil Nadu finished its campaign with a clinical win, chasing down Baroda’s total of 120 with two overs to spare. The victory on Sunday was set up by left-arm spinner M. Siddharth, playing his first match this season, as he wrecked Baroda’s top-order with a four-wicket haul (4/20). Tamil Nadu’s chase was set up by opener C. Hari Nishaanth’s 35 before B. Aparajith (29 n.o.) and Dinesh Karthik (22) ensured Baroda never got back into the game. M. Shahrukh Khan then blitzed an unbeaten 18 off just seven balls, which contained two fours and a six, to finish the chase in style. Earlier, electing to bowl on a wicket that offered the spinners good help, Tamil Nadu struck early. In the second over, Aparajith removed opener Ninad Rathva, caught inside the circle on the off-side while going for a cut. At the other end, Siddharth soon had Kedar Devdhar, who had just hit two consecutive boundaries, by deceiving him in flight and having him caught at cover. Siddharth then accounted for Smit Patel, trapped leg-before with an arm ball. In the ninth over, the left-arm spinner struck twice, leaving Baroda tottering at 36 for six. Vishnu Solanki (49) and Atit Sheth (29) added 58 for the seventh wicket, but their efforts proved inadequate.  The scores: Baroda 120/9 in 20 overs (Vishnu Solanki 49, M. Siddharth 4/20) lost to Tamil Nadu 123/3 in 18 overs (C. Hari Nishaanth 35); Toss: TN.   Man-of-the-final: Siddharth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-stopping-tamil-nadu/article33712808.ece
01 February 2021||KOCHI,||Hungry to play Soham: Govind Anoop||It was Govind Anoop’s greatest day in table tennis, he had just won his maiden State men’s singles title at the Rajiv Gandhi indoor stadium here on Friday but the youngster felt a bit of emptiness. Kerala has two State table tennis associations, the new TTAK which is recognised by the National body TTFI and the nearly 70-year-old KTTA which has the Kerala State Sports Council’s recognition. Each had its State championship recently. “The winners of that association (TTAK) cannot say that they are the best in Kerala unless they beat the players from the other association. And I feel the same. I can’t say I’m better than Soham Bhattacharya who won the other championship,” said Anoop after winning the KTTA’s State title. “I‘m very hungry to play Soham.” Feeling left out There is another issue troubling the KTTA stars. While the TTAK stars are assured of playing the Senior Nationals (at Panchkula, from Feb. 14), the chances of KTTA’s champions of playing there are bleak. With the associations issue running for over two years, mostly in courts, players are now running out of patience. “I would like this to get over as soon as possible and I don’t think the players will wait much longer either,” said Anoop. “And I really think both associations should look towards which players offer the best chance for our State at the Nationals. I don’t care what it takes, I think that should be the main priority instead of all this separation and stuff. “I really don’t know about the politics or anything, all I want is to play with the best,” said the 11th standard student of Bhavan’s Girinagar who is coached by R. Rajeev at the Regional Sports Centre. Abhaya hurt G. Abhaya, the KTTA’s youth champion and women’s runner-up, is also very hurt. “Disappointment, anger....everything is there. We work hard, trained even during COVID days, but there are no rewards. Now after winning the Youth title and women’s silver, I cannot play the Nationals. It’s very unfair,” said the 18-year-old from Alappuzha. “I think if there is a players’ union, it will be good. The sooner we have it, the better.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hungry-to-play-soham-govind-anoop/article33713169.ece
01 February 2021||Barcelona,||Messi — the most expensive athlete||Lionel Messi’s most recent contract with Barcelona is worth up to €555 million over four seasons, the El Mundo newspaper reported on Sunday. The Spanish daily said it had access to the document Messi signed with the Catalan club in 2017, which included fixed incomes and variables that could reach nearly €138 million each season. The newspaper said it is the most expensive contract ever signed by an athlete. Messi would have to pay about half of that amount in taxes in Spain. The report said the 33-year-old player has already secured more than €510 million of the total contract. The newspaper also details how Messi rewarded the club over the years, having helped it win more than 30 titles. Messi has been with Barcelona for nearly two decades but asked to leave at the end of last season after saying he wasn’t happy with the direction the club was headed. He had his request denied but will be able to leave for free when this season ends.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-the-most-expensive-athlete/article33712848.ece

A well-rested Davis, who sat out the Lakers’ loss to the Pistons in Detroit on Thursday with a bruised thigh, added 14 rebounds for the reigning NBA champions. LeBron James finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Jayson Tatum scored 30 points and pulled down nine rebounds for the Celtics and Jaylen Brown added 28 points. It came down to the buzzer in Chicago, where Portland’s Damian Lillard drained a three-pointer as time expired to give the Trail Blazers a 123-122 victory over the Bulls. Lillard finished with 44 points on eight three-pointers.

01 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Spinners won it for us: Vasu||Fourteen years after winning the inaugural Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (2006-07), Tamil Nadu finished on top again with a superb performance in the final against Baroda. Speaking to The Hindu on Sunday, coach D. Vasu said: “It has been a long journey. For us, today was just another match we had to win and we produced a clinical performance. It was thanks to the preparation that we had put in since November and I have to thank the association for giving us whatever we needed.” About Siddharth, Vasu said: “We knew the wicket was going to turn and that’s why we went with four spinners. There was help from the pitch and he did really well, bowling good lines. Spin is our strength and the likes of Sai Kishore, M. Ashwin and Aparajith have all delivered. I would say the spinners won us this tournament,” said Vasu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/spinners-won-it-for-us-vasu/article33712820.ece
01 February 2021||Chennai,||Fans’ entry a ‘good possibility’ for second Test||The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) will meet on Monday to decide on letting in crowds and media for the first two Tests here following an announcement by the State Government allowing 50% of the stadium to be filled by spectators for all sporting events.  The Hindu learnt from TNCA sources that while it would be very hard to allow crowds for the first Test, beginning February 5, there was a “good possibility” of the spectators being allowed for the second Test. “We will discuss among ourselves and then hold talks with the BCCI. We are trying very hard to allow media in for the first two Tests. They need not get central accreditation. We can give them accreditation,” the source said. Social distancing The TNCA was confident that it could maintain adequate social distancing between spectators for the second Test. “It is almost impossible to allow crowds for the first Test since there is very little time now to make the preparations. But we will certainly try to get the crowds in for the second Test,” the source said. There is a three-day gap between the end of the first Test and the beginning of the second. “Actually, we don’t have enough time and it will be a tight squeeze to make the arrangements in the stands for the second Test since we can’t go in there during the first Test.” Another stakeholder The ECB is another stakeholder and it had requested for “no crowd”, ahead of the series. Following a request that is likely to come from the TNCA, the BCCI will hold discussions with the ECB. This appears to be a fast-changing situation.  It is almost impossible to allow crowds for the first Test since there is very little time now to make the preparations.

Moeen also felt the batting maestro will be extra motivated to fire after missing his team’s incredible series win in Australia. Kohli is back as captain for the four-match series against England beginning here on February 5. “How do we get him out? “He’s obviously an amazing player, world-class, he’s very motivated to do well and I’m sure he’ll be even more motivated after they did well in Australia and he had to leave for the birth of his child,” Moeen told reporters during a video conference. “I don’t know how we’re going to get him out because I don’t think he has any sort of weakness but we have a good bowling attack, some pace in the line-up. “He’s a great guy and a good friend of mine — we don’t talk too much about cricket. We do a little bit but not too much.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dont-know-how-were-going-to-get-kohli-out/article33712806.ece

01 February 2021||MELBOURNE,||Top stars keen to participate in Olympics||Japanese sensation Naomi Osaka, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal said on Sunday that they remain keen to compete in the delayed Tokyo Olympics, and would be guided by what the health experts tell them. Three-time Grand Slam champion Osaka admitted being worried by a recent poll that found 80% of the Japanese public were opposed to Tokyo hosting the event this year because of the pandemic. “My concern would be the general safety of everyone else because you’re opening the country,” Osaka said. The 23-year-old has been the poster girl of the 2020 Olympics and still hopes to represent Japan at her home Games. “I missed out on the last one. Playing in Tokyo would be very special to me.” World No. 2 Rafael Nadal echoed Osaka’s sentiments and hoped to play, but said health experts should have the final say. “What we have to do is just follow the instructions of what the people who really have the right knowledge of all this stuff give to us,” he told reporters on Sunday. World No. 1 Djokovic has played in three Olympics, winning a bronze at the 2008 Beijing Games. He too is keen to be in Tokyo. “I am personally planning to go for the Olympic Games. I’m really hoping that the Olympics will happen,” he said. “It’s going to be a lot of people obviously. Far more than a tennis tournament. It’s obviously not up to me to talk about organisation or what can be done, should be done, what will be done.”  I am personally planning to go for the Olympics. I’m really hoping that they will happen— Djokovic   I missed out on the last one. Playing in Tokyo would be very special to me— Osaka   For me, the Olympic Games is very important— Kvitova||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/top-stars-keen-to-participate-in-olympics/article33712861.ece

01 February 2021||February 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Siva’s marvellous deeds||There are eight temples in Tamil Nadu, each of which is associated with a marvellous deed of Lord Siva, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse. Thirukkadaiyur is the place where Siva destroyed Yama, to save the young devotee Markandeya. Thirukkandiyur is where He vanquished Brahma’s pride. In Thirukkoilur, Andakasura was killed. Thiruvadhigai is associated with the burning of the cities ruled by three demons, as a result of which, Siva came to be known as Tripurantaka. Thiruppariyalur is where Daksha was punished for his arrogance. Thiruvirkudi is where Jalandarasura was killed. In Thiruvazhuvoor, Siva killed the demon who had taken the form of an elephant. This earned for Him the name Gajasamharamurthy. Thirukurukkai is the place where Kama, the god of love, was burnt, when he tried to disturb Siva’s penance. Vinayaka has a special significance in Thirukkadaiyur. When the ocean was churned and nectar emerged, the asuras and devas fought over who should have the nectar. Even as the fight was going on, Vinayaka, in accordance with instructions from His mother, took the pot of nectar, and brought it to Thirukkadaiyur. In Tamil, kalavu means to steal, and because Vinayaka clandestinely took the nectar during the fight, He is called Kallavaaranapillaiyar, in this temple. Brahma did penance in Thirukkadaiyur, which is about thirteen miles from the town of Mayiladuturai. Kungiliklaya Nayanar and Kaari Nayanar are two of the 63 Saivite saints associated with this temple. In Thirukkadaiyur lived Amritalinga Iyer. In the 18th century, a son was born to him. The child was named Subramanian, and grew up to be deeply devoted to Goddess Abirami of Thirukkadaiyur temple, and he composed Abirami Andadi, in praise of the Goddess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/sivas-marvellous-deeds/article33712810.ece

01 February 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC denies permission to father of sexual assault victim to settle dispute||The father of a sexual assault victim cannot be permitted to settle the dispute with the accused in the case, the Delhi High Court has ruled, noting that permitting such offences to be compromised and quashing FIRs will not secure the interest of justice. Justice Subramonium Prasad made the remarks while dismissing plea of a man seeking to quash an FIR registered at Patel Nagar police station here against him for sodomising a seven-year-old boy as he had come to a compromise with the father of the victim. The boy’s father, in his police complaint, had stated that on November 20, 2019, his son told him that after he left for work, the accused, who stays in the same building, had come and sodomised him. After investigation, the police said there was enough material to proceed against the accused for offences under IPC Section 377 IPC and Section 4 of the POCSO Act. The accused moved the High Court, seeking to quash the FIR primarily on the ground that “the parties have decided to amicably put an end to the disputes”. The boy’s father also filed an affidavit before the High Court, stating that all the disputes had been settled between him and the accused and that he had no objection if the FIR was quashed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-hc-denies-permission-to-father-of-sexual-assault-victim-to-settle-dispute/article33713006.ece
