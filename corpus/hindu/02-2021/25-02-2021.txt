25 February 2021||New Delhi,||Vaccines for seniors and 45-plus with comorbidities from March||People above 60 years of age and those above 45 with comorbidities would be given COVID-19 vaccines from March 1, the Union government announced on Wednesday. Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said that under the second phase of vaccination, shots would be given for free at 10,000 government-run medical facilities and for a charge at 20,000 private hospitals. Charges for vaccination at private hospitals would be confirmed in a few days. Mr. Javadekar was addressing mediapersons after a Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Health Ministry is in discussion with manufacturers and hospitals to determine the cost of vaccination to be made available in private sector,” Mr. Javadekar said. The Centre would buy doses and send them to all the States for the government medical facilities, he said. Around 27 crore people were expected to be covered in the second phase. Of this, around 10 crore people are over 60, Mr. Javadekar said. A senior health official told The Hindu that with the expansion of the vaccination coverage, the government would bring in sub-groups to ensure that the most vulnerable were covered first. Detailed listing of the comorbidities and pre-vaccination requirements would be issued and strict surveillance and monitoring of those vaccinated would be done as part of the protocol, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccines-for-seniors-and-45-plus-with-comorbidities-from-march/article33928231.ece

On February 22, the government had invalidated the Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation’s (KSINC) Rs. 2,900-crore prefatory agreement with the same company to build and operate a deep-sea trawling fleet. The controversial accords were part of a concept paper signed by the KSINC and KSIDC with EMCC International at the State government-sponsored global investors meet ASCEND in Kochi last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-scraps-ksidcs-mou-with-emcc/article33928404.ece
25 February 2021||Kolkata,||Want to procure vaccines on priority: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking rapid supply of vaccines to the poll-bound State. “We would request you to kindly take up the matter with appropriate authorities so that the State government is able to purchase the vaccines from designated point(s) on priority because the West Bengal government wants to provide vaccination free of cost to all,” Ms. Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister. The letter from the Chief Minister comes on the day the Centre has announced that people above 60 years of age and those over 45 with co-morbidities will be given COVID-19 vaccination from March 1. In the letter, Ms. Banerjee emphasised that “West Bengal being an election-going State, we are required to reach out practically to every government and parastatal employee on an urgent basis to make the election safe.” She also added that “the worrying point is that, in the ensuing elections, the people in general will be forced to go to the polling stations without any vaccination coverage”. The development triggered strong reactions from political parties in Opposition who said that there should not be any politics over vaccination. CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said that vaccination is a matter concerning health and well-being of people and of more important than electioneering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/want-to-procure-vaccines-on-priority-mamata/article33928449.ece
25 February 2021||Pune,||Minister linked to woman’s death meets Uddhav||Maharashtra Forest Minister and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod, under fire from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for his alleged connection with the death of a 23-year-old woman from the nomadic banjara community in Pune, attended the State cabinet meeting on Wednesday in Mumbai. Later in the evening Mr. Rathod met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray at his official residence Varsha. He however, refused to speak with reporters on his way out. Sources said Mr. Rathod was closeted in an hour-long meeting with Mr. Thackeray and other Sena ministers. Senior Nationalist Congress Party leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Energy Minister Dr. Nitin Raut (Congress) are reported to have joined in later. Speaking after the Cabinet meeting, Minority Development, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Minister Nawab Malik said, “He [Mr. Rathod] was present at the meeting. He appeared after many days. But there was no discussion on his resignation as the Cabinet deliberated over Covid-19 pandemic.” Meanwhile, a show of strength on Tuesday by Mr. Rathod at the Poharadevi shrine in Washim district in the Vidarbha region — attended by thousands of members of the banjara community — has led to a fresh bout of criticism from the Opposition and senior Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders. Senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said it was “unfortunate”. NCP chief Sharad Pawar too is reportedly displeased over Mr. Rathod’s actions. Mr. Malik said CM had ordered an inquiry into the gathering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/minister-linked-to-womans-death-meets-uddhav/article33928989.ece
25 February 2021||Kalaburagi,||GESCOM sells power ‘cheap’ to Arunachal||Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (GESCOM) sold 193.88 million units (MU) of power to Arunachal Pradesh government through Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX) at just Rs. 2.47 a unit, against the average purchase cost of Rs. 4.99 a init. This, activists say, has added to the burden of the company which is already facing financial problems. As per its submission to Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) for revision of power tariff for 2021-22, the GESCOM had purchased 8483.22 MUs of power paying Rs. 4,232.63 crore that translated into at Rs. 4.99 a Unit. However, it sold 193.88 MUs of power at just Rs. 2.47 to monetise Rs. 48.01 crore. The power sector experts blame the unfair Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that GESCOM entered into with the power generators for the procurement of excess energy at higher costs. “The PPAs are made in such a way that the buyer has to purchase a certain amount of energy mandatorily. The buyer has to pay the entire fixed amount even though he does not procure the complete amount of energy agreed upon for any reason such as fallen demand. This will result in the procurement of excess energy. Instead of selling it for deflated prices outside, the GESCOM could have sold it at cheaper prices to local consumers that use Extra High Tension (EHT) and High Tension (HT) connections for industrial production and it would have been beneficial to both GESCOM and industries,” said Deepak G Gala, President of Hyderabad Karnataka Environment Awareness and Protection Organisation,. Rahul Tukaram Pandve, Managing Director of GESCOM, said that PPAs were made for a longer periods the ESCOMs could not come out of them. “We have to purchase and sell the excess energy somewhere, often at lesser than purchase price. The demand from local industries that use EHT and HT connections is not growing. Presently, the power consumption in peak hours is charged at a higher price, Rs. 1 more than the normal charge. We are expecting the KERC to remove this clause so as to encourage the local consumption,” Mr. Pandve told The Hindu .  In another move, GESCOM, complying with the decision taken in the meeting of top officials chaired by Chief Secretary, has waived the interest amount of Rs. 242.01 crore on the dues payable to it by local civic bodies for the energy used for streetlights and water supply between 2015 and 2018. Mr. Gala argued that it is “illegal” to waive the interest on dues. This is how the government is destroying the public sector units, he argued, urging KERC not to allow this to happen. Responding to this, Mr. Pandve said, “We have, however, showed the waived amount as loss.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gescom-sells-power-cheap-to-arunachal/article33928352.ece
25 February 2021||MYSURU,||Rukmini Made Gowda is Mysuru Mayor||Rukmini Made Gowda of the Janata Dal (S) was on Wednesday elected Mayor and Anwar Baig of the Congress Deputy Mayor. The mayoral polls saw the continuation of the Congress-JD (S) alliance in the hung Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) council, ironically even after the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy claimed that the partnership had collapsed owing to Congress leader Siddaramaiah’s attitude towards the JD (S). The BJP, which had sought to align with the JD (S), failed in its efforts to have the party’s first Mayor in Mysuru as its nominee Sunanda Palanetra polled 26 votes as against 43 by Ms. Made Gowda. The new Mayor represents Ward No. 36. Mr. Baig, who represents Ward No. 10, defeated BJP’s S. Satvik. The Mayor’s post was reserved for a woman from the general category while the Deputy Mayor’s was set aside for a candidate from the general category. Regional Commissioner, Mysuru, G.C. Prakash, who conducted the elections along with MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag, declared Ms. Made Gowda the 23rd Mayor of Mysuru. Earlier in the day, Mr. Kumaraswamy declared that the JD (S) was maintaining equidistance from both the Congress and BJP after which candidates from all the three parties fielded their candidates. While the Congress fielded Shanthakumari as its mayoral candidate, the JD (S) and BJP nominated Ms. Made Gowda and Ms. Palanetra respectively. But during the polling, the Congress members surprisingly chose against raising their hands in favour of Ms. Shanthakumari and instead supported the JD (S) candidate. The JD (S) returned the favour to the Congress during the elections to the post of Deputy Mayor. Speaking to reporters later, former Minister and Congress MLA Tanveer Sait said the Congress-JD (S) alliance struck after the 2018 MCC polls would continue for the remainder of the council’s term. The Congress would have a Mayor for two years and JD (S) for three years. Though the post of Mayor was to come to Congress this time, Mr. Sait said the party would claim it next year. To a question, he said the party decided to back the JD (S) candidate for the post of Mayor on Wednesday in view of “changed circumstances” and “changed requirements”. He said that a decision on the Congress’ strategy in the mayoral polls had been taken at the local level. In the hung MCC council, the Congress has 19 members and the JD (S) 18; the BJP has 22 members. One BSP and five Independents make up the rest of the 65-member MCC council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rukmini-made-gowda-is-mysuru-mayor/article33928356.ece
25 February 2021||Bengaluru,||State conveys concerns on Cauvery to Centre||Karnataka’s concern about Tamil Nadu’s plans to utilise excess water in the Cauvery basin was conveyed to the Union Minister for Water Resources Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Wednesday. Karnataka’s Minister for Major and Medium Irrigation Ramesh Jharkiholi met the Union Minister in Delhi to discuss the water projects of the State, and he raised the issue during the meeting. The Minister orally expressed his concern and spoke about the State’s stand on the utilisation of the excess water in the Cauvery basin, sources in the Minister’s office said. “No memorandum has been given to the Centre yet.” Taking the State government largely by surprise, the T.N. government last week announced the laying of foundation stone for the Cauvery–Vellaru–Vaigai–Gundar Link scheme that seeks to utilise the excess water in the Cauvery basin and transfer it to southern parts of the State. The scheme is being funded by the Centre. While a high-level meeting involving technical and legal experts chaired by the Minister was held in Delhi on Saturday, a high- level meeting in which the leaders of the Opposition are expected to participate will be convened. The Minister’s office said the high-level meeting would be convened very shortly during which the response of the State to the Tamil Nadu’s decision to start the project would be formulated. Upper Bhadra Meanwhile, sources said the modalities of funding the Upper Bhadra project, which received national status recently, was discussed during the meeting. “It has been broadly agreed that the project will be implemented with 90% funding from the Centre.” The about two-decade-old project, now estimated to cost about Rs. 21,500 crore, was the first water project of the State to receive national status. The project has been conceived to irrigate about 2.25 lakh hectares across Central Karnataka districts of Chitradurga, Davangere, Tumakuru, and dry regions of Chikkamagalur. Agricultural land will be irrigated through drip irrigation under the project. Among others, Mr. Jharkiholi also discussed the implementation of projects in Mahadayi, Krishna, and Cauvery basins, a statement from the Minister’s office said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-conveys-concerns-on-cauvery-to-centre/article33928353.ece

The decision came days after the Congress-led government in the Union Territory lost power during a vote of confidence. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the decision was taken as no party came forward to stake claim to form the government following the resignation of Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy. Subsequently, Lieutenant-Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan recommended President’s Rule, he said. “After the President’s assent, the Assembly will get dissolved... Further steps for administrative work will be taken soon,” he said. He said the model code of conduct was expected to come into effect soon after the Election Commission announces the dates for elections there, along with four States. “President’s rule was forced on the people of the UT by removing a government elected as per the rules and provisions in our Constitution,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/puducherry-cabinet-gives-nod-for-presidents-rule/article33928232.ece

25 February 2021||CHENNAI,||T.N. steps up vigil on borders||Tamil Nadu has stepped up vigil as COVID-19 cases are on the rise in some parts of the country, including Maharashtra and Kerala. While fever surveillance is being strengthened in the border areas, Chennai, Coimbatore and Chengalpattu will be put on alert for clusters. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said officials had been told to set up or reinforce checkpoints along the border with Kerala (about 26), Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to check for fever among those entering Tamil Nadu. The Corporations should conduct fever screening at railway stations and bus terminals, while mobile screening could be organised at places where people gather, he added. Chennai, Coimbatore and Chengalpattu must be on alert for clusters. Tirunelveli, which witnessed an inflow of people from Mumbai, should also be on alert, Dr. Radhakrishnan said. If there are more than three cases in an area, officials should ensure effective containment zone activity. He told officials that strict action to ensure the use of mask was missing. He cautioned them against letting down guard, absence of monitoring of mask-wearing and reducing the focus on containment measures. The official pointed out that mandatory masking was less than 10% at most public places. Maharashtra was already in the midst of a new wave, and Tamil Nadu, too, for the last 15 days was having localised clusters, in which families and individuals who had attended functions were testing positive for the infection. The number has not risen dramatically in Tamil Nadu so far. However, he said, “We should not be complacent. Contact-tracing, containment, early initiation of treatment and follow-up of all protocols and Standard Operating Procedures should be reviewed regularly.” On the Centre deputing a multi-disciplinary team to Tamil Nadu, besides a few other States, he said there were no specific reason. “Our numbers are in the range of 450 to 500 and case positivity is about 1%. Other States have a spurt and increase in positivity but some also had lesser numbers. They also look at overall absolute numbers.” As per data, on February 23, Maharashtra recorded a positivity rate of 9.2%, while Kerala had 5.8%. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Gujarat had a positivity rate of 1% to 1.7%, while Tamil Nadu’s positivity rate stood at 0.9%.

Simultaneously, it reprieved those named as accused in trivial offences perpetrated during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. The Home Department would work out the modalities. In the Sabarimala issue, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) seemed to have pressed the reset button on a topic that threatened to mar its prospects in the imminent Assembly elections. The Congress and the BJP had made Sabarimala a significant talking point in the Lok Sabha election campaign and looked to do so in the Assembly elections. The government’s handling of Sabarimala had drawn a sharp rebuke from respondents in a widely published pre-election poll. NSS demand Furthermore, the LDF appeared to have bowed to the Nair Service Society’s pressure (NSS) to withdraw cases against those who had participated peacefully in prayer meetings, a sizeable number of them women. NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair welcomed the decision. However, he said the differences between the NSS and the government on the Sabarimala issue remained. Devaswom Board Minister Kadakampally Surendran said those involved in Sabarimala-issue related grave cases would still face prosecution. The State had witnessed attacks on the police and widespread destruction of public property during the tumultuous protests. The LDF had signalled a willingness to recalibrate the Sabarimala policy in January. It had guaranteed that a broad consensus among stakeholders would form any future decision on Sabarimala. Opposition stance Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said wisdom had dawned belatedly on the government. Indian Union Muslim League State general secretary K.P.A.Majeed said the decisions were a left-handed compliment for the United Democratic Front. BJP State president K. Surendran said the government had wrongly conflated the Sabarimala and CAA issues. Sabarimala was a matter of faith. The CAA was a political and legal matter. He demanded that the government withdraw all cases linked to the Sabarimala agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-to-drop-non-serious-sabarimala-cases/article33928177.ece
25 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Tikait plans rally, Tomar offers talks||Faced with farm union leader Rakesh Tikait’s threat of a larger tractor rally, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has reiterated that the Centre is ready to hold talks with the protesting farm unions if they respond to its offer to suspend three contentious farm reform laws for an 18-month period. Thousands of protesting farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been camped at Delhi’s borders for almost three months, demanding repeal of the farm laws. Talks with the government broke down on January 22. During a tractor rally on January 26, a section of the farmers broke off from the rally route and engaged in violent clashes with the police. On Tuesday, speaking at a mahapanchayat in Sikar district of Rajasthan, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) leader warned that a call would be given to gherao Parliament with 40 lakh tractors if the laws were not repealed. Asked about this threat on Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government was committed to the welfare of the farmers and was working to double their income. “The government has been holding discussions with farmers in a sensitive and sympathetic way. Even now, whenever they give their response [to the proposal], the government is always ready to hold talks,” he said on the sidelines of an event to mark the second anniversary of PM KISAN income support scheme. Mr. Tomar said the Centre had transferred Rs. 1.15 lakh crore to more than 10.75 crore farmers since the scheme began. However, the initial target for beneficiaries under the scheme was 14.5 crore. The Minister urged the State governments to ensure that all eligible beneficiaries were registered, as many had been complaining that they were not receiving the benefit. Farm unions observed Daman Pratirodh Divas, or Anti-Repression Day, on Wednesday. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha wrote to the President calling for “the unconditional release of innocent farmers imprisoned during the farmers’ agitation and the dismissal of false cases”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tikait-plans-rally-tomar-offers-talks/article33928195.ece
25 February 2021||New Delhi,||Central teams for 9 States, J&K following surge in case count||The Union government has warned against any laxity in implementing the stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, especially in view of the new mutant strains of the virus, and deputed multi-disciplinary teams to Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for supporting them for targeted response and management. These States and Union Territories have been registering a surge in daily new cases. In a release issued on Wednesday, the Union Health Ministry said the three-member multi-disciplinary teams would be headed by its joint secretary-level officers. The teams would work closely with the States and Union Territory administration and ascertain the reasons for the surge in the number of cases. They would also coordinate with the State health authorities for requisite measures to break the chain of transmission. The States and the Union Territory have been advised to have regular critical reviews of the emerging situation with district officials concerned to ensure that gains made so far in COVID-19 management were not lost, the Ministry stated. The Centre has also written to Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and J&K. The Union Health Secretary has separately requested the Chief Secretaries of the nine States and J&K to provide time to the high-level teams to debrief the respective Chief Secretaries. “The Health Ministry has been regularly engaging with States and UTs that have been exhibiting either a sudden surge in COVID-19 cases, high case load or reporting a higher mortality in some districts. The teams interact with the field authorities to get a first-hand understanding of the challenges and issues being faced by them,” the Ministry said. 13,742 new cases The country reported 13,742 new COVID-19 cases and registered 14,037 recoveries in the last 24 hours. There was a net decline of 399 cases in the total active case load. According to data from the Ministry, 86.15% of the daily new cases are from six States, and Maharashtra continues to report the highest at 6,218, followed by Kerala at 4,034. Tamil Nadu reported 442 cases. There were 104 deaths in the last 24 hours, with five States accounting for 81.73% of them.

A senior police officer said they were moving ahead with the evidence they had recovered till date. They had not given a clean chit to anyone in the case. “We have procured data in the form of texts, pictures and videos from the electronic devices seized from the possession of Disha, Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk. And going through voluminous data is not an easy task as it will take time. A team of investigating officers is working round the clock to get specific details from the data,” the officer added. He said they were waiting for the reply from WhatsApp, Zoom, Google and other agencies to connect the dots in the case. If they get adequate evidence, then they might move for bail cancellation of Ms. Ravi. And if required, Ms. Jacob and Mr. Muluk would be again called for questioning. The evidence was in digital form and people involved in the toolkit case were making all possible efforts to tamper with or delete their digital footprints. Policemen along with cyber experts were working to preserve the data, said the officer. On Thursday, the police would file their response on the anticipatory bail application moved by Mr. Muluk. He had got transit bail from the Bombay High Court on February 16 for 10 days.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Propose bilateral green deal to U.S.’||Arunabha Ghosh , founder-CEO, Council on Energy Environment and Water (CEEW), says India needs to proactively negotiate a bilateral climate agreement with the U.S. He suggests that hill States such as Uttarakhand be given a concrete plan to transition from reliance on large hydropower plants for energy. Edited excerpts.  The U.S. has re-entered the Paris Climate agreement. What does this mean for India? This is an opportunity for India to be proactive and propose a bilateral deal, where the U.S. and India can work more closely on climate change. It should be similar to the 2014 deal involving U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The focus should be on what can be achieved in the near-term. There will be pressure on India to give a plan on when it will achieve Net Zero (when a country’s carbon dioxide emissions are balanced by the amount locked back in). However, we must have an agreement on say the use of hydrogen, and form a Green Hydrogen Alliance. The U.S. will predictably try to nudge, cajole other countries into raising ambition (in the form of greater emission targets, for example) but India shouldn’t be swayed by emotion. India can use this opportunity to ask the U.S. to raise ambition, given that it has been out of the agreement for four years. We can ask for concrete targets, finance, technology. Do you expect the upcoming United Nations Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland to be a significant one in terms of agreements? Given the expectations, I think it will be a very significant event though probably not as much as the conference in Paris (in 2015). The reason for its importance is because it’s coming in a year after the pandemic began. It will reveal if the world’s recovery has been a green one and [if] we are building a world that is better. COP26 will likely be about the mechanisms, especially financial ones, to operationalise plans. Hydro power is considered part of the renewable energy mix. However, in light of the disaster in Uttarakhand, questions are being raised on the role of dams. What’s the future for hydropower? It was only two years ago that large hydropower projects (above 25 MW) started to be considered as renewable energy. I think we should be going back to the earlier definition where only the smaller hydropower plants were considered renewable energy. In future, we have to think if hydropower can compete with solar-plus-storage and it’s very much possible that the latter will be cheaper than a new hydropower plant. On the other hand, even smaller hydropower plants are in fragile ecosystems and will still be a challenge. We see the per-unit cost of solar power falling. However, are we anywhere close to an inflection point — and if not, why not — of solar power becoming a much bigger component of our energy mix? I don’t think we are anywhere near such a point. There are three additional drivers: financial, technological and new markets. We can still shave off a few paise from improving financial contracts and the implementing of them. The solar rooftop market is relatively untapped. There are also solar irrigation pumps, urban microgrids, etc. These are niche markets not being exploited at all. We must be able to offer our market as a test bed for new batteries and storage technologies, like we are doing with vaccines. We’ve developed one vaccine here but we are the factory for the other vaccine, and that makes us relevant to the global market. So could we be the factory for 5-6 battery technologies?  (Full interview on   bit.ly/Arunabha)   Even smaller hydropower plants are in fragile ecosystems and will be a challenge||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/propose-bilateral-green-deal-to-us/article33928203.ece
25 February 2021||New Delhi,||Winter pollution on the rise: CSE||The levels of PM 2.5, the most threatening of particulate matter, worsened in 43 of 99 cities whose winter air in 2020 and 2019 was compared by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a non-governmental research organisation. Only 19 registered “substantial improvement” — one of these was Chennai. The rest of the cities did not experience significant change. In the aftermath of the lockdown, several cities reported improved pollution levels but by winter, when the restrictions were significantly eased, pollution levels had clawed back to pre-COVID-19 levels, the CSE notes, underlining the significant contribution of local and regional factors to a city’s pollution levels. The cities with the worst pollution spikes in 2020 over 2019 include Gurugram, Lucknow, Jaipur, Visakhapatnam, Agra, Navi Mumbai, and Jodhpur. Kolkata is the only mega city in this group. In 37 cities that are otherwise showing stable or declining seasonal averages, their peak pollution levels have risen significantly during winter. These include Aurangabad, Indore, Nashik, Jabalpur, Rupnagar, Bhopal, Dewas, Kochi, and Kozhikode. On the other hand, in North India, other cities, including Delhi, have experienced the reverse — that is, an increase in the seasonal average but decline in the seasonal peak. During winter, cool and calm weather traps and spikes daily pollution, particularly in north Indian cities located in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. This year, the average level of PM2.5 during the summer and monsoon months was considerably lower than the previous year due to the summer lockdown. However, the winter PM2.5 concentration has risen from the 2019 winter figures in cities across regions. Local factors “This bouncing back of pollution post-lockdown unmasks the high impacts of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker regional reforms to curb pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants and waste burning to curb the winter pollution and also sustain annual improvement at a regional scale with speed,” Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE’s executive director in charge of research and advocacy, said in a statement. When ranked from the most to the least polluted cities, 23 of the most polluted cities are from north India. While Mysuru is the least polluted, followed by Satna in Madhya Pradesh and Kochi in Kerala, Ghaziabad is the most polluted city in the northern belt. The study emphasises it was the smaller and upcoming cities that were emerging as pollution hotspots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/winter-pollution-on-the-rise-cse/article33928213.ece
25 February 2021||KOLLAM,||After sea sortie, Rahul all praise for fisherfolk||An early morning sea sortie fighting all elements and returning to the shore with hardly any catch. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was all praise for the fishers and their hard work after his maiden fishing trip on Wednesday morning. He ventured into the sea in a fishing boat to get a first-hand experience of their life. Addressing the fishers at Thangassery after the two-and-a-half-hour trip to the sea, he expressed his admiration for the fisherfolk and their resilience. Hard and risky “Over the years, I have constantly been told how difficult it is to be a fisher in India. From the moment the boat left the shore to the moment we came back, every single force was trying to fight my brothers. They take the entire risk, they put their entire labour, they fight the sea, and somebody else gets the profit,” he said. He added that the fishers who accompanied him did not want their children to take up fishing because “it’s too hard and risky”. Single squid Pointing out that they had to come back with a single squid after the two-hour trip, Mr. Gandhi said the whole investment put into that trip had zero return. “In my mind, I was expecting the net to be full of fish and then it came back empty. The fishers told me that they won’t get the same price if they came one hour late and they also have no insurance,” he said. At the sea, the fishers cooked some fish for the leader and he said: “For the first time, I realised the difficulty in getting the fish on our plate.” Adding that he wants to work with fishers to make their life easier, he said: “I might not be able to resolve all your problems, but I will stand with you.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-sea-sortie-rahul-all-praise-for-fisherfolk/article33928171.ece
25 February 2021||New Delhi,||SC denies plea for extra attempt by UPSC aspirants||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) aspirants, whose last attempt to crack the civil services exam was marred by COVID-19, for another chance in 2021. The court said every candidate who took the exam last year suffered “one way or the other”. The petitioners had argued about the “overwhelming” impact of coronavirus in the run-up to the civil services preliminary exam held on October 4, 2020. They said their access to study resources had shrunk with the closure of libraries and coaching centres during the lockdown. Some of them had fallen sick while others had cared for the sick during the pandemic months, leaving little or no time for study. “What is being claimed and prayed for under the guise of COVID-19 pandemic is nothing but a lame excuse in taking additional attempt to participate in the Civil Service Examination 2021,” a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar said in the judgment. ‘Cascading effect’ Justice Ajay Rastogi, who authored the 40-page verdict for the Bench also comprising Justice Indu Malhotra, said any “indulgence” shown to a few would be against the scheme of the Civil Services Examination (CSE) Rules of 2020 and trigger a “cascading effect” on other public exams. “If this court shows indulgence to a few who had participated in the 2020 exam, it will set down a precedent and also have cascading effect on examinations in other streams, for which, we are dissuaded to exercise plenary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution,” Justice Rastogi noted. The aspirants had argued that extra chances were given to candidates in 2011 and 2015 when the syllabus was changed. They said, if so, it was their “legitimate expectation” that the government would understand their travails during a pandemic and give them another opportunity in 2021. But the court refused to accept the contention. Justice Rastogi reasoned that past relaxations, which were policy decisions done on the basis of the peculiar facts and circumstances of those times, cannot be made the basis and foundation for demanding an additional attempt as a “matter of right”. Besides the candidates had had enough time to prepare. The first notification for the CSE 2020 was published on February 12 last year. The original date of the exam was May 31. It was deferred due to the pandemic. On June 5, the authorities decided to conduct the exam on October 4. Thus, the candidates got an additional five months, till October, to prepare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-denies-plea-for-extra-attempt-by-upsc-aspirants/article33928216.ece

25 February 2021||New Delhi,||SFJ case: 16 come under NIA scrutiny||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought details of the social media accounts, Aadhaar numbers and bank account details of persons who were recently examined by the agency in connection with the ongoing farmers’ agitation. The NIA has so far examined 16 persons in connection with a case registered in December 2020 against Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a foreign-based group banned by the Union Home Ministry in 2019 for advocating secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities in India. While the government has denied that the questioning was related to the ongoing farmers’ agitation, all those who received NIA notices were either associated or had participated in the ongoing protests. Ranjit Singh, 30, of Damdami Taksal, Amritsar, said he was examined by NIA for nine hours on January 21. “The NIA officer asked why I was participating in the farmers’ protest if I did not own or cultivate any land. He took down the details of my social media accounts and bank account. They were cordial to me for eight hours, but in the end said that I have been brainwashed by Khalistani leaders and was too young to be involved in all this,” he said. Mr. Singh said he was a promoter of the Sikh religion and runs a magazine that receives donations from friends in a foreign country. “The bank details show that I have not received more than Rs. 4 lakh from any foreign account in the past eight years. The NIA officers wanted to know if there was a bigger amount that I had received. I told them of the Rs. 1.5 lakh I received, we purchased gloves and books for Rs. 1.30 lakh that we distributed at the Singhu and Tikri border [sites of farmer protests], Rs. 12,000 was spent on petrol for my two vehicles and the remaining Rs. 8,000 is with me. I showed them the bills,” he said. The NIA on January 15 summoned 40 persons to be examined by the agency as “witness”. Only 16 appeared for examination in the end of January. No further questioning has been done, said an NIA official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/16-held-in-sfj-related-case-under-scrutiny/article33928201.ece
25 February 2021||New Delhi,||Disengagement a win-win situation, says Army chief||The Chief of the Army Staff, General Manoj Naravane, on Wednesday said the disengagement in Pangong Tso (lake) was a ‘win-win’ situation for both India and China and it was still a long way toward de-escalation. China has been in the habit of making small incremental moves like in the South China Sea that were not challenged but the Ladakh stand-off has shown that this strategy will not work with India and “every move will be met resolutely”, he said at a webinar organised by Vivekananda International Foundation. “China has been in the habit of creeping forward and making very small incremental changes, where each change by itself was not very big or worthy of a very strong reaction. Because of these small incremental moves which were never contested it has been able to achieve its aims without firing a shot or without any loss of life. What has happened in the South China Sea is a very glaring example of that,” Gen. Naravane said. “More than anything else, what we have achieved is to show that this strategy will not work with us and every move will be met resolutely.” Pending issues On the first phase of disengagement completed at Pangong Tso, he stated that it was a good outcome of the 10 rounds of military talks. However, there were pending issues in eastern Ladakh and other parts along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including Depsang Plains, he pointed out. “End of the day, we have achieved a lot. We still have a long way to go. We now have to move on to the stage of de-escalation. After that de-induction of troops, which went to the higher reaches,” he observed. Gen. Naravane asserted that there was trust deficit with China. “We will be wary and cautious and closely watch the moves that happen on either side of the LAC.” To a question if India had more tactical leverages such as the domination of the peaks on the Kailash range that have now been vacated, he said ‘they do’, without elaborating. “Every agreement is premised that they are observed in letter and spirit. We will trust but we will verify.” Systems have been put in to verify that these heights were not reoccupied. When asked if they had done an assessment to identify the shortfalls post the Ladakh stand-off, Gen. Naravane stressed that after every incident, an after action review was carried out and a similar one was carried out. “In the larger scheme of things, we have realised that over the years we have had more focus on our western front than our northern borders... We have done certain amount of rebalancing of our units and formations from the western front to the northern border.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disengagement-a-win-win-situation-says-army-chief/article33928205.ece

The road development, which is part of the Bharat Mala project, is being built by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in hybrid annuity mode along with maintenance of 15 years. Ahmedabad-based Adani Group, Hyderabad-based Megha and KNR groups had also participated in the global tender. This is the first time that the ULCCS has participated alone and won a contract of the NHAI. The ULCCS is the only contractor from Kerala eligible to participate alone in the tender for the National Highway Development Program, which includes projects such as the Bharat Mala and the Golden Quadrilateral Super Highway. The ULCCS got the contract for the first stretch from the State border for Rs. 1,704.125 crore. This is Rs. 132 crore less than the second lowest bid. The Adani Group bid Rs. 1,836.49 crore, Megha Group bid Rs. 1,965.99 crore and KNR Group bid Rs. 2,199.00 crore. The construction period is two years. The estimated cost is Rs. 1,268.53 crore. Only 40% of the contractual amount will be allotted during the construction phase. The rest of the amount will be given as 30 instalments in 15 years. The ULCCS would have to secure 60% of the construction cost and also bear the interests on its own.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ulccs-bags-contract-for-six-laning-works/article33928489.ece
25 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘North-south divide a toolkit sold by BJP’||Defending former Congress president Rahul Gandhi who, in a speech in Thiruvananthapuram, lauded the voters in Kerala for being more interested in issue-based politics in comparison with those in the north, the Congress on Wednesday said the north-south divide was a “toolkit” being adopted and sold by the BJP to the news channels and to the public. Party general secretary Randeep Surjewala told presspersons that Mr. Gandhi had given a “clarion call to the people of India to question the governments of the day” but the government was using diversionary tactics to keep the debate centred on superficial issues. “Let us all rise up and ensure that the governments of the day answer on issues and not on superficiality that they are trying to divert our attention to,” he said. After Mr. Gandhi’s comments, the BJP accused him of dividing the nation on parochial lines. Mr. Surejwala called it merely diversionary tactics when the country was besieged with more important issues. “It is an issue that people of India have lost the right to dissent, right to speak, right to express, right to tweet, right to even write on Facebook or on other social media platforms or to express their opinion, for they will be branded as anti nationals.” He said equally important was the fact that lakhs of farmers were sitting at the Delhi borders but the government was displaying insensitivity in refusing to listen to them. He claimed that nearly 255 farmers had died so far in the agitation. However, there were voices within the party who took a different line, including Anand Sharma, who said the Congress had always stood for a united India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/north-south-divide-a-toolkit-sold-by-bjp/article33928191.ece
25 February 2021||GUWAHATI,||Seat-sharing with allies in March: Assam BJP chief||Two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Election Commission was expected to announce the dates for the Assam Assembly elections by the first week of March, the State BJP unit said it would work out the seat-sharing formula with its two regional partners soon. The list of party candidates would also be announced by mid-March, State BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said. “We are analysing the possibilities of win for deciding which party will contest how many seats. Our allies can get fewer or more seats than in 2016 after the picture becomes clearer,” he told The Hindu . BJP had contested the 2016 Assam polls in alliance with the Asom Gana Parishad and the Bodoland People’s Front. It won 60 of the 89 and AGP 14 of the 30 seats contested while BPF had the best strike rate by winning 12 of the 13 seats contested. BJP replaced BPF with the United People’s Party Liberal this time and there are chances that the new regional ally, confined to the Bodoland Territorial Region, would end up contesting fewer seats than it is eyeing for. Support base There is a possibility of AGP ending up with fewer seats because of the perception that the Assam Jatiya Parishad, a new regional party born of the same students’ organisations, has made inroads into its support base. Mr. Dass, however, exuded confidence that the BJP-led alliance would be too hot to handle for the other two pre-poll coalitions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/seat-sharing-with-allies-in-march-assam-bjp-chief/article33928872.ece
25 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CPI(M): Cong. echoes BJP’s disinformation||The CPI(M) State secretariat on Wednesday said the Congress had become the ideological echo chamber of the BJP. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on his visit to Kerala had parroted the disinformation spread by the BJP against the Left Democratic Front government. Mr. Gandhi had not uttered a word of criticism against the Narendra Modi government in his campaign speeches. He tiptoed around the livelihood issues of the people. Mr. Gandhi had no opinion about the spiralling fuel prices, rising cost of living, selling of national assets to corporates, unemployment, dilution of labour protections, escalating income disparity, CAA or the farmer’s agitation. Instead, he chose to repeat the BJP’s discredited charges against the State’s political executive. The CPI(M) said Mr. Gandhi and his brother-in-law Robert Vadra faced charges of enriching themselves during the United Progressive Alliance government. Mr. Gandhi had wept crocodile tears for traditional fishers. The 1991 Congress government under P. V. Narasimha Rao had opened the country’s territorial waters to foreign fishing fleets. Congress MPs from Kerala spoke in support of the move in Parliament. The CPI(M) had fought on the side of traditional fishers In 2017, the CPI(M) agitated with traditional fisher’s organisations to persuade the NDA government to repeal the decision to allow corporate fishing fleet owners to harvest the deep seas off the coast of the country,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-cong-echoes-bjps-disinformation/article33928520.ece

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, passed the order on the petition filed by Samarpana, a cultural and social service organisation. RTI information The petitioner, relying on the information provided by the BMTC under the RTI Act, pointed out that the sudden strike by the employees between December 11 and 14, 2020 caused a revenue loss of around Rs. 7 crore, besides damage to 23 buses. Complaining that the investigations into the criminal cases registered in relation to strike were not being done swiftly as many unions, which were responsible for the sudden strike, were associated with one political party or another, the petitioner also sought direction to complete the probe at the earliest. Other corporations The petitioner also pointed out that various other public transport corporations such as the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, North-Western KSRTC, and North-Eastern KSRTC too suffered huge loss of revenue due to four-day strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bus-strike-karnataka-hc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-to-recover-loss/article33928363.ece
25 February 2021||MYSURU,||Campus hiring in virtual mode gains traction||Campus hiring continues to gain traction in the city with fresh recruitment drives in the virtual mode. belying the bleak scenario projected during the peak COVID-19 and the lockdown. that followed to curb its spread. Professional colleges in the city which conducted online classes till recently, have switched to the offline mode but the campus placements continues to be in the virtual mode. “We are expecting to hit the pre-COVID 19 level of placements within the next two months,” and this is on the basis of the number of companies evincing interest in recruiting freshers,” said Pradeep Manjunath, placement coordinator, JSS Science and Technology University, SJ College of Engineering, Mysuru. The circuit branches comprising computer science, electronics and communication, electricals and related fields have wide openings while the demand from the mechanical stream is also gaining slow traction, he added. The revival of the automobile sector has created fresh demand for mechanical engineering students, and there is a huge requirement for the manufacturing sector which is gathering fresh steam, according to B. Sadashive Gowda, Principal, Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, Mysuru. He said even in case of students who were recruited last year when the pandemic hit, reputed companies honoured the commitment made to the students. Interviewing freshers However, the virtual mode of interviewing freshers tends to put off a section of the students not familiar with the intricacies and hence they are failing to make the grade, said Prof. Gowda. But VVCE has a pre-placement training in which students are taught how to face an online interview, said J.K. Roopa Priya, Training and Placement Officer. at VVCE. She said campus placement activities were taking place with one or the other company conducting online tests or holding virtual interviews on a daily basis though none of the buzz was visible on the campus. The pandemic and the lockdown has resulted in development of a slew of online recruitment tools and going forward this could as well be the norm, according to Mr. Manjunath. He said more than 125 companies have conducted online tests and virtual interviews for students of JSS Science and Technology University this year despite the lockdown and the slowdown in the economy. which is now bouncing back. The VVCE too has an impressive line of companies to recruit fresh talent. A direct fallout of the pandemic is the decline in the number of students going abroad for higher studies, said Ms. Roopa Priya. Most students have deferred their plans of higher studies abroad till September or have turned to writing the Graduates Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) to seek admission to PG degrees, according to Mr. Manjunath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/campus-hiring-in-virtual-mode-continues-to-gain-traction/article33928381.ece
25 February 2021||KOCHI,||HC issues notice to former wife of judge||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday issued notice to the former wife of Palakkad Principal District and Sessions Judge B. Kalam Pasha on his petition challenging a complaint filed by her under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against him before the Ernakulam Judicial First Class Magistrate Court. In his petition, he pointed out that a petition was filed against him for offence under Section 494 of the IPC (remarriage during the lifetime of a husband or a wife). As his former wife had indulged in character assassination and treated the petitioner with cruelty, the petitioner was constrained to pronounce triple talaq in 2017 after a series of mediations/conciliation and arbitration. Later, he married another woman in 2018 in terms of the Muslim personal law. In fact, the petition filed by his former wife challenging the validity of the talaq was dismissed by a family court earlier. The marriage with his present wife was valid. In the meantime, his former wife had filed a series of complaints against him before the magistrate court and before various authorities to harass the petitioner. The petitioner sought to quash the complaint for the offence under Section 494 of the IPC. The court posted the case for further hearing on March 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-issues-notice-to-former-wife-of-judge/article33928488.ece
25 February 2021||KOLLAM,||No Fishing Ministry, says Rahul; govt. rejects claim||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has suggested that the United Democratic Front (UDF) prepare a manifesto for the fishing community. Interacting with fishers at Thangassery here on Wednesday, he said: “We are currently in the process of making the manifesto of the UDF in consultation with different groups and communities about what they want. Yesterday [on Tuesday], I said that we need to have a fishers’ manifesto for the fishing community. I would like the fishers of Kerala and the UDF to have a conversation and decide what exactly they want in the manifesto.” Request for discussion Responding to the grievances related to paying 5% of the auction amount to the government, lack of breakwaters in some areas, and issues related to paying road cess, Mr. Gandhi said UDF leaders would study the problems and his role was to ensure that the fishers were not treated in an unfair manner. Requesting the fishers to have a discussion with UDF leaders, he said: “If you want the 5% government commission withdrawn, put it in our manifesto and it will be done. Whatever is in that manifesto will be delivered to you and that is a promise. I want the manifesto to be your expression, I want the voice of fishers to be there.” He said the UDF manifesto is developing a version of the Nyay (Nyuntam Aay Yojana) scheme, introduced during the 2019 Lok Sabha election guaranteeing Rs. 72,000 per annum to every poor person. Having a Ministry dedicated to fishers tops his priority list for the community so that they can be defended and protected across the country. “Just like the farmers farm the land, you farm the sea. The farmers have a Ministry in Delhi, but you do not have one. No one speaks for you in Delhi,” he said. Talking about the current controversy in connection with the alleged deep-sea fishing contract, Mr. Gandhi said he did not like any unfair situation. “I am for competition, but not for unfair competition. So, there should be a level-playing field for everyone. Every single day the fuel price goes up and you cannot buy an engine beyond a certain size. The boat cannot be maintained here, it has to be maintained somewhere else. At the same time, the government is trying to build trawlers that will destroy your life,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/setting-up-of-fisheries-ministry-on-priority-list/article33928172.ece
25 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala govt. reaches out to PSC rank holders||The Cabinet on Wednesday announced the creation of posts in excess of the requisite number in the Sports and Youth Affairs Department to employ 82 athletes who had won gold, silver and bronze medals for Kerala in the National Games. The ‘unusual’ decision to generate supernumerary posts to accommodate the striking athletes without waiting for vacancies to emerge reflected the Left Democratic Front's political gambit to impede the Opposition efforts to weaponise the ongoing protest of Public Service Commission (PSC) rank holders against the government. The month-old roadside sit-in protest of the PSC rank holders in front of the Secretariat had included the medal-winning athletes alongside those on the rank list for appointment to the post of last grade employees, civil police officers (CPO) and other posts. Expired rank list The Cabinet also decided to raise a new battalion to combat the rising urban crime, economic offences, and national security threats. The proposed Kerala Armed Police Batallion (VI) has 100 CPO posts with 25 set aside for women. However, the Cabinet has not indicated whether or not it would revive the expired CPO rank list. The PSC rank holders on the list had moved the Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT) seeking an extension of its validity. They may also petition the High Court. The government is unlikely to oppose their plea in the tribunal or the High Court. However, the government is hard-pressed to revive an obsolete PSC rank list. Such a move is legally untenable and would lead to litigations, an official said. 100 new posts The Cabinet also created at least 100 new posts in various departments, possibly to benefit the striking last grade rank holders. A government delegation had promised the rank holders that the administration would expedite promotions and report vacancies speedily to create more post for them. The government had also extended the validity of the rank list till August. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had pushed the PSC rank holders’ agitation into the national limelight by visiting the agitation venue on Tuesday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-govt-reaches-out-to-psc-rank-holders/article33928175.ece
25 February 2021||MALAPPURAM,||Hunt on for five accused of drugging, raping teen||A special police investigation team has been constituted with the support of the District Anti-Narcotics Special Action Force (DANSAF) to nab the absconding members involved in drugging and raping a 14-year-old girl in the district. District Police Chief Sujith Das S. said the police were using all their resources to pin those involved in the crime. Two of them were arrested and five others were at large. “We hope to nab them all in a day or two,” said Mr. Das. He said the police were dealing with the case with utmost seriousness and importance, especially as Malappuram was ahead of other districts in the number of POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act cases. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Tanur, will lead the special team. The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on Wednesday handed over the survivor for medical examination. The girl will have to undergo several tests, including HIV test, as no fewer than seven people were involved in abusing her over the last several months.  Grave issue CWC chairman Shajesh Bhaksar said the life of the girl would be at risk as long as the culprits were at large. “It would not have been a shocking incident had it happened in a metropolis. Drugging and raping a school girl repeatedly in a village after accosting her through Instagram is certainly a matter of grave concern,” said Mr. Bhaskar. It was the Childline that rescued the girl and brought to light the drug-and-sex racket involved in trapping school girls after accosting them through Instagram. Several girls are feared to have been abused by the racket. Meanwhile, Childline officials said that plans were afoot to reach out to the parents with awareness programmes about social media hazards. Incapability of certain parents in detecting behaviour changes in children and monitoring their use of mobile phones were said to be a major cause for worry. “Making parents aware of the dangers of the cyberworld has become the need of the hour. We are chalking out awareness programmes in the wake of the enhanced use of mobile phones by students after the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Childline coordinator Anwar Karakkadan and counsellor Muhsin Pari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hunt-on-for-five-accused-of-drugging-raping-teen/article33928181.ece
25 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Builders told to deposit half the compensation||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked two builders in the Maradu flat demolition case of Kerala to deposit 50% of the compensation amount due to the flat owners within six weeks. A Bench led by Justice Navin Sinha also did not agree with Kerala government's suggestion to transfer a contempt case related to illegal constructions in coastal areas to the Kerala High Court for monitoring. The State said there were 19,000 violations which would require actual verification. This process could be supervised by the High Court. But the Bench did not agree. The hearing on Wednesday mainly concerned pleas by two Maradu builders, Jain Housing and Golden Kayaloram group, to lift the attachment on their assets. The court said it would consider their pleas on payment of the 50% compensation due. Jain Housing, represented by senior advocate A.M. Singhvi and advocate A. Karthik, had collected Rs. 28.53 crore in all from residents. The amount was revealed by the Supreme Court-appointed Justice Balakrishnan Nair Committee. “We have already paid Rs. 2 crore. The remaining amount will be a little over Rs. 12 crore,” Mr. Karthik said. During the arguments, Mr. Singhvi submitted that the company had a property worth Rs. 93 crore in Chelavannur. He said this property, worth four times more than the compensation owed, could be held back as security while releasing the other confiscated properties. Appearing for Golden Kayaloram, senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Haris Beeran, said their client had received a little over Rs. 13 crore from the flat owners for construction. The court directed them to pay 50% of it, which was Rs. 6.68 crore. “We already paid back Rs. 2.89 crore,” Mr. Beeran said. He said the company asked the court to de-freeze a property transaction so that the proceeds of the sale could be used to raise around Rs. 4 crore to make the payment to the flat owners. Mr. Sibal also sought a stay on a vigilance enquiry. The court asked amicus curiae to look into the request and submit a report. The court has listed the case for hearing on March 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/builders-told-to-deposit-half-the-compensation/article33928183.ece

Vaccination in India had been successful, “faultless with hardly any complaints”, he claimed. Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who also briefed the media on the Cabinet decisions, said most of the Ministers were of the opinion that they would pay to get vaccinated. The first phase of vaccination started on January 16. The cumulative number of doses administered to healthcare and frontline workers crossed 1.23 crore on Wednesday, the Health Ministry said. “A total of 1,23,66,633 vaccine doses have been given through 2,63,224 sessions, as per the provisional report till 6 p.m. These include 65,24,726 healthcare workers (HCWs) who have taken the 1st dose and 14,81,754 HCWs who have taken the 2nd dose, along with 43,60,153 front line workers FLWs (1st dose).

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. withdraws order on online science meets||“In view of the easing of restrictions on travel and assembly of people, guidelines issued regarding political clearance for international conferences/seminars/training etc due to covid-19 pandemic are no longer applicable. All such events will however continue to be governed by the same rules and regulations applicable to political clearances prior to the pandemic,” said an office order issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) late on Wednesday. These rules are available on the website of the Ministry of Home Affairs governing conferences, the order said.  The Hindu had reported on Monday that the government was considering withdrawing the notification after protests from leading science academies in India. The scientists were reacting to orders issued by the Ministry of Education on January 31, based on the guidelines originally issued by the MEA on November 25. The restrictions, according to scientists, were too broad-based and vague and would have made it impossible for many scientists to participate in online conferences without contravening the law. “The Ministry of Education may send their withdrawal notices but those will be effectively forwarding this [MEA note],” a senior official privy to developments confirmed to The Hindu on condition of anonymity. The now defunct guidelines were applicable to publicly funded institutions and extended to a wide ambit of topics, such as “...security of the Indian state, border, North East States, J&K, or any other issues which are clearly/purely related to India’s internal matters”. The guidelines also covered “sensitive” subjects that included “political, scientific, technical, commercial, personal [subjects] with provisions for sharing of data in any form; presentations”. Though such permissions were required for international visits by foreign speakers, this was the first time they were sought to be applied to virtual meetings as well as mentioned terms such as “India’s internal matters”. Partha Majumdar, president, Indian Academy of Sciences, wrote a letter to Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal last week requesting that the guidelines be withdrawn. “The Indian Academy of Sciences considers the provisions of the Office Memorandum (OM) to be overly restrictive, lacking in clarity, and detrimental to the progress of science in India, including capacity-building. We strongly urge upon you to withdraw the blanket restrictions and the requirement of permission on the organisation of scientific discussion meetings and scientific training programs in India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-withdraws-order-on-online-science-meets/article33928186.ece

25 February 2021||Patna,||SI, accused in liquor case die in gunfight in Bihar||A police sub-inspector (SI) and a man allegedly involved in smuggling of liquor were killed and a village “chowkidar” sustained injuries in a gunfight in a village in the Majorganj police station limits in Sitamarhi district of north Bihar on Wednesday. Two accused are absconding. Acting on a tip-off, a police team went to Kuari-Madan village to arrest Ranjay Kumar Singh, the alleged smuggler and a fugitive in an old case. “As soon as the team led by SI Dinesh Ram, along with watchman Lalbabu Paswan, reached the house of the fugitive, criminals opened fire. In the exchange of fire that followed, Mr. Ram and Mr. Paswan were injured. The SI died on the way to hospital, while the watchman sustained injuries in the hand,” district police official P.N. Sahu. Singh was killed in the gun battle, he added. The police, led by Superintendent of Police Anil Kumar Singh, have launched a search for the two absconding men. “The killed criminal was wanted in an old case and was also involved in liquor smuggling. We will arrest the two absconding criminals soon,” Additional Director-General of Police (Law & Order) Amit Kumar said. Sitamarhi shares its border with Nepal and smugglers have been bringing in liquor from there to Bihar, where consumption and trade of liquor have been banned since April 2016. However, trade of illegal liquor is said to be rampant with the involvement of criminals and smugglers from States such as Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Nepal. Of late, liquor smugglers have attacked policemen in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Vaishali and Begusarai districts during searches on their hideouts. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said policemen found drunk or involved in liquor business must be dismissed as they had taken a pledge not to take liquor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/si-accused-in-liquor-case-die-in-gunfight-in-bihar/article33928207.ece

25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Student who alleged rape ends life||A 19-year-old pharmacy student, who had accused an autorickshaw driver and others of kidnapping and raping her two weeks ago, died by suicide on Wednesday. Ghatkesar police, who are investigating the case, said the victim’s father approached the police on Wednesday morning to inform about the death. He told police that on Tuesday night, he had noticed his diabetes and blood pressure tablets missing. The next morning, around 10.30 a.m., he found his daughter frothing at the mouth. The girl was rushed to Area Hospital in Ghatkesar. She was declared ‘brought dead’ at 10.55 a.m. As soon as the tragic incident came to light, police officers rushed to the hospital and took stock of the situation. ‘Appeared unwell’ A day before her death, her parents had taken her to Area Hospital at Ghatkesar after noticing that she was feeling unwell. Her father claimed that she was suffering from ‘mental agony’. Doctors at this hospital referred her to Gandhi Hospital for treatment where she saw a doctor and returned home the same day. “The victim’s father has stated that he does not suspect anyone’s involvement or consider it foul play,” Ghatkesar inspector N. Chandra Babu said. Family changed home According to the police, the girl and her family had moved from an area under Keesara Police Station limits to a location in Ghatkesar after her allegations about being kidnapped and raped earlier this month were labelled false by the police. She had named an autorickshaw driver and others as culprits. However, according to the Rachakonda police, the pharmacy student had certain disagreements with her family and thus, lodged a complaint even as she ‘misled’ the police. Police conclusion After investigating the matter based on evidence, including CCTV footage, police concluded that she had made up the story.

A Bench of Justice R. Devdas passed the order on separate petitions filed by the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka; the Karnataka State Minorities Educational Institutions’ Managements’ Federation; Oakridge International School and others. The GO, issued on January 29, 2021, had also directed private unaided schools, including those imparting education in CBSE, ICSE and international mode of syllabus, not to collect any other fees, including school development, optional activities, etc., and also donations for their trusts and societies. The government had issued the order following representations by parents and their associations for drastically reducing the school fees for the present academic year in view of COVID-19 and after holding discussions with representatives of associations of managements of school and the parents. The petitioners have mainly questioned the jurisdiction of the government to issue direction to the schools regulating their fee structure under the Karnataka Education Act. The association of the minority education institutions, quoting the apex court’s judgements, contended that the government had no power to interfere with the fee structure of minority educational institutions. On the other hand, the association of private unaided primary and secondary schools contended that the government could not have invoked the amended provisions of the Karnataka Education Act as the same was pending adjudication before the High Court. Pointing out that many parents had not paid complete fee for the previous year as that academic year ended abruptly owing to COVID-19, the petitioner association contended that only 70% of the tuition fee was insufficient to pay salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-notice-to-karnataka-on-school-fee-cut/article33928166.ece

(CMRL), after the phase I extension project from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar was opened last Sunday, the average daily number of passengers rose to 74,000. On Monday, the reduction in fares came into effect, and the maximum fare became Rs. 50 from Rs. 70, with an additional 20% discount for those who bought smartcards or QR code tickets. “In the last two days, we have witnessed nearly 86,000 passengers a day. We are expecting the ridership to touch one lakh a day very soon,” an official said. Chennai Central, with nearly 7,000 passengers a day, has been seeing the maximum footfall, followed by 4,500 at the airport and Thirumangalam stations, the officials said. “In the phase I extension stretch, the Washermenpet and Wimco Nagar stations both get nearly 2,000 passengers a day, which is much higher than what we expected. We see that many office-goers and college students travel from the northern areas to the central parts of the city. In addition, we have seen a surge in the passenger traffic at the Koyambedu station, with nearly 3,000 passengers a day. This could be because of traders travelling to the Koyambedu market. But we need to do an elaborate study on the passenger profile. It will help in understanding the traffic we get,” another official of the CMRL said. Recently, last-mile connectivity services, like share autos, have resumed at select stations but they have to be provided at all stations, especially from the airport to places like Chromepet, Pallavaram and Tambaram, the officials added.

25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||In T.N., Cong. sees itself as mobiliser of minorities||With the DMK likely to play hard ball with the Congress during the impending seat-sharing talks for the Assembly election, the national party believes it acts as the ‘multiplier’ and can mobilise the minorities to vote for the alliance. While the DMK was liberal in allotting seats to the Congress during the Parliamentary election, it is expected not to be be generous this time citing the party’s poor “strike rate” in the last two Assembly elections. All India Congress Committee in-charge for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Dinesh Gundu Rao insisted: “Definitely, when the Congress is part of the alliance, the minorities would feel doubly secure that the secular principles would be reinforced.” He credited the DMK with opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “wrong policies” and the BJP. “We act as a multiplier – we are a liberal, progressive party and will not compromise on our secular ideology. It is in our DNA and we bring that to the alliance,” he contended. The Congress leadership believes that the minorities in Tamil Nadu are increasingly viewing the party favourably with the BJP perceptibly growing in the State. A source close to the party high command claimed that internal surveys showed the minorities were feeling jittery about a possibility of the DMK striking an alliance with the BJP in the future. “In seats where minorities make a difference, we find that the voters prefer a Congress candidate contesting in their constituency,” he claimed. “There is usually a talk about how Congress’ strike rate is poor, but what is not discussed is how many seats DMK wins because of the Congress,” he said. According to him, the Congress could tilt the scales in favour of the alliance in 29 seats. A Muslim leader in the Secular Progressive Alliance, when contacted, felt the alliance would be a credible ‘secular’ alternative only if DMK and Congress were together. “It is not useful to discuss who has more credibility with minorities. The alliance should be intact, only then will it work,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/in-tn-cong-sees-itself-as-mobiliser-of-minorities/article33928834.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC for policy to ban ownership of elephants by temples, individuals||The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to come up with a comprehensive policy after consulting experts for banning future ownership of elephants by temples and individuals besides ensuring that the welfare of the elephants already under private custody was taken care of by the Forest Department. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the interim direction on a batch of four public interest litigation petitions filed by activist Rangarajan Narasimhan complaining about mistreatment meted out to temple elephants. He accused the Forest Department and Animal Welfare Board of India of failing to monitor the welfare of the animals. Referring to a video of Srivilliputtur Andal temple elephant Jayamalyatha being beaten up by its mahout and another caretaker at the rejuvenation camp in Thekkampatti of Coimbatore district, the judges wrote that some temple elephants might actually not be treated well “as was evident from a video which went viral on the social media a couple of days ago.” Coming down hard on such ill treatment of animals, the Bench said: “Any kind of mistreatment of elephants and other animals must be dealt with promptly and as mercilessly as such persons deal with the animals. Exploitation of animals for all purposes should be stopped except for limited government-controlled exercises such as horse riding or camel-riding on the beaches.” Even such rides should not be allowed to be operated by private individuals since the treatment of the animals could not be checked or monitored, the Bench said and granted time till April 27 for the State government to come up with comprehensive policy and guidelines for rehabilitation of all animals, including elephants, which had been lured away from their natural habitats. Adequate measures must be put in place to ensure that elephants were not exploited any more in the State for joy rides or used as beasts of burden to transport heavy materials, the judges added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-for-policy-to-ban-ownership-of-elephants-by-temples-individuals/article33929087.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Former IPS officer moves High Court seeking better pay for Home Guards||Former IPS officer K. Annamalai has filed a public interest litigation petition in the Madras High Court challenging a February 19, 2019, Government Order which restricts the number of call out duties that could be assigned to the Home Guards, those who voluntarily serve as an auxiliary force to the police, to just 10 days a month. When the case was listed for admission before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on Tuesday, the judges ordered notice to the Home Secretary, the Director General of Police and others returnable by 10 weeks. The judges directed State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to get instructions by June 15. Voluntary force Mr. Annamalai said the Home Guards was a voluntary force raised in 1946 to assist the police in controlling civil disturbances and communal riots. Their role was to serve as an auxiliary force to the police in maintenance of internal security and help in any kind of emergency, such as an air-raid, fire, cyclone, earthquake and epidemic. Home Guards were recruited from cross sections of society and utilised to carry out all functions performed regularly by police constables. They had been working as part and parcel of the Police Department and perform duties, such as driving, traffic control, night patrolling, VIP bandobust, election duty and serving of court summons, the petitioner added. Pointing out that the Home Guards were originally paid a meagre amount of Rs. 150 a day in Tamil Nadu, he said the amount was increased to Rs. 560 a day by way of a G.O. issued on July 7, 2017. However, that G.O. decreased the number of call out duties for them from 16 to five days a month, thereby virtually nullifying the pay increase. On February 19, 2019, another G.O. was issued, increasing the call out duties to 10 days a month. Nevertheless, stating that it would not be sufficient, the petitioner pointed out that the Home Guards in neighbouring States were paid for almost 30 days a month and some States even offered them a pay equal to the monthly pay of a Grade II police constable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-ips-officer-moves-high-court-seeking-better-pay-for-home-guards/article33929107.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Veterinary college gets ‘Eat Right Campus’ tag||The Food Safety Department has begun certifying private institutions, including colleges and hospitals in the city that have in-house canteens, as “Eat Right Campuses”. Recently, the Madras Veterinary College Hostel and Apollo Hospitals, Greames Road, have been given such certification by the department based on the guidelines issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Veterinary college warden N. Kumaravelu said the process of certification began before the lockdown. “We had stopped using maida and providing junk food some two years ago. We had included traditional food, including sundal, in the diet. The Food Safety Department gave us tips, including not to use wooden cutting boards or layer shelves with newspapers since those attract pests. They suggested that we place a board in the mess showing how much food is wasted and after that the wastage has drastically reduced,” he said and added that college Dean K.N. Selvakumar sanctioned automation of the mess and fixing of meshes on the windows. “It has been a joint effort of students and staff that has helped us improve the mess,” he said. Designated Food Safety Officer for Chennai A. Ramakrishnan said the certification was being done as part of the Eat Right Chennai campaign. “Under this campaign, private companies, corporates, government offices, public sector undertakings, anganwadi centres and even prisons, where food is prepared and served to people, can be certified. We have four parameters based on which the campus is evaluated,” he said. These parameters include steps to ensure provision of healthy food, environmentally sustainable practices and creating awareness among individuals on the campus of the need to make the right food choices. Any campus that has chosen to be part of the programme first does self-assessment and a third-party audit by an FSSAI-empanelled agency.  We have four parameters based on which the campus is evaluated and certified  A.

25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Red Hills reservoir to be a tourist spot||The Water Resources Department (WRD) has proposed to develop the Red Hills lake as a tourist attraction and recently submitted a proposal to the Tiruvallur district administration. In a bid to encourage community participation in lake conservation, the WRD has initiated efforts to create a green belt on the 30 acre vacant site around the lake’s boundary and protect it from encroachments. Built in 1876, the Red Hills reservoir is one of the five major waterbodies meeting the drinking water requirements of Chennai. Of the 830 million litres a day supplied as drinking water to the city, the Red Hills reservoir contributes nearly 270 mld. It is now brimming with water as the lake has storage of 3,182 million cubic feet, which is nearly 96.4% of its capacity. WRD officials said about 400 saplings were planted recently on the lake’s boundary along the G.N.T. Road. The WRD joined hands with the Rural Development Department and various organisations, including the Rotary Club of Alandur, the Social Work Team Trust (Swott) and several schools and colleges for the initiative. “We wanted to secure the 30 acre site that is now free of encroachments and increase the green cover and create a recreational space around the waterbody. We have submitted a proposal and design to develop the lake as a tourist spot on the lines of the Poondi reservoir,” said an official. The WRD has proposed to create a park with children’s play area and a pond on the lake’s periphery along the G.N.T. Road. Officials of the Tiruvallur district administration have assured the WRD that steps would be taken to develop the lake into a tourist attraction, the official added. V. Irulandi, former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and member of the Rotary Club of Alandur, said: “We target to plant up to 1,000 saplings on the site, which was cleared of thick vegetation, around the lake. We recently planted 12 varieties of native species, including neem, Iluppai, Magizham, Vengai and Indian gooseberry.”   The WRD is awaiting funds from the Tiruvallur district administration to develop the green space around the waterbody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/red-hills-reservoir-to-be-a-tourist-spot/article33928817.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK leaders urge HC to reject plea for intra-party polls||Senior AIADMK leaders have filed a joint application in the Madras High Court seeking to reject a civil suit preferred by an individual insisting that intra-party elections should be conducted and the appointment of various office-bearers without conducting such elections should be declared null and void. The applicants — party presidium chairman E. Madhoosudhanan, coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami — prayed to reject the plaint with exemplary costs. Justice R. Pongiappan on Wednesday directed the plaintiff, G. Sundaram of Kanagkurichi in Salem district, to file his reply within eight weeks and adjourned the case till April 24. ‘Hidden agenda’ The applicants had questioned the plaintiff’s locus standi and claimed there was a “hidden agenda” behind the case. Filing a common affidavit, Mr. Madhoosudhanan denied the claim that the party was dormant since 2017 and said the plaintiff could not question the leadership of Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami. “There was dispute between two factions in AIADMK and the said matter reached the Election Commission of India (ECI) as a dispute under Para 15 of Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order of 1968.  EC ruling “The ECI held that the group presided over by the coordinator and co-coordinator is the original AIADMK. This order came to be passed on November 23, 2017. The order was challenged before the Delhi High Court but the writ petitions were dismissed on February 28, 2019.” Thereafter, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed against the order on March 26, 2019. A review application was also dismissed on April 23, 2020. “Therefore, the very tenor of the plaint questioning the leadership of the coordinator and co-coordinator is not maintainable… The party has specifically sought time from the ECI for conduct of intra-party election from time to time and the same has been granted by the Commission,” he said. The AIADMK was an unregistered body of individuals governed by a set of rules and regulations registered with the ECI, the applicants said. Non-members of the party could not question its functioning. The by-laws of the party require every member to renew his/her membership on payment of Rs. 10 once in five years and categorically states that even members could not resort to court proceedings regarding party matters. As far as the plaintiff Mr. Sundaram was concerned, there was no evidence to prove that he had renewed his membership after 2013. “The plaintiff is motivated and has approached the court with mala fide intention to demean the stature of AIADMK,” they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-leaders-urge-hc-to-reject-plea-for-intra-party-polls/article33928301.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu not safe even for women IPS officers: Stalin||The alleged sexual harassment of a woman IPS officer by Special DGP (Law and Order) Rajesh Das was an indication that women were not safe in Tamil Nadu, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Wednesday. “The Chief Minister should hang his head in shame because there are a few black sheep among honest IPS officers and they have made it unsafe even for the female IPS officers,” Mr. Stalin said in a statement. ‘Claim exposed’ He said the woman IPS officer deserved his appreciation since she had come forward to lodge a complaint when others failed to complain out of fear. “The complaint has exposed the claim of the Chief Minister that Tamil Nadu is a safe haven for women,” he said. Mr. Stalin noted it was not the first time an IPS officer was facing sexual harassment charge. “There was a complaint against then DVAC IG Murugan [in 2018] and the Chief Minister sought to keep it under carpet. A case was filed only after the court intervened. He is protecting police officers to save himself from the corruption and illegal activities,” the DMK leader claimed. Mr. Stalin said it was the height of arrogance that a Special DGP, on duty during the Chief Minister’s tour, had harassed a woman officer. Claiming that the Chief Minister sought to protect Mr. Das, he said, “The DMK will not allow such a shameful situation. If the government protects the officer and undermines the safety of women officers, the DMK will launch a protest.” CPI (M) state secretary K. Balakrishnan demanded suspension of Mr. Das to ensure a fair inquiry into the sexual harassment allegations against him. “The incident has taken place in the wake of the arrest of a AIADMK functionary (since expelled) in the Pollachi sexual assault case. It has thoroughly exposed the AIADMK government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/even-women-officers-not-safe-stalin/article33928806.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court seeks govt. response to plea over appointment of SHRC Chairman||The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to respond to a public interest litigation petition, which challenged the appointment of former judge S. Baskaran as the Chairman of the Tamil Nadu State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on the ground that it lacked transparency. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to get instructions from the Public Department Secretary within four weeks with respect to the PIL petition filed by S. Logeshwar, an advocate. Representing the litigant, senior counsel A. Sirajudeen said Justice Baskaran was fully qualified to hold the post since he had served as a judge of the High Court and that was the reason a writ of quo warranto was not filed questioning the authority under which he was holding the position. However, complaining about the selection process, counsel said that no notification was issued, and no applications were invited for the post. He claimed that many other retired judges might have applied for the post if a notification had been issued by the State government. The petitioner stated that the SHRC Chairperson’s post was lying vacant since 2019. Suddenly, the government convened the selection committee meeting on December 26, 2020, and the Law Minister proposed the name of Justice Baskaran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-seeks-govt-response-to-plea-over-appointment-of-shrc-chairman/article33929099.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Number of people adhering to COVID-19 norms has fallen drastically: survey||Amid a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, only 30% of the people in the country are complying with the norm of wearing masks and only 12% are observing distancing norms, a survey that covered 8,000 respondents has found. The respondents said with a fall in cases in tier 2, 3 and 4 towns and rural areas and with social events being permitted, people believed that there was no need to fear. Also, the survey found that in metropolitan cities and tier 1 and 2 districts, the compliance was better. LocalCircles, which conducted the survey, said it had received reports from citizens about non-compliance with the wearing of masks and the lack of physical distance in public and private events and markets. With schools beginning to function in many States and workplaces making physical attendance mandatory, people had also started returning to pre-COVID-19 activities, the survey said. The responses to the survey came from people in 238 districts in the country. As many as 51% of them lived in a metro or tier 1 district while 28% were located in tier 2 districts. Tier 3, 4 or rural districts accounted for 21% of the responses. Additional masks LocalCircles pointed out that while in countries around the world, people were upgrading their masks or going in for double basic masks for protection, in India mask compliance fell from 67% in September to 30% now. The respondents said discomfort, poor enforcement of rules by local authorities and the declining case load in their area were the reasons for the lowering of the guard. As many as 35% respondents in tier 1 cities rated mask-wearing as effective in their cities. In tier 2 locations, it dropped to 29% and in tier 3 and 4 and rural locations, it fell to 19%, the survey found. Data analysed based on locations found that compliance with physical distancing norms was 15% effective in tier 1 locations; 10% in tier 2 locations; and 7.5% in tier 3 and 4 and rural locations. The survey pointed out that the experiences of Maharashtra and Kerala should serve as a warning to ensure better compliance. “States that are seeing even a minor rise week over week must sensitise residents about wearing masks and following physical distancing norms and take timely calls on imposing localised restrictions in order to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and its mutant strains,” the survey said. Of those who were surveyed 32% were women; 51% were from tier 1; 28% from tier 2 and 21% were from tier 3 and 4 and rural districts. LocalCircles is a community social media platform that enables the government to make citizen and small business-centric policies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/number-of-people-adhering-to-covid-19-norms-has-fallen-drastically-survey/article33929100.ece

At the party headquarters in Royapettah, Chief Minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister-coordinator O. Panneerselvam garlanded Jayalalithaa’s statue and cut a cake to mark the occasion. Apart from inaugurating a three-day medical camp, they handed over cheques for Rs. 3 lakh each to the legal heirs of six members of the party who had died.

25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK rebuffs Sasikala’s fresh call for unity||V.K. Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the AIADMK, on Wednesday used the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to make a fresh call for unity to the departed leader’s “genuine followers”. The AIADMK rebuffed it. Ms. Sasikala, a long-time aide of Jayalalithaa, garlanded the late leader’s portrait at her T. Nagar residence in Chennai. She urged “followers” to achieve a “resounding success” in the Assembly election and expressed her confidence that they would perform well. She added that she would soon meet the followers and the public. Her nephew T.T.V. Dhinakaran, who is also the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) general secretary, was present on the occasion. Later, Mr. Dhinakaran told reporters at his party office that the call was meant for “Amma’s [Jayalalithaa’s] followers”. He was responding to a query whether the call was aimed at bringing the AIADMK and the AMMK together. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said Ms. Sasikala’s call was relevant to the AMMK and not to the ruling party. “As far as the AIADMK is concerned, the party is progressing on the right path with the overwhelming support of the people and the party cadre. The unanimous view among all of us is that the MGR [party founder M.G. Ramachandran]-Amma government should blossom again. We are all marching towards this goal,” the Minister said. ‘Wrong information’ Responding to a question on Congress MP Karti Chidambaram’s tweet that the BJP was exerting pressure on the AMMK and Ms. Sasikala to strike an understanding with the AIADMK, Mr. Dhinakaran said the tweet was based on “wrong information”. There had been “no pressure” on him. When asked whether anti-DMK votes would not get split if the AMMK contested separately, he said a similar argument was raised when he contested the byelection to the R.K. Nagar constituency in December 2017, but he won. “I am confident that the people will repose their faith in us in our pursuit of the re-establishment of Amma’s government,” he said. Earlier, R. Sarath Kumar, founder of the All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi, along with his wife Radikaa Sarathkumar and party colleagues, met Ms. Sasikala. Later, he said it was a “courtesy call”. He pointed out that he knew her, and his party had been an ally of the AIADMK for over 10 years. He wanted Ms. Sasikala to “continue her public service”. Seeman, leader of the Naam Tamilar Katchi, and Bharathiraja, a veteran filmmaker, also called on Ms. Sasikala. When asked about the meeting between Mr. Sarath Kumar and Ms. Sasikala, the Minister said the former was still a part of the alliance led by the AIADMK.

She has since started walking without assistance. Subhalakshmi Venkatraman, a resident of Mumbai, had been suffering from knee pain for six years. She had met several surgeons who said she had to undergo a total knee replacement. Ms. Venkatraman could not undergo treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She approached Apollo Hospitals’ Madhan Thiruvengada, a senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Dr. Madhan said his team completed a first-of-its-kind procedure in the State and the patient was mobile with assistance within three hours of surgery. The surgeon called it a fast track knee replacement procedure. Ms. Venkatraman said she had hesitated, as a total knee replacement would involve eight to 10 days of hospital stay. The delay cost her heavily. Her condition worsened and the pain hindered her daily activities. The joint bones had developed friction and the bone spurs altered her gait. She limped, favouring one leg. Her knees had started bending due to the pressure. Dr. Madhan said: “I used a faster, quicker procedure and a smaller incision.” Three hours after the surgery, she began to walk with crutches and was climbing steps within 16 hours of the surgery done at the hospital’s OMR facility. Apollo Hospitals’ managing director Suneeta Reddy said the hospital had leveraged technology and innovation to improve care. “Apollo Institute of Orthopaedics develops more sophisticated techniques and uses increasingly precise tools that can allow patients to go home the same day as their surgery,” she said. Ms. Venkatraman was happy with the outcome of the surgery on her right knee and within five days underwent a surgery on her left knee as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/woman-walks-three-hours-after-knee-surgery/article33928814.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai Book Fair begins||The 44th edition of the Chennai Book Fair was inaugurated by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Wednesday. Organised at the YMCA grounds in Nandanam, about 700 stalls have been set up this year as against 800 last year. “The numbers dwindled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But most publishers have come forward and put up stalls, which is an encouraging sign,” R.S. Shanmugam, president of the Book Sellers and Publishers Association of South India (BAPASI), told The Hindu . He said that rent for stalls had been slashed by 20% this year considering the fact that many people could not sell their books during the lockdown. For those who could not afford rent, space had been provided for displaying their books. BAPASI is confident of recording good footfalls this year. “Those who love reading books will certainly come. During the pandemic, many people started reading books and this particular crowd will visit the exhibition to buy books,” Mr. Shanmugam said. A number of story books for children was available, he said. “Enquiries have been positive so far. With kids at home, the demand for activity books are increasing,” said J. Saravanan of Scholastic India. The fair has a stall for books recommended by actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan during hisBig Bossshow. “Suriya’s Agaram Foundation is urging its sponsors to buy books for donating them to schools,” Mr. Shanmugam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-book-fair-begins/article33928827.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘NGT order on 1996 CZMP map proves fraud at highest level’||The order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directing the authorities to take the 1996 Coastal Zone Management Plan map with approved modifications in respect of Tiruvallur district while preparing the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) “proved that industrialisation of the Ennore Creek and the Kattupalli island was based on fraud committed at the highest level, including by regulators”, environmental activists have claimed. In a statement, the Save Ennore Creek Campaign said the NGT’s findings raise questions over the validity of the recently prepared 2018 CZMP as this map was based on an ‘amended’ 1997 map rather than the approved map of 1996. While directing the authorities to use the 1996 map, instead of the one put out in 1997, the NGT said the documents produced by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) showed that when the CZMPs were prepared on the basis of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011, “they have verified the alleged 1997 CZMP produced by Tamil Nadu for verification and found that most of the ecologically sensitive areas and major portions of waterbodies like Kosasthalaiyar river and Salt Pans were omitted in the 1997 plan and were included in the 2018 plan.” The Bench noted that though sheet no. 2 was modified as per a letter of the Ministry, the plan had not been prepared, whereas the State government claimed it had been prepared in accordance with the law. The Save Ennore Creek Campaign claimed that the NGT’s order confirmed the allegations by activists and Ennore fishers that the former Director of Environment, H. Malleshappa, presented an illegal and unapproved CZMP that deleted entire sections of the river and backwaters to justify industrial takeover of wetlands in the Ennore Creek in Tiruvallur district. “In June 2017, the Department of Environment revealed, for the first time, a map prepared in 1997 asserting that to be an officially amended, approved map that replaced an earlier Government of India-approved CZMP map of 1996. The Department of Environment had used the illegal map to justify setting up of industries and infrastructure within the Ennore wetlands,” the Campaign said. The Campaign said the Kamarajar Port, L&T Port, TNRDC’s port access road, the North Chennai Thermal Power Station’s Phase III, part of NTECL Vallur power plant, BPCL and HPCL’s oil terminals, the Chettinad coal yard, and the Ennore SEZ’s conveyor belts had all been allowed in the eco-sensitive ‘No Development Zone’ by hiding the approved map.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngt-order-on-czmp-of-1996-proves-fraud-at-highest-level/article33928808.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Panel to probe harassment charge against Special DGP||Following a complaint of sexual harassment filed by a woman IPS officer against Special DGP (Law and Order) Rajesh Das, the Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday constituted an inquiry committee and placed him on compulsory wait. IAS officer and Secretary of the Department of Planning and Development Jayashree Raghunandan has been named the presiding officer of the six-member committee, according to a government order issued by Home Secretary S.K.

25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Automatic patta name transfer project piloted in 21 districts||The Registration Department has successfully completed a pilot project for automatic patta name transfer, and is awaiting the green signal to adopt the system throughout Tamil Nadu in phases. It is waiting for a date from Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to launch the service in the 21 districts where it was tested. A senior official of the Department said the project was initiated following a similar experiment in Perambalur district, where land documents since 1865 had been digitised. The Perambalur model helped in implementing the automatic transfer of patta by integrating the Star 2 software of the Registration Department with the digital database of the Commissioner of Survey and Settlements in 21 districts. The 21 districts having only the rural area database, including Chengalpattu, Ariyalur, Thoothukudi, Thirupathur, Theni, Erode and Namakkal, were selected. The official said the automatic patta transfer in these districts would be applicable to sale documents in the ‘not involving sub-division’ (NISD) category, and not to sale deeds or settlements in the ‘involving sub-division’ category. The official said the system involved the verification of sale documents under the category of NISD. With all documents in order, the patta name would automatically be transferred in the Sub-Registrar Office itself; the buyer need not go to the Tahsildar’s office. Many property owners have complained that the patta name transfer is a cumbersome process, in which those buying properties have to apply to the Tahsildar concerned by uploading all sale documents at e-Seva centres. Based on the application, a surveyor would be deputed to inspect the property, after which the name transfer would be done in the patta. The name transfer done at the registration office itself would bring relief to the owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/automatic-patta-name-transfer-project-piloted-in-21-districts/article33928294.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the interim direction on a batch of four public interest litigation petitions filed by activist Rangarajan Narasimhan complaining about mistreatment meted out to temple elephants. He accused the Forest Department and Animal Welfare Board of India of failing to monitor the welfare of such animals. Referring to a video of Srivilliputtur Andal temple elephant Jayamalyatha being beaten up by its mahout and another caretaker at a rejuvenation camp in Thekkampatti of Coimbatore district, the judges wrote that some temple elephants might actually not be treated well “as was evident from a video which went viral on the social media a couple of days ago.” Ill treatment of animals Coming down hard on such ill treatment of animals, the Bench said: “Any kind of mistreatment of elephants and other animals must be dealt with promptly and as mercilessly as such persons deal with the animals. Exploitation of animals for all purposes should be stopped except for limited government-controlled exercises such as horse-riding or camel-riding on the beaches.” Even such rides should not be allowed to be operated by private individuals since the treatment of the animals could not be checked or monitored, the Bench said and granted time till April 27 for the State government to come up with comprehensive policy and guidelines on rehabilitation of all animals including elephants which had been lured away from their natural habitats. Adequate measures must be put in place to ensure that the elephants were not exploited any more in the State for joy rides or used as beasts of burden to transport heavy material, the judges added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/frame-comprehensive-policy-on-ownership-of-elephants-hc/article33929106.ece

Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa made Tamil Nadu a role model for other States in the areas of welfare and development, AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Wednesday. Addressing a public meeting in R.K. Nagar, Chennai, to mark Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary, Mr. Palaniswami said the two leaders were known for philanthropy. “Ours is a party that gives away [assistance] to people, whereas the DMK is a spoiler,” the Chief Minister said. Giving an account of the various welfare measures undertaken by his government, Mr. Palaniswami accused DMK president M.K. Stalin of “indulging in nitpicking” and reiterated his challenge of a direct debate with Mr. Stalin. The Chief Minister assured the minorities that his party would work for the interests of the community, and this was the policy of the party since the days of MGR.

25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corpn. contractors seek permission to carry up to Rs. 15 lakh after poll code comes into force||Coimbatore Corporation Contractors’ Welfare Association has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to Election Commission of India (ECI) to permit its members with an annual turnover above Rs. 10 crore to carry up to Rs. 15 lakh in cash after the model code of conduct comes into force for the Assembly elections. The association claimed that its members had to face lot of difficulties during the 2019 Parliamentary elections when individuals were not allowed to carry more than Rs. 50,000 in cash at a time and had to produce several documents to get back the money seized by officials on election duty. Therefore, it had made a representation on the issue, well in advance, to the ECI. Suggestion to EC An affidavit filed by the association, through its counsel V. Elangovan, stated that it had made a suggestion to the Election Commission of India on February 17 that contractors could be categorised into those with an annual turnover of Rs. 2 crore, Rs. 2.1 to Rs. 5 crore, Rs. 5.1 to Rs. 10 crore and over Rs. 10 crore and permitted to carry up to Rs. 2 lakh, Rs. 5 lakh, Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 15 lakh respectively. Stating that its members obtain contracts from the corporation for works worth Rs. 2 crore to Rs. 650 crore, the association said they have to necessarily carry huge amount of cash all the time for meeting expenses such as paying wages to the labourers, purchasing materials, settling bills and so on. Imposing curbs on such cash handling during elections stifles their business, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corpn-contractors-seek-permission-to-carry-up-to-rs-15-lakh-after-poll-code-comes-into-force/article33928837.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refrains from setting aside Tangedco’s Rs. 1,330-cr. tender for supplying imported steam coal||The Madras High Court on Wednesday refrained from setting aside a Rs. 1,330 crore tender floated by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) on February 8 for supply of 20 lakh tonnes of imported steam coal of any origin to be delivered at the Kamarajar port in Ennore between May 2021 and May 2022. Justice B. Pugalendhi, however, directed Tangedco to strictly comply with Section 9(3) of the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998, and publish the tender notification in Indian Trade Journal , a standard medium for public advertisements, so that a greater number of domestic and international bidders could participate in the process and quote competitive prices. Though Tangedco had originally given only 15 days for submitting the bids as against the statutory requirement of a minimum of 30 days for such high-value tenders, the judge recorded the submission of Advocate-General Vijay Narayan and Additional Advocate- General P.H. Arvindh Pandian that the last date had now been extended till March 10. Rush-through process The judge recorded Mr. Narayan’s submission that Tangedco had to rush through the process by initially giving just 15 days for submitting bids because it had to take into consideration the requirement of coal by the thermal power plants during summer and also the code of conduct that would have to be observed on account of the Assembly election. The Advocate-General also told the court that what was being imported was just 6% of the requirement of the thermal power stations in the State, and the imported coal was actually mixed with about 180 lakh tonnes of domestic coal, procured from Indian coal companies, to achieve a certain calorific value. Concurring with the law officers that Tangedco must be prepared to meet the energy requirements during summer, the judge granted liberty to the power utility to approach the Election Commission of India for permission to move forward with the process if the code of conduct came into force before the finalisation of the tender. The orders were passed while the court disposed of writ petitions filed by two private firms — one based in Thoothukudi and the other in Indonesia. The firms had challenged the tender notification on the grounds of Tangedco not having given 30 days’ time for submitting bids and its failure to publish the notification in Indian Trade Journal as mandated under the 1998 Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refrains-from-setting-aside-tangedcos-rs-1330-cr-tender-for-supplying-imported-steam-coal/article33928292.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Minister urges unions to drop transport strike||Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar on Wednesday appealed to the transport unions to call off Thursday’s strike as Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had announced interim relief to the employees of the State Transport Corporation. Nine unions, including the LPF, the CITU and the INTUC, have called for the strike on Thursday. The Minister told presspersons that Mr. Palaniswami had announced an interim relief of Rs. 1,000 a month to all the employees of the State Transport Corporation till the wage agreement was completed. The term of the last wage agreement ended in September 2019. The government would continue to hold talks with the unions over the wage agreement. To a question on the possible disruption in services, he said the department had taken steps to maintain normal services. Mr. Vijaybhaskar said Rs. 536 crore had been allocated to pay retirement benefits to employees from January to April. A senior official said a contingency plan had been worked out to operate as many buses as possible. He said the department had requested the police to tighten security and ensure that members of the public were not put to hardship because of the strike. The Minister held a meeting with senior officials. The official said as schools were not functioning in a full-fledged manner because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the commuter traffic was not heavy, there would not be any major disruption in MTC bus operations. At present, about 3,000 buses were being operated in the city. The department had warned the transport employees that those participating in the strike would be not be paid salary for the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-urges-unions-to-call-off-transport-strike/article33928818.ece
25 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Child rights manifesto for election released||From strengthening mechanisms to monitor female infanticide to encouraging the participation of children in gram sabhas, a child rights manifesto with various demands for the Tamil Nadu Assembly election was released in the city on Wednesday. The manifesto was prepared by the Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch (TNCRW), the Campaign Against Child Labour - Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, the Forum for Promotion of Child Participation - Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and the Right to Education Forum - Tamil Nadu. It was released by Justice S. Vimala, full-time member, Tamil Nadu Law Commission. One of the main demands was to strengthen the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994. “This includes the formation of a task force, with the participation of civil society organisations, to handle the issue of dropping child sex ratio in the State, as revealed by the Census 2011 and the National Family Health Survey IV (2015–16). The issue of female infanticide is serious and needs urgent attention,” said Andrew Sesuraj M., professor, Loyola Knowledge Hub for Excellence in Child Protection. He said that anganwadi centres should be upgraded on a par with private play schools and their timings should be extended. “Besides, the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, needs to be extended from newborns to 18 years of age, guaranteeing free, quality and equitable education to all children compulsorily,” he added. Another demand is to stop closing down government schools in the name of merging of schools; measures should be taken to strengthen the admission and attendance of the children. The manifesto also spoke about reopening schools immediately and providing mask, sanitiser, soap, and other COVID-19 essentials free of cost in the schools itself. "Until schools reopen, teachers should visit the children at home and teach. This will reduce school dropouts and incidents of violence against children at home," said A. Devaneyan, activist and director of Thozhamai. The manifesto stressed on the need for the rules concerning the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights to be revisited and strengthened. “The Commission should be given full autonomy, funds, infrastructure and human resources to transact the mandate for protecting and promoting child rights,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/child-rights-manifesto-released/article33928824.ece

Stalin and many other legislators last year for having displayed gutkha sachets in the House in July 2017. Justices R. Subbiah and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup allowed petitions moved by the appellants to dispense with the production of certified copies of the single judge’s order and instead permit the filing of the appeals on the basis of web copies. The appeals had been filed against orders passed by Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana on February 10. Allowing a batch of writ petitions filed by the legislators, the judge set aside the fresh show cause notices issued to them by the Committee of Privileges in September 2020. The original notices issued in 2017 were quashed by a Division Bench of the court in August 2020 with liberty to proceed further if the committee was still of the view that any of the privileges of the House had been breached. On the strength of such liberty, the Committee had issued fresh notices which were set aside by the single judge and hence the present appeals.

25 February 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Textile industry has opportunities in infrastructure, healthcare: Smriti Irani||The Indian textile and clothing sector has several opportunities in the infrastructure and healthcare sectors, Union Minister for Textiles Smriti Zubin Irani has said. Inaugurating the Global Textile Conclave, organised virtually by the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, on Wednesday, the Minister said the Union Budget this year had proposed capital expenditure of Rs. 1 lakh crore in infrastructure projects next financial year and another Rs. 1 lakh crore in railways. The Jal Jeevan Mission of the Union Government was not only to provide clean drinking water but also to develop water bodies in rural areas. These were also markets for the textile industry to focus on. The National Mission on Technical Textiles was to enhance the research capabilities, technology and production of technical textiles in India. There were opportunities in Buildtech, Meditech, etc. “The PPE story of India is historic,” she said. There were about 1100 companies that make PPEs in India while there were none before the pandemic. “This strength should become the foundation for the textile industry's growth,” she said. The Production Linked Incentive scheme of the Centre highlighted some product lines where India needed to become self-reliant and globally competitive. The seven mega textile parks announced in the Budget should attract investments. However, the industry should also look at how the MSME units could benefit from these opportunities. The Minister urged the industry to look at the challenges and the need for good technology that was effective for the silk sector and diversification in the jute sector. In his message for the conference, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government was taking comprehensive measures for the textile industry. It had implemented several programmes to upscale infrastructure. Contribution of the textile sector was vital for building a self-reliant India. Integrating the industry with technology was a focus area. Indian textile industry should continue to innovate as well as research extensively to tap new markets. The impact of the pandemic showed how the industry could leverage on technology and convert challenges into opportunities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/textile-industry-has-opportunities-in-infrastructure-healthcare-minister/article33928323.ece

The anicut is located about 15 km from Gobichettipalayam on River Bhavani and its picturesque waterfall attracts tourists from other districts and from Karnataka.

Responding to a report “Hindi in name boards at Erode Railway station condemned”, published in these columns on February 16, B. Guganesan, Chief Public Relations Officer, Southern Railway, said the trilingual name boards were installed as per the Act. The report was based on a letter addressed to Railway Minister by K.N.

He had, among other things, objected to Hindi being used in 'No Parking' boards on the station premises. Mr. Guganesan said the names were in trilingual at the Erode station and in the rest of Tamil Nadu only as per the Act. New boards In view of the General Manager’s annual inspection, the name boards were repainted and some were replaced with new boards.

Out of about 50 mini-buses being operated in Karur, 45 offered free rides to the passengers throughout the day due to an initiative of the AIADMK unorganised workers’ wing and owners of these vehicles. Transport Minister and district secretary of AIADMK M.R. Vijayabaskar claimed that the private bus operators readily accepted the proposal when he mooted the idea as a mark of paying respect to Jayalalithaa. According to him, Jayalalithaa played a lead role in the growth of the public transport system in the State. While the AIADMK had borne the operational cost including diesel and salary to the crew, the bus operators sacrificed the day’s revenue.

25 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic pulled down revenues since April last, says Minister||Revenue Minister R. B. Udhayakumar on Wednesday explained the projected debt burden of the State crossing Rs. 5 lakh-crore citing revenue shortfall since April 2020 following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. He told journalists in Madurai that despite the fall in tax share from the Union government during the crisis, the State government had spent on the pandemic. Likewise, when cyclones and floods hit the coastal districts last year, the government took it as a challenge and overcame the hurdles. The farmers lost their crop and normal life of the working class was hit. Hence, the government had to extend financial assistance to the people. However, with trends looking upward, the economy was set to revive soon. On Leader of Opposition M.K. Stalin, the Minister claimed that even his father and late DMK leader M. Karunanidhi did not desire to see him in the Chief Minister’s seat. M.r Udhayakumar, who garlanded former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s statue at Amma temple near Thirumangalam on her 73rd birth anniversary, claimed people would not want Mr. Stalin as Chief Minister as his father did not wish to see him in the post. He accused the DMK leader of spreading misinformation about the AIADMK. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami would continue to lead the State after the elections, he felt. Asked about the petrol anddiesel price increase, Mr. Udhayakumar said that the government was taking steps to give some relief to consumers and talks were on with the Centre. Finance Secretary S. Krishnan had already explained that the levies of the Tamil Nadu government were not a cause for the higher petrol prices. Statue garlanded Earlier, in Madurai city, Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju, accompanied by party functionaries, garlanded the statue of Jayalalithaa on K.K. Nagar Main Road. In many southern districts, MLAs, former MPs and councillors took out processions and garlanded the statue of the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-pulled-down-revenues-since-april-last-says-minister/article33928306.ece

25 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘BJP did not want Congress rule in U.T. during Modi’s visit’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) executed its plan to see that the Congress government did not exist in the Union Territory when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Puducherry on Thursday, former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said on Wednesday. “The BJP did not want a Congress government in the Union Territory during Mr. Modi’s visit. They engineered defections in the Congress and the DMK by threatening legislators using the Central agencies and lured them using money power. The same shameful act, done in other States, was repeated in the Union Territory,” he said, addressing an agitation organised by the Secular Democratic Progressive Alliance near Anna Statue. He said the BJP owed an explanation to the people of Puducherry for destabilising a democratically elected government just days before the announcement of the Assembly election, he said. “BJP candidates will lose their deposits like they lost during the last Assembly election. The AINRC and AIADMK that allied with the BJP to topple the government will lose badly in the next election. Even if some of their candidates get elected, the BJP will win them over to their camp, as was done in Haryana,” the Chief Minister said. Member of Parliament and VCK chief Thol. Thirumavalavan said the BJP had adopted an “uncivilised” way to destabilise a democratically-elected government. “They have done a good thing. The people of the Union Territory will now see through its plans and will certainly re-elect the Congress-led government,” Mr. Thirumavalavan said. He urged the people to exercise their franchise so that the BJP and those who supported it to topple the government, including defectors from the Congress and the DMK, do not get elected in the poll. MPs V. Vaithilingam (Congress) and D. Ravikumar (VCK), former Congress Ministers M. Kandasamy and M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, former Minister and DMK leader S. P Sivakumar, CPI secretary A.M.

They charged that the officials at the paddy direct procurement centres were demanding Rs. 1.50 per kg towards loading and unloading charges, which should be borne by the government. They also complained that the officials were refusing to buy the paddy decoloured by the unseasonal rains in January. Another group of farmers said the crop loans availed from the Mahendravadi Cooperative Society near Sankarankovil were not waived. Those who suffered crop damage due to wild animal invasion urged the officials to give compensation for the loss. They also demanded the appointment of District Forest Officer for the newly formed Tenkasi district. When the farmers appealed to the Collector to evict encroachments in the waterbodies and the instalation of boundary marker stones after proper survey, Dr. Sameeran assured that it would be done shortly wherever it was required. Personal Assistant to Collector (Agriculture) Balasubramanian said the district, which would get annual average rainfall of 817 mm, recorded 153 mm rainfall from January to February (till February 24) against the average rainfall of 80 mm during this period.

25 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bharathidasan University student bags fellowship||A student of Life Science department of Bharathidasan University Sushmitha Krishnan has been granted the UNESCO TAGe (Talking Across Generations on Education) Fellowship in recognition of her effective participation in a global dialogue with senior decision-makers organised by Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Education & Peace (MGIEP). A student of integrated programme at the university, Sushmitha Krishnan, who was among the six youths chosen from across the globe to take part in the TAGe dialogue held between August 28 and September 1 last year had voiced her concern over the education system revolving around the theme ‘reimagining education.’ She demanded education to be a joyful experience and students are equipped to face the 21st century challenges. She stressed the need for youth to rethink education from the perspective of emotional resilience with elements such as compassion, empathy and mental wellness. Senior decision makers who took part in the global dialogue included Aishath Ali (Minister of Education, Maldives); Ambassador Antonio Novoa (Ambassador of Portugal to UNESCO) and Akpezi Ogbuigwe (Founder, Anpez Centre for Environment and Development, Nigeria). After the panel discussion, the selected youth were awarded a TAGe fellowship to work closely with the UNESCO MGIEP officials and senior policy makers to fine-tune a policy brief titled ‘reimagining education’, depicting the collective thoughts of youth worldwide in global discourses such as the Futures of Education Initiative and the International Science and Evidence-based Education Assessment (ISEEA) of UNESCO. Her article titled ‘Teachers of the future – our demands and dreams’ has been published in Blue dot, the flagship journal of UNESCO MGIEP in the February 2021 issue. The selected youth are engaged in different activities of UNESCO like planning and moderating other series of TAGe. Ms. Sushmita was felicitated by M. Selvam, Vice-Chancellor; G. Gopinath, Registrar; and N. Thajuddin, Programme Co-ordinator of the five-year Integrated M.Sc.

25 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Use of banned plastic materials resumes||Use of single-use plastic materials has surfaced in the city due to a let-up in enforcement of the ban imposed by the State government early last year. The government had banned the use and sale of plastic carry bags, cups and plates, plastic straws and plastic flags from January 2019. The ban meant that sale, manufacture and storage of the banned plastic items was an offence. Immediately after the ban was imposed, officials used to carry out frequent raids on stockists, dealers, shopkeepers, manufacturers and retail merchants. The strong enforcement effectively prevented the use of single-use plastics to a substantial extent. With the support of line departments, the Tiruchi Corporation and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board officials used to conduct raids at regular intervals, forcing people to use cloth bags to buy vegetables, groceries and other essential items. But, now, a number of shopkeepers, especially street vendors and hawkers, could be seen using the banned single-use plastic carry bags. The people, too, choose to use plastic bags for buying vegetables and fruits. “A section of customers still demand carry bags to carry fruits. If I refuse, they go to other vendors. Each and every customer is important for me. I am forced to buy carry bags to pack fruits,” says a hawker on Thillai Nagar. The practice of taking along carry bags could be curbed in totality only if it is not available in the market. The current situation is that the stockists and dealers have the ‘use and throw’ plastic bags in plenty. N. Jamaludeen, a consumer activist in Tiruchi, said accumulation of plastic waste on street corners and thickly populated areas was quite evident. Token raids on stockists and shopkeepers could not eradicate the menace. A time-bound action was required to effectively control the use of carry bags, he said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/use-of-banned-plastic-materials-resumes/article33928274.ece
25 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Long wait for FASTag at toll plazas continues||Inadequate kiosks to get FASTags at some of the toll plazas on National Highways has forced the motorists to wait for long hours. Ever since the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) doubled the toll fee for the motorists, who fail to fix FASTags on their vehicles, from February 16 there has been a surge to get FASTag at toll plazas on National Highways. Special kiosks have been set up near the toll plazas to distribute FASTag. In some places private banks have deployed personnel to process and distribute FASTag. Though the number of motorists, who have installed FASTag on their vehicles, has gone up significantly over the period, nearly one third of them continue to pay cash at toll plazas as usual. The motorists, who were not familiar with the system, often enter into arguments with the toll employees when they demand double fee for allowing them to proceed further on toll roads. A section of them prefer to get FASTag installed on their vehicles before proceeding further. They have to produce the registration certificate of the vehicles, Aadhaar card or Permanent Account Number for the FASTag. At the toll plaza at Ponnambalapatti on Tiruchi-Dindigul Highway, there is just a kiosk functioning for processing FASTag applications. At any point of time at least 25 to 40 motorists stand at the kiosk to get the tag. It takes at least 45 minutes to process and activate FASTag for a person. It depends on the Internet connectivity. As the day progresses, the queue becomes longer. “I am waiting for more than 90 minutes for my turn. It should have at least three or four kiosks at each toll plaza for processing tag applications,” said T. Kamalakannan of Tiruchi. The motorists were asked to pay Rs. 550 for activation. Moreover, those who possess smart phones only, could get the tags. Others were asked to visit banks to get the tags. “The system supports only to those, who have smart phones and digital payment options. I am not familiar with smart phones as I have a basic mobile phone. So I couldn’t get the tag and I was forced to pay double fee. It is unfair,” rued A. Bose of Dindigul, a driver of a mini load carrier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/long-wait-for-fastag-at-toll-plazas-continues/article33928270.ece

25 February 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||‘Pay Rs. 20,000 to aggrieved consumer’||The District Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum has directed the e-commerce portal - Snapdeal and one of its vendors Just Shopping Private Limited Bangalore to replace a faulty smart phone sold to a customer and directed the respondents to pay Rs. 20,000 to the aggrieved consumer for deficiency in service. According to petitioner Abdul Rahman of Tirunelveli, he placed an order for iPhone, costing about Rs. 39,000, on Snapdeal on April 18, 2016 and he received the product from the vendor by courier on April 21, 2016. When the iPhone developed a technical snag within a week due to overheating and consequently hanged up quite often, the consumer registered a complaint with the portal’s customer care section, who told the buyer that the faulty phone would be collected from him shortly. Subsequently, the phone was collected on May 9 and was informed on May 12 that the phone had been handed over to the person concerned for further action. Since the replacement of the faulty phone with the new one got delayed, Mr. Abdul sent the second mail to the e-commerce portal seeking the refund of Rs. 39,000. He was told by the customer care executive that neither the replacement nor refund of the amount would be made. Hence, he approached the District Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum. Following submissions made by both parties, Forum chairman Devadoss and members Sivamoorthi and Muthulakshmi directed Snapdeal and Just Shopping Private Limited that the faulty iPhone be replaced with a new one within a month. Moreover, the forum also ordered to pay Mr. Abdul within a month Rs. . 20,000, including Rs. 15,000, for deficiency in service and Rs. 5,000 towards cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pay-rs-20000-to-aggrieved-consumer/article33928309.ece

He told officials that strict action to ensure mask wearing was missing. He cautioned them against letting their guard down. Dr. Radhakrishnan pointed out that mandatory masking was less than 10% in most public places. Maharashtra was already in the midst of a new wave, and Tamil Nadu, too, for the last 15 days, had been witnessing localised clusters, where families and individuals who had attended functions were testing positive for the infection. The numbers had not risen dramatically in Tamil Nadu, he said, adding, “We should not be complacent. Contact-tracing, containment, early initiation of treatment and follow-up of all protocols and Standard Operating Procedures should be reviewed regularly.” On the Centre deputing a multi-disciplinary team to Tamil Nadu, besides a few other States, he said there was no specific reason. “Our numbers are in the range of 450 to 500 and case positivity is about 1%. Other States have had a spurt in cases and positivity rate. They also look at the overall absolute numbers.” As per data, on February 23, Maharashtra recorded a positivity rate of 9.2%, while Kerala had 5.8%. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Gujarat had a positivity rate between 1% and 1.7%, while Tamil Nadu’s figure was 0.9%. The Health Secretary also called for steps to improve vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vigil-stepped-up-at-border/article33928283.ece

He was speaking after inaugurating gymkhana activities for the coming academic year at Karnataka Law Society’s Raja Lakhamagouda Law College. “In these days of increasing stress, everyone needs to maintain good physical and mental health. To achieve anything on life you need hard work and dedication. But to sail through difficult situations and to face success and failure with equanimity, you need training in sports. Sportsmanship is the most important thing as life as it helps you face challenges but does not leave you upset about the result of your actions,” he said. A.H. Hawaldar, principal, said that the college was looking forward to a new year full of activity and events. “COVID-10 and the lockdown took away a lot of time and caused some disruptions in our academic and co -curricular calendar. But it has given us time to introspect and come up with new and innovative ideas,” he said. He urged young law students to develop an interest in sports. “Sportsmanship was essential to lawyers as there is no guarantee of success in each case,” he said. The council of counsellors including general secretary Shreya Utture, ladies’ representative Pooja Badkundri, and other secretaries, Vaishnavi Vibhute, Nivedita Dixit, Haiyalappa, Kshama Bhat, Vaishnavi Kulkarni, Samiksha Mahadik, Rohit Latur, Manasi Jigajinni, Priyanka Rathi, Rucha Ashtaputre and Khushi Kathariya, was sworn in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-urged-to-take-part-in-sports-to-prepare-for-life/article33928372.ece

Due to a lack of awareness about the standard operating procedure, several passengers were not carrying the certificates and they were sent back. Nirmala Patil, a resident of Belagavi, complained that members of her family, who were traveling to Belagavi from Kolhapur, were sent back as they did not have the certificates. Sangam Rangadal, a resident of Nippani, complained that his young nephew, who had gone to Sangli for treatment, was forced to stay there for two days as he did not have the certificate. “He has given his swab for testing today. He will get the result after three days and will be able to travel only after that,” he said. “Private vehicle companies in Karnataka and Maharashtra have been told not to issue tickets to those returning from Maharashtra without the negative RT-PCR reports,” Superintendent of Police Laxman Nimbaragi said. “ There is some confusion among travellers due to lack of knowledge about the checkpost guidelines. But the situation will stabilise in 3 to 4 days,” he said. Police, Revenue, and Health officers are managing five checkposts along the border in Belagavi district. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath visited some checkposts on the border on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/travellers-sent-back-at-border-for-not-having-rt-pcr-reports/article33928374.ece

At a meeting of district-level officers on Wednesday, Superintendent of Police Laxman Nimbaragi asked officers to check for all kinds of quarries and their licences. He asked officers to convey to quarry owners and workers that the government was not trying to close quarries but was trying to make sure that they used the explosives carefully, as per safety guidelines. He asked officers to ensure that all goods vehicles transporting stones, explosives, sand, and other extraction related materials were fitted with GPS locators. He asked officers to ensure that only licensed quarries were operating in forest areas. He set a deadline of March 31 to provide a detailed report on the status of quarries and the use of explosives. S. Bindan, district geologist, said that explosions were caused by some workers who were using kerosene and petrol to trigger blasts, in violation of rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-to-check-for-quarries-without-permits/article33928377.ece

25 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Handicraft exhibitions are back||The return of handicraft exhibitions – Bengaluru Dastkar Bazaar, Handmade Collective and Vastrabharana – after last year’s break is likely to revive the businesses of artisans and craftspeople who were hit by the lockdown. According to the 2011 census, India has 70 lakh artisans, but the actual number now is much higher, if not double, say NGOs and organisers of handicraft exhibitions. Their livelihoods were affected by the inability to procure raw materials, the lack of cash reserves and the shut down of markets. Bojraj Ramkrishna, a tussar silk weaver from Vidarbha who runs a company, said he and his employees were at home for several months in 2020. “We usually make about Rs. 2 crore every year. Last year, we hardly made Rs. 5 lakh,” he added. Kalyan Jana, who makes hand-crafted mats in West Bengal, employs over 200 families. “Last year, I couldn’t hire them. We could neither find raw materials nor places to sell the mats. We usually make Rs. 25 lakh a year. In 2020, we made less than half of that,” he says. One of the reasons was the cancellation of exhibitions as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19. At such exhibitions, artists and artisans meet wholesale and retail buyers apart from selling to customers. They are a substantial source of income. Vidushini Prasad, a Bengaluru-based Madhubani artist, makes about Rs. 4 lakh a year by selling her paintings. About 75% of her income, she says, comes from such exhibitions. “We are relieved that they are being organised this year,” she said. The 16th edition of Bengaluru Dastkar Bazaar began on February 19 at the Jayamahal Palace Hotel. The 10-day event, organised by Dastkar, an NGO that supports craftspeople, features more than a hundred groups from over 20 States. According to Shelly Jain, the event’s head of programs and personnel, they make business of approximately Rs. 2 crore during every exhibition. “Last year, artisans struggled a lot without raw materials. We got donations of about Rs. 1 crore. But the market is essential for their livelihoods. Everyone can breathe a little easy now,” she said. Shift to online Some of the more tech-savvy craftspeople used the Internet to reach out to customers. But Shelly says it is not easy for everyone to do so. “There are quite a few logistical issues. When you sell online, the photos of your products must look good. But how can small-time sellers hire professional photographers? You should find a way to courier these products. What if a customer wants to return the product? These are some of the obstacles to selling online,” she added. Vidushini, a member of A Hundred Hands, a non-profit trust for handicraft workers, had a similar opinion. “The online medium was helpful in a way. I used it to connect with other artists last year, teach them how to leverage social media to sell their products and conducted painting workshops through which I made some money. But I hardly made any money through online sales,” she said. A Hundred Hands had organised The Handmade Collective at the Bangalore International Centre, with the two-day exhibition ending on February 21. It featured over 65 artisan groups, of which more than 40 were from rural areas, according to Mala Dhawan, the founder trustee of A Hundred Hands. After The Handmade Collective and Bengaluru Dastkar Bazaar, Crafts Council of Karnataka's exhibition, Vastrabharana, will begin on March 5 at Chitrakala Parishat. Although sarees will be the main attraction of this five-day exhibition, hand-woven dhotis, ghagra cholis, jewellery and other accessories will be on sale too. Local artistans, like Vidushini, as well as those from other States, like Bojraj and Kalyan, hope the following fortnight will be a fruitful one.

25 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Illegal quarrying at the root of unregulated use of explosives’||The gelatin stick blast that left six dead near a quarry in Chickballapur district on Tuesday has underscored the rampant problem of illegal trade of explosives and their unscientific handling in the State. Ever since six people were killed in a similar blast in Shivamogga district last month, agencies, mainly the Internal Security Division (ISD) of the State police, have launched a crackdown on illegal procurement and storage of explosives. The ISD has booked more than 20 cases across the State so far, including against the quarry in Chickballapur whose six employees were killed in the Tuesday’s explosion. But this is unlikely to prevent another similar disaster, for the explosives’ market can be regulated by only putting a stop on illegal quarrying and not just by a crackdown on their illegal sale — a politically sensitive issue given the collusion of several politicians in the quarry business, opine police and Revenue officials who are part of the crackdown. Presently, the law is stringent on the sale, storage, and use of explosives in quarries. A licensed explosive dealer should report all the sales to the district administration and should in person go and supervise the explosion at the quarry. “An illegal quarry or a firm carrying out quarrying beyond the licensed area cannot afford legal records of all the explosives they buy. This has created a black market for explosives in the State. Unregulated sale of explosives is the symptom, while illegal quarrying is the disease,” said a tahsildar who did not wish to be named.  Collusion Illegal quarrying and the alleged collusion of politicians and officials has created an ecosystem for illegal trade of explosives, activists point out. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah asked how explosives could be illegally transported even across the State border from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh without being detected at checkposts, hinting at a well-oiled corrupt mechanism in place. “The Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh has a long history of use of explosives in political and factionist violence, which has created illegal explosive manufacturing units. This also finds its way into Karnataka. The source of explosives in Shivamogga was from this region. In Chickballapur too, the origin is likely to be the same region,” said another officer, calling for strict vigil along the inter-State border. Explosives so procured illegally, are handled by labourers at the quarries who are not trained to handle them, often causing accidents. “There are strict protocols for both their storage and use in explosions. But those who use them at the quarries are completely ignorant. For instance, detonators and explosive material must not be stored together. Detonators are so sensitive that even a mobile phone signal could possibly trigger an explosion. In Chickballapur, they were put in the same gunny sack. Even a slight friction could have set off the explosion,” an explosive expert from the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad said. Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh R. Nirani has said that the department would set up a school of mines on the lines of a similar institute in Dhanbad, Jharkhand, to train the workforce in scientific mining, including the use of explosives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/illegal-quarrying-at-the-root-of-unregulated-use-of-explosives/article33928561.ece
25 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two delivery boys killed in hit-and-run incident||In less than a day, the Yeshwanthpur traffic police tracked down and arrested a motorist who ran down two delivery personnel in the wee hours of Tuesday. The incident took place near a residential apartment on BFW Road off Tumkur Road around 1.15 a.m. According to the police, the deceased, Gowtham M. (21) and Sreekanth (27), lived in Manjunathanagar and worked as delivery partners for a private firm. They were on their way home after delivering a parcel in Yeshwanthpur. “Preliminary investigations revealed that their scooter was hit by a speeding car heading in the same direction. They were flung out of the two-wheeler on impact. The car driver did not stop but sped off. The accident was recorded by a CCTV camera installed in a residential building, but we could not make out the number plate,” said a police officer. Gowtham was riding the scooter while Sreekanth was on the pillion seat. They sustained severe injuries in the accident and were taken to a private hospital in the area where the doctors declared Sreekanth brought dead. Gowtham died while he was being taken to the Nimhans (National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences). Soon after the accident, the Yeshwanthpura traffic police rushed to the spot and collected a few pieces of registration number plate. The front portion of the car had shattered due to the impact of the accident, and they were able to get some parts of the licence plate. “We went to showrooms to identify the make of the car. Though there was CCTV footage recorded of the accident, it was not clear as it was dark,” a senior police officer said. He added that after inquiries with several showrooms, it was concluded that the car was a Chevrolet Captiva. Meanwhile, the police with the help of number plate pieces put together parts of the ten digit number and obtained details of around 15 cars registered in and around the city RTOs that met the criteria. After analysing each and every car, the team finally zeroed in on one car. It belonged to an owner of a travel agency at Madanayakanahalli, identified as Bharath (25). “We found the car in a garage where Bharath had left it for repair soon after the accident,” the police officer added. The police claim that Bharath initially tried to mislead them by stating that his friend had taken the car. After detailed questioning he finally allegedly confessed that he was behind the wheel. “He had gone to a hotel to get dinner and was driving home,” said the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-delivery-boys-killed-in-hit-and-run-incident/article33928801.ece
25 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NABARD projects State’s credit plan at Rs. 2,96,051 cr.||The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Regional Office, Karnataka, has projected the credit potential for the State at Rs. 2,96,051 crore for 2021–22, an increase of 21.05% over the projection made for 2020–21 of Rs. 2,44,564 crore. Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar released the State Focus Paper 2021–22 and said the credit potential for agriculture had been estimated at Rs. 1,45,213 crore for the year. The farm sector has been receiving less investment in the State as 55% farmers own less than one hectare, he said. Additional Chief Secretary and Development Commissioner Vandita Sharma said the credit flow to the farm sector from commercial banks during 2020–21 was not at all satisfactory. She appealed to bankers to be gentle in sanctioning loans to farmers and restructuring loans as the State witnessed both floods and droughts in the last few years. “Lending to agriculture is not up to the mark. The sector needs a big push to make farming an income-generating sector,” she said. Ms. Sharma also deplored the performance of banks in issuing Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) and said issuing KCCs needs to be picked up. About 44.9 lakh farmers had been given the KCCs. While farm credit, including credit for crop production, maintenance and marketing has been projected at Rs. 86,746 crore, credit for agricultural infrastructure has been estimated at Rs. 6,734 crore and for ancillary activities at Rs. 22,133 crore. The credit potential of a whopping Rs. 1,08,509 crore has been projected for micro, small, and medium enterprises for 2021–22. Export credit estimated at Rs. 4,503 crore, education – Rs. 5,387 crore, housing – Rs. 28,579 crore, renewable energy – Rs. 1,104 crore, and social infrastructure – Rs. 2,756 crore, said the SFP. Mrs. Sharma told banks to utilise the ‘FRUITS’ (farmer registration and unified beneficiary information system) portal to avail details of land of farmers while handling credit applications. Niraj K. Verma, CGM, NABARD, Karnataka, urged the bankers to put their efforts for successful implementation of the credit plan for doubling the farmers’ income. S. Rajendra Prasad, Vice-Chancellor of UAS, Bengaluru, said Krishi Vigyan Kendras would be ready to adopt farmers’ produce organisations to improve farm productivity and income.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nabard-projects-states-credit-plan-at-rs-296051-cr/article33928557.ece
25 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Leaders deliberate on declining values in parliamentary system||Politicians, including Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, along with representatives from a cross section of society on Wednesday deliberated on the declining values in the parliamentary system and possible measures to stem the decline. The programme, ‘An introspection — preventing the decline of parliamentary values’, was organised by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Karnataka, in the light of several unsavoury incidents in both Houses of the legislature, and also outside the House, in recent times. Mr. Siddaramaiah said that unless the electoral system was changed, the decline in parliamentary practices and values cannot be arrested. “Earlier people would fund elections of candidates. But now you have to pay for votes. Persons with criminal background, economically strong, and others have entered the electoral fray. Elections have become a trade or an auction place, all of which have changed the direction of elections.” He said the duration of the legislature sessions should be decided by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the Chairman of the Legislative Council. “It is not right for the government to decide. There is a rule that legislature sessions should be held for 60 days in a year and everyone has to adhere to it,” he added.  Ordinances Further, he pointed that legislation were being done in a hurry and without discussion. Ordinances are being promulgated in a day. “Opportunity has to be given for discussion.” The tenth schedule was brought to prevent defection of legislators, but they have found ways to circumvent it. Earlier, Mr. Yediyurappa said the decline was owing to politicians thinking that the country was there for them. “In the pre- independence time, politicians sacrificed for the country. The parliamentary system will succeed only when politicians think towards taking the government programmes to the needy.” He said it was the responsibility of both ruling and Opposition parties to see that there were no unfortunate incidents in both Houses of legislature. “We should introspect if we are doing enough.” Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and Legislative Council Chairman Basavaraj Horatti were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/leaders-deliberate-on-declining-values-in-parliamentary-system/article33928559.ece
25 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Opposition mounts over threat to Hesaraghatta grasslands||As one section of citizens are heaving a sigh of relief, albeit temporarily, after being assured that the tree park project inside Turahalli forest has been put on hold, opposition is mounting over threats to the Hesaraghatta grasslands. After a proposal to declare the grasslands as a conservation reserve was reportedly shot down in the last meeting of the State Wildlife Board, several members of the board are registering their dissent. At least three members have written dissent notes to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) against the proceedings of the January 19 meeting, which was chaired by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Sources said the Hesaraghatta conservation reserve proposal was shot down allegedly at the insistence of Yelahanka MLA S.R. Vishwanath, who is known to be close to the Chief Minister. Board members have since raised questions apart from objections about the MLA’s presence in the meeting. Board members said they are yet to receive the minutes of the meeting. Two members confirmed to The Hindu that they have formally voiced their dissent. “I have expressed my dissent. The issue of Hesaraghatta grasslands is very important and it has several ramifications. Many species will suffer. It needs to be discussed in detail,” said one of them. Another member said he too would be filing his objections. “Even before the meeting began, we were made to wait outside for over half-an-hour. The minutes of the meeting were not circulated in advance, and there were many changes,” he alleged. Tyag Uthapa, who has written to the PCCF, asked how the MLA was present in a core body meeting of the wildlife board. “Every subject was discussed, but the minute Hesaraghatta came up, he started started speaking. What’s the point of a core body when you have to brush aside our opinions? We were not given a chance to speak,” he said. Rail project Environmentalists are drawing parallels with what happened with the Hubballi-Ankola railway line project. Last year, the High Court of Karnataka directed that no further steps be taken based on the recommendation of the State Board for Wild Life, headed by the Chief Minister, on the proposal for diversion of 595.64 hectares of forest for the new project after pointing out that the decision-making process in the 14th meeting held on March 11 calls for closer scrutiny. The court had said that the decision was taken by allowing non-member Ministers to participate in the meeting held only 11 days after an earlier meeting in which it was unanimously decided to reject the proposal. Now, apart from online petitions to save the last remaining grasslands of Bengaluru gaining steam, conservationists and citizens are planning to approach Forest Minister Aravind Limbavali. The issue gains prominence especially in the wake of speculation that the grasslands are being considered as a potential site for a film city. Mahesh Bhat, a photographer and filmmaker who has been working on preserving the Arkavathy catchment for over 15 years, said they were awaiting the minutes of the meeting to know if the proposal has been deferred or rejected. Environmentalist Vijay Nishanth said the grasslands are a natural reserve that belongs to the entire city and citizens will launch an agitation if the government does not roll back its decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/opposition-mounts-over-threat-to-hesaraghatta-grasslands/article33928383.ece

A Bench passed the order on a petition filed by the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, and five private unaided schools questioning the circular issued on November 10, 2020. As per the guidelines issued in the circular, the existing school buildings are required to be assessed for structural fire safety norms applicable for educational institutions as per the National Building Code specification, obtain certificate from the authorities concerned, and renew certificate every five years. The schools also must obtain no-objection certificate from the Fire and Emergency Services and should build an overhead water tank having capacity to store 10,000 litres of water, as per the new guidelines.

25 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Mayor relaxes norms on trade licence||Chairing his final Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) council meeting as Mayor, Divakar on Wednesday relaxed the norms for renewal of trade licence of applicants operating from rented premises and allowed them to produce only the copy of trade licence granted earlier year along with last year’s tax paid receipt. Anybody having problem in producing the tax receipt can submit the application along with an undertaking stating the reason for not submitting it. Mr. Divakar passed this direction following councillors pointing out at problems faced by traders in getting their licenses renewed. Member Sudheer Shetty Kannur said officials are asking for a host of documents, including copy of the agreement between landlord and the tenant, khata and tax receipt, which was making renewal of trade licences cussmbersome. Councillor Vinayraj said so far only 1,000 traders have applied for renewal of trade license, which is among the main sources of revenue. Councillor Naveen R. D’Souza said ideally renewal should be done immediately after applicant has paid the licene fee and solid waste management cess. “I do not know why health inspectors are dragging their feet,” he said. Councillor Premanand Shetty said renewal should be done, as in the past, by accepting the copy of the last year’s trade licence copy. “There is no need for the MCC to ask any more documents from the applicant,” he said. Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said the civic body is asking the tax paid receipt as it will help in cross verification of property tax payment. “If applicants have any problem in submission of tax receipt, they can submit an undertaking accordingly and submit the application at the health section or to me,” he said added submission of agreement copy and khata has been made optional. The Mayor ordered for switching off of the sound system for a while following discussion related to the Karnataka High Court order staying works of Mangaluru Smart City Limited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mayor-relaxes-norms-on-trade-licence/article33928980.ece

25 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Congress’ manoeuvring in MCC helps keep BJP out of power||When Congress members failed to raise their hands in support of Shanthakumari, their party candidate for the mayoral polls in Mysuru on Wednesday, and instead backed the candidature of Rukmini Made Gowda, who was fieldedby the JD(S), it dawned on everyone that the Congress and the JD(S) had once again stitched together at the eleventh hour their alliance, which had been in tatters just hours earlier. Ms. Gowda of the JD(S) was elected the new Mayor of Mysuru, while the Congress’ Anwar Baig was elected Deputy Mayor. The 65-member Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is a hopelessly hung house, with the BJPhaving 22 members, the Congress 19, and the JD(S) 18, besides one BSP member and five Independents. The voting rights enjoyed by the other elected representatives of Parliament and the State legislature were also not enough for any single party to muster a majority in the MCC. Though the Congress and the JD(S) had entered into an alliance after the 2018 MCC polls and shared power during the first two years, the partnership had come under strain lately. Former Minister and Congress leader Tanveer Sait’s meetings with JD(S) leaders in the run-up to the mayoral polls had elicited no assurance from the latter. The JD(S) was also approached by leaders of the BJP, keen on having the party’s first Mayor in Mysuru. The suspense remained till hours before the mayoral polls on Wednesday when former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy sought to drive the final nail in the coffin on the alliance with the Congress by saying that the partnership between the two parties had collapsed because of Congress leader Siddaramaiah’s “arrogant” attitude towards the JD(S). Mr. Kumaraswamy had also given no assurance to the Minister in charge of Mysuru, S.T. Somashekar, when he called on him at the resort where he was parleying with party councillors. With no alliance emerging from the hectic political activity in the run-up to the polls, all three parties decided to field their own candidates for thepost of Mayor. Even Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar called Mr. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday morning with an appeal to continue the alliance, but the JD(S) leader said the matter had been left to the party councillors and a decision hadbeen taken to field a candidate for the post of Mayor. The turn of events during the voting caught most people by surprise. The Congress supported the JD(S) candidate for the Mayor’s post and the JD(S) returned the favour for the Deputy Mayor’s post, causing a major setback to the BJP. Different takes While R. Dhruvanarayan, former MP and a KPCC observer for the polls, said the Congress had decided to support the JD(S) to keep the “communal” BJP away from power, Mr. Kumaraswamy described the development as a “spontaneous” decision taken by the party’s councillors during voting. Mr. Kumaraswamy also thanked the Congress councillors for helping the JD(S) bag the Mayor’s post. Meanwhile, BJP leader and MP for Mysuru Pratap Simha scoffed at the Congress for not being able to support their own party candidate and accused the party’s councillors of betraying their own candidate. He claimed the developments were a setback to the Congress and to Mr. Siddaramaiah. Mr. Somashekar, meanwhile, said the Congress and JD(S) have been with each other notwithstanding the statements made by Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Siddaramaiah against each other’s parties. He expressed hope that the BJP would come to power in the MCC in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-manoeuvring-in-mcc-helps-keep-bjp-out-of-power/article33928550.ece
25 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Funds sought for terminal in Budget||The completion of the greenfield railway terminal at Naganahalli by 2024, as envisaged by the Railway Board, hinges to a large extent on the State government’s alacrity in land acquisition and allocation to the Railways. Though the Railway Board has included the Naganahalli terminal as a priority project and even sanctioned Rs. 19.99 crore for the financial year 2021-22, all eyes are on the State Budget, to be tabled in March, and the funding that could be made available for it by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Hence, MP for Mysuru Pratap Simha has impressed upon the district in-charge Minister, S.T. Somashekar, the imperatives of allocating a sizeable amount in the forthcoming Budget. Mr. Simha is also expected to meet the Chief Minister to press for a significant allocation for the railway terminal at Naganahalli. The cost of the project has been pegged at Rs. 789.29 crore, but the land has to be provided by the State government. The project requires 380 acres, of which 165 acres is required to kick-start the work and complete the first phase itself. This calls for a greater coordination between the Revenue Department officials and the Railways, and the authorities say that not an inch of land has been acquired though the project was originally mooted in 2007-08 and received the administrative nod in 2018. It is pertinent to recall that Mr. Yediyurappa himself had stated that the forthcoming budget would be downsized as a lot of resources had to be allocated towards fighting the pandemic. Besides, the State exchequer too has taken a hit owing to the COVID-19 lockdown and industries working at a fraction of their installed capacity for the greater portion of 2020. Naganahalli as a new terminal has been mooted to decongest the existing city railway station in Mysuru, which is landlocked and has no scope for expansion. The railway authorities also see merit in a greenfield railway terminal as a fallout of the completion of the track doubling work and electrification between Mysuru and Bengaluru. This will facilitate the introduction of new trains, but the Mysuru station is choked, handling nearly 100 trains a day. Also, the saturation of stations in Bengaluru is forcing the railway authorities to extend some of the trains till Mysuru or even Chamarajanagar as there is no scope for berthing and shunting of additional trains in Bengaluru. All this necessitates the creation of additional capacity and hence, Naganahalli has been mooted as an ideal station to develop a new terminal. But its completion by 2024 depends on land acquisition, which is yet to commence. The new terminal envisages the construction of six platforms — four in the first phase and two in the second phase — apart from laying four pit lines and eight stabling lines. This will complement the existing infrastructure at the city station, which has six platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/funds-sought-for-terminal-in-budget/article33928541.ece
25 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Activate Industrial Township Authority’||Mysore Industries’ Association (MIA) has urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to provide the necessary financial support and personnel to activate the Mysuru Industrial Township Authority. In its pre-Budget memorandum submitted to the Chief Minister in Bengaluru recently, MIA general secretary Suresh Kumar Jain and president Vasu said the State government had announced the setting up of the authority in the 2015-16 State Budget, based on the association’s request, but it was yet to become functional. They pointed out that the Mysuru District Industries Centre (DIC) had approved the setting up of the Industrial Township Authority in 2014-15. But the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has been seeking to include the 85 acres of land developed by Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) within the Outer Ring Road under its ambit. Also, the MCC has been issuing notices to industries for payment of property tax to it. Hence, Mr. Jain said, the government in the coming Budget should announce the necessary financial support for making the Mysuru Industrial Township Authority functional and also provide the necessary staff for the purpose. Referring to the electricity being provided to micro industries in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu at “cost of supply”, the MIA said Karnataka should extend a similar gesture and promote such industries. The MIA urged Mr .Yediyurappa to issue directions in this regard to ESCOMs in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/activate-industrial-township-authority/article33928551.ece
25 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Those converting to Christianity cannot claim benefits, says MP||Pratap Simha, MP for Mysuru, on Wednesday instructed officials to deny the benefits meant for tribals to those Adivasis who convert to Christianity. He was participating in theDistrict Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting. While reviewing the programme implementation, Mr. Simha apprised himself of the facilities being extended to Adivasis living in the hamlets and wished to know from the officials the developmentworks taken up there. In the context of nutrition, Mr. Simha questioned whether the tribals were receiving benefits as mandated by the government, including the supply of eggs to ensure their nutritional intake did not ebb. When the officials replied in the affirmative and said the supply of eggs continued through anganwadis and did not stop even during the pandemic and the prolonged lockdown, Mr. Simha remained sceptical. He asked why there was so much of conversion in the hamlets or hadis if all the benefits were indeed being extended to them. “They are being converted to Christianity. If they convert, you are not supposed to claim any facility and this was discussed even in Parliament,” the MP said. When the officials said converts were not receiving any benefits, Mr. Simha reiterated that those “wearing the cross” should not be given any facility. “Check again and filter such persons,” he instructed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/those-converting-to-christianity-cannot-claim-benefits-says-mp/article33928545.ece
25 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Chamarajanagar gets rapid action team to deal with emergencies||A District-Rapid Action Team (D-RAT) has been launched in Chamarajanagar, making it the first district in the State to have trained personnel for rapid response in the event of any disaster. The D-RAT training programme was inaugurated on Monday. It entails exercise, drills and training for 50 youngsters drawn from across the district to handle various kinds of disasters. A brainchild of the Chamarajanagar district administration, the training programme was launched byDeputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi. He said though every district has a disaster management plan, the administration tends to be hamstrung in the absence of trained personnel and does not get to turn the concept of rapid response into reality. He said the newly constituted D-RAT would help infuse confidence among members of the community. He urged the trained members also to work in that direction. He said the district administration tends to depend on the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) or the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) to handle any emergency, but the launch of D-RAT would enable the local authorities to take intervention and rescue measures in quick time. Mr. Ravi said this would also reduce the dependence and pressure on the NDRF and SDRF teams. The D-RAT members will be trained to handle any situation arising out of disasters such as flood, explosion, fire, earthquake, and accidents. Mr. Ravi also mooted the idea of roping in ex-servicemen to help bolster the capabilities of the newly constituted team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chamarajanagar-gets-rapid-action-team-to-deal-with-emergencies/article33928553.ece

Of the citizens surveyed, 90% felt a little or a lot more positive now about the police in Bengaluru than before the pandemic. The findings of the study, ‘Policing in Bengaluru during the COVID-19 pandemic’, were discussed at a webinar on Wednesday. As many as 525 residents across ages, gender and socio-economic backgrounds, were surveyed online. Citizens felt safer due to the noticeable increase in police presence on the streets and felt that overall the police did a good job during the pandemic. The study also noted that 70% citizens, who interacted more with the police during the pandemic than before, were more likely to indicate that they feel much safer. A majority of the respondents – 55 % to 69% – were, to a large extent, aware of the additional responsibilities that police undertook from enforcing lockdown to maintaining curfew once restrictions started to ease. Over 70% ‘strongly agreed’ that the police effectively dealt with their needs when they approached them. P.K.H. Tharakan, who was chief of the Research and Analysis Wing and former Director General of the Kerala Police, said that the police were given the primary duty of enforcing prescribed protocols. “At the beginning, they themselves did not know what preventive measures they had to take, and protective gear was scarcely available. Yet, they jumped into the fray with gusto. Many suffered the consequences, falling ill themselves and some succumbed. But in the process, the police personnel of this country endeared themselves to the common man,” he said. Isha Pant, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Command Centre, said, “We realised during this time that the barrier between the public and police broke. This pandemic provided a brilliant opportunity to show who we really are and that we can work with the public.” Expanding on the the way forward, Vikram Rai, General Secretary and Member-Governing Council, Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF), said that the engagement between the police and public needs to be taken forward at the ward and police station levels. The study noted that citizens felt that the police could be stricter where necessary and should continue creating awareness about the pandemic, be more attentive to and not forget ‘normal’ crimes, engage with communities, and not go back to their old ways.

The BBMP had taken up construction of underpasses at Wind Tunnel, Suranjan Das and Kundalahalli junctions as part of the project as early as 2019. However, progress has been slow, much to the chagrin of thousands of commuters using that stretch. At the Wind Tunnel junction, the land belonging to National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had already been acquired for the underpass. The work on the retaining wall on one side of the underpass is complete. Officials stated that once the traffic police give permission for diversions, work on the retaining wall on the other side could be taken up and completed in a few months. Reviewing the retaining walls already completed at Kundalahalli junction, the Administrator sought more details on the project and reasons for the delay. Civic officials attributed it to the acquisition process of 27 properties for the service road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/complete-signal-free-corridor-on-old-airport-road-by-september/article33928791.ece

A note from Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to the Chief Secretary on February 20 said that it had been brought to his notice that since its inception many people were misusing the system by providing fake names and fake addresses. The officials against whom complaints had been raised had been inconvenienced and official work was being hampered owing to investigation against such officials.  From October 2019 The government had allowed whistle-blower complaints to be anonymous and the system came to be implemented on October 3, 2019. The issue had been flagged by the State Government Employees’ Association that had said that officials could not work fearlessly owing to such complaints, and that the earlier order needed to be modified. The association had urged the Chief Minister that the complainant’s name and address had to be verified, and the decision to investigate against an official had to be taken only after ascertaining such basic information or documents against the officials that the complainant could provide. Mr. Yediyurappa in his note to the Chief Secretary directed that to enable officials to work fearlessly, to ensure administration does not get affected and to prevent the misuse of the system a suitable order in this regard had to be made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/order-on-anonymous-complaints-to-be-modified/article33928563.ece

She said a lot of people, especially from North Malabar, turned up at the IFFK festival in Thiruvananthapuram. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Paul said the committee would think of organising regional festivals or small events in the coming years. The experience had proved that there was a need to take the event to different places but the venue of the main festival would be never changed, she said. For those who loved movies the festival in the capital had become something of a pilgrimage, where they come by travelling a long way, meet each other, share their thoughts, exchange ideas and stay together, she observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/regional-film-festivals-under-consideration-bina-paul/article33928417.ece

25 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||COVID patients to be admitted at Aluva hospital from March 1||Nearly a month after it was supposed to have started functioning as a tertiary care centre for COVID-19, the Aluva District Hospital will begin admitting patients from March 1 onwards. While the facility will eventually be scaled up to treat 100 critically ill patients, it will be opened with a small number of beds, said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. The capacity to treat patients will be built up over a month, he added. The COVID-19 treatment centre is equipped with facilities for dialysis, emergency surgeries, gynaecology and paediatric wings. Surgeries for COVID-19 positive patients and pregnant women have been done so far only at the Government Medical College Hospital. The new facility is expected to ease the burden on the medical college hospital. Upgrading the facilities at the hospital cost around Rs. 1.50 crore. Around Rs. 14 lakh was allocated under disaster response funds in the district, while the rest was funded by the National Health Mission and the district panchayat. While a large chunk of the work is complete, some finishing elements are yet to be done, Dr. Numpeli said. Early in January, the District Collector had informed house surgeons and students of the medical college that it would be possible to get the Aluva District Hospital running as a COVID care facility by January 31. The students had sought resumption of all regular classes and inpatient facilities at the medical college for their training. Setting up power supply, an additional generator and a few other aspects for the block that was converted into the COVID care facility had caused the delay, Dr. Numpeli said. Facilities for non-COVID patients will continue at the hospital in all departments except the gynaecology wing which is being renovated. Additional staff is being appointed at the hospital, where 200 staff members are required. While a few appointments are being made via the National Health Mission, additional staff members will also have to be transferred to the district hospital from the PVS COVID care centre. As the facilities at the Aluva hospital expand, the number of patients at PVS Hospital will also be reduced, Dr. Numpeli said. 473 new cases The district recorded 473 new COVID-19 cases and 600 recoveries on Wednesday, when 8,383 samples were sent for testing. Four health workers have newly tested positive. Thrikkakara recorded the maximum number of new cases with 30 people testing positive. Thripunithura and Nedumbassery recorded 14 new cases each. A total of 9,183 people are recovering from the infection. As many as 7,790 people are recovering at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-patients-to-be-admitted-at-aluva-hospital-from-march-1/article33928954.ece

The foremost among them are works spearheaded by the agency under the Green Carpet scheme in Cherai beach, which is part of the Beach Circuit. “They include the project to build a toilet complex for differently-abled people. The much-awaited shelter for lifeguards posted at the beach and a watch tower above the building that would house the shelter. The scheme will thus be ready for launch in March,” said S. Vijayakumar, secretary of the DTPC. Kerala Tourism’s Green Carpet scheme is aimed at ushering in a sustainable destination-management system in Kerala through partnership and participation of regional stakeholders. New initiative Another initiative to roll out village life experience packages as part of Responsible Tourism initiative in Valanthakad Island is getting ready for launch in a week. This includes a floating facilitation centre which includes space for dining, mini refreshments and toilet facilities. A boat jetty and walkway here are expected to be ready by March end. Guests who arrive here will be able to walk around and see people engaged in traditional jobs and also making craft items. Morning and evening packages are on the anvil. WAPCOS was the implementing agency, Mr Vijayakumar said. The DTPC would also tender Rs. 98 lakh worth of renovation works at Ezhattumugham Prakriti Gramam Park located on the Ernakulam-Thrissur boundary. They include upgradation of eateries at the locale. Works will be completed in three months. The Rs. 5.50-crore pilgrim tourism amenity centre at Thiruvairanikulam Temple will be inaugurated this month. All amenities here would be readied in another two months, he said. The DTPC’s governing council meeting convened here on February 17 by District Collector S.

Challenges faced “The research initiative assumes significance in the wake of emerging seafood trade-related challenges faced by the fishermen targeting high-value resources and the export market players of India. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USA, had issued import strictures of strict adherence to norms laid out in the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of their country, stating that seafood exporting countries should not allow intentional killing of marine mammals in commercial fisheries. For exporting fish and fish products, the U.S. has given a five-year exemption period starting January 1, 2017, to nations for developing regulatory programmes by assessing marine mammal stocks, estimating by-catch, calculating by-catch limits, and reducing total by-catch,” according to a press release issued by the CMFRI. A joint initiative of the three agencies functioning under different ministries, the cruise is aimed at closely observing and monitoring of marine mammal stocks and scientific interaction, especially collecting oceanographic parameters, sources said. Game-changer “This research will emerge as a game-changer in conservation of marine mammals and reduction in the interaction of ecologically threatened species by ensuring uninterrupted export of the seafood and enhancing the livelihood of the fisheries sector. The mission is expected to lead to the genesis of a pioneering research project conceived and implemented by CMFRI with the financial assistance of the MPEDA and infrastructure support of the FSI,” said CMFRI Director A. Gopalakrishnan in the pressnote. R. Jeyabaskaran, Principal Investigator of the project, said that it focused on assessing the status of stock health of marine mammals and all species of sea turtles in Indian waters. “Marine mammals and sea turtles play key roles in maintaining marine ecosystems,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/survey-of-marine-mammals-in-eez/article33928492.ece
25 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Densely populated areas excluded from revised Thattekad ESZ||The revised Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of the Thattekad Bird Sanctuary by excluding the densely populated areas and incorporating suggestions mooted by the Central authorities will be submitted next week. The managers of the sanctuary had to go for the revised plan after the expert committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change for the declaration of ESZ around protected areas suggested modification to the proposal. The protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and tiger reserves, were asked to identify and mark the zone from their boundary. The park managers of Thattekad had suggested an area of 16 sq.km as ESZ with an extent ranging from zero to 1 km from the boundary of the sanctuary. They had also marked ESZ as zero on the eastern and south-eastern side, considering the high-density human habitation on these sides. Human habitations with high population density have been excluded from the purview of the zone in the revised proposal. There have been persistent demands from local residents and various organisations to exclude these thickly populated areas, said B. Rahul, the wildlife warden of the sanctuary. Three waterbodies, Palamattam, Koreya, and Kurikkulam, which are linked to the river Periyar, have been incorporated into the eco sensitive zone of the park as suggested by the expert committee. The three waterbodies together would account for 0.52 sq. km of area, he said. Incidentally, the expert committee had asked the park managers to explore the scope of expanding the ESZ extent from zero to a suitable distance on the eastern and south-eastern direction, where waterbodies exist. A digitized map of the ESZ and protected area would also be submitted as demanded by the panel, Mr. Rahul said. The sanctuary, which is located in Kothamangalam taluk, is home to one of the richest bird habitats in south India. The important fauna in the sanctuary include slender loris, tiger, leopard, elephant, mouse deer, and pangolin. Sloth bear, spiny dormouse, bonnet macaque, and jungle cat could also be seen in the sanctuary, according to the documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/densely-populated-areas-excluded-from-revised-thattekad-esz/article33928945.ece
25 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Stones believed to be of historical value recovered from seafront||A motley group of people, comprising the local ward councillor, a documentation assistant, and two museum guides from the State Archaeology Department, and a set of local history buffs, moved to safety a few slabs of granite from the Fort Kochi seafront, in an effort to protect the historical significance, they say, the stones hold. From the area adjacent to the Chinese finishing nets, 11 pieces of granite and one of laterite were retrieved on Wednesday morning, said K. Harikumar, a documentation assistant with the State Archaeology Department, and officer in-charge of the museum at Bastion Bungalow. “The period to which they belong is still uncertain. The Portuguese were known to have used laterite more than granite, so they could predate the Portuguese period. The curved nature of some of the blocks indicates that they could have been part of a pillar,” he said. The slabs of stone were moved to the garden in front of the Bastion Bungalow. ‘Effort to protect them' This was an effort to protect these pieces of history before work on the Water Metro project begins and destroys it, said Antony Kureethara, councillor representing Fort Kochi, who was part of the team that retrieved the stones. Shovels and excavators were put to use to wrench the stones out of the land that belongs to the Cochin Port Trust. E. Dinesan, Director of the Archaeology Department, was cautious about declaring the historical significance of the stones. “We have not examined the stones yet and are still unsure of what they may have been a part of. If they lie on the beach, we won’t be able to preserve them. The intention was to move them to a safer location and then study the significance,” he said. Thaha Ibrahim, a history enthusiast who is part of the team, also suggested that these remains could have been built in the Portuguese period and might have been destroyed when the Dutch laid claim to the area, or they might have existed when the Portuguese arrived at Fort Kochi. “If the Portuguese constructed it, they could be at least 500 years old. But further study is necessary,” he added. When a few historically important buildings were razed to the ground for Water Metro work recently, the significance of conserving the stones was brought to the fore. The laterite stone was possibly part of the remains of Fort Immanuel that was constructed by the Portuguese in 1503, said a statement from Mr. Harikumar. The remains will be available at the Bastion Bungalow for viewing and study on all days except Monday, when the museum is closed. The area is a goldmine for archaeological remains, and just a little work would reveal these remnants, said former Mayor K.J. Sohan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stones-believed-to-be-of-historical-value-recovered-from-seafront/article33928949.ece
25 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Aided school teachers can’t contest Assembly polls: HC||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday barred aided school teachers and non-teaching staff from contesting Assembly elections. The Bench made the ruling while allowing a few public interest litigations seeking to prevent aided school teachers from contesting Assembly elections. The petitioners contended that though government teachers were barred from participating in political activities, including contesting Assembly elections, there was no such prohibition on aided school teachers. Allowing the petitions, the Bench held unconstitutional section 2 (IV) of the Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualifications) Act, 1951, which said that employees of non-governmental educational institutions would not be disqualified for being chosen as a member of the Assembly by reason only of his/her holding any office in any non-governmental educational institutions. The court made it clear that the declaration would be applied prospectively. Right to Education Act The petitioners pointed out that aided school teachers were granted political rights as per the Kerala Education Act (KEA), 1951. At that point, part II of the KEA dealing with compulsory school education was not brought into effect. However, with the subsequent development in the education sector such as the Right to Education Act, etc., the classification of teachers had become unreasonable. Besides, political activities by teachers and their contesting the Assembly elections would also affect the quality of education. The petitioners contended that aided school teachers could not be given different treatment as the Right to Education Act ensured quality education both in government and aided schools. The State government argued that as per a government order issued in 1967, teachers of aided schools were conferred political rights. There were no rules or Act prohibiting them from contesting the Assembly elections. Besides, special leaves without pay could be granted to aided teachers elected to local bodies and Assemblies. Moreover, Section 2 (IV) of the Act had relaxed the rule of disqualification in favour of employees of non-governmental educational institutions, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/aided-school-teachers-cant-contest-assembly-polls-hc/article33928515.ece

The proposed toilets will be either newly constructed or renovated, and the project is likely to be completed during the 2021-22 financial year. “The first five will come up at Ramamangalam, Koovappady, Kuzhiipilly, and Kumbalanghi. The two at Kumbalanghi will be new, while the other three will be renovated. While these five will be basic units, the majority of others will be premium ones with extensive facilities attached to them. One such is proposed at the Kizhakkambalam private bus stand at an estimated cost of Rs. 45 lakh,” said P.H. Shine, Assistant Development Commissioner and district coordinator, Suchitwa Mission, Ernakulam. The project envisions sanctioning of up to eight toilets within the corporation limits, five each in municipalities and two each in panchayats. The toilets could be built using multiple funds, including the performance-based incentive grant, Central financial commission grant, Plan funds of local bodies, MP and MLA funds. While the focus is on renovating existing ones into beautified and hygienic facilities, new superior quality ones could also be set up depending on the preferences of the local bodies.

The reassessment will be carried out by a three-member NAAC delegation led by its chairman Prakash C. Sarangi, former vice chancellor of the Bhubaneswar-based Ravenshaw University; member coordinator Kinnari Thakkar, economic professor of Bombay University; and member Praveen Martis S.J., former principal of Mangaluru-based St. Aloysius College (Autonomous). This is the fourth-level reassessment of Maharaja’s College (Autonomous), which received three-star rating on February 7, 2000, followed by A grade on May 21, 2006, and A grade with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.11 on March 23, 2013. The reassessment by NAAC is usually held every five years. But Maharaja’s College started functioning as an autonomous institution during the 2015-16 academic year, thus making the reassessment due only in 2020, as the accreditation was extended till December 2019, college sources said. The college had submitted the Self Study Report on time, and NAAC reassessment was scheduled for January last year but was postponed in the wake of the pandemic outbreak. “We are optimistic of receiving the highest possible grade in view of the development activities in the college since it was declared academically autonomous,” said college Principal Mathew George. While the college has academic autonomy, the lack of financial autonomy stopping it from starting self-financing courses like some of their counterparts may prove a handicap. The reassessment and subsequent meetings and interactions between NAAC delegation and college authorities will be held in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol and the pandemic-related guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission. The number of persons attending these meetings will be restricted. NAAC members will hold extensive meetings with the college Principal, department heads, research committee, and office staff. Academic and governing council members will be met, and the activities carried out since the college was declared autonomous will be closely examined. NAAC members will visit various departments and meet with department heads and faculty members besides inspecting the laboratory and the library. The college claims to have undertaken development projects worth over Rs. 100 crore since it had been granted academic autonomy. Being autonomous empowers the college to complete admission process in time, design syllabus and new courses, and conduct exams and announce results in 30 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/maharajas-sets-eyes-on-highest-naac-grade/article33928950.ece

When the petition came up for hearing before Justice N. Nagaresh, the court directed the State government to file an affidavit in the case. The Act mandates burial of members of Jacobite faction families in the Orthodox-controlled cemetery where their ancestors are laid to rest. The petition was filed by Baselios Mar Thoma Paulose II, Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan, and Biju Oommen, secretary, managing committee, Malankara Syrian Christian Association. The petitioners said the new enactment was highly discriminatory and arbitrary. No law could be enacted to regulate the religious or spiritual services of a church. The right to bury and do burial services were an integral part of the religious services of the church. Meanwhile, Justice P.V. Asha ordered that the petition filed by the Jacobite faction seeking to declare the Act as constitutional be tagged with the petition of the Orthodox faction.

25 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||STP project in city hit by several hurdles||The Kozhikode Municipal Corporation and the companies taking up contract for the two sewage treatment plants (STPs) along the coast may have to cross a number of hurdles before they could start work for the much awaited project. The project for STPs at Kothi and Aavikkalthodu comes under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), and it had recently gained administrative sanction from the State government. The corporation council too had approved the project. “The corporation is now free to enter into a contract with the four companies that have bagged the tender for STP construction as well as laying pipelines for the project. This will prevent lapse of funds allotted under AMRUT,” said Corporation Secretary K.U. Bini. However, it may take a while before the commencement of work considering the ground realities. For one, both the plants come under the Coastal Regulatory Zone and hence procuring the necessary sanctions is an issue. The project has not obtained environmental clearance as yet. The CRZ report will be prepared by the Chennai Institute of Remote Sensing of Anna University. Contract signed The corporation has already entered into a Rs. 3.54 lakh contract with the institute for the purpose. The environmental impact study will be carried out by Ultratech consultancy at Rs. 2.5 lakh. The two reports are necessary for the project to gain CRZ clearance, a prerequisite for starting construction. Convincing local people of the necessity of the project is yet another hurdle. Laying pipelines for around 100 km through a thickly populated region is another hurdle before Nasith Infrastructure, which has bagged the tender for the network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stp-project-in-city-hit-by-several-hurdles/article33928423.ece
25 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||CPI(M), Cong. to contest more seats in Kozhikode||With the Assembly elections around the corner, both the CPI(M) and the Congress are planning to field their own nominees in seats contested by their partners in Kozhikode district last time. Local leaders of the two mainline parties have apprised their State forums that their nominees should make it to the Legislature in the context of a political churning taking place in the State. Of the 13 Assembly segments, the CPI(M) and the Congress have been generously offering winnable seats to their constituents in keeping with the coalition policy. The district committee of the CPI(M) is determined to take over the Elathur and Vadakara segments, which the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Janata Dal (Secular) had successfully contested in the last two polls. One of the reasons cited is that the party wanted to accommodate its own leaders rather than letting constituents win from its strongholds. NCP leader and Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran had contested from Elathur twice and earlier from Balussery. In the case of Vadakara, the CPI(M) had never contested from the segment in recent memory. Since 2001, the Janata Dal (S) has been successfully contesting with the solid backing of the CPI(M), party sources said. Now, the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), which was inducted into the Left Democratic Front (LDF), is also demanding the Vadakara seat. The case of the Congress is pathetic in that it has had no legislator from Kozhikode district for the last three terms. But with the exit of the LJD and a major chunk of the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani, party leaders believe that seat-sharing will be easy. It hopes to contest the Elathur seat as well as the Perambra and Thiruvambady segments, which were earlier contested by the KC(M) and the Union Muslim League (IUML) respectively. However, it will have to confront its defiant partner, the IUML, which has been demanding additional seats in the coming polls. With its aggressive campaigning at the grassroots level, the IUML has been able to dominate the electoral apparatus of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kozhikode. Incidentally, the party has two legislators from the district now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-cong-to-contest-more-seats-in-kozhikode/article33928406.ece

The hostel for boys has 1,500 single rooms with various recreational facilities and a modern kitchen. This is the second hostel for boys on the campus. The institute has 11 hostels for boys and three for girls. At present, the NIT-C has a total student population of around 6,600 of whom 72% are boys, Director-in-Charge P.S. Sathidevi and Dean-in-charge (Planning and Development) Jeevamma Jacob said here on Wednesday. They added that the hostel, constructed by the Central PWD, at a cost of Rs. 165.24 crore, is an eight-storey building with a total plinth area of 64,505 sq.m. The project was initially funded by then Ministry of HRD (now Ministry of Education) and later by the Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA). Prof. Jacob said the student community at the NIT-C had representation from across the country and abroad. Although hostel facility is primarily meant to provide residential accommodation to students, it provides a myriad of benefits to the community as a whole. The new project consists of 15 wings of which 14 consist of residential rooms. The number of floors in these fourteen wings vary from five to nine. There are 14 discussion rooms, 14 television rooms, 14 reading rooms, 18 store rooms, two warden rooms, and 28 resident tutor and sick rooms. There are eight lifts and fire escape stairs. The project includes a lightning arrestor system and a fire-fighting system with a water tank with 1 lakh litre capacity. Separate fresh water tanks and flushing water tanks with a total capacity of 2.54 lakh litres are provided on the terrace of each wing. There is an underground water sump of 4-lakh-litre capacity to meet any demand. The 15th wing (dining block) on two floors, and each floor with an area of 5,771 sq.m., has a seating capacity of 1,500, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mega-hostel-to-be-opened-at-nit-c/article33928428.ece

Ibrahim Elettil, president, KMCC, Dubai; O.K. Ibrahim, vice president, and other functionaries told the media on Wednesday that all expatriates who return to Kerala had earlier been asked to undergo RT-PCR test 72 hours before travel. From February 22, the test has been made mandatory after their arrival here. This has to be followed by a seven-day quarantine and one more RT-PCR test. The KMCC functionaries alleged that Kerala was the only State where expatriates were being subjected to such conditions. “A large majority of our people in the Gulf countries have either lost jobs or have faced salary cuts. When they return with their families, it is inhuman to ask them to cough up Rs. 1,700 on each person for the test. Either the government should drop the decision or make the test free for all,” Mr. Elettil said. No financial aid He also accused the government of ignoring the plight of Gulf Malayalees. “Around 3,000 new COVID-19 cases are being reported there daily, of whom a majority are from our State. “Over a dozen deaths too are being reported every day. The bodies cannot be brought home. The State government is not releasing any financial help to their families,” Mr. Elettil added. Earlier, M.K. Raghavan, Kozhikode MP, had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to either withdraw the decision or make the test free for all. Mr. Raghavan said the test was offered for free at major airports abroad.

Surendran, which toured the district, concluded with a rally at Muthalakulam Maiden here on Wednesday evening. Inaugurating the rally, Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, Minister of Industries, Bihar, and national spokesperson of the party, highlighted the development schemes implemented by the NDA government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last six years. At the same time, he accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of colluding with anti-national forces to defame the country. He said Congress leaders had become jobless after losing power in all key States, the reason why they were joining farmers’ strike or students’ protests. Mr. Hussain exhorted minority communities to stay with the BJP, as the party did not discriminate on religious faith. He said the party would replicate its electoral performance in Tripura in Kerala too. He added that the Congress and the CPI(M) were political buddies in West Bengal though they were attacking each other in Kerala. Secularism is only a ploy for the two parties to fight polls. Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, former BJP State presidents P.K. Krishnadas and C.K. Padmanabhan, senior leader M.T. Ramesh, B. Gopalakrishnan, and N.K.

Muraleedharan has termed the decision of the State Cabinet to withdraw cases registered against those who staged protests against women’s entry to Sabarimala temple as a victory of the faithful belonging to the Hindu community. At a news conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Muraleedharan, however, sought an apology from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the issue. The decision also substantiated the stance of the various Hindu organisations on Sabarimala, the Minister said. He added that the political situation in Kerala had evolved in such a way that any party ruling the State has to accept the BJP’s demands. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, which had earlier taken a stubborn stance on the Sabarimala issue just to gain political mileage, now had to kneel before the Hindu community, he observed. If the government has an iota of sincerity, it should withdraw all cases registered in connection with the Sabarimala protests, Mr. Muraleedharan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/muraleedharan-seeks-cms-apology/article33928411.ece

Sreedharan, Principal Adviser to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), that the State government decided to favour the infeasible Thalassery-Mysuru rail project. Committee convener T.M. Rasheed said the disclosure by Mr. Sreedharan pointed to the fact that a conspiracy had been hatched to sabotage the railway project that would have been beneficial to the people of Malabar. The railway budget in 2016 had proposed an allocation of Rs. 3,000 crore. But the move to divert the allocation for the proposed Thalassery-Mysuru project led to the sabotage of the Nilambur-Nanjangud rail line, he alleged. Mr. Rasheed said the State government had tasked the DMRC with preparing the detailed project report for the Nilambur-Nanjangud rail line project. Mr. Sreedharan then held a meeting to review the project with elected representatives and other officials at Kalpetta on January 9, 2017. Subsequently, Minister for Public Works G.

25 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Welfare fund for IT employees||Responding to a long-pending demand from employees in the IT sector, the State Cabinet on Wednesday decided to form a welfare fund for those working in the IT and allied sectors. The new welfare fund will be under the Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishment Workers Welfare Board. Pension, family pension, pregnancy and marriage-related benefits, medical aid, aid for the education of children, and aid for family in case of deaths are part of the welfare fund. Small firms will benefit Even smaller IT firms with fewer than 10 employees will be included under the new welfare fund. According to the government’s estimates, there are more than two lakh employees in the IT and allied sectors. The employees and their family members will be coming under the welfare fund. Those aged between 18 and 55 years and working in IT or allied sectors are eligible for membership in the welfare fund. According to those employed in the IT sector, they have been raising the demand for a welfare fund for employees for the past few years. “It was in 2016 that we had first raised this demand with the government. Since then, we have been raising this demand at various forums and in representations to the Chief Minister and MLAs. Most recently, this demand was raised again in the CM’s interaction with those from the IT sector,” said a representative of Prathidhwani, a socio-cultural organisation of IT employees in Kerala. With increasing insecurity in their jobs following instances of lay-offs from some companies, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak, the IT employees have been demanding the welfare fund as a security net. Though no lay-offs have happened in recent months, the precarious nature of jobs in the sector has ensured that this demand has always been a constant in the past few years. IT sector hails it Welfare organisations of IT sector employees, including the Progressive Techies and Prathidhwani, put up Facebook posts lauding the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/welfare-fund-for-it-employees/article33928533.ece

Prakashkumar, director, JNTBGRI, and the executive editor, said. The biannual journal is aimed at encouraging individuals and multidisciplinary research groups to codify valuable knowledge after obtaining prior informed consent from the knowledge providers. The journal noted that the use of locally available bio-resources, especially plants, for food and medicine are still prevalent among rural and tribal areas of the country. Some of the highly effective and safe modern medicines have been developed from traditional knowledge/indigenous knowledge, it observed. “More than 80% of the livelihood needs of the world’s poor depend on the use of biological resources and associated traditional knowledge which are fast deteriorating due to multiple reasons, including changing lifestyles. The remaining traditional knowledge needs to be documented urgently for the welfare and betterment of society and nature as a whole,” the journal noted. Topics Topics covered in the new edition include folk customs and traditions prevalent in the Trans-Giri region of Himachal Pradesh, ethnomedicine for gynaecological problems used by tribes of Adilabad district and wild species of Curcuma as a potential source of starch powder. The journal was first published with funding from AYUSH in 2013. Publication ceased after six more issues came out with support from the KSCSTE. Now it is being revived with Ministry of AYUSH funding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jntbgri-revives-journal/article33928495.ece

The Church sensed a plot to deprive traditional fishers of their livelihood and rights. The government found itself in troubled waters and scrambled to reassure the fishing community. Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan told journalists that the agreements were non-binding. They had no legal or contractual value. The Opposition had used it cynically to stir disaffection with the government. The government had declared the memoranda of understanding scrapped to blunt the United Democratic Front’s criticism. It was merely a political move to deprive the Opposition of ammunition. “The KSIDC has not transferred any public land to the firm, as alleged by the UDF,” he said. An official said the government also found that the KSINC had publicised the non-binding agreement as an achievement. The agreement contravened the Left Democratic Front policy to allow only traditional fishers to own or operate deep-sea trawlers. Only they would receive new boat permits. The government felt the KSINC had “missed” the critical proviso.The “slip” had opened the door for the Opposition to mislead the seafaring fishing community and put the administration on the defence. Moreover, EMCC had used the promotional material published by the KSINC to “prospect” for investors abroad. The government has ordered an inquiry into the KSINC’s actions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-to-scrap-ksidc-mou-with-emcc/article33928519.ece

25 February 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||J.C. Prabhakar: volunteers used for election work||The former Tadipatri MLA J.C. Prabhakar Reddy has alleged that the YSR Congress Party has used ward volunteers for the panchayat elections and it was trying to use them in the upcoming municipal elections too, hence he had approached the Andhra Pradesh High Court in this regard and the arguments are over in the case. “The judgment is reserved and may be pronounced in a day or two,” the MLA added. At a press conference in Tadipatri on Wednesday, he alleged that none of the YSRCP leaders approached the voters, it were the volunteers, who threatened the voters with withdrawing house sites, ration cards, and other welfare benefits. “I request the election commission and State government to withdraw the volunteers before and during the municipal elections and I have represented to the District Collector and Election Commission regarding this,” Mr. Prabhakar Reddy said. Mr. Reddy sought action against the APSPDCL officials for their inaction in switching off the power supply in the 11kV wire that snapped and killed two persons. “Local people had complained to the department from the site at 11 a.m., but the officials came 20 minutes later and the complainants were harassed asking for their Adhaar Number and other details without taking care of the problem first,” he alleged. He said he would approach the court if no action is taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/volunteers-used-for-election-work-jc-prabhakar/article33929003.ece
25 February 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telugus in Vizag, Jamshedpur seek rerouting of train||A direct train between Waltair (Visakhapatnam) and Tata, originally launched to meet the needs of Telugu people, employed in Tata Steel Plant, has been extended, in a phased manner. Now, the Tata-Ernakulam Express is bypassing Visakhapatnam Junction, depriving the largest city in Andhra Pradesh of a direct train to Tata. The train was first extended to Madras (Chennai) and then to Alleppey. On the other side it was extended to Bokaro to meet the demands of people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, working in Bokaro Steel Plant. During the 1970s, this train was split into two, with one portion starting from Tata as 8189 express and the other from Bokaro express as 3351 express. Full occupancy Both the trains after amalgamation at Rourkela used to run as 3351 express to Alleppey. This train used to run with full occupancy all through the year due to convenient timings in all major cities en route. After the recent lockdown, the Bokaro portion was introduced as 03351 express as an individual special train and from January 28, 2021, another special train was introduced from Tata to Ernakulam as 08189 express, by changing the timings, and bypassing Visakhapatnam Junction, and in all likelihood these timings will be incorporated in the new timetable as a regular train.  Inconvenient timings Though this train is given a halt at Duvvada, the inconvenient timings and the non-availability of local trains or shuttle services to the main station in Visakhapatnam is a major deterrent for passengers from using this train. “The Waltair – Tata Nagar Express was originally launched during the 1960s. Visakhapatnam Junction used to be called as ‘Waltair’ in those days. The train used to be hauled by a steam locomotive in those days. Telugu people living in Visakhapatnam region and in Tata, for whom the train was originally meant, will now be deprived of a direct train,” says Nagabushanam, a retired railway employee. Visakhapatnam, the largest city in Andhra Pradesh, is poised to become the Executive capital. Bypassing a major junction will cause untold hardship to the people. This train should be rerouted through Visakhapatnam, demand Telugu people from the two cities. People from Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, M.P., Chhattisgarh and Odisha travel to Visakhapatnam city for education, employment and medical purposes. Visakhapatnam is a medical hub with state-of-the-art hospitals and an upcoming IT hub.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/halt-tata-ernakulam-express-in-vizag-say-jamshedpurs-telugus/article33928244.ece
25 February 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Poll debacle: blame game in TDP ahead of Naidu’s visit to Kuppam||Blame game in the TDP over the party’s drubbing in the panchayat elections in Kuppam Assembly constituency has reached its zenith on the eve of its national president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s three-day visit to his home turf. Kuppam, which has remained a stronghold for Mr. Naidu ever since 1989, gave a jolt to the TDP in the panchayat elections. The YSRCP won the elections in all the four mandals – Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Shantipuram and Gudupalle. Mr. Naidu’s sudden plan is being viewed as a “damage control” measure with elections to the mandal parishads, Municipalities and Municipal Corporations round the corner. He is scheduled to hold a series of meetings with the cadres of Gudupalle, Shantipuram, Ramakuppam, Kuppam (rural and Municipality). A meeting to chalk out an action plan for Mr. Naidu’s visit witnessed unruly scenes after a majority of the cadre blamed the local leaders, who included Manohar, the personal secretary of Mr. Naidu(Kuppam), MLC G. Srinivasulu, and constituency in-charge P.S. Munirathanam, for the party’s rout. Interestingly, Mr. Manohar and Mr. Munirathnam announced that they would be quitting their posts. It was alleged that party leaders chose to be silent even as the YSRCP cadres went all out to face the elections under the direct supervision of Panchayat Raj Minister P. Ramachandra Reddy. YSRCP threat Meanwhile, tension was palpable in the constituency after the YSRCP leaders threatened to prevent Mr. Naidu’s visit. TDP district president P. Nani and MLC B.N. Rajasimhulu told the media in Kuppam that the party would not tolerate any disturbance from the YSRCP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/poll-debacle-blame-game-on-in-tdp/article33928364.ece

25 February 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Guntur gearing up for polls on March 10||The stage is set for an intense political battle in the historic city of Guntur which is all set to witness local body polls after nearly 15 years. While the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) is calling the shots in the run-up to the elections, the opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is also hoping to pull off a victory as it has a reasonably strong base in the region. The 2019 elections saw the YSRCP taste defeat both in the Guntur Lok Sabha constituency as well as the Guntur West Assembly constituency. While the YSRCP’s Modugula Venugopala Reddy lost to Galla Jayadev of the TDP in the Lok Sabha election, Ch. Yesuratnam lost narrowly to Maddali Giridhar Rao of the TDP. While Mr. Giridhar later quit the TDP and is now supporting the YSRCP, the twin defeats would be weighing heavily on the minds of the YSRCP leaders. The ruling party seems to be better equipped in Guntur East and Prathipadu segments where the local MLAs have won twice. Guntur Municipal Corporation has 57 divisions, including the merged villages of Gorantla, Budampadu and Perecharla. Though the skyline of the town has changed a lot, the absence of an elected body meant that the town was lagging in infrastructural development. Most city roads remain narrow, but inner ring roads have been laid easing the flow of traffic towards national highways. Traffic snarls continue to be commonplace and there is a glaring lack of coordination between the GMC and the police department.  This is in contrast to 2010, when two powerful leaders Kanna Lakshminarayana and Rayapati Sambasiva Rao vied with each other to spearhead the development of the town, say locals. The GMC has been bereft of an elected council since 2010, with the last council headed by Mayor Rayapati Mohana Sai Krishna of the Congress. Among the major projects bagged by the GMC include a World Bank-funded comprehensive water scheme, a Centrally-funded Under Ground Drainage (UGD) project. The UGD project, which was accorded financial sanction in 2015, remains in limbo even after five years. The contractor, Shapoorji Pallonji, left in 2019 and since then the works have been stopped. The GMC had started to restore the roads. The YSRCP, fresh from its victory in the gram panchayat elections, seems to have an advantage. Kavati Manohar Naidu, former Congress floor leader, is in the race for Mayor and Padarthi Ramesh Gandhi is also vying for the post. The TDP is pitching Kovelamudi Ravindra Babu alias Nani, as its Mayoral candidate and both parties have intensified campaigning. The elections are due to take place on March 10 and the results would be known on March 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/guntur-gearing-up-for-polls-on-march-10/article33928247.ece

25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||IOC plans Rs. 600 crore ethanol plant each in A.P. & Telangana||Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is planning to set up a foodgrain-based, mega scale ethanol production facility each in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh with an estimated total investment of Rs. 1,200 crore. Spoilt and surplus foodgrain, sourced from the Food Corporation of India (FCI), will serve as feedstock to make ethanol, for blending with petrol and reducing dependence on crude oil imports. Director (R&D) SSV Ramakumar mentioned about the proposed facilities during a media interaction here on Wednesday. ED and State Head of IOC for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh R.Sravan S.Rao added the 5 lakh litres per day capacity plants will entail an investment of Rs. 600 crore each. Both IOC officials appreciated Telangana government for its proactive response and suggesting two locations for the plant in the State. The oil company would be evaluating the options, Mr.Rao said, adding about 80 acres, a continuous source of water and proximity to FCI godowns are aspects important for the facility. IOC was yet to approach the Andhra Pradesh government, he said. The two facilities proposed in the Telugu States are among the three such planned in the country as part of measures to augment ethanol availability. According to Mr.Ramakumar, the Centre has mandated usage of 10% ethanol in petrol by 2022 and 20% in 2025. In view of the limited availability, the ethanol blend in petrol is around 6% at present. Indian Oil’s research and development thus is focusing on new avenues to produce ethanol, including from agriculture residue such as wheat straw, paddy straw as well as converting carbon dioxide by a biotechnology pathway. The first such 3rd generation ethanol production facility, a 3,000 tonne per annum plant at Panipat, in which carbon dioxide emissions from the IOC refinery will be converted into ethanol, will be commissioned this year. Carbon dioxide can also be converted to Omega3 Fatty Acids which commands a huge price in the international markets, he said. Some of the other IOC R&D initiatives Mr.Ramakumar highlighted were flexible technology that will facilitate conversion of existing IOC oil refineries to produce petrochemicals, in the event of decline in demand for fossil fuels. The company will also be launching a differentiated diesel soon. The diesel variant will offer better combustion efficiency and set to be unveiled in the wake of good response to the 100 octane rated petrol by the company. He said IOC, in partnership with an Israeli startup, will produce aluminium-air (Al-Air) batteries to propel e-mobility in the country. The collaboration will help reduce import dependence and insulate the country's energy requirements from global geo-political and currency risks. The joint venture intends to set-up a factory in India to manufacture Al-Air batteries, for electric vehicles, which will not require electricity to charge. They will be mechanically recharged, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ioc-plans-rs-600-cr-ethanol-plant-each-in-ts-ap/article33928942.ece
25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Gang charged with duping Kadapa trader of Rs. 11 cr. busted||A gang of four, which allegedly tricked a businessman from Kadapa into parting with nearly Rs. 11 crore, was busted by the Bachupally police on Wednesday. One of the gang members Ankireddy Vijay Kumar Reddy, who led the businessman P. Veera Reddy to believe that he was selected for IPS, ended his life by hanging 19 days ago. Among the arrested was Vijay Kumar Reddy’s father Raghava Reddy who was working as an Assistant Sub-Inspector of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) but claimed to be Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central). Another arrested member is Smriti Simha, who was in a live-in relationship with Vijay Kumar Reddy. She falsely claimed that she was chairperson of the International Human Rights Commission for entire south India. The other two are Ranadhir Reddy and Ramakrishna Reddy. “Their friendship blossomed into love and they started living together,” Madhapur DCP in-charge M. Venkateshwarlu said. With the supermarket in losses, the couple was on the lookout to make fast buck and wanted to lead a lavish lifestyle. They shifted to a posh gated community in Bachupally where Veera Reddy was their neighbour. They happened to meet him at the local football ground. With his extrovert nature and communication skills, Vijay Kumar Reddy impressed Veera Reddy and led the latter to believe that he was selected for the IPS and was going to Dehradun and other places for training. He introduced Smriti Simha as his wife, claiming that she was chairperson of a human rights body. Veera Reddy went on transferring the money to Vijay. “With that money, Vijay bought three BMW cars and a couple of other high-end vehicles. Value of these vehicles was around Rs. 4-Rs. 5 crore,” Mr. Venkateshwarlu said. With the money thus secured from Veera Reddy, the couple purchased a villa worth Rs. 1.30 crore and paid Rs. 70 lakh. “Veera Reddy grew suspicious of Vijay’s claims and started insisting on details of his training,” the DCP said. Realising that his game was up, Vijay ended his life on February 5, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gang-charged-with-duping-ap-trader-nabbed/article33928935.ece

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Manohar said the party was exploring legal options to unearth the “scandal” in gathering more than 10,000 acres of fertile land in East Godavari district for the SEZ. “The JSP will expose the alleged role of GMR group in the scandal. The recommendation of the Cabinet Sub-Committee to return 2,100 acres of the above extent to its owners is a conspiracy,” Mr. Manohar alleged. “We will also expose the reasons behind the GMR group selling 51% stake in the KSEZ to the Aurobindo group, and the role of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and other stakeholders in the deal,” the JSP leader said. Divi’s unit “We have been fighting against the policy that allows the Divi’s group to set up its unit in Thondangi mandal. The YSRCP government is proceeding with the hazardous project despite threats to the marine ecosystem,” Mr. Manohar observed. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on the project was silent on the arrest of the protesters only to hush up the voice of the local communities, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jsp-will-expose-the-land-robbery-in-ksez-manohar/article33929015.ece

Rajyalakshmi said while overseeing the programme at the nine session sites set up exclusively for the purpose in the district. Prakasam Additional Superintendent of Police(ASP) B. Ravichandra took the lead by taking the vaccine in Ongole to instil confidence among his colleagues. Coverage among the staff members of the Panchayatraj department was not up to the mark. Now that the elections to gram panchayats are over, the vaccination programme might pick up pace in the coming days, hoped health officials in Prakasam district, where 4,075 police personnel are being targeted for vaccination by Friday. “We planned to cover over 14,000 village volunteers and sanitary workers also under the second phase.

25 February 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Congress calls for a united struggle to prevent sale of Vizag steel plant||APCC president S. Sailajanath on Wednesday exhorted people to wage a united struggle to stop the Centre’s strategic sale of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), which he said was the pride of Andhra Pradesh. Addressing an all-party meeting chaired by APCC vice-president Sripathi Prakasm, he said it was time for all the parties to shed their political differences and come together onto a common platform to exert pressure on the Centre to give up privatisation of the VSP, which was achieved after a protracted struggle and supreme sacrifice made by people more than 50 years ago. Describing the Centre’s decision as the “biggest land scam” in the State, Mr. Sailajanath said the ruling YSRCP in the State was hand in glove with the ruling BJP at the Centre with an eye on the huge land bank with the VSP. “Now, the YSRCP is feigning ignorance on the privatisation issue after showering praise on the Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan,” he said, and added that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should make it clear to the Centre that the people of the State would not accept the decision that went against their interests and that they were prepared to wage a protracted struggle to save the PSU at any cost. APCC general secretary Ch. Sridhar Reddy recalled the historic ‘Visakha Ukku, Andhrulu Hakku’ struggle, in which all sections of people took part, resulting in the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, clearing the decks for the establishment of the PSU in the Port City. Instead of fulfilling the promises made to the State at the time of bifurcation, which included a public sector sea port, the Centre was all out to privatise even the limited number of PSUs in the State, said Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch. Ranga Rao. Poura Samajam’s Prakasam district president G. Narasimha Rao said people across the country should come together against the “privatisation spree” of the Centre as it was akin to “selling the family silver.” Representatives of the TDP, the CPI, the CPI(M), and the PDSU attended the meet, and expressed their solidarity with those agitating for the cause.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-calls-for-a-united-struggle-to-prevent-sale-of-vizag-steel-plant/article33929017.ece
25 February 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP-JSP combine faces uphill task||With the election for the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation just a few days away, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appears to be facing an uphill task. This time it has entered the fray in alliance with Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party (JSP) and is sharing the 98 wards almost equally.  After a successful outing in 2014 general and Assembly elections, when the BJP had won the Visakhapatnam (North) MLA seat and the MP berth, it slumped in 2019 elections. In 2014, K. Haribabu of BJP was elected as Visakhapatnam MP and Vishnu Kumar Raju was Visakhapatnam (North) MLA. But in 2019, the fortunes reversed and the BJP did not win any seat in the entire State, as the Special Category Status, was the bone of contention. Now for the corporation election, the proposed privatisation of Visakahpatnam Steel Plant by the Union government, might once again put the party on a difficult turf. But leaders from both the BJP and the JSP exude confidence and say that the combine would do well. Admitting that there was a drop in the enthusiasm level of the candidates, due to the prolonged delay of over a year, party leaders say that things are just picking up. The elections were supposed to be held in March 2020, but due to COVID-19 pandemic, it was stopped and in the last one year, much water has flowed and candidates have changed their political affinity, across party lines, said former BJP MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju. Electorate turnout On an optimistic note, both Mr. Raju and General Secretary of JSP Bolisetty Satyanarayana said that the fortunes of the party hinges on the electorate turnout. Both the leaders were of the opinion that bringing educated people to the polling station has been low in the city and it holds the key to their success. The electorate in the slums, which comprise around 35%, can be manipulated by money and liquor, but the remaining 65% should come out freely and cast their franchise, said Mr. Raju. Even in the last two general and Assembly elections, the percentage of voting in the entire district was below 68%, and in the city it was even more less. To bring the voters to the polling booths, the government should order closure of cinemas and shopping malls, at least till 5 p.m. on the voting day, felt Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju. Mr. Satyanarayana also hopes that youth, which comprise about 50% of the electorate, can change the tide and the combine hopes to encash Mr. Pawan Kalyan’s popularity. The leaders from BJP-JSP combine also feel that VSP issue would not be a hurdle, as the leaders from both the parties had long discussions with Union Ministers Amit Shah and Nirmala Sitharaman and things would be worked out. The former BJP MLA also felt that the party had missed the bus in communicating the welfare schemes to the electorate. He said, “Every house given to the poor, whether it was given by the present YSRCP government or the earlier TDP, a major chunk of subsidy, about 50%, was from the Union government. But this has not gone to the people.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmc-polls-bjp-jsp-combine-faces-uphill-task/article33929111.ece
25 February 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD urged to lift curbs on Tirumala temple footpaths||Pilgrims seeking darshan at the Lord Venkateswara temple have urged the Tirumala Tirupati Devestahanams (TTD) to relax the restriction imposed on trekking the foot paths leading to the hill shrine. At present, only the devotees with valid tickets are allowed to trek the footpaths to the shrine either a day in advance or on the same day of their scheduled darshan. Those with plans to visit to other temples in and around the Chittoor district are worried a lot, as they are either forced to alter their travel itinerary or skip one of the places owing to the restrictions on trekking the footpaths. After the lockdown imposed owing to the coronavirus was lifted, devotees preferred reaching the sacred town in the appropriate hours and embark on their return journey soon after the darshan at the hill shrine. The phase-wise lifting of COVID restrictions, coupled with the gradual increase in the number of devotees allowed for darshan at Tirumala, has the devotees included other temples such as Sri Kalahasti, Kanipakkam and golden temple in Vellore in their travel itinerary, even if it means adding a few days to their pilgrimage schedule. Mr. Srinivas Rao from Visakhapatnam, who came to Tirumala along with his family, said their three-day travel plan was upset as they were not allowed to trek the footpath leading to the temple on the same day only for the reason that their darshan slot was scheduled on the final day of their itinerary. “Everything went awry owing to the little known restriction that eventually forced us to reschedule our entire schedule,” he said. Ananth from Bidar also echoed the same view and urged the TTD to allow the devotees to trek they footpath at least two days in advance of their scheduled darshan. COVID protocols TTD CVSO Gopinath Jatti told the The Hindu that the restrictions were imposed as part of the COVID protocols. “The intention is to avoid overcrowding in the temple town. Some relaxations may be considered only after the pandemic weakens further,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-urged-to-lift-curbs-on-tirumala-temple-footpaths/article33929031.ece

25 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Parties should stop blaming each other over VSP issue’||CPI(M) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu has urged the ruling and opposition parties to stop blaming each other over the issue pertaining to privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and support the trade unions that are agitating against the Central government’s proposal. Addressing the media on Wednesday, Mr. Raghavulu said the TDP, the YSRCP, the JSP, and the Congress were accusing each other on the issue. “This is only weakening the agitation. All sections of society are extending their support to the agitation launched by the trade unions. It is time for the ruling and opposition parties to wage a united fight,” he said. Referring to the State Cabinet decisions, Mr. Raghavulu said it seemed the government was favouring alternative options rather than privatisation. “The government should come out clearly on the alternative options. There are also reports that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has suggested selling the VSP lands to mobilise funds. Selling away the land is not a solution. The government, instead, can borrow money by pledging the land,” he suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/parties-should-stop-blaming-each-other-over-vsp-issue/article33929020.ece

25 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC to hear pleas on MPTC & ZPTC polls on March 1||The Andhra Pradesh High Court has posted a batch of writ petitions, including the one filed by Jana Sena Party (JSP), against the State Election Commission’s decision to resume the process of elections to the MPTCs and ZPTCs from where it was paused in March last owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, for hearing on March 1. In his petition, JSP secretary Chillapalli Srinivasa Rao said the SEC should be restrained from proceeding with the MPTC and ZPTC election process from the stage where it was postponed, in view of the multiple instances of violence, prevention of filing of nominations and forced withdrawal of nominations reported later. Mr. Srinivasa Rao appealed that the SEC be directed to issue a fresh notification to ensure free and fair elections thereby protect democracy. Mr. Rao argued that the SEC’s order for an inquiry into the acts of violence and irregularities was nothing but eyewash, and if it proceeded with the elections, it would amount to diluting what happened earlier and making a mockery of democracy.  The action of SEC in proceeding further on the basis of its nearly a year-old notification (dated March 7, 2020) was illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the course provided under Articles 151(1), 179(1) and 243-K of the Constitution and the Andhrda Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, the Jana Sena Party leader stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-to-hear-pleas-on-mptc-zptc-polls-on-march-1/article33929025.ece

25 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Plethora of problems plague Madhurawada Zone||Back in the year 2007 when the corporation elections were held in the city, Madhurawada zone was part of the GVMC, but was on the outskirts of the corporation. The area was known for housing the International Cricket Stadium and a couple of engineering colleges. But with the recent real estate surge and the buzz that the Executive capital would be located in that area, the zone now houses scores of apartments, commercial buildings, gated communities, couple of multiplexes, schools and restaurants, making it a much sought-after destination. The locals say that on par with the development, a number of civic issues cropped up and they need to be addressed. “With increase in population here, the Car Shed Junction has become a major traffic point. During peak time, vehicles form long queues of at least 500 metres before the signal and it is taking a lot of time to clear,” said Adarsh Kumar, a resident of Bakkavanipalem. According to the locals, one more issue related to it is that, there has been a long demand for foot-over bridges. During peak traffic situation, it is very difficult to cross the roads not only at Car Shed Junction, but also at Madhurawada and Kommadi Junction. Many people have lost their lives while crossing the roads, says M. Vikram, a resident. He said that as medians have no iron grills people cross them easily creating problems for motorists during night. Though main roads in the locality are in a good condition, the roads in interior areas of Madhurawada, PM Palem and Kommadi are a nightmare for the locals during rains. “Despite a number of complaints, many damaged roads in interior areas were not relaid. Drains are not cleared properly. People just throw their wastes here and there. Many construction companies dump construction & demolition (C&D) wastes in the open areas,” said Executive Member of Andhra Pradesh Federation of Resident Welfare Associations (APFERWAS), M. Koteswara Rao, who is a resident of Durga Nagar, PM Palem. He also complained that apathy from the Town Planning wing has led to many encroachments in their area. L. Renuka, a resident of Kommadi, said that there are many rain battered roads which need attention since many years. The area also has pig menace and sanitation in a few colonies is poor. “Apart from these, our locality do not have many dumpbins,” she said. Meanwhile, people from Adarsh Nagar also complain about increase in encroachments in the locality. This zone has recorded the highest number of encroachment and land grabbing cases. Voters doubled There are about eight wards in the Madhurawada Zone (From Ward 6 to 13). According to the officials, compared to the previous municipal elections, the voter population is doubled and stands at over 1.90 lakh voters for the coming municipal elections. There used to be a tough fight in the Madhurawada zone between the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party. In the 2007 elections, three wards were won by the TDP, while two were won by the Congress. K. Dora Babu of the Congress, who had won from Ward - 6, had also become the Deputy Mayor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plethora-of-problems-plague-madhurawada-zone/article33929121.ece

The party leaders were reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's webinar on Wednesday where he made a strong pitch for privatisation of loss-making public sector units by saying that ‘the government has no business to be in business.’ The Centre has directed the VSP administration to submit all the details of the steel plant, which are required for bidding by private parties, alleged party city committee secretary B. Ganga Rao in a statement here on Wednesday. He alleged that the Centre was planning to hand over the plant to some corporate group at the earliest. The BJP leaders, who are changing their statements on the sale of the VSP, in a bid to mislead the people, should now come out with an answer on the Centre’s latest move, Mr. Ganga Rao said.

25 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||We will not disappoint employees, says KTR||TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao has indicated that the government would not disappoint employees in the pay revision and reminded that the last Pay Revision Commission (PRC) had given 43% fitment, highest in the country. Speaking to reporters here along with the party’s Hyderabad-RangaReddy- Mahabubnagar Graduate MLC constituency nominee Vani Devi, he defended her choice for the election saying despite being the late Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao’s daughter, she was a simple woman working for the society. She had all the credentials to be in the contest. Mr. KTR said that compared to other candidates in the fray, Ms. Vani Devi was better in terms of her education and contribution to society through her educational institutions. She had made a name for herself in her own way. The TRS surprised all the political parties by picking her at the last minute and the move is being seen not only to check BJP’s N. Ramchander Rao, a Brahmin candidate like Vani Devi, but also exploit the P.V. Narasimha Rao sentiment in his centenary year, which is being celebrated by the State government. However, other political parties argue that TRS was sacrificing her for its political gains when employees, youngsters and students, who form the voters’ group in these elections, were apparently annoyed with the government. But Mr. KTR at the press conference rejected the argument that the TRS had failed youngsters on jobs and said that 1.32 lakh jobs were given in the government sector in the last six years while Congress could fill up just 10,000 posts in Telangana from 2004-2014. He said the perception being created was to mislead youngsters and students and he was ready for a debate on this issue. Apart from filling up jobs, the government has also enhanced the salaries for several groups after Telangana was formed, he argued. Mr. KTR said that Mr. Ramchander Rao had no right to seek votes as he had not contributed anything in his term. In fact, the BJP was just harping on divisive agenda and despite being in power at the Centre, the State BJP had failed to get projects. In fact, they have scrapped the ITIR project meant to generate employment for lakhs. The Municipal Minister also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of Rs. 15 lakh in all accounts, and said he did not get money but got 15 lakh abusive posts on his Twitter account from BJP supporters. Ms. Vani Devi said she had a right to seek votes given her work in educational institutions and service organisations. “My father got an opportunity to become the PM when he wanted to retire from politics and I have got an opportunity in a similar stage,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/we-will-not-disappoint-employees-says-ktr/article33928925.ece
25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Telangana farmers take up record cultivation||Amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by the three new farm laws over the procurement operations under the price support scheme, which has been helping at least a section of farmers get reasonable (support) price to major crops, the farming community of Telangana have scaled another peak of record cultivation this agricultural year. Buoyed by good rainy season, increasing irrigation potential and hopes of getting good returns, as usual, as also timely availability of inputs, farmers of Telangana have broken the records both in the Vanakalam (Kharif) and Yasangi (Rabi) seasons of 2020-21. In the process, the cultivation of agriculture and horticulture (non-plantation) crops has crossed 2 crore acres for the first time. “Cultivation of crops has reached a phenomenal 2.1 crore acres as on February 23 with Vanakalam accounting for 144.85 lakh acres and Yasangi contributing the remaining 65.03 lakh acres as agricultural crops and 9.22lakh acres and 2.02 lakh acres, respectively, of horticultural crops during 2020-21”, Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, who is also officiating as the Commissioner, said. Estimated yield At an estimated yield of 34 quintals of paddy per acre in Rabi, which is higher compared Kharif due to low incidence of pest attacks in Rabi, the production of paddy is likely to be a whopping 150 lakh tonnes to 170 lakh tonnes. As per the provisional estimation, the production of paddy in Kharif was about 120 lakh tonnes in spite of damage caused by excessive rains. In spite of such promising picture, the farming community are a worried lot over the marketing of their produce this (Rabi) season not only for paddy but other crops too. The State government had procured paddy, maize, bengalgram, jowar, sunflower and safflower at the support price fixed by the Centre during the last Rabi season but the farming community has no such minimum guarantee this time, although the Supreme Court has placed the new farm laws under suspension and the Centre’s announcement of support price for Rabi crops. “The State government has already made it clear that it would not open procurement centres this season as there has been no assurance from the Centre to procure rice. We may have to depend purely on private traders for disposing our produce without any guarantee for support price,” M. Tirupal Reddy, a paddy farmer in Kalher mandal of Sangareddy district said expressing his fears. Echoing similar views, a senior official said: We are not in a position to commit anything at this juncture except keeping the fingers crossed over the procurement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-farmers-take-up-record-cultivation/article33928934.ece
25 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘TRS, BJP are dustbins for Cong. waste’||TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has termed the ‘Operation Akarsh’ of both the TRS and BJP an effort to fill their “dustbins with trash”. “Telangana BJP leaders are acting like scavengers searching for some disgruntled elements within the Congress. Earlier, TRS had served as a trash can for the Congress, where all non-important and irrelevant leaders got dumped. Since the TRS trash can is almost full, BJP is proving to be a fresh dustbin of Congress party,” he claimed. Mr. Reddy was speaking while campaigning for the MLC elections for Warangal-Nalgonda-Khammam and Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahabubnagar Graduates constituencies. He addressed two election meetings on Wednesday in Warangal and Ghanpur. The TPCC chief said that defection of a few leaders to TRS or BJP would never impact the Congress. “We are a cadre-based party and they never switch loyalties for money or other allurements.” He added that Congress candidates Ramulu Naik and G. Chinna Reddy were enjoying the backing of organisational strength in all the six districts where polling will be held. He claimed that neither TRS nor BJP has much reach or strength to face the Congress candidates although both were trying to lure voters with money and other sops. The Congress chief said that the TRS government has disappointed all sections of the society and employees, teachers, jobless youth and students were repeatedly cheated by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao with false assurances. “Teachers have completely lost their relevance in the KCR government and lakhs of students are facing difficulties due to the lack of funds and facilities. Jobless youth have no opportunities and unemployment has reached its peak,” he said. “The BJP government at the Centre and TRS government in Telangana are equally responsible for bringing the situation to this level,” he said. He also ridiculed the ongoing membership drive of the TRS. He said every party takes care of its members but TRS leaders were offering incentives and cash to meet membership targets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-bjp-are-dustbins-for-cong-waste/article33928927.ece
25 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Not many back to classes VI to VIII||The reopening of schools for classes VI to VIII saw a very poor response with just 9% of students turning up on the first day. However, officials expect the number to go up gradually. As per the figures available with the Department of School Education on the 18,030 schools that run classes VI to VIII with 13,11,772 sanctioned strength, only 1,17,304 students attended. These include all the government and local body schools, model schools, KGBVs, TREIS and private schools. Even in private schools, the attendance was abysmally low. Out of the 7,07,064 students in private schools, only 71,453 attended. All schools in the government sector opened for classes VI and above and teachers too attended in sizeable numbers. However, in Adilabad district, schools were not opened as it was a holiday on account of Sevalal Jayanthi. Officials said that all schools will reopen in Adilabad on Thursday. Director of School Education Sridevasena said that all teachers in government schools were getting in touch with parents to obtain consent letters and that is why the attendance was thin. “Cleaning up of classrooms and toilets is also being done. Customised seating plans are being prepared for each school.” Regarding private schools, about 70 to 80% schools have reopened. The remaining are in the process of sanitising their premises and re-engaging teachers, getting their school buses checked for roadworthiness and ready to transport schoolchildren, as well as obtaining consent letters from parents. Another reason for the low turnout was the short notice given to parents to send their wards and lack of transport. Parents were worried about the safety of their children in schools where there is shortage of space and difficult to maintain distance. The number may increase slightly from Monday onwards. Since attendance is not mandatory and there is no fear of detention due to the RTE Act, parents also preferred online education that children got used to for the last 10 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/very-few-back-to-classes-vi-to-viii/article33928930.ece
25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Online, offline options to register for COVID vaccine||With COVID-19 vaccination drive set to begin for people above 60 years and those above 45 years with co-morbidities from March 1, there is curiosity over the registration process. Authorities have kept open both the online and offline methods for interested vaccine recipients to register. One can register in advance through online mode, and or simply walk into a vaccination site to get their names on the list. The latter would be of help to those who do not have means to self-register or are not tech-savvy enough. Details of the photo identity cards or other documents that are needed for registration would be announced soon. In case of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), trhe Co-WIN app was used to list the beneficiaries. They were sent messages about date, time and location of the vaccination site. Senior officials of the Health department had earlier said a different version of Co-WIN would be launched for general public to register themselves. If one registers in advance, they would be sent a message regarding the date, time and location of the vaccination site. Each hospital would be provided with only a single brand of vaccine. However, they might not be given the option to choose which vaccine they will get. 50L recipients According to the estimate of Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao, there are around 50 lakh people in the State who are above 60 years old or above 45 years with co-morbidities. Of them, around 44 lakh are 60-plus, he said. Asked how they would determine if a person has a co-morbidity, the senior official said that they are yet to come out with a procedure. The officials might ask for written material from a doctor that a prospective recipient has one or more co-morbidity. Last mop-up session HCWs and FLWs who have not yet taken the vaccine would be extended a final opportunity to get the jab. Dr Srinivasa Rao said they would hold mop-up sessions till the end of February. If they miss out on it, they would have to take it along with general public from March 1. From January 16 to February 23, out of the total targeted 3,31,097 HCWs from government and private sectors, 59% or 1,95,850 took the vaccine. In case of FLWs, 88,987 out of the targeted 2,57,239 have taken the first dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/online-offline-options-to-register-for-covid-vaccine/article33928362.ece
25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Shaming, mental agony may have taken a toll, say experts||Shaming and stress could have driven the 19-year-old pharmacy student to suicide, opined a few psychologists who spoke to The Hindu after news of the teenager’s death started circulating. Another expert, however, stated that the reasons cannot be determined without specialists having spoken to her about her state of mind. Nonetheless, they unanimously suggested that those in distressing situations need counselling by trained professionals along with unconditional support. Jayanti Sundar Rajan, counselling psychologist at Roshni Counselling Centre, said the girl might have had an emotional breakdown after being shamed for ‘making up’ the kidnap and rape story, which ultimately made her resort to the extreme step. “In such situations, the family needs to stand by an individual and support them. People in such situations call our helpline for counselling. There have been many cases where they decided against ending their lives,” Dr Jayanti said. A clinical psychologist who wished to remain anonymous tried to drive home the point about the support one requires in such situations by correlating it to an episode of heart attack. “If a person suffers from heart attack, do people leave him/her or do they take care to ensure the person does not suffer from another attack? So, when a person is under stress, they need support,” said the psychologist, adding that a person under stress can opt for phone counselling by trained professionals and can rest assured that their identity will be kept confidential. “If someone shows signs of taking a drastic step, they should be taken care of. Family members can observe what they are going through by tracking their online browsing history and observing whether the person is sleeping properly or not,” the psychologist explained. ‘Need to rehabilitate’ A student counsellor and clinical psychologist, Radhika Acharya said when people think an individual who has committed a ‘mistake’ does not have a place in the society anymore, it can have dangerous consequences. “Rather than cornering them, it is important to rehabilitate such persons who have committed a mistake,” Dr Radhika opined.  If a person suffers from heart attack, do people leave him/her or do they take care to ensure the person does not suffer from another attack?

Mr. Garg and his team took up a three-day inspection of service and facilities at various metro rail stations between February 16 and 18 where they inspected the ‘effectiveness’ of the new upgrades to signalling and train control system across metro rail corridors — Corridor-I (Red Line) from Miyapur to LB Nagar, Corridor-II (Green Line)from JBS to MGBS and Corridor-III (Blue Line) from Nagole to Raidurg. The inspection also included various civil works at the entry and exit points, newly commissioned elevators and escalators at a few metro stations. The CMRS has expressed satisfaction to the overall performance of the systems and related works and sanctioned his approval with a certificate of compliance, informed L&TMRH in an official release. “This integrated system will add operational efficiency to the entire metro corridor network leading to seamless operation of metro services”, it said. L&TMRH managing director and chief executive officer K.V.B. Reddy said with the successful completion of the inspection, the agency will now be using the ramped up systems for better operational excellence to “help serve our passengers with more reliable and smooth experience. French multinational ‘Thales’ which has provided the telecom and signalling system for the HMR has been operating lines separately when each section was being commissioned and also integrating them besides upgrading the software. Hence, the latest check was more about this and certainly not a periodic maintenance report, he explained. Indian Railway Safety Commissioners based in Delhi and Mumbai have been empowered to issue safety certifications to metro rail projects across India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/software-upgrades-for-metro-rail/article33928901.ece
25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘PV daughter sacrificed’||Senior BJP leader and incumbent MLC N. Ramchander Rao accused the TRS of making former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao’s daughter Vani Devi contest from the Hyderabad-RR-Mahabubnagar Graduates constituency in the last minute as a fallout of the gruesome daylight murder of lawyer couple Vaman Rao and his wife Nagamani at Manthani a few days ago. “It is their last ditch effort to assuage the Brahmin community but they will not succeed as the educated lot from among all castes and communities are with me. The entire lawyer fraternity has been supporting me and everyone is aware of the role I had played in the Legislative Council in questioning various omissions and commissions of government,” he said on Wednesday. At a press conference at the party office, Mr. Rao wondered why the TRS leadership did not deem it fit to give either Rajya Sabha seat or chairpersonship of any corporation rather than force her to contest a seat only to ‘sacrifice’ her. “It is evident that the ruling party wants the Communist Party candidate to win. If it was really sincere in recognising PV’s family, there were other ways,” he claimed. Responding to the criticism against him by Minister K.T. Rama Rao, the BJP leader pointed out several loopholes in various issues, including the municipal bills that came up during his interventions in the RS. The government had allotted Rs. 100 crore to lawyers but did not disburse for three years till he had lobbied for the disbursal and the interest alone has helped in issuance of health cards. The party rushed to the aid of junior lawyers during lockdown with provision of essential commodities. “I had a right to question the government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pvs-daughter-sacrificed/article33928919.ece

Rama Rao’s claims on the 1.32 lakh jobs given in Telangana and challenged him for a debate on the figures. At a press conference here, he also fixed the date, time and venue and asked the Minister to come to the Telangana Martyrs Memorial at Gun Park on February 26 at 12 noon if he was serious on a debate. “We will not believe in your falsified statements. Come with your team and the figures on the recruitment and current vacancies,” he said. Reminding that the core pillars of the Telangana movement — water, grants and employment — were ignored, Mr. Sravan asked KTR to disclose the vacancies as of 2014, new jobs created with the creation of new districts and panchayats and the implementation of GO 610. He claimed that KTR was revealing false figures to mislead graduates through doctored data. Regularising over 22,000 TS Genco, and Transco employees is one of the best examples of deceptive statements of the Minister, he argued. Warning that graduates would teach a lesson to TRS in the MLC elections, he alleged that KCR and KTR were both serious about jobs in the family than lakhs of unemployed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktrs-figures-on-jobs-doctored-congress/article33928928.ece

Out of 40,583 total students of classes VI, VII and VIII enrolled in 658 schools, only 2,590 students attended the classes on Wednesday in Khammam district, sources said.

The government upper primary and high schools recorded a meagre attendance of 6.18 % and the private schools registered 6.61 %.

Ahead of the inauguration of the new modern bus station, tentatively slated for March 1 here, the committee has launched a campaign in the form of diverse mass contact programmes to mobilise support for its demand to retain the existing bus stand due to its location near the railway station and the prime business centres in the town. The committee comprising members of various organisations representing street vendors, small traders, hoteliers and other petty businessmen of the areas surrounding the existing bus stand launched a phase-wise campaign a few days ago to drum up support for its demand. The “praja ballot” was held at various locations under the aegis of the committee members consisting of a host of senior leaders of the CPI (M), the Congress and various other political parties. A total of 2,773 persons from different spheres participated in the ballot. Out of them, an overwhelming number of 2,726 people favoured the demand for retaining the existing bus station as the local bus stand, according to the organisers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/campaign-on-to-retain-existing-bus-stand/article33929058.ece

25 February 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Despite Maharashtra spike, no steps in place||Though second wave of corona has been reported in neighbouring Maharashtra, proper steps are yet to be put in place by the authorities. The Sangareddy district shares a border with both Karnataka near Zaheerabad and Narayanakhed has a border with Maharashtra. Sukkaltheerth village in Narayanakhed constituency is just 12 kilometres from Maharashtra, via Nizamabad district and Karnataka is about 10 kilometres. Alarm bells are ringing in Maharashtra with the spike in COVID cases there. Karnataka has made it mandatory for those coming from Maharashtra and Kerala to furnish COVID negative certificate (RT-PCR). Though the Telangana government had implemented such restrictions during the pandemic peak in August-September by erecting checkposts on the borders for testing temperatures of those coming from Maharashtra and Karnataka, such steps are yet to be taken this time. “We are yet to get any orders from the authorities to erect border checkposts. However, we are taking all precautions and have increased the number of COVID tests in border areas,” said a medical officer involved in the process adding that about 50 tests are being conducted at border areas every day. Coming to the district, the number of cases being registered every day is below 15. Collector M Hanumantha Rao has asked the public to take all precautions in view of spike in cases in Maharashtra. “Do not forget to wear masks and sanitise and it is the only protection we can have despite the vaccine. Any negligence will prove costly,” said Mr. Rao in a release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-steps-in-place-despite-covid-19-spike-in-maharashtra/article33928940.ece

As per the proposal, licence fees will now be properly collected from traders of these markets. “Unauthorised construction was happening in these markets. The panel’s decision will pave the way for regularisation of these markets,” North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash said. These 29 markets include Kasturba Market, Gokhale Market, and Kuch Natwa in Town Hall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/civic-body-moves-closer-to-regularising-29-markets/article33928886.ece
25 February 2021||Barabanki (U.P.),||Let Rajnath Singh talk to protesting farmers, demands Naresh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union president Naresh Tikait on Wednesday called Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh a “caged parrot” and said the farmers’ issues could be resolved if he is given the freedom to talk with them. He accused the BJP-led Central government of being “stubborn” over the three new laws which the farmer unions want repealed. The protesting farmers too are not ready to go back on their demands, he said. “The government has made Defence Minister Rajnath Singh a caged parrot ( pinjre ka tota ). If he is given the freedom to talk to the farmers, I can guarantee that there would be a decision and the BJP’s prestige will also remain intact,” he said. He said farmers respect the Defence Minister, but he is not given a chance by the government to deal with the issue. ‘Govt. is stubborn’ Mr. Tikait addressed a farmers’ ‘mahapanchyat’ here and also spoke to reporters, claiming that the Centre was not paying heed to the farmers protesting against the laws. “The government is stubborn and is not ready to hear out farmers. It should change its attitude,” the BKU leader said. “If the PM is not ready to repeal the laws, we are also not going to backtrack. The farmers are ruined and not getting the right price for their produce. The rise in prices of power, petrol and diesel has affected them also,” he said. “If this government continues for long, farmers will have to abandon agriculture,” added. The BKU leader said the way to Uttar Pradesh’s Purvanchal is through Barabanki and if farmers here are made aware of the impact of the new laws, they will be able to tell farmers in that region about it. ‘Defaming farmers’ “This government is defaming farmers, labelling them as terrorists and Khalistanis and we will not remain silent on this,” he said. Mr. Tikait indicated that he had no quarrel with Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan, whose supporters and those of the Rashtriya Lok Dal clashed recently over the farmers’ protests. He indirectly referred to the riots in western Uttar Pradesh in 2013, over which Mr. Balyan too had faced charges. “Earlier Hindus and Muslims lived in amity. But from 2013, BJP spread misconceptions among them and divided society. But now people have understood their tricks,” the BKU leader said. Thousands of farmers have been camping at the border of Delhi since November-end, demanding the repeal of the new agri-marketing laws. They claim that the laws will weaken the MSP system, an argument the government rejects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/let-rajnath-singh-talk-to-protesting-farmers-demands-naresh-tikait/article33928887.ece
25 February 2021||GURUGRAM,||FASTag users at Kherki Daula toll plaza cross 90% mark||More than a week after the digital payment through FASTags was made mandatory at all toll plazas on the national highways, the number of FASTag users at Kherki Daula has crossed the 90% mark. Several commuters, however, alleged that the waiting time was still 6-11 minutes during peak hours since many users did not keep sufficient balance in their FASTag. Of the total 62,500 vehicles that passed through the Kherki Daula toll plaza on February 23, around 57,700, which is around 91% of the total traffic, made payment through FAStag, said a Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) official. However, only 84% vehicles – approximately 55,000 of the total 65,000 – had made payment through FASTag on February 16, the first day of the implementation of the order on digital payment. A senior National Highways Authority of India official said that reduction in the share of non-FASTag vehicles in the total traffic from 14% to just around 8% was encouraging and the instances of congestion at the toll had gone down. Welcome change The MCEPL official described the improvement in the situation as “drastic”. He claimed that it took around a minute for around ten vehicles to cross through the toll barriers. He hoped the situation to improve further in the next couple of days. “The awareness campaign by the Union Road Transport Ministry, the NHAI and our own efforts have brought about a welcome change and the people have adopted FASTag in a big way,” said the official. Traffic snarls, delays Ramprastha City’s Atrium Condominium Welfare Association president Pradip Rahi, a commuter, claimed that it took him on an average 6-11 minutes to cross the toll the past three days. He claimed that a large number of local commuters, running into several thousands, mostly had monthly pass scheme activated on their FASTags that offers concessional rates. “The monthly pass scheme offers 40 trips within a month at a concessional rate of Rs. 750. Since it is difficult for the commuters to remember the exact recharge date, the motorists with monthly passes many times end up having inadequate balance in the FASTag. It leads to traffic snarls and delays. The authorities should find a solution to it to ensure smooth flow of traffic,” said Mr. Rahi. He said he was mulling to file a formal complaint with regard to long waiting time. Another commuter, Rajesh Bhardwaj, claimed that the U-turn near the toll plaza towards Jaipur used by the motorists to avoid paying the toll also led to long traffic snarls extending up to the toll. Mr. Bhardwaj said the U-turn should be closed for smooth traffic movement at the toll plaza.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fastag-users-at-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-cross-90-mark/article33928469.ece
25 February 2021||Mumbai,||Congress seeks inquiry into MP Delkar’s death||Congress leaders in Maharashtra on Wednesday approached Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and demanded a probe into the BJP’s alleged “role” in the death of Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha member Mohan Delkar. The State BJP trashed the allegations. The body of Delkar (58), Independent MP from the Union Territory, was found in his hotel room in south Mumbai on Monday. A suicide note in Gujarati was found at the spot, according to police. A Congress delegation led by the party’s State unit spokesperson Sachin Sawant had a videoconference with Mr. Deshmukh and alleged that Delkar was being harassed by the Union government and the Union Territory’s officials. Police should be asked to “probe the role of the BJP” in the death, the Congress said. Mr. Deshmukh, a minister from the NCP, assured them that those found guilty would not be spared. Maharashtra BJP’s chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye dismissed the Congress’ allegations, saying all Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, had the habit of lying, and Mr. Sawant saw a BJP connection in anything and everything. Meanwhile, asked about the contents of the purported suicide note, a police official declined to comment and added that Delkar’s family had not lodged any complaint regarding his death so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-seeks-inquiry-into-mp-delkars-death/article33928483.ece
25 February 2021||Mumbai,||HC orders inspection of work around Banganga talav||The Bombay High Court recently ordered the director of Archaeology and Museums, Maharashtra, to depute a competent officer to conduct a survey and inspection of the ongoing piling and construction activities around Banganga talav at Walkeshwar, Malabar Hills, in south Mumbai. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a petition filed by the Board of Trustees of the Temples Charitable Institution and Funds of Gaud Saraswat Brahman Community. The petition alleged that because of the extensive piling and construction activities, Banganga talav, which was a State-protected monument and a grade-I heritage structure, was being severely affected. The plea said, “The natural underground water streams/water flow to the talav is being disturbed and contaminated on day-to-day basis due to the inflow of muddy water as well as accumulation of mud in the water of the talav in huge quantity.” On February 22, senior advocate Milind Sathe, appearing for developers who are carrying out the work, told the court that initially, the director of Archaeology and Museums had directed them to stop work due to their omission to obtain permission from the directorate for commencing the work of piling and construction. However, after submitting a proposal along with reports of technical experts, and on perusal and scrutiny thereof, the director on January 22, 2021, lifted the stop work order and permitted the authorities to proceed with the piling and construction activities subject to strict compliance with certain conditions. The court said, “Having regard to the seriousness of the concern expressed, we direct the director of Archaeology and Museums to depute a competent officer for the purpose of conducting a survey and inspection of the piling and construction activities around the talav undertaken by the developers immediately, but not later than two days of receipt of a copy of this order.” The court directed the officer to file the report in a sealed cover on March 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-orders-inspection-of-work-around-banganga-talav/article33928487.ece
25 February 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Bone marrow transplant cures 13-month-old boy of rare genetic disorder||Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children in Mumbai has successfully performed a life-saving bone marrow transplant surgery on a 13-month-old boy from Hyderabad with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Mohammed Khizr was born to Raziya Sayed (29) and Karrar Ali (33) on December 24, 2019. Their happiness was short-lived as Mohammed would get fever and cough every alternate day. After giving medications prescribed by a paediatrician, his fever and cough would subside for a few days. Several tests conducted in a local hospital failed to provide a correct diagnosis. The patient was referred to Wadia hospital where he was diagnosed with SCID in September 2020, Dr. Prashant Hiwarkar, a bone marrow transplant physician, said. Immune deficiency “The patient was evaluated for immune deficiency in his first admission in August 2020 while in the paediatric ward. He was diagnosed with SCID on September 4. It is an inherited primary immunodeficiency disease that is seen in infancy; a genetic defect that affects T cells. Children with SCID have virtually no immune system to fight common viruses and fungus and die before their first birthday without a bone marrow transplant,” he said. On admission, he was diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia, a rare severe infection leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was on the ventilator for 14 days and developed life-threatening viral and bacterial infections. The patient was stabilised with the help of anti-microbial medications. Biggest challenge “The biggest challenge in any SCID condition is that it is diagnosed late. Even in this case, by the time the baby reached us he was suffering from two life-threatening infections. So, our first hurdle was to control the infections. If the medical procedure of bone barrow transplant is done without controlling the infection, the transplant is less likely to be successful,” Dr. Hiwarkar said. Mohammed was shifted to the bone marrow transplant unit after achieving good control of infections. All the organs were evaluated before transplant and were found to have normal function. After treating with chemotherapy for four days, he underwent a successful stem cell transplant at 11 months of age from his HLA-matched grandmother. The new immune system from the transplanted stem cells started to function after 16 days, and he was finally discharged on Wednesday after being in the transplant unit for more than two months. Dr. Ambreen Pandrowala, an immunologist with the hospital, said, “This is the second child with SCID that we have successfully transplanted under one year of age. It is important for all children with immunodeficiencies to have an early referral to a centre familiar with immunodeficiency transplant.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bone-marrow-transplant-cures-13-month-old-boy-of-rare-genetic-disorder/article33928484.ece
25 February 2021||New Delhi,||Husband, wife fight civic bypoll for AAP from Shalimar Bagh||As Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal took out a roadshow in Shalimar Bagh on Wednesday ahead of the municipal corporation by-elections in ward 62N, almost all posters and banners had four faces: Kejriwal’s, the local MLA, the AAP candidate and one more. Even during the roadshow, the jeep in which Mr. Kejriwal was travelling in had the candidate, multiple MLAs, and the same person: Sanjay Mishra, the candidate’s husband. Reserved seat While the candidate, Sunita Mishra, was standing next to Mr. Kejriwal in front of the vehicle, Sanjay was standing at the back and greeting people with folded hands. “I am the AAP sangatan mantree of the Shalimar Bagh Assembly constituency and we both have been working for the party for a long time,” Mr. Mishra told The Hindu . He added that the ward was reserved for a woman candidate this year. “We are focusing on cleaning the area and promising people to improve the MCD schools in the area, where basic education happens, if elected to power," Ms. Mishra said. Addressing people during the roadshow at Shalimar Bagh, the AAP chief said: “We have elections on Sunday, you all must go and vote for AAP. How many of you receive zero electricity bills? 24x7 free electricity has happened only in Delhi. We have worked to improve Delhi in the last six years by improving schools, hospitals, availability of electricity, and water. But the BJP has left the civic bodies in shambles. It is your responsibility to make AAP victorious in the civic bodies, together we have to change the face of the municipal corporations.” Later in the evening, Mr. Kejriwal promised Rs. 100 crore for a sewer project at Bawana, where he took out another road show. ‘We will win’ When asked how this time would be different for the party compared to the 2017 municipal polls, in which the party performed badly, Pankaj Gupta, National Secretary of the AAP, told The Hindu : “In 2017, we were still a relatively new party. But now people have seen the work done by the AAP government for about six years and they're confident about the party. We are also sure about winning the election." He also said that the bypolls to the five wards will reveal the public mood before the municipal corporation elections in 2022. Many people in the area said that garbage collection was a major issue in the area.  Two opinions People were, however, split on whether the same party should be ruling the corporations and the State government. “It should be different parties so that they will point out shortcomings of each other,” said a 57-year-old Delhi Police officer living in the area. Darmendar Kumar, a 47-year-old teacher, said both should be ruled by one party. “In that case there won’t be any blame game,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/husband-wife-fight-civic-bypoll-for-aap-from-shalimar-bagh/article33928477.ece

25 February 2021||New Delhi,||HC allows NRI family to undergo home isolation||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday ordered to send a family of four, which was sent to seven day institutional quarantine after returning from the U.K. despite testing negative for COVID-19, to home quarantine for seven days. Justice Prathiba M. Singh noted that there was a lack of clarity in the notifications regarding quarantine of passengers coming from the U.K. The Central government said its guidelines only mandate 14 days home quarantine for travellers from the U.K. if they test negative and institutional quarantine is not advised. The Delhi government, on the other hand, said there was a January 29 Central government Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which stated that all passengers sitting close to a traveller who tested positive for COVID-19 have to be sent to institutional quarantine. “Since there is no clarity about the SOP, and the petitioners [family] include two children below the age of 10 years, they shall remain in home quarantine instead of institutional quarantine,” the High Court said. The court also directed the Delhi govt. to give clear instructions to the IGI Airport to display the current SOP prominently on its website, so that travellers are aware and there is no confusion. The court direction came on the plea of the family claiming that all the members were tested for COVID-19 when they arrived here from the U.K. on February 20 and despite testing negative, they were “illegally and unlawfully” sent to institutional quarantine.

However, their kitchens could continue to function for online food delivery, officials said. Furthermore, all swimming pools and libraries are to remain closed till March 7. Educational institutions and weekly markets in Jalna district have been ordered to remain shut till March 31. Likewise, night curfews have been imposed in Satara and Solapur districts in western Maharashtra. With Vidarbha emerging as the new ‘epicentre’ in this wave, authorities in Parbhani district have cancelled inter-district buses to Nagpur, Amravati and Yavatmal districts. On Wednesday, Pune and Nagpur district, along with Mumbai city, recorded more than 1,000 fresh cases each. The State’s total cases have risen to 21,21,119 while the cumulative recoveries stand at 20,08,623. Pune district reported a whopping 1,500 new cases — a new high in the last five months — to take its total case tally to 4,03,782. As per the State Health Department figures, four deaths pushed the toll to 8,044. However, according to the district administration, the fatality count has crossed 9,200 while the active case tally has surged past the 7,600 mark. Mumbai city recorded 1,167 fresh cases, taking its total tally to 3,21,699 of whom 6,900 are active. Four fatalities took the city’s death toll to 11,458.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-reports-alarming-surge-of-8807-covid-19-cases/article33928486.ece

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. will seek to rejoin UNHRC: Blinken||The U.S. will seek re-election to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Tuesday, as he “humbly” asked for the support of UN member states. This is the latest in a series of moves by the Biden administration to reverse a pattern of retreat from multilateralism that was characteristic of the Trump regime Former President Donald Trump had taken the U.S. out of the Council in 2018, saying it was biased against Israel and had members who were human rights abusers. While acknowledging that American democracy was “imperfect” and often fell short of its ideals, Mr. Blinken, in a video message to the 47-member Council which is currently in session, said the U.S. was placing human rights at the centre of its foreign policy and therefore seeking to rejoin the Council. “ … I'm pleased to announce the United States will seek election to the human rights council for the 2022 to 2024 term. We humbly ask for the support of all UN member States in our bid to return to a seat in this body,” Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken also alleged that the Council was biased against Israel — a position shared by Democrats and Republicans. The Secretary also referred to the Council’s membership. While he praised the Council for bringing attention to the coup d’etat in Myanmar, he said those with the “worst human rights record” should not be part of the Council. “We must work together to improve the work and membership of the council.” The Secretary spoke of challenges to racial justice in the U.S. and said the fight for racial justice should be on top of the global human rights agenda. Mr. Blinken also said there was no moral equivalence between the actions of the Untied States and authoritarian regimes. “The United States does not claim to be perfect, but we strive every day to improve, to hold ourselves accountable, to become a more perfect union,” he said. ‘No moral equivalence’ “There's no moral equivalence between the actions of the United States, which are subject to robust, impartial, and transparent accountability mechanisms, and those of authoritarian regimes, which violate and abuse human rights with impunity. together, we must push back against blatant attempts to subvert the values upon which the United nations was founded…” Mr. Blinken said those who use economic development as a reason to undermine human rights will be held accountable. “Those who hide under the mantle of promoting economic development while seeking to undermine human rights will be held to account, including for their own human rights violations,” he said. The Secretary called for Russia to unconditionally release dissident Alexei Navalny and others wrongfully detained. Other countries that were mentioned by name included China and Sri Lanka. “We’ll speak out for universal values when atrocities are committed in Xinjiang, or when fundamental freedoms are undermined in Hong Kong,” Mr. Blinken said. He also called on the Council to adopt resolutions in this session, including one on Sri Lanka. “We encourage the Council to support resolutions in the session, addressing issues of concern around the world, including ongoing human rights violations in Syria, North Korea, the lack of accountability for past atrocities in Sri Lanka and the need for further investigation into the situation in South Sudan,” Mr. Blinken said. The U.K. and other countries have circulated a draft resolution asking for accountability for war crimes in Sri Lanka’s 26 year civil war.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-will-seek-to-rejoin-unhrc-blinken/article33928153.ece
25 February 2021||COLOMBO,||Imran announces $50 mn defence credit line for Lanka||Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced a $50 million defence credit line facility for Sri Lanka, even as the two countries stressed the need for “stronger partnership” in security, combating terrorism, organised crime and drug and narcotic trafficking, and intelligence-sharing. “Both sides expressed satisfaction at the existing bilateral cooperation in the field of defence and noted that the elevation of staff-level talks to Defence Dialogue has further provided an opportunity to expand security sector relations,” a joint communiqué issued by the two sides said on Wednesday, as PM Khan wrapped up his two-day visit to Colombo, accompanied by a high-level governmental and business delegation. Mr. Khan’s visit to Sri Lanka is the first to be undertaken by a head of government, after the pandemic hit the world. It was the first visit by the Pakistani Prime Minister since the formation of the new governments in both the countries and marked Mr. Khan’s return since his cricketing tours to Sri Lanka in 1975 and 1986. Mr. Khan met with representatives of Sri Lanka’s sports fraternity, at an event where Sri Lanka’s Minister of Sports and Youth Namal Rajapaksa announced the commissioning of the ‘Imran Khan High Performance Sports Centre’ in Colombo. Lengthy discussion Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Khan held talks with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The leaders engaged in a “lengthy discussion” on improving bilateral relations, a statement from President Rajapaksa’s office said. They exchanged views on partnering in sectors including agriculture, trade, and tourism. Mr. Khan also met Muslim parliamentarians on Wednesday, amid protests by Sri Lanka’s Muslim community demanding a reversal of the government’s mandatory cremations policy for COVID-19 victims. Opposition parliamentarian and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem said in a tweet that PM Khan “expressed confidence” in the capacity of Sri Lanka’s leaders “to improve harmony” among all Sri Lankans and address citizens’ grievances with a view to “foster goodwill among nations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/imran-announces-50-mn-defence-credit-line-for-lanka/article33928151.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. leadership sorely missed, says Canadian PM||U.S. President Joe Biden had his first bilateral meeting — virtually — with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday, a meeting that involved discussions on COVID-19, economic recovery, China, climate change and a swipe or two at the Trump administration by Mr. Trudeau. “U.S. leadership has been sorely missed over the past years,” Mr. Trudeau said from Ottawa via teleconference prior to the meeting. “And I have to say as we were preparing the joint rollout of the communiqué on this, it’s nice when the Americans are not pulling out all the references to climate change and instead adding them in.” The Trump administration — which had pulled out nearly all references to climate change from the White House website shortly after Mr. Trump assumed office — had also pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord — a move reversed by Mr. Biden on his first day in office. The U.S. officially re-entered the Paris Agreement last Friday. “Now that the United States is back in the Paris Agreement, we intend to demonstrate our leadership in order to spur other countries to raise their own ambitions,” Mr. Biden said following the meeting. The President also called for the release of two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, detained in China. Mr. Spavor, a businessman, and Mr. Kovig, a former diplomat, have been detained by China since December 2018 on charges of spying. Their detention came after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in response to a U.S. request. “Human beings are not bartering chips,” Mr. Biden said. “You know, we're going to work together until we get their safe return.” “Canada and the United States will stand together against the abuse of universal rights and democratic freedoms. We're going to strengthen our shared commitment to providing safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers, and so much more,” Mr. Biden said. The two leaders also discussed strengthening the WHO and engaging with multilateral institutions to strengthen global norms, according to Mr. Biden. The Biden administration has begun reversing America’s retrenchment from its traditional alliances, including the transatlantic partnership. Mr. Biden said the two leaders had discussed bolstering transatlantic security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-leadership-sorely-missed-says-canadian-pm/article33928155.ece
25 February 2021||KATHMANDU,||Thousands celebrate restoration of Parliament||Thousands of anti-government protesters threw confetti and chanted slogans in Nepal’s capital on Wednesday to celebrate Parliament’s reinstatement by the Supreme Court. The court order was a major blow to troubled Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, who dissolved the legislature in December because of a feud within the governing Nepal Communist Party. The demonstrators applauded the court’s decision and demanded Mr. Oli’s immediate dismissal. The court ruled on Tuesday that the dissolution was unconstitutional and that a meeting of the reinstated body be called within 13 days. Mr. Oli has not made any public comments since the ruling, which has put him in a difficult position because he will not have the support of a majority of lawmakers. Political crisis likely The Nepal Communist Party won a majority of the seats in 2017 elections, but has split following a feud between Mr. Oli and co-leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Without the support of Mr. Dahal’s splinter group in Parliament, Mr. Oli would have difficulty remaining in office. However, no party holds majority to form the government, which is likely to lead to a political crisis. Since Parliament’s dissolution, there have been regular protests against Mr. Oli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-celebrate-restoration-of-parliament/article33928149.ece
25 February 2021||Washington,||J&J single-dose vaccine 66% effective, says FDA||Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) single-dose vaccine protects against COVID-19, according to an analysis by U.S. regulators on Wednesday that sets the stage for a final decision on a new and easier-to-use shot to help tame the pandemic. The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) scientists confirmed that overall the vaccine is about 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. The agency also said J&J’s shot — one that could help speed vaccinations by requiring just one dose instead of two — is safe to use. That’s just one step in the FDA’s evaluation of a third vaccine option for the U.S. On Friday, the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend the long-anticipated shot. The FDA is expected to make a final decision within days. The vaccination drive has been slower than hoped, hampered by logistical issues and weather delays even as the country mourns over 500,000 virus-related deaths. So far, about 44.5 million Americans have received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and nearly 20 million have received the second.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jj-single-dose-vaccine-66-effective-says-fda/article33928161.ece
25 February 2021||Washington,||J&J shot 85.4% effective against severe COVID-19||The single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19, including newer variants, according to documents released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday. The news came as the regulator was set to convene an independent panel Friday that will likely vote to authorise the vaccine, making it the third one available in the country hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9% in the United States, 81.7% in South Africa, and 87.6% in Brazil. Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe COVID-19 was 85.4%, but it fell to 66.1% when including moderate forms of the disease. Crucially, analysis of different demographic groups revealed no marked differences across age, race, or people with underlying conditions. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no reports of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, which have been seen in rare cases for the Pfizer and Moderna shots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jj-shot-854-effective-against-severe-covid-19/article33928769.ece
25 February 2021||ACCRA,||Ghana first country to receive COVAX vaccines||Ghana received the world’s first delivery of coronavirus vaccines from the United Nations-backed COVAX initiative on Wednesday — the long-awaited start for a program that has thus far fallen short of hopes that it would ensure shots were given quickly to the world’s most vulnerable people. 600,000 doses The arrival of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the West African country marks the beginning of the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history, according to the World Health Organization and UNICEF. It is a linchpin of efforts to bring the pandemic to an end and has been hailed as the first time the world has delivered a highly sought-after vaccine to poor countries during an ongoing outbreak. “Today marks the historic moment for which we have been planning and working so hard. With the first shipment of doses, we can make good on the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the race for life-saving vaccines,” said Henrietta Fore, executive director of UNICEF, which delivered the vaccines. However, the initiative has been hampered by the severely limited global supply of doses and logistical problems. Although it aims to deliver 2 billion shots this year, it currently has agreements only for several hundred million shots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ghana-first-country-to-receive-covax-shots/article33928159.ece

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also reasserted China’s claim to a string of tiny, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan. The verbal exchange followed reports that two Chinese coast guard ships on Sunday twice entered Japanese territorial waters surrounding the islands, known by Japan as Senkaku and by China as Diaoyu. Chief Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby on Tuesday said China had “continued to flout international rules” and the U.S. would work with its allies to address such challenges. Wang did not directly address the criticism but said the islands were “China's inherent territory”. “The U.S.-Japan security treaty is a product of the Cold War, which should not harm a third party's interest or endanger regional peace and stability," Wang said at a daily briefing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japan-us-treaty-a-product-of-cold-war/article33928162.ece

Former Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal said on Wednesday that the majority of the Nepal Communist Party is against Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and they are in talks with likeminded parties to form a coalition government. “We are open for the formation of a coalition government as soon as the House of Representatives meets 12 days later. We are in discussion with Nepali Congress and Janata Samajvadi Party. We expect to discuss all aspects, including leadership of the coalition,” Mr. Nepal told The Hindu over phone. He said Prime Minister Oli is politically isolated and has no option but to resign. Mr. Nepal urged not to believe rumours of a crackdown on the opposition by Mr. Oli. “At the moment, there is no environment for him to impose a drastic measure like an emergency rule because the mood of the people here is very positive,” said Mr. Nepal. Mr. Nepal and co-chair of Nepal Communist Party Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ have been at the forefront of leading the anti-Oli campaign, which prompted Mr. Oli to dissolve the Lower House of the Parliament in December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/anti-oli-faction-planning-to-form-coalition-govt/article33928770.ece

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The structural fragility of Union Territories||The sudden and inexplicable resignations of Congress MLAs from the Puducherry Assembly have turned out to be an ingenious move to topple the Congress government led by V. Narayanasamy. This was done in 2019 with devastating effect in Karnataka. In both cases, the governments lost majority and went out of office. Resigning from the membership of the House is every member’s right. But according to Article 190 of the Constitution, the resignation should be voluntary or genuine. If the Speaker has information to the contrary, he or she is not obliged to accept the resignation. An innovative method But there is by now a familiar pattern to the resignations of Members of the Legislative Assembly. Such resignations invariably lead to the fall of the government and resignations take place only from the ruling parties in the States which are opposed to the ruling party at the Centre. These parties are, in fact, in a precarious condition because in most cases, the resignations are quite unanticipated and reduce the party’s majority in the House abruptly. Even the most seasoned Chief Ministers who have weathered many storms look flummoxed in the face of this blow. Resignations are done with such precision that the exact number of MLAs required to reduce the majority resign, not more. This mode of toppling a government has an odd attractiveness about it because of its sheer novelty. The beauty of this scheme is that no MLA has to defect and face disqualification and get a bad name. It is a wonderful way to end defection and save the honour of the legislators. The Puducherry development has tremendous political significance. But the purpose of this article is to unravel the structural fragility of Union Territories (UTs) as units of the Indian federation which perhaps makes it easier for powerful operators in the political system to destabilise them. Composition of the legislature The first question that arises in the context of these UTs is why the Constitution-makers/ Parliament thought it fit to provide a legislature and Council of Ministers to some of the UTs. The ostensible reason is to fulfil the democratic aspirations of the people of these territories. In other words, there was a realisation that the administration of these territories directly by the President through the administrators under Article 239 does not meet the democratic aspirations of the people. Therefore, the creation of a legislature and a Council of Ministers is logical and in consonance with the policy of the state to promote democracy. But a closer look at the relevant provisions in the Constitution reveals that this professed aim has often been sought to be defeated by the Union. Article 239A was originally brought in, in 1962, to enable Parliament to create legislatures for the UTs. Look at the composition of the legislature as provided in the Constitution. It is a body that is elected, or partly elected and partly nominated. There can be a Council of Ministers without a legislature, or there can be a legislature as well as a Council of Ministers. A legislature without a Council of Ministers or a Council of Ministers without a legislature is a conceptual absurdity. In our constitutional scheme, a legislature is the law-making body and a legislative proposal is initiated by the government, which is responsible to the legislature. Neither can the legislature exist without a Council of Ministers nor can the Council of Ministers exist without a legislature. Similarly, a legislature that is partly elected and partly nominated is another absurdity. In fact, a simple amendment in the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 can create a legislature with more than 50% nominated members. How can a predominantly nominated House promote representative democracy? Issue of nomination The issue of nomination of members to the Puducherry Assembly had raised a huge controversy. The Government of Union Territories Act provides for a 33-member House for Puducherry of whom three are to be nominated by the Central government. So, when the Union government nominated three BJP members to the Assembly without consulting the government, it was challenged in the court. Finally, the Supreme Court ( K. Lakshminarayanan v. Union of India, 2019) held that the Union government is not required to consult the State government for nominating members to the Assembly and the nominated members have the same right to vote as the elected members. Nomination as such is not new to the Indian legislature. There is provision for nomination of members to the Rajya Sabha [Article 80 (i)(a)]. But clause (3) of the Article specifies the fields from which they will be nominated. The purpose of this nomination is to enable the House to draw on the expertise of those eminent members who are nominated and thus enrich the debate in the House. But in the case of nomination to the Puducherry Assembly, no such qualification is laid down either in Article 239A or the Government of Union Territories Act. This leaves the field open for the Union government to nominate anyone irrespective of whether he or she is suitable. The Supreme Court took too technical a view on the matter of nomination and did not go into the need to specify the fields from which those persons could be nominated and also lay down a fair procedure to be followed for nomination of members. As things stand, the law invites arbitrariness in dealing with the nomination of members to the UT legislature. If a different party runs the government in the UT, this provision will be used by the Union government with a vengeance, which is what happened in Puducherry. Administrator’s power As a matter of fact, the UTs were never given a fully democratic set-up with necessary autonomy. The power vested in the administrator, who is known as the Lieutenant Governor in the UTs having a legislature, bear this out. The administrator has the right to disagree with the decisions of the Council of Ministers and then refer them to the President for a final decision. The President decides on the advice of the Union government. So, in effect, it is the Union government which finally determines the disputed issue. The administrator can, in fact, disagree with all crucial decisions taken by the State government when the territory is ruled by a different political party. Section 44 of the Government of Union Territories Act and Article 239 AA(4) (proviso) of the Constitution vests the power in the administrator to express his or her disagreement and refer the matter to the President and then take all actions he or she deems fit in the matter in total disregard of the elected government. Although in NCT of Delhi v. Union of India (2019), the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had said that the administrator should not misuse this power to frustrate the functioning of the elected government in the territory and use it after all methods have failed to reconcile the differences between him/her and the Council of Ministers, experience tells us a different story. In Puducherry, the conflicts between the Lt. Governor and the Chief Minister were perennial. A frustrated Chief Minister at last had to knock on the door of Rashtrapati Bhavan seeking the removal of the Lt. Governor. Similarly, in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, one often hears of complaints against the Lt. Governor from the ministers about the non-cooperative federalism being practised by him. As a matter of fact, such conflicts between the administrator, who is the nominee of the President, and the elected government is inherent in the constitutional arrangement created for the UTs. No Union government really likes the idea of a free and autonomous government in the UTs and therefore tries to control it through the administrator. The weaponisation of the constitutional provision is done in full measure when the UT is ruled by a different political party. Experience shows that the UTs having legislatures with ultimate control vested in the central administrator are not workable. The redemption for the harried governments of these territories lies in the removal of the legal and constitutional provisions which enable the administrator to breathe down the neck of the elected government. So far as the conspiratorial resignation by legislators to bring down their own government is concerned, the political class will have to rack its brains on how to get the better of the predatory instincts of political parties through constitutional or other means.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Federalism and India’s human capital||Investing in human capital through interventions in nutrition, health, and education is critical for sustainable growth. But India’s human capital indicators remain low. In the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, the country ranked 116th. The National Family Health Survey-5 for 2019-20 shows that malnutrition indicators stagnated or declined in most States. The National Achievement Survey 2017 and the Annual Status of Education Report 2018 show poor learning outcomes. In addition, there is little convergence across States. This is a cause of concern as these statistics could worsen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several government initiatives have been launched to address these issues. The National Health Policy of 2017 highlighted the need for interventions to address malnutrition. On the basis of NITI Aayog’s National Nutrition Strategy, the Poshan Abhiyaan was launched, as part of the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Scheme. The latest Union Budget has announced a ‘Mission Poshan 2.0’ and the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has been the Centre’s flagship education scheme since 2018. However, India spends just 4% of its GDP as public expenditure on human capital (around 1% and 3% on health and education respectively) — one of the lowest among its peers.  International experience suggests that one reason why these interventions are not leading to better outcomes may be India’s record with decentralisation. Globally, there has been a gradual shift in the distribution of expenditures and revenue towards sub-national governments. These trends are backed by studies demonstrating a positive correlation between decentralisation and human capital. In recent years, India has taken some steps towards decentralisation. The Fourteenth Finance Commission increased the States’ share in tax devolution from 32% to 42%, which was effectively retained by the Fifteenth Finance Commission. In India, three tiers of government are envisaged, with the Constitution dividing powers between the first two tiers — the Centre and the States, as per the three lists under the Seventh Schedule. While public health is in the State List, the broader subject of economic and social planning is in the Concurrent List. In 1976, education was shifted from the State List to the Concurrent List through the 42nd Amendment. The placement of a subject in the Concurrent List, in effect, indicates the presence of overarching considerations that warrant the Centre’s involvement. Fiscally, while the Constitution assigns the bulk of expenditure responsibilities to States, the Centre has major revenue sources. To address this vertical imbalance, the Constitution provides for fiscal transfers through tax devolution and grants-in-aid. In addition, the Centre can make ‘grants for any public purpose’ under Article 282 of the Constitution. While fiscal transfers that are part of tax devolution are unconditional, transfers under grants-in-aid or Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) can be conditional. Therefore, the increase in the States’ share of tax devolution represents more meaningful decentralisation. Several imbalances The 73rd and 74th Amendments bolstered decentralisation by constitutionally recognising panchayats and municipalities as the third tier and listing their functions in the Eleventh and Twelfth schedules, respectively. These include education, health and sanitation, and social welfare for panchayats, and public health and socio-economic development planning for municipalities. However, the Constitution lets States determine how they are empowered, resulting in vast disparities in the roles played by third-tier governments. Despite some shifts towards greater State autonomy in many spheres, the centralised nature of India’s fiscal architecture has persisted. Centrally Sponsored Schemes have formed a sizeable chunk of intergovernmental fiscal transfers over the years, comprising almost 23% of transfers to States in 2021-22. But its outsized role strays from the intentions of the Constitution. Article 282 of the Constitution is listed as a ‘Miscellaneous Financial Provision’, unlike Articles 270 and 275, which fall under ‘Distribution of Revenues between the Union and the States’. Constitutional expert Nani Palkhivala had characterised it as more of a residuary power, opining that grants-in-aid under Article 275 as per Finance Commission recommendations are the more appropriate, regular route. The Supreme Court inBhim Singh vs Union of Indiahad observed that “Article 282 is normally meant for special, temporary or ad hoc schemes”. There are issues in the design of CSSs as well, with the conditions being overly prescriptive and, typically, input-based. Against this, international experience reveals that schemes with output-based conditions are more effective. Moreover, CSSs typically have a cost-sharing model, thereby pre-empting the States’ fiscal space. This is incongruous, given that many CSSs cover subjects in the State and Concurrent Lists, such as health and education. A functionally and fiscally empowered third tier would not only be more in keeping with the constitutional spirit, but also lead to better outcomes. But ironically, States, too, have been responsible for centralisation. Many States do not clearly demarcate or devolve functions for panchayats and municipalities. Further, third-tier governments are not fiscally empowered either. The collection of property tax, a major source of revenue for third-tier governments, is very low in India (under 0.2% of GDP, compared to 3% of GDP in some other nations). The Constitution envisages State Finance Commissions (SFCs) to make recommendations for matters such as tax devolution and grants-in-aid to the third tier. However, many States have not constituted or completed these commissions on time, and hence, the Fifteenth Finance Commission has recommended no grants after March 2024 to any State that does not comply with the constitutional provisions pertaining to SFCs. Towards a solution To begin with, the Centre needs to rethink the nature of its actions. It should play an enabling role, for instance, encouraging knowledge-sharing between States. For States to play a bigger role in human capital interventions, they need adequate fiscal resources. To this end, States should rationalise their priorities to focus on human capital development. The Centre should refrain from offsetting tax devolution by altering cost-sharing ratios of CSSs and increasing cesses. The unconditional nature of these vertical transfers should be effectuated in spirit. Concomitantly, the heavy reliance on CSSs should be reduced, and tax devolution and grants-in-aid should be the primary sources of vertical fiscal transfers. Panchayats and municipalities need to be vested with the functions listed in the Eleventh and Twelfth Schedules. Leveraging the true potential of our multi-level federal system represents the best way forward towards developing human capital.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Addressing vaccine reluctance and policy hesitancy||The fact that only one in 10 healthcare workers returned for the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as of February 15 indicates that they have probably understood the advantages of delaying it for 12 weeks — that the 12-week interval between the two doses affords considerably better protective efficacy than the four-week interval currently followed in India. Only about half of those offered the first dose actually took it, pointing to widespread vaccine hesitancy even among healthcare workers, the best-informed segment of society. After all, they should have been the most willing recipients of the vaccines given that they are at highest risk of contracting infection due to repeated occupational exposure. Unfortunately, clear and correct scientific information — on vaccine efficacy and the potential side effects — was not provided before the two vaccines were rolled out. Over and above the Phase 3 clinical trial results on COVID-19 vaccines that are currently used in different countries, is there any other evidence to say that vaccination programmes are effective? Peak and the rate of decline A study of the epidemic curves of different countries in different phases of their epidemics gives us insights into vaccine effectiveness regardless of which vaccine is used. The peak of the COVID-19 global pandemic, a statistical derivation, occurred in the second week of January 2021, followed by a steep decline in the number of new cases reported worldwide, with a halving time of 35 days. The death rates peaked on January 29, after a lag time of 18 days after the pandemic peak, reflecting the time lag between infection and death, corroborating the conclusion that the global pandemic peak is well and truly behind us. Individual countries that embarked on mass vaccination prior to or around the time of their respective epidemic peaks show a faster rate of decline with shorter halving times of 17 days (U.K.) and 29 days (U.S.). India began rolling out its vaccines on January 16, long after the peak was over on September 16, 2020, and close to the time our epidemic was transitioning into the endemic phase. India’s halving time in the number of new infections was about 42 days, as the vaccine roll-out was too late to accelerate the speed of epidemic decline. As India seems to have entered or is about to enter the endemic phase by March 2021, we have to presume that the predicted herd immunity threshold of 60% infection of the entire population is about to be reached. Time for targeted vaccination Countries like India that missed the opportunity to authorise emergency use of the vaccines earlier during the epidemic in order to blunt it, and are now nearing the endemic phase, will be well advised to implement targeted vaccination to prevent deaths and eradicate the infection. Mass roll-out is not necessary now. State-wise utilisation of the allotted vaccines shows varying vaccine acceptance by healthcare workers offered the vaccines on a priority basis. Vaccine hesitancy is due to poor understanding of the benefits and risks of vaccination, perhaps with an exaggerated perception of the vaccine’s side effects due to media reports. This could be rapidly dealt with by a decentralised process of information-education-communication by the public health authorities at the level of each district, town and panchayat. All media, print and electronic, would do well to present accurate facts and health departments in each State should publish the side effects of the vaccines in detail to dispel mis-trust. This needs to be done on a war footing. Utilising funds The Central and State governments have set up vaccination centres at great expense, with a liberal budgetary allocation of Rs. 35,000 crore. It is important that the allotted funds are properly and fully utilised by running the vaccination centres to full capacity. However, ground-level data show poor utilisation of this valuable resource. Even States such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which have an excellent record of health management, are utilising only about 30%-40% of their planned capacity. This in turn, leads to considerable waste of time, funds and human resources. The Health Minister has announced that India will begin to enrol, register and start vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable (those with co-morbidities) from March 1. This will fill all the empty slots in vaccination centres. This will help us prevent hospitalisation for severe COVID-19 cases and prevent deaths due to severe COVID-19 faster. Apart from this, accepting scientific information on the advantages of delaying the second dose of the Covishield vaccine to 12 weeks will further increase the number of available slots for the elderly and vulnerable to access early vaccination and be better protected. This requires an immediate policy decision by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This approach will not only yield rapid results but will set a model for other middle- and low-income countries to emulate. Vaccine hesitancy on the part of the people of India and policy hesitancy on the part of the government will seriously hamper achievement of the twin targets of preventing COVID-19 deaths and eventually eradicating COVID-19, goals we strongly advocate.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Suu Kyi’s many dilemmas||Myanmar’s army generals overreached themselves by declaring last November’s general election null and void and arresting Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), had swept the 2020 election with an overwhelming majority. The story of Ms. Suu Kyi’s life, with the many odds and lengthy periods of incarceration she has faced, has been told often. More recently, her act of defending Myanmar against the Rohingya genocide charges triggered massive condemnation from the international community. But though she won the November 2020 election, she is now under detention, yet again. Perhaps her admirers-turned-critics can now begin to understand that her silence on the Rohingya crisis was a difficult choice among her very limited options. Myanmar’s Constitution was amended in 2008 to ensure that 25% of seats in the country’s Parliament are reserved for the military. The Constitution excluded anyone married to a foreign citizen (or whose children are foreign citizens) from contesting. In 2010, the NLD chose to boycott the election; in 2015, Ms. Suu Kyi joined the electoral process and the party swept the polls. Although she was constitutionally barred from the office of President, in an internationally brokered accommodation with the junta, she accepted the post of State Counsellor and became the virtual Prime Minister. The November 2020 election to both Houses of Parliament and the State legislatures (excluding seats reserved for the military), saw her party trounce the Union Solidarity and Development Party by a sufficiently large margin. The military-backed opposition alleged that the election was riddled with irregularities. The international observers for the Myanmar poll included Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), the Carter Center, the European Union and International IDEA, amongst other reputed bodies. There was some criticism of the NLD’s extensive use of state media and the Election Commission’s exclusion of the Rohingya from the voting process. But ultimately, the Carter Center commended the Commission’s efforts, and a coalition of 12 domestic observers declared the election results credible while also pointing out the weaknesses in the electoral legal framework post the 2008 Constitution. On February 1 this year, the Tatmadaw overturned the election in its entirety, thereby bringing a decade’s worth of democracy to an abrupt end. A one-year Emergency has been declared and fresh elections are promised. In a pre-dawn raid on Ms. Suu Kyi’s house, the army claimed that it found imported walkie-talkie sets and invoked infringement of customs regulations. The police arrested her. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Yangon, Mandalay and other cities since the coup. While the NLD called for a nationwide strike, the army clamped down on social media networks and ordered a curfew. In turn, thousands began to bang pots and pans as an act of protest. While the protests are still largely peaceful, the press has reported police firing and a few deaths. In an unprecedented move, the generals have detained Election Commission officials, with the purported aim of having the poll body admit to electoral fraud. The overturning of the election has been widely condemned by the international community. U.S. President Joe Biden was among the first to denounce the coup. He effectively froze U.S. funding and called for the release of political leaders and party members who had been detained. The United Nations passed a resolution calling for Ms. Suu Kyi’s immediate release. A full circle Until recently, Ms. Suu Kyi was being attacked for her silence on the plight of the Rohingya. But by arresting her yet again, the generals may have succeeded in partially restoring the halo that had slipped. The world may once again be reminded that she was the daughter of the country’s hero General Aung San, and that she has already spent a large part of her life deprived of freedom. What are the options for her now? In 2015, she had reached an understanding with the military junta that enabled over five years of a civilian government. As in a game of snakes and ladders, she has now slipped back to the starting point. The charges against Ms. Suu Kyi may make little sense, but it seems likely that she will be sentenced by a court of law. A question that may have arisen in her mind is that if detention, again, was to be her fate, even after winning an internationally accepted election, would it have been preferable to stand up to the army and regain the world’s respect which came after a lifetime’s sacrifice?

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Adultery as ‘misconduct’||Every civil servant, whether a member of the All India Services (AIS), State Service or Central Service, is governed by a moral code of conduct. Similarly, the conduct of army officers and jawans is administered under the Army Act. While the AIS conduct rules require its members to “maintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty” and do “nothing which is unbecoming of a member of the service”, the Army Act contains penal provisions for displaying “unbecoming conduct” or “disgraceful conduct”. The Central and State Civil Services conduct rules also demand similar integrity from its members. Surprisingly, what exactly constitutes an “unbecoming conduct” or “unbecoming of a member of a service” is nowhere defined. It, therefore, leaves ample scope for the employer or disciplinary authority to use this leverage and set up parameters of misconduct for its subordinates. One such conduct, which has been a subject of debate for long, is whether illicit or adulterous relations with another woman or man amounts to misconduct under service rules, particularly after the Supreme Court’s verdict in Joseph Shine vs Union of India (2018). This contention assumes significance in light of the Centre’s application for clarification that the SC’s aforesaid decision on decriminalising adultery under IPC should not apply to the armed forces. Though the matter has been referred to a Constitution Bench, Justice Rohinton Nariman while issuing notice made an observation that “something which is not adultery because the section [497 IPC] has been struck down will still be ‘unbecoming conduct’”. This observation, in fact, is in contrast to the judgments made by various High Courts in the past. In 1985, the Calcutta High Court inRabindra Nath Ghosh (In re)held that a head constable who was living with another woman ignoring his married wife was not guilty of any misconduct in the performance of his duties as a policeman. In State of U.P. vs BN Singh (1989), the Allahabad High Court ruled that in order to bring a case of a government servant within the definition of ‘personal immorality’ on the habit of sex, it must be shown “that this habit of the government servant has reduced his utility as a public servant so as to damage the government or official generally in public esteem”. Justice M. Katju, in Pravina Solanki vs State of U.P. (2001) held that “unless an employee does some act which interferes with his/her official function then ordinarily whatever he/she does in his/her private life cannot be regarded as misconduct”. More importantly, after the Joseph Shine case, the Rajasthan High Court in Mahesh Chand Sharma vs State of Rajasthan (2019) held that “no employer can be allowed to do moral policing on its employees which go beyond the domain of his public life”. The court said that though adultery is an immoral act and is not to be appreciated, “the same would, however, not be a ground for initiating departmental proceedings by the employer and it be left best for the person who maybe affected to take remedy...”. Ambiguous expressions When various High Courts have held that the act of adultery is not a sufficient ground to initiate departmental proceeding unless it interferes with an employee’s official functions, the observations of Justice Nariman that the Army Act is “on a different footing” because the expression used is “unbecoming conduct” have, once again, raised the contention between “misconduct” and “immoral act”. Hence, the SC must address expressions such as “unbecoming of a civil servant” or “unbecoming” or “disgraceful” conduct. It is understood that “misconduct” is nothing but unlawful behaviour, misfeasance, may involve moral turpitude and must be improper or wrong behaviour, wilful in character. Any government or public authority would want its employees to maintain integrity not only during the discharge of their official duties, but also in the public domain. With such a public policy in place, whether adulterous conduct is sufficient to initiate departmental action is a million-dollar question that the Supreme Court must answer.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Bail as right||In granting bail for six months to poet Varavara Rao in the Bhima Koregaon case on medical grounds, the Bombay High Court has affirmed the principle that even the stringent provisions of an anti-terrorism law are not invincible before a prisoner’s constitutional rights. Jailed under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Mr. Rao, 82, suffered from a host of ailments, and his condition was deteriorating until he was treated at the Nanavati Hospital on the intervention of the National Human Rights Commission. The court overruled the National Investigation Agency’s objection that bail should not be granted on medical grounds once an undertrial prisoner’s bail application was rejected on merits under UAPA, as long as access to treatment in a government hospital was available. The NIA had argued that in view of the statutory bar on granting bail under Section 43D(5) of the UAPA if the accusation against a person is prima facie true, any bail given on health grounds would open up the floodgates to similar petitions. The court looked at Mr. Rao’s plight from the perspective of his right to life under Article 21. It ruled that “a Constitutional Court cannot be a mute spectator to the undertrial being sent to prison and then to government hospitals, where his health deteriorates further, to be ultimately shifted to the Private Superspeciality Hospitals, upon intervention of courts...”. This could not continue back and forth only because his bail application has been turned down on merits, it said. Bail is routinely denied in most cases under UAPA. It became a watertight embargo since the Supreme Court in 2019 gave a ruling that made it nearly impossible for anyone arrested under UAPA to be released on bail, unless the accused could demonstrate that the charges against them were prima facie untrue. However, a few recent judicial decisions have sought to carve out exceptions. The Supreme Court laid down recently that prolonged incarceration without any possibility of an early completion of trial could be a ground for granting bail. In Mr. Rao’s case too, the High Court has noted that charges are yet to be framed, and 200 witnesses have to be examined once the trial begins. The temporary release of the octogenarian poet ought to turn public attention on the others incarcerated for a long time in the Bhima Koregaon case, in which lawyers and activists have been accused of plotting with Maoists to overthrow the government. Recent revelations that some of the electronic evidence in the case may have been planted remotely by a piece of malware have dented the prosecution’s claims about the existence of a plot. It is unfortunate that there is no sign of either an expeditious trial or any possibility of release of those arrested after a case of alleged provocative speeches made during a Dalit commemoration event held on December 31, 2017 in Pune, was transformed by the police into a sinister Maoist plot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bail-as-right/article33928135.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Scientific disinterest||The presence of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan at a press conference to promote Coronil, an Ayurvedic pill promoted by Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved, is objectionable on more than one count. Coronil is a concoction of common herbs known to Ayurveda. Since June, there have been attempts to deploy it into India’s COVID-19 management protocol. Dr Vardhan, alongside Cabinet colleague Nitin Gadkari, was at a press conference with Baba Ramdev and other promoters of Patanjali to announce a scientific publication describing the efficacy of Coronil in ridding volunteers, part of a clinical trial, of coronavirus. For one, Coronil is a product manufactured by a private company. Doctors — Harsh Vardhan is an ENT surgeon — are explicitly barred from promoting drugs of any sort. Though Dr Vardhan didn’t explicitly mention Coronil in his address at the function, what public functionaries are seen to be doing speaks louder than what they say. Baba Ramdev first claimed that his product was endorsed by the WHO. Following media reports, WHO South-East Asia tweeted that it hadn’t reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment of COVID-19. What transpired was that India’s apex drug regulator had certified Coronil as a pharmaceutical product in “supporting COVID treatment and an immunity booster” and cleared it for export. It hasn’t recommended it as treatment for COVID-19. The publication of a double-blinded, randomised clinical trial in a research journal isn’t an endorsement of a product, but an essential requirement of reporting the drug’s action to subject experts. The report reveals that the medicine was only tested on 95 of those asymptomatic and “mildly symptomatic” but confirmed as RT-PCR positive. The 45 patients who got the actual treatment (and not a dummy pill) tested COVID-19 negative significantly quicker. However, these numbers are small. A large proportion of those with mild or no symptoms are expected to clear out the infection without any external intervention. There was no information in the study on the number of days that elapsed before the patients tested positive, making the role of the drug in clearing out the virus unclear. True, allopathic medicine too has cut corners: an ICMR-led trial ultimately couldn’t justify the administration of hydroxychloroquine; the Drugs Controller General of India approved itolizumab by Biocon that was tested only in a sample of 30 but was advertised as a “breakthrough drug”; and Covaxin was approved before its efficacy was known. Processes are imperfect, but the government must demonstrate its scientific disinterest when evidence is wanting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/scientific-disinterest/article33928138.ece

The condition of one, the head warden, is stated to be critical. Seventeen of the 48 injured naxalites and all the 15 injured wardens have been admitted to hospital. A nine-and-a-half hour curfew was clamped on the municipal area of Berhampur town from 19-30 hours to-day to 05-00 hours to-morrow as a precautionary measure. The District Magistrate of Murshidabad, Ashok Chatterjee, told UNI that the trouble started when a naxalite prisoner suddenly fell upon the head warden and stabbed him with a spring dagger which the extremists had apparently smuggled in. This was a signal for other naxalites to attack, some naxalites started dragging a jail employee into their ward and others armed with iron rods and lathis beat up the wardens. They had torn away the iron rods from the fences inside the jail walls. Naxalites similarly rioted in Midnapore central jail twice in recent weeks, about 20 naxalites escaped from prison in Siliguri on February 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/7-naxalites-die-trying-to-jump-jail/article33928141.ece
25 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cabinet approves PLI plan for pharmaceuticals, IT hardware||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the pharmaceuticals and IT hardware sectors, entailing an outlay of Rs. 15,000 crore and Rs. 7,350 crore, respectively. The PLI scheme for pharmaceuticals, for nine years till 2028-29, will benefit domestic manufacturers, help create employment and is expected to contribute to the availability of a wider range of affordable medicines for consumers, the government said. The scheme is expected to bring in investment of Rs. 15,000 crore in the pharmaceutical sector. “The scheme is expected to promote the production of high-value products in the country and increase the value addition in exports. ‘20,000 direct jobs’ Total incremental sales of Rs. 2,94,000 crore and total incremental exports of Rs. 1,96,000 crore are estimated during six years from 2022-23 to 2027-28,” it said, adding that the growth in the sector is expected to add 20,000 direct and 80,000 indirect jobs for both skilled and unskilled personnel. The scheme also aims to create global champions from India that have the potential to grow in size and scale using cutting edge technology and thereby penetrate global value chains. The Cabinet also approved the PLI Scheme for IT hardware such as laptops, tablets, all-in-one PCs and servers. The scheme, under which an incentive will be given on net incremental sales of goods manufactured in India for four years, will benefit five ‘major global players’ and ten domestic ‘champions’ in IT hardware, the government said. “This is an important segment to promote manufacturing under AtmaNirbhar Bharat as there is huge import reliance for these items at present... It will enhance the development of the electronics ecosystem in the country,” it added. The Centre said the scheme could generate more than 1,80,000 jobs (direct and indirect) over four years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cabinet-approves-pli-plan-for-pharmaceuticals-it-hardware/article33928120.ece
25 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Monetise or modernise’ is Modi’s mantra for govt. assets||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday urged foreign investors to tap investment opportunities thrown up by the government’s decision to privatise most public sector entities and monetise ‘unutilised and underutilised assets’ such as airports that have an estimated investment potential of Rs. 2.5 lakh crore. The government’s mantra is ‘Monetise or Modernise’, the PM said, stressing that the funds raised from the exercise will help empower citizens by building homes for the poor and ensuring clean water reaches all. “Many such flaws remain in our country even today. We cannot wait any longer,” he said. “Our policy goes beyond annual disinvestment targets, to a medium-term strategic approach. This will help create new investment opportunities for industry in every sector. These are valuable assets, have served the country well, and have many future possibilities too. We have often seen, when management changes, fortunes change,” he said at a webinar on Budget announcements related to privatisation and monetisation of assets. Mr. Modi said government officials in charge of PSUs are often scared of taking decisions and there is a tendency to maintain status quo. The private sector can not only bring capital but also introduce global best practices and quality manpower and modernise enterprises, the PM pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/monetise-or-modernise-is-modis-mantra-for-govt-assets/article33928117.ece

They are able to take informed decisions regarding their investments and are recognised by many securities and financial market regulators globally. The accredited investor concept may offer benefits to investors and financial product/service providers, such as flexibility in minimum investment amount, flexibility and relaxation in regulatory requirements and access to products/ services offered exclusively to accredited investors. SEBI said the accreditation once granted shall be valid for a year. It also said the accreditation may be carried out via 'Accreditation Agencies’ which may be the market infrastructure institutions or their subsidiaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-moots-concept-of-accredited-investor/article33928121.ece

In June 2020, NSE had suffered a technical glitch. At that time, its bank option segment prices were not reflecting on the terminal linked to the exchange. In September 2019 too, the bourse’s system faced a trading outage as investors were unable to place orders in the final minutes of the trade. Detailed analysis urged Markets regulator SEBI on Wednesday asked the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to explain why trading on the bourse did not migrate to a disaster recovery site after facing connectivity issues. It also advised the NSE to carry out a detailed root cause analysis of the “trading halt” witnessed at the exchange on Wednesday. The NSE should “explain the reasons for trading not migrating to the disaster recovery site” and asked it to submit a report at the earliest, according to an official statement. A disaster recovery system helps as a plan-B in times of distress to ensure that activity is not affected. “The NSE was also advised to keep the market participants updated with the evolving developments,” SEBI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/nse-trading-hit-after-tech-glitch-resumes-hours-later/article33928124.ece

25 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Padikkal powers Karnataka to easy win||Devdutt Padikkal (152, 140b, 14x4, 5x6) starred in Karnataka’s 101-run victory over Odisha in the Vijay Hazare Trophy at Alur (3) ground here on Wednesday. In good nick Opener Padikkal, who scored 97 and 52 in his previous outings in this tournaments, took his form up a notch to record his third List A century. The southpaw’s exploits propelled him to the top of the tournament’s highest run-scorers chart. Karnataka registered a second win in three Elite Group C matches. Karnataka, Railways and Uttar Pradesh all sit on eight points, with Karnataka ahead of the pack on net run-rate. An unbeaten Kerala leads the standings. Odisha fell to a third loss is as many games. Big opening stand After being put in, Karnataka racked up 329 for five in 50 overs. Padikkal and captain R. Samarth (60, 83b, 4x4) put on a 140-run opening stand. K.V. Siddharth (41, 32b, 5x4, 1x6) and Karun Nair (25, 22b, 3x4) came good in the middle-order, while A. Mithun (40 n.o., 17b, 5x6) applied the finishing touches with some big hits. Odisha struggled in the chase, losing wickets regularly. One-drop Subhransu Senapati (78, 92b, 3x4, 2x6) and Ankit Yadav (56, 63b, 6x4, 1x6) fought hard, but it was not nearly enough. Pacer Prasidh Krishna and leg-spinner Shreyas Gopal picked up three wickets each for Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/padikkal-powers-karnataka-to-easy-win/article33928538.ece
25 February 2021||BENGALURU,||Nidheesh does it for Kerala with the ball||M.D. Nidheesh emerged Kerala’s hero as the southern side pipped Railways by seven runs in a high-scoring Vijay Hazare Trophy Elite Group C match at the Just Cricket Ground near here on Wednesday. Mammoth target Chasing a mammoth 352-run target, Railways’ Harsh Tyagi (58, 32b, 7x4, 2x6) and Amit Mishra (23, 10b, 1x4, 2x6) had combined for a stunning 59-run partnership for the ninth wicket off just 23 balls to bring their side to the threshold of a famous victory. But with just seven needed off four balls, Nidheesh (3/83) removed both batsmen off back-to-back deliveries to leave the railwaymen heartbroken. Midway through the innings, however, the target had seemed too distant. There were half-centuries by opener Mrunal Devdhar (79, 80b, 9x4) and No. 4 Arindam Ghosh (64, 62b, 6x4, 2x6) only for the rest of the top order to fail and leave Railways at 177/5. But Saurabh Singh (50, 52b, 4x4, 1x6) and Karn Sharma (37, 30b, 2x4, 2x6) brought the side back into the contest with a 62-run stand for the sixth wicket. Then, Tyagi and Mishra nearly pulled off the heist, but it was not to be. Earlier, Kerala, which was asked to bat first, rode on yet another fine knock by Robin Uthappa (100, 104b, 8x4, 5x6) and fellow opener Vishnu Vinod (107, 107b, 5x4, 4x6). The two put on 193 at just over run-a-ball to give the side a solid foundation. Samson’s blitz Sanju Samson then came up with a blitz, scoring 61 off just 29 balls, before Vathsal Govind (46 n.o., 34b, 2x4, 3x6) and Jalaj Saxena (13, 9b) accumulated 52 from the last four overs to take Kerala beyond 350.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nidheesh-does-it-for-kerala-with-the-ball/article33928397.ece
25 February 2021||Indore,||Shahrukh’s act not enough for Tamil Nadu||Madhya Pradesh prevailed over Tamil Nadu by 14 runs to register its first win in the Vijay Hazare Trophy (Elite Group B) at the Holkar International Stadium here on Wednesday. Put in, MP was bowled out for 225 with Aditya Shrivastava and Parth Sahani scoring 46 each as the duo added 84 runs for the fifth wicket. For TN, medium-pacer Mohammed was the pick of the bowlers, taking three wickets. In reply, only the in-form Shahrukh Khan waged a lone battle with an unbeaten 67 (77b, 3x4, 5x6) while skipper Dinesh Karthik chipped in with 37. It did not help that there were as many as four run outs in TN’s innings, including that of key batsmen B. Aparajith and B. Indrajith. The middle-order batsman Shahrukh walked in late at No. 8 with the team struggling at 107 for six and almost took TN home, but was unlucky as he ran out of partners. Huge blow With its second defeat in as many matches, TN’s chances of progressing to the knockouts took a huge blow with Jharkhand already having won all its three matches so far. TN coach D. Vasu did not mince words saying, “We should have won this match easily. The run-outs really hurt us today. Shahrukh played a brilliant knock and showed his maturity but ran out of partners. “With the ball too, we did not make the best use of the conditions and could have restricted them to a lesser score which could have made the difference today.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shahrukhs-act-not-enough-for-tamil-nadu/article33928258.ece
25 February 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Axar wrecks England, Rohit steadies India under lights||Axar Patel’s family used to put up a giant screen in his home-town Nadiad, around an hour’s drive from Ahmedabad, whenever he played a televised match. Featuring in a Test at the home of Gujarat cricket for the first time, the left-arm spinner derailed England’s batting to hog the limelight on Wednesday, the first day of the third Test. Axar’s six-wicket haul — his second five-for in as many Test appearances — ensured England could not capitalise on the advantage of winning the toss on a turning track for the pink-ball Test, as India bundled out the visiting side for a paltry 112 in less than two sessions. Silken touch Opening batsman Rohit Sharma continued his silken touch with the willow, his unbeaten fifty guiding the home side to 99 for three at stumps at the Narendra Modi Stadium. The Motera ground, previously known as the Sardar Patel (Gujarat) Stadium, was renamed minutes before the start of play. Even before Axar was introduced into the attack in the seventh over, Ishant Sharma had celebrated his 100th Test appearance in style. In his second over, Ishant forced Dom Sibley to poke at one that rose slightly to offer Rohit catching practice at second slip. Axar didn’t have to wait long, as Jonny Bairstow misread the line of a straight one, which was the left-arm spinner’s first ball of the day. The dismissal sparked the trend of England batsmen playing down the wrong line for the rest of the afternoon. Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope and Jofra Archer committed the same mistake. Senior spinner R. Ashwin tightened the noose in the first session itself by getting the prized scalp of Joe Root. The England captain was guilty of playing on the back foot to one that missed the inside-edge of his bat and rapped him on the pads. While Ashwin was flawless, Axar was rewarded for his variation of pace. Operating in a range from the early 70s to the mid 90s (kmph), Axar bamboozled the England batsmen, who did not appear to have recovered from the debacle in the second Test at Chepauk. The only exception to the ordinary batting was opener Zak Crawley, who shone in his maiden appearance in the series with an impressive innings. His successive boundaries off Ishant — a straight drive followed by a whip through mid-wicket — were among the highlights of the day. Moments after he reached his fifty, he was undone by Axar’s skidder on the cusp of the tea break. It resulted in a collapse after the interval, as England lost six wickets for 31 runs. Tricky period As a result, India’s openers were forced to see off a tricky period before the dinner break. In the last session, Rohit dealt with Jofra Archer’s short-ball ploy but Shubman Gill’s over-ambitious pull resulted in his dismissal. Cheteshwar Pujara then joined the spree of batsmen playing down the wrong line, giving Leach his first wicket. The bespectacled spinner ended the day with an even wider smile after captain Virat Kohli, who had helped Rohit stabilise the innings, chopped one onto the stumps in the final over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/axar-spins-england-to-its-doom-before-rohit-steadies-india/article33928225.ece
25 February 2021||Surat,||Kedar Devdhar’s century sets up Baroda’s victory||Baroda, powered by opener Kedar Devdhar’s century (131, 139b, 14x4, 2x6) defeated Hyderabad by 110 runs in the Elite Group-A league match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy cricket championship here on Wednesday. It was a disappointing show by Hyderabad after convincing wins against Tripura and Chhattisgarh in the two previous games. Useful partnership Put in, Baroda made a challenging score thanks to Devdhar. He added 102 runs for the third wicket with Krunal Pandya (55, 50b 7x4, 1x6) as the Hyderabad bowlers were pushed on to the back foot. The Hyderabad pacers — left-armer Chama Milind, Ajay Dev Goud and T. Ravi Teja — were expensive. Left-arm spinner Mehdi Hasan was economical and also picked up a wicket, but he couldn’t get the breakthrough which the team needed. The other left-arm spinner Tanay Tyagarajan went wicketless. When the chase began it looked the inform openers Tanmay Agarwal (34, 39b, 5x4) and Thakur Tilak Varma (47, 46b, 6x4, 1x6) would come good again.  Captain Tanmay was out to off-spinner Kartik Kakade, stumped by Smit Patel in the 14th over and Tilak was cleaned up by medium-pacer Babashafi Pathan in the next over. And Hyderabad never recovered from those blows. The other batsmen Himalay Agarwal (17), B. Sandeep (18), Mickil Jaiswal (5) and all-rounder Ravi Teja (19) failed to come good. The Baroda bowlers were far more disciplined, with Pathan picking up three wickets and left-arm pacer Lukman Meriwala and Kakade claiming two wickets apiece.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kedar-devdhars-century-sets-up-barodas-victory/article33928893.ece
25 February 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Motera stadium named after Modi||The world’s largest cricket arena at Motera in Ahmedabad, the Sardar Patel Cricket Stadium, was renamed Narendra Modi Stadium and was inaugurated on Wednesday by President Ram Nath Kovind in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, his son Jay Shah, who is BCCI Secretary, and others. The rebuilt stadium is part of the proposed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave to be spread over 220 acres on the Sabarmati river bank in the North East of Ahmedabad. The foundation stone for the Enclave was also laid on Wednesday by the President. It will comprise a natatorium, athletics track, football, hockey and tennis stadia, velodrome/skating area among other facilities. “Coupled with the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave and Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera, a sports complex will also be built in Naranpura,” Home Minister Amit Shah announced in his speech. “These three will be ready to host any international sports event.” The initiative at Motera was the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had conceived it as President of GCA and Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2014. The construction had begun in 2016 and has been completed at the estimated cost of Rs. 800 crore. The refurbished venue is spread over 63 acres and has a seating capacity of 1.1 lakh, more than double the previous number of 49,000. The ground has been equipped with LED floodlights, a first for any Indian sports site. “This stadium was conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat. He was president of the Gujarat Cricket Association at that time," President Ram Nath Kovind said during his inaugural address. It may be noted that exactly one year ago, on February 24, PM Modi had hosted the then US President Donald Trump at the same venue in a mega event Namaste Trump.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/motera-stadium-named-after-modi/article33928229.ece

25 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||Training in a big stadium will be helpful: Sindhu||For P.V. Sindhu, it has been a different kind of experience — to train under Korean coach Park Tae Sang at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here with two young, relatively unknown sparring partners. Preparing for the Swiss Open and the All England Championships next month, the 25-year-old believes that the experience of training in a big stadium like Gachibowli, with the drift factor in play, should be useful in future campaigns. “When I played across bigger stadia, I realised the drift factor was a major issue. Now, I am getting used to training with blowers at the Gachibowli Stadium and this should be handy as the drift factor often led to many unforced errors earlier,” Sindhu said in a chat with The Hindu . Is this a new idea? “Not really. It has been there for a long time. My father has been suggesting this for a while,” the World No. 7 revealed. “ I am grateful to SAI and SATS for letting me train here.” “Park has been really helpful in rectifying my mistakes after the Thailand events (last month) that did not end on a good note for me. I hope to come back much stronger,” Sindhu said. “The draw (for All England) looks pretty good. Of course Tai Tzu is not playing, but the other big names like Carolina and Ratchanok, besides top players from Japan, will be there. One player’s absence doesn’t take away the charm of the championship. “The coach-player relationship is all about communication before and between the matches, apart from believing in each other,” Sindhu said about Park. “The ultimate goal is to win an Olympic gold. I know it is not going to be easy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/training-in-a-big-stadium-will-be-helpful-sindhu/article33928113.ece

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Bipin ’tricks as Mumbai routs Odisha||Bipin Singh scored this season’s first hat-trick as Mumbai City FC thrashed bottom-placed Odisha FC 6-1 in their penultimate ISL match at the GMC Stadium, Bambolim on Wednesday. Nigerian striker Bartholomew Ogbeche helped himself to a brace as Mumbai City led 4-1 at half-time. With this comfortable victory, Mumbai City stays in contention for the League Winners Shield. In its final league contest, it will take on table-topper ATK Mohun Bagan on February 28. Odisha will stay at the bottom with nine points and one match remaining. Taking charge Though Odisha took everyone by surprise with an early goal off a penalty by Diego Maurico, the Islanders quickly took charge with four goals in the first session. Ogbeche’s goals, both headers, came off assists from Ahmed Jahouh. Bipin, replacing Rowlin Borges in the first XI, was outstanding. He scored the team’s second goal with a strong finish after Ogbeche’s strike deflected off a defender’s leg. Bartholomew Ogbeche’s second headed goal, and the team’s third, was unlike his first which he scored by getting down to head home. Cy Goddard’s superb drive, thanks to a poor clearance, had Mumbai going into the break with a three-goal advantage. Neat pass Two minutes into the second session, Bipin converted off a neat pass by Ogbeche before Ahmed Jahouh, missed a penalty as Odisha ’keeper Arshdeep Singh guessed right to put it away. In the 86th minute, after Rowlin Borges’ shot was saved by Arshdeep, the predatory Bipin rushed to the complete the hat-trick.  The result: Mumbai City FC 6 (Bartholomew Ogbeche 14 & 43, Bipin Singh 38, 47 & 86, Cy Goddard 44) bt Odisha FC 1 (Diego Mauricio 9-pen)   Thursday’s match: Jamshedpur FC v Bengaluru FC, 7.30 p.m .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bipin-tricks-as-mumbai-routs-odisha/article33928260.ece
25 February 2021||Kochi,||Sreeshankar appears to be in good form||The performances in last week’s Indian Grand Prix-1, the national season-opener, may not have raised excitement levels much, but with the arrival of young long jumper M. Sreeshankar in Patiala, there is a lot to look forward to in Thursday’s IGP-2. The 21-year-old national record-holder from Kerala appears to be in good form and has plans to pull off a big one. “I don’t want to tell the distance but I’m very optimistic about tomorrow. My first focus is breaking my personal best (8.20m) and hopefully qualify for the Olympics (qualification standard 8.22m),” Sreeshankar told The Hindu from Patiala on Wednesday. “Everything looks good.” Interesting duel Meanwhile, on the track, the women’s 100m duel between World University Games champion Dutee Chand and the 2018 under-20 World 400m gold medallist Hima Das should be an interesting one. Hima, the 400m National record holder who appears to have given up the quartermile now for some strange reason, will be opening her season in the 100m and 200m here. The second GP will also see some of the big stars like Asian Games men’s shot put champion Tajinderpal Singh Toor and Asian women’s javelin silver medallist Annu Rani start their competition season. But top star Neeraj Chopra will be missing. “I will be competing in the IGP-3 (on March 5, Patiala)...Neeraj will be there too,” said Shivpal Singh, who like Asian Games and Commonwealth Games javelin champion Neeraj, has already qualified for the Olympics. National 400m record holder Muhammed Anas and Arokia Rajiv will once again be skipping the quartermile and will face off in the 200m. In the women’s 400m the seasoned M.R. Poovamma and young Kiran Pahal will be ones to watch. Manjit Singh, who stunned Jinson Johnson to win the 2018 Asian Games 800m gold in Jakarta, will also be in action in the 1500m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sreeshankar-appears-to-be-in-good-form/article33928394.ece
25 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sable gears up for Indian Grand Prix 3, Fed Cup||Having decided to skip the Indian Grands Prix, steeplechaser Avinash Sable has had a re-think and will now be participating in the third leg of the competition on March 5 in Patiala. This will be followed by the Federation Cup later next month. Confirming this from his training base in Bengaluru, Sable, the only individual Indian track athlete to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics so far, said the decision was taken keeping in mind the lack of competition for a long time and his fitness. “My last outing was the 2019 World Championships, so it’s been a really long time since then. Although I have been training well, participating in a competition is always different. Since I have been managing my fitness levels pretty well, I decided to test myself at the IGP,” Sable told The Hindu . This will also be the first competitive event for Sable since the Airtel Delhi Half-Marathon last year, which he won with a new national record, finishing 10th overall in an elite field. It will also be his first event under coach Nikolai Sneserev, who was re-appointed as the middle and long distance coach by SAI and AFI last month. Really beneficial  “Given that this is the Olympics year, I feel it will be really beneficial to train under him once again. I did well earlier also when he was here and I think working with him again will help me improve my performances a lot in the run-up to the Olympics and especially at the Diamond League events starting in May,” Sable added. Belarussian Sneserev, who quit in February 2019 after being left with no trainees with Sable opting to train under Services coach Amrish Kumar, is expected to reach India on Thursday. Meanwhile, AFI confirmed that the javelin throwing duo of Shivpal Singh and Neeraj Chopra would not be part of the second IGP on February 25. “They arrived in Patiala well in time but had decided against participating. That hasn’t changed. So there is no question of they being included. National record holder Annu Rani, however, will be participating after her name was included in the revised list,” an AFI official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sable-gears-up-for-igp-3-fed-cup/article33928431.ece

25 February 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Bowling wicket-to-wicket worked, says Axar||On a pitch where only the odd ball turned on the first day, the key for India’s spinners was to target the stumps. Left-arm spinner Axar Patel said the ploy worked to perfection. “Since the ball was skidding, you prefer bowling wicket-to-wicket because if the batsman tends to play on the back foot, you have a good chance of getting an lbw or bowled. I was discussing the same with Ash [Ashwin] that the ball wasn’t turning a lot so we planned to bowl wicket-to-wicket,” Axar said after the opening day’s play. Axar is known for deceiving batsmen with his arm-ball in domestic cricket. Over the last two weeks, he has repeated the trick on a bigger stage, flummoxing England. Crediting former India off-spinner M. Venkataramana’s influence on his skills during his time at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru, Axar added that his early days as a seamer had also helped in mastering the arm-ball. “When I went to NCA early on, I learnt a lot from Venkat sir. Since I used to bowl fast as a kid, I tend to bowl slightly quicker. I turned into a spin bowler once I had a bit of a knee problem. I think that’s what has helped me bowl arm-balls better,” he said. Home advantage? Axar, who had played only a solitary First Class game at Motera coming into the match, had no qualms in admitting he didn’t enjoy any advantage on the pitch. “There wasn’t really any home advantage in that respect because it’s a new stadium, new pitch and we were playing a match here after more than five years,” he said. “But the fact that the Gujarati crowd was cheering us in the local language made me feel the home advantage. Otherwise it was equal for both teams.”  A lot of wickets were with the ball that went straight on. I think that is what we found challenging today Crawley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bowling-wicket-to-wicket-worked-says-axar/article33928780.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Ramanujacharya’s glory||Vedanta Desika wrote Adhikarana Saravali to expand on the points made by Ramanujacharya in his Sri Bhashyam, which is a commentary on sage Vyasa’s Brahma Sutra. In his Yatiraja Saptati, Desika shows us the glory of Ramanuja and his philosophy, said Veliyanallur T.S.R. Narayanachariar in a discourse. In a lighter vein, Desika says in Yatiraja Saptati that even Gods succumb to the pulls of the world. Brahma has given Sarasvathi a place in his tongue; Siva accommodates Parvathi in one half of his body; Krishna danced with the Gopikas. But Ramanuja was able to keep worldly charms away and devoted himself to the cause of Vedanta, says Desika. When one talks of the Supreme One, one of the descriptions is that He is satyam. Split this word as ‘sat,’ ‘yat,’ and ‘am,’ and you can see that it indicates tattva traya — cit, acit and Iswara. Satya incorporates in itself the three tattvas. This Supreme Truth — satya — remains the same always. In the Ramayana, Sugriva says Rama always speaks the truth. He does not say one thing one moment and something else the next. That kind of adherence to the absolute truth always characterised Ramanuja and his writings. Throughout his works, he upheld the Visishtadvaita philosophy. What Ramanuja explains briefly through his Sri Bhashyam is explained in greater detail by Desika in Adhikarana Saravali. Such an elaborate elucidation is necessary, because philosophy is not easily comprehended. Different schools of philosophy interpret scriptural texts in different ways. Nathamuni, and later Alavandar, did put forward Visishtadvaitic concepts, but it was Ramanuja who strengthened the school of thought. To help us grasp the Visishtadvaita philosophy in its entirety, later Acharyas added to the wealth of Visishtadvaitic literature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ramanujacharyas-glory/article33928219.ece

After a little over six minutes (6:06.9s, a national record), the 21-year-old from Yamuna Nagar in Haryana realised that he had finished sixth in the under-23 2000m event at the World indoor rowing championships held virtually this time. “Actually, I wasn’t even expecting a top 10, I was expecting between 12 to 15,” Parminder told The Hindu from Pune, where Indian rowers are training for next year’s Asian Games, on Wednesday evening. “It’s the first time an Indian had finished sixth in the indoor Worlds. I see great potential in him. We knew that he was extremely good but we didn’t know that he was so good,” said M.V. Sriram, the secretary general of the Rowing Federation of India, from Chennai.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Hittu wicket||My taste buds are on fire. I am biting into ragi hittu (or ragi flour balls), made of finger millets dipped in sandege — a fiery chutney-like gravy made using roasted garlic and pepper — at Nanga Hittu; a newly-opened restaurant in Coimbatore that serves the traditional cuisine of the Badagas, a native tribe of the Nilgiris. The buttery hittu has a small depression on top into which molten ghee is poured. There is also a choice of avarai uthakka ,  a  curry made with three varieties of seasonal beans and potato, or kappa koi uthakka (chicken gravy) and adu baadu uthakka (mutton gravy) to go with it. Paintings tracing the origin of the Badagas adorn the walls as we dig into white rice after adding avarai uthakka to it; this nutritious and wholesome gravy is a staple at Badaga weddings. It is believed that the Badagas have lived in the Nilgiris for thousand of years. Throughout the Nilgiris, they live in nearly 400 villages called hattis, a cluster of of houses surrounded by tea on low hillocks. Unlike the other hill tribes like the Todas, Kotas, Kurumbas and the Irulas, the Badagas embraced change that came with the British. The restaurant started by Vignesh Chandran, a Badaga, along with Deepa Sudhakar from Udhagamandalam, is an attempt to revive and promote forgotten recipes of the community. “This is the first time anyone has come up with an exclusive restaurant for Badaga cuisine,” says Deepa, adding, “Our restaurant is a talking point among the members of the International Badaga Association in the US now.” Reviving memories The cook, Uma Murugan,who sports traditional Badaga attire: a white cloth wrapped around her shoulders and another worn as headgear, says, traditionally, Badagas consumed varieties of millets.“We used to make a steamed dish with ootukudi (bamboo shoots) once a year. It is collected after trekking deep into the forest. With people moving to the plains for education and jobs, the dish has been forgotten now,” she sighs. Another forgotten dish is hatchike , a dessert made with little millet or saamai ; it involves roasting, boiling and pounding the millet to de-husk it before soaking it in hot milk and topping with grated coconut. Uma and her husband Murugan Palani, who are from Kinnakorai village in Udhagamandalam, have stuck to tried and tested recipes. The result? A delicious and honest taste. A special spice powder they call hatti maas hudi , which is made from roasted chillies, coriander seeds,cinnamon, asafoetida, and khus khus, is used in the vegetarian reparations. For the meat-based curries, a deep black masala made from chillies, whole coriander seeds,jeera, pepper, and cloves is used. “This is an effort to revive forgotten recipes and keep the memories alive, and to also give a taste of our food to non-Badagas,” says Deepa.She describes the aroma that fills homes when they make thuppadahittu , a deep-fried snack from maida dough mixed with sugar, khus khus, elaichi and mashed bananas. They are also reaching out to elders in the villages to retrace recipes that have been popular in the last five decades. At the moment, Nanga Hittu serves lunch and snacks like thuppadahittu , ragi hittu and pothittu (wheat dosa served with a sweet concoction made of coconut milk and khus khus). As we talk, a platter of thuppadahittu and hutti kaapi (black coffee sweetened with jaggery) makes its way to the table. I tear a piece, dip it in the black coffee and then eat it, just the way the Badagas do.  The restaurant is at Thangam & AMP Junction Mini Mall, Cheran Nagar, Mettupalayam Main Road, Coimbatore.   For details, 99529-98443/ 9500269697.   looking back Badaga farmers are known for their mixed farming of millets, barley, wheat and vegetables including potato, carrots and cabbage, and hence the food they eat often uses seasonal and locally-grown vegetables. They also took to cultivation of beans and cauliflower on a large scale besides spices like cardamom and pepper, till the British-owned tea and coffee plantations took over the landscape.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/hittu-wicket/article33928768.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Burmese days||American journalist Gene Fowler’s sentiment that ‘news is history shot on the wing’ comes true nearly every day across the world. For many families in southern India, particularly Tamil Nadu, this has meant watching the declaration of military rule in Myanmar (formerly Burma) this month with more than just a passing interest, because the two regions share a history that goes back several centuries. Emperor Rajendra Chola (1014-1044 AD), expanded his empire to the Bay of Bengal, including parts of southern Burma. By the mid-19th Century, Tamils migrated to Burma which was also a British colony annexed through the three Anglo-Burmese wars. Though Burma was separated from British India in 1937, just 10 years before the subcontinent would gain its own Independence from the Raj, the ties that bind have continued to hold. There was a mass exodus of Indians from Burma after the Second World War and after the military dictatorship took over in 1963. Despite this, many maintain links with their family members who chose to stay on in Burma. Returning home After the coup d’etat of 1962, which marked the political dominance of the army in Burma, Indian expatriates, were asked to either become citizens or leave the country. About 1,55,000 persons of Indian origin returned to India for good from Burma between 1963 and 1970. They were resettled in ‘Burma Colonies’ set up by the Indian Government in cities like Chennai, Tiruchi and Madurai. Many of the affluent Chettiar community expatriates (who had made their name in finance and business) in Burma had started offshoring their earnings in India early on, but the bulk of the Tamil population — people working as indentured labourers, farmers, petty traders and professionals — had to leave at short notice. “In 1965, I came with my younger brother and sister to India. My other relatives are still in Burma. My mother had said we were going for a wedding and would be back in two days, but only later did I realise that she had fooled me,” says M Sundarraj, a former mason who resettled in the Burma Colony in Navalpattu town near Tiruchi. His neighbour S Govindan, a retired security guard at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), recounts his return with 15 family members by ship. “We were sent to the camp at Gummidipoondi where we were counselled about our future prospects. The Indian authorities advised us about where we could go, depending on our skills,” says Govindan. Though originally from Ramanathapuram district, the two men relocated to Navalpattu because of the presence of BHEL and the Ordnance Factory Tiruchi (OFT) nearby. “It was a big culture shock for us. The poverty and climate were unbearable. But somehow, we managed to settle down here,” Govindan says. One of his many co-passengers was A Panthanam, an 80-year-old homemaker whose mother was a Burmese national. “My father was a farmer [originally from Bhuvanthi near Madurai] and we were a family of 12 children. We hadn’t visited India in a long time. In the 1960s, Indian farmers feared losing their crops and property to Burmese guerrilla fighters, which is why my husband and I decided to return,” she says. E Jaffersha travelled back voluntarily with his sister to Madurai in 1969, in the hope of studying Medicine. But life had other plans. “The savings sent by my father to my relatives for safekeeping got misused, and I was unable to join the PUC course that would help me get into college. I obtained a diploma in Homoeopathy after being trained by a doctor in Madurai and later got professionally licensed by the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in Tiruchi,” he says. While his sister was married to their cousin in Madurai, he tied the knot with a Burmese returnee. “The initial days were tough, but I was lucky to meet helpful people along the way. I even stood for local elections,” says Jaffersha, who runs a clinic from his home in Burma Colony, Gundur. Indelible links Sri Pilikan Muneeswarar Sri Angala Parameswari Thirukovil in Mathur, Pudukottai district, has been frequented by worshippers since 1963. Burma resides in the name of this temple (Pilikan or Pelikha is a village near Kyauktan, Myanmar), and also in the shrine’s foundation. “This temple was built with a handful of soil from Burma in 1963. Since then, small amounts of the mud have been shared in Chennai, Thanjavur, Tiruchi Airport and Navalpattu to build temples in areas where Burmese returnees live,” says R Bhagyam, who has been its priest since the beginning. The cultural exchange between Burma and southern India was largely nurtured by the Chettiar community, says columnist and Chennai chronicler V Sriram. “Chettiars, particularly the Nagarathar Chettiars from Karaikudi, made their fortune in Burma as financiers of agriculture and trade,” he says. He adds that before the Great Depression of 1929, the common interest rate for trading in Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka would be decided in the Nagarathar Chatram on Coral Merchant Street in Madras, and communicated via telegram. “As there was a large Tamil population in Burma, it ranked very high in terms of the performing career of many Carnatic musicians in the 1940s,” says Sriram. Back in India, Burma has lingered not just in settler colonies, ‘Burma Bazaars’ and atho and idiappam eateries, but also in little things like the vetthilai petti (known in Burmese as kun it ), a tall bamboo container coated with pitch and lacquer used to store betel leaves, nuts and lime, traditionally gifted to brides. As Chintamani, a Madurai homemaker who returned in 1963 with her parents and siblings from Bago, Burma, shows us her vetthilai petti over a video conference call, she pulls out other mementos that she has kept safe over the years. “These are the Union of Burma Airways (UBA) flight tickets that brought us to Calcutta from Rangoon,” she says. “And this is the passport of my paternal grandmother Meenachi, issued in 1916. She was a widowed petty trader who split her time between Burma and her native village near Karaikudi to support her family.” In Navalpattu, Tiruchi, Sundarraj brews a pot of Burmese tea that he brought back after a recent visit while Govindan wets a piece of sandalwood and grinds it on a circular stone slab to get a paste that is dabbed on the face. “This used to be a common skin coolant in Burma, and we now use it when we want to remember our days there,” he says. Memories, luckily, don’t need visas to travel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/burmese-days/article33928765.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I have become more courageous now’||Shruti Haasan was barely six when she first stepped into a recording studio. The occasion was momentous: she was to croon a few lines for composer Ilaiyaraaja in Thevar Magan . “I knew it was important because my father (Kamal Haasan) was nervous that I get it right,” she recalls, over phone from Mumbai. “I just remember going to this really cool place and having a new experience. It’s only later that I realised the value of it, and what it meant to my life and music.” The memory of that occasion might be hazy but the experience prodded her on to take up a career in the arts. Her latest musical outing is the ‘Yaazha Yaazha’ track for upcoming Tamil film Laabam, in which she co-stars with Vijay Sethupathi. She credits composer D Imman for roping her in to sing the track, a melody which, she says, utilises her vocals in a unique manner. “When [Imman] called me, I asked, ‘Do you think people would expect me to sing this?’. He said ‘No, that’s why you ought to sing it’.” Her varied musical influences during childhood contributes a lot to the musician she is today. “My mom had impeccable taste in music. My dad is a wonderful singer himself; when we hang out we sing together. He introduced me to The Who and The Beatles which changed my concept of how one can write a song,” she says. Shruti started out as a singer-musician, but slowly branched out to acting as well. “It took me many years to get as comfortable with acting. But now, I cannot imagine removing that from my life because I express a different part of my artistic self through cinema.” A few years ago, Shruti Haasan was eyeing a lot of big-ticket projects in Tamil; she was seen in Suriya’s 7aum Arivu and Vijay-starrer Puli . With the recent influx of OTT platforms, Shruti has been in the thick of things; she was seen in Amazon Prime’s Tamil anthology Putham Pudhu Kaalai in 2020, and more recently in Netflix’s Telugu anthology Pitha Kathalu . “The industry is very different from what it was a decade ago. I have become more courageous now,” she remarks. Also part of the new Shruti Haasan we are seeing is her playing a mother in recent Telugu hit Krack , starring Ravi Teja. “A lot of people questioned me for that. It was a risk I was willing to take, and it really paid off. These were not risks that I would have taken before.” This year will see more of the risk taker in Shruti. Laabam , which has been in the making for a long time, will revolve around farmers — a hot topic currently. “People will connect with the storyline, especially with the situation in the country (farmers’ protest),” she says, adding, “I feel that it is important to make statements through cinema.” Her other biggie, Pawan Kalyan-starrer Telugu film Vakeel Saab , strives to do that. It is a remake of acclaimed Hindi film Pink . “Making such films is important. And then, if you have someone like Pawan Kalyan who can influence the masses, it’s great. Anybody in a position of influence using it to provoke thought is powerful,” says Shruti, who is also part of Prabhas-starrer Salaar and has an Amazon Prime web-series lined up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-have-become-more-courageous-now/article33928732.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A gin powered facelift||In the middle of nowhere, Party Land thrived. Launched in the ‘80s, it slowly evolved through the ‘90s, and was then rebranded as Green Meadows in 2010. Meanwhile, as the city grew, engulfing it, the venue became more than just a Saturday night destination. Over the decades the three-acre property in Palavakkam, lush with trees and vivid with flowers, was enhanced with banqueting halls, rooms, a restaurant and bar as it began hosting everything from weddings to office team- building lunches. Now, it has had its most dramatic facelift yet. Replacing the dated neon Grasshopper ‘restobar,’ reminiscent of Cher, crop tops and syrupy cosmopolitans (in short: good times), stands Origin, a chic cocktail bar. The old Hoppers Kitchen, exulting in lacy Keralaappams, will be replaced with Bayroot, offering Middle Eastern food next. And that is not all. Japtej Ahluwalia, Nikesh Lamba and Vikram Mohan of Pricol Gourmet, who run a host of popular restaurants including Double Roti, Savya Rasa and Soy Soi, have added the property to their portfolio, with a focus on turning it into an entertainment destination, complete with rooms, a pool and sprawling banquet halls for parties. And though the Green Meadows brand seems dated, they have decided to build on the past instead of tearing it down, thus capitalising on rose-tinted memories of a generation that grew up attending parties here, even as they set out to create a contemporary space that also appeals to a younger, more globalised audience. Origin is a fluid fusion of garden and glass, sparkling with sunshine and jazz. The grass and stone-striped open air dining space, crowned with a DJ console, is flanked by two air-conditioned wings of the bar, enabling intimate seating pockets. Its clean design is echoed in the cocktail menu, offering classics and shooters in addition to a line-up of drinks fusing local ingredients, dehydrated fruit, alcohol and imagination. “Balance is key,” states Kathiravan Govindaraj, from the Pricol team, whose many years as a sommelier in luxury hotels has clearly had an impact on the bar. The classic Pinacolada, for instance, is spiked with an in-house pandan tincture, and woven with flavours of hazelnut, banana and coconut, in addition to pineapple, dark and light rum, then served in generously plump pineapple-shaped glasses. If you want something more adventurous try the No Name, presented as a set of test tubes containing extracts of blue pea flower, lemon grass, elderflower, lime and gin. Harnessing molecular gastronomy’s favourite gadgets, the team uses spherification, dehydration, smoking and foams, but does so judiciously, to enhance flavour and add playful textures instead of simply showing off technique. Hibiscus from the garden finds its way into a very pink PG&T, boasting pomegranate, tonic, litchi and gin. The Grapefruit Coconut G&T bobs with tender coconut caviar, while the Old Fashioned features bourbon spiked with smoky orange zest. Try the Margarita, heady with tequila, orange liquor and lime. Or ask Jay Suyal, Origin’s lead bartender, to pour you a spicy, refreshing chilli gin, generously flecked with fresh coriander. Explaining that the food is “tapas style,” featuring small plates, Japtej introduces their executive Chef Gopalsamy Mani, who has worked with leading hotels chains, most recently in West Asia. To provide something for everyone, without descending into a generic “multi cuisine” kitchen, Origin offers abbreviated versions of popular classics, attempting to pack each plate with a chorus of familiar flavours. Creamy galouti kebabs, for instance, balanced on corn meal coins. Or prawn moilee, dusted with dehydrated curry leaves and served on appam blinis. Vegetarians: try the fiery Guntur mini idlis and the creamy malai broccoli. As with the cocktails, there is an appealing simplicity to the dishes that belies the work behind the scenes: tender squiggles of stir fried squid, for example, resplendent in just salt and pepper. The property currently has two halls, lawns and amandapam, and the team is gearing up to host events. A health club is in the works. And in a few weeks, the West Asian restaurant, Bayroot, will be up and running. Evidently, party land is here again.  Origin is at 364 A, Anna Salai Road, Palavakkam Kuppam, Palavakkam.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Madras’ spiny namesake||In 2011-2012, when ecologist Brawin Kumar was in the town of Nanguneri, near Tirunelveli, he was told multiple tales about pangolins and peacocks making their way into nearby farmland. But the most interesting report he got, was of “a kind of rat. At least, it looked like a rat, but it had no tail. And it has a lot of thorns.” He visited the village again and again, to catch sight of this creature that no one in the area could identify. It took multiple visits before he finally saw one, crawling away from him towards a cover of trees. He tried to be quiet, but ended up sneezing. Immediately, the mystery creature curled into a ball of spines. At the time, Brawin was with the Coimbatore-based NGO ZOO/WILD, with whom he quickly put out questionnaire surveys in Tamil, trying to trace the creature’s sightings. The results told them a lot, but also very little. The Madras hedgehog, also known as the bare-bellied hedgehog, was discovered in 1851 in what was then known as the Madras Presidency, says Brawin, over phone from Nagercoil. These insectivorous spiny mammals “have been on this land since before human evolution,” claims Brawin, “And yet, there is no mention of them even in our folk tales”. Neither is there a name assigned just for it: “In Tamil, we call them mul eli – mul meaning thorn, and eli meaning rat – or irmal eli aka cough rat,” says Brawin, clarifying that the creature is not in fact a rat. Their strongest connection to humans in central Tamil Nadu is an unfortunate one: as an ingredient in traditional medicine, or in household remedies for coughs, rheumatism and the like. “Some shops in Nagercoil still sell hedgehog oil,” he says. While the local populace seems well aware of the creature and its behaviour, “the animal is still rare to sight, and in the last 20 years its population has declined drastically.” The latter, he states, is mainly due to habitat changes, development, and its capture for domestication or sale: “Semi-arid areas were converted to monocrop plantations, arid ones were occupied. People tried keeping these hedgehogs as pets.” Over the last six years of his fieldwork, Brawin has managed to spot the hedgehog only 19 times. He has seen more of them as roadkill, in the same stretch of time. Almost invisible  “Generally, when it comes to wildlife and conservation, people are more concerned with large animals and charismatic mammals: the flagship species,” he says, adding, “But of the 423 animals we have in India, 50% are rats and bats. Besides these, we have shrews, pangolins, hedgehogs and other small mammals, each less than two kilograms that are not always looked at.” Usually, these smaller creatures end up indirectly benefiting from human efforts to conserve the larger mammals they share a habitat with. But for this hedgehog, the case is different “because it often dwells in urban landscapes: in backyards of homes in semi-arid areas of low elevation,” says Brawin. In fact, some of the creature’s homes might be considered the polar opposite of a protected wildlife area — Brawin has seen them mainly in windmill farms. Newer habitats are still being discovered, adds Brawin: “There are some records and I have also noticed them in some high-elevation areas of the Western Ghats and mostly in the Eastern Ghats.” But the records, he reiterates, fall far short of what they should be. One reason could be that this animal, not being endangered, is not listed in the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act. “There is no preserved specimen of this hedgehog, other than one skeleton in the Madras Museum,” he points out. Even outside a museum, in the everyday world, the Madras hedgehog is not commonly spotted, adds Brawin: “They are nocturnal, and have unique habitats that have only been seen in selected patches.” Researching other species of hedgehogs would not entirely help — as the hedgehogs in India are distinct in many ways. For instance, hedgehogs in the UK, Africa and Central Asia hibernate in winter, but the ones in South India estivate in summer instead. Brawin himself had no idea about this till 2014, when he came upon a Madras hedgehog in Tirunelveli that alarmed him. “It weighed very little, and I thought it was sick or dying. But I read up, and found out that for these creatures go into their burrows and sleep continuously for two months, to reduce their metabolic activity. They are in dormant state.” They don’t dig much, but instead use burrows previously dug by other mammals, like pangolins. Their home range is long — they keep moving and only stay in one place for long during breeding season.” In Tamil Nadu, they can be found in parts of Tiruppur, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Karur and Namakkal, besides a few locations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. “This is a rare animal, and it is our own. We should know about it, protect and preserve it,” he signs off, adding “At the very least, we should be encouraging it to live.”  life on hold  Not everyone hibernates.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The tree and its stories||In 1996, when German visual artist Birgitta Volz was dabbling with wood printing and tree bark printing, she felt particularly attracted to a rather “unspectacular” willow ( Salix caprea ) tree. She immediately started working on a large, abstract composition as the tree’s bark patterns were not uniform. But owing to strong winds, she had to give up. A few days later, when she looked at the result, she was shocked — “My composition looked like a life-size witch!” Incidentally, Volz found out that in the Alps, there is a mention of a character ‘the white woman or salic woman’ who is referred to as the changing spirit of the willow. This was the start to a long and eye-opening journey with bark printing for the artist, who moved to Auroville in 2005. The technique involves applying organic colour onto tree bark, and superimposing it with paper or fabric, to receive prints that mimic patterns seen on the outer skin of the bark. The artist, who has 100 solo shows and over 200 group shows across 20 countries to her credit, is currently showing a collection of bark prints in an exhibition titled Temple Tree at the Pavilion of Tibetan Culture International Zone, Auroville. “I have always loved wood prints and slowly learned to take prints from uneven and huge wooden planks, where one can’t use a press. I even did my own wooden sculptures and printed them. Then in 1994, I printed a piece of fresh bark for the first time and to my surprise, it worked,” says Volz. She has not looked back since. “The tree gets a good cleaning with a brush before I apply a thin layer of organic oil colour on the outer skin. Then I pin paper or fabric on it, and rub the colour through, with soft pressure,” Volz explains, adding that the technique is completely harmless to the tree, since there are no chemicals or solvents involved. The prints are left to dry overnight. While most prints may seem abstract, some patterns give way to figures that arise naturally. “I never manipulate the tree. The print making is like meditation in motion. I rarely see images on the bark; all I control is the composition. Figures become visible only later in the studio. I sometimes draw or paint around what I discover, to make them perceptible,” Volz adds. In her current exhibition, the focus is on prints from a tree located next to the Pavilion of Tibetan Culture. When she started working on this tree, she had a “vague feeling that [the Hindu god] Ganesha would show up”. And, so half of the prints feature abstract manifestations of Ganesha. A tree, says Volz, says a lot about the environment it is in. “It seems as if the trees record the history of their place, and of its ‘clandestine’ inhabitants,” she adds. For instance, a couple of years ago, she had printed a 3,000-year-old baobab tree that led her to a lot of stories surrounding African culture.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Nostalgia on a blank page||Hours after hiding behind uncertain grey clouds, the sun is finally out. Photographer Varun Gupta is relieved. The harsh sun is a friend today, as we prepare to make cyanotype prints; photographic, analogue prints awash with a cyan-blue tinge that gives it an almost ‘vintage’ makeover. At the Chennai Photo Biennale Foundation’s office in Adyar, multiple trays line up holding film negatives, papers of many sizes and brushes. For the past few weeks, the team at CPB has been experimenting with this technique before co-founder Varun decided to open it up as a workshop for the public, over the weekend. Cyanotype was invented in 1842 by English experimental photographer John Herschel and the process was created to make copies or blueprints of architectural drawings and engineering sketches which were done on tracing paper. “Two or three years after, it was adopted by Anna Atkins, who is considered the first woman photographer in the world. And, she has done an entire body of work by collecting plants, especially seaweed for making prints. She brought forth the idea that photographers can work with this process,” says Varun, who had his first interaction with cyanotypes in 2006. Photograms (a photographic image made without a camera by placing objects on photosensitive material and exposing them to light) are what Atkins experimented with extensively, and so objects became a common component of the process, he continues. When a digital or analogue negative comes into the picture, cyanotype prints emerge. Either way, the process relies heavily on negative spaces created by the shadow of the objects in play. A few sheets of paper are now being clipped on to a dark board. In minutes, these sheets will transform into photographic prints that capture the essence of this “hands-on”, analogue process of image development. Varun picks up small bottles containing ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide: equal parts of both are mixed to form an inky concoction. Individually, these two chemicals are not light sensitive and only when mixed, do their photosensitivity come alive. “The chemicals harden when exposed to light and when not exposed, they wash away,” Varun explains. And so, when an object is placed on the painted chemicals and exposed to light, the area below the object washes off creating a negative space. “For printing photographs, hot press paper would be ideal but for printing leaves and patterns, textured papers work very well. Anything above 200 gsm (grams per square metres) is better,” he continues. But how does one get their hands on large format negatives of their images? Varun scans the images and converts them into digital negatives to print them out onto OHP sheets. Now, the yellow liquid is spread evenly on the clipped sheets of paper. To further give it a “handpainted feel”, Varun lets the brush loose to create patterns. Once the chemicals dry out, the negatives are stuck firmly on each sheet and pressed down. As the sun hits the sheets, the yellow of the chemicals slowly gives away to a subtle blue. Twenty minutes later, the blue dominates as the photograph emerges as a print. To take the process a step ahead, these prints can also be toned with tea or coffee and carried out on fabric. One of the most important aspects of cyanotype printing is that it is perhaps one of the cheapest ways to print: one can get started under a reasonable budget of Rs. 1,000. And, each print is likely to stay intact for 50 to 60 years. CPB is also in the process of making a kit with all the necessary tools meant for the process. “But right now, it’s in the R&D phase,” Varun quickly adds. “The photography challenge in the digital era has been that you can buy how many ever copies of the same photograph but there is nothing unique about them. In this way, each print is unique. Then, there is an opportunity for photography to be in the space of creating original art,” says Varun, as we clip the prints to dry on a cloth line. In a few minutes, these will be keepsakes.  Slots are open for the Sunday session from 11 am to 4pm at CPB Foundation, Adyar.

Thus began Samartha’s tryst with horses. He has since won several competitions in the Dressage category. A recent among them was the FEI (Fédération Equestre Internationale) 2020 held in November, in which he won the all-India silver and stood fifth in world ranking. He trained with a club in Chennai and when he decided to pursue the sport seriously, moved to the Chennai Equitation Centre at the age of 12. “It was then that I started showing improvement, riding more horses and travelled to cities such as Bengaluru to participate in competitions.” Samartha enjoys competing, but more than anything else, he enjoys spending time with horses, which he says is crucial to his success. He recalls the horses he met along the way, some of whom changed his life, like a pony called Moonlight. “He was stubborn and could not canter,” says Samartha. “But I practised and practised on him with my coach and he reached the highest levels in competitions,” he adds. In 2017 and 2018, Samartha emerged the Grand Champion in the Indian Dressage Development League, and won an individual as well as team gold for showjumping at the Junior Nationals in 2019. That year was unforgettable for Samartha in another way as well. “For my birthday that year, my father dressed up Blue Casper in a bow and walked him to me, saying he was mine,” he says. “He saw something between us.” From then on, Samartha started training on Blue Casper and today “there is no difference between him and a high-level horse,” he boasts. Samartha travels to Puducherry to train every weekend with his father, and took part in online classes with his coaches over lockdown. His ultimate aim? “To participate in the Olympics when I’m 18 years old,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/canter-companion/article33928741.ece

Founder of Loka House, a 1.5-acres co-living space near Auroville, Anuradha has been trying to form a creative community bringing together Chennai, Auroville and Puducherry’s talents. In pursuit of that aim is its Ten10 Fair, which will be entering its fourth edition this weekend. Their dedication to indie music is particularly prominent in this edition, because of their tie-up with maajja, the recent initiative by AR Rahman to help independent musicians. “Arivu and Siennor are two of the artistes on their platform, who are coming to perform here through them, says Anuradha, adding, “The bulk of the musicians are from Pondicherry, Chennai and Auroville. We also have a couple of people coming down from Bangalore, including Vasu Dixit [vocalist and rhythm guitarist of folk fusion band Swarathma].” Other interesting names in the lineup are Auroville-based world folk artiste Shalini Shekhar, psychedelic indie artiste Candy Box, and Puducherry rapper Ashtridia. There are intriguing sets in lesser-known genres, like Jhanu Chantar’s solo lunar punk act and Karthick Madrasi’s Tamil electronica and poetry. The fair also features a string of workshops, from magic and mime to gymnastics, some art, a string of food stalls and an intriguing space dedicated to educating visitors about hemp. Says Anuradha, “We have seen an increasing interest in hemp in all the three festivals that we have done — in October, November and December 2020. So this time, we want to create an experience zone for people to interact with startups and companies working in this space. We have soap, clothes, food, paper, art, essential oils and more made with hemp.” Hemplanet Auroville and United Tesla Hemp Company in Mumbai are some of initiatives making their way to this fair. The workshops are also pulling in practitioners and researchers from other states: an archery workshop, for instance, is set to be hosted by Sebin Philip from Kerala. From closer home, Auroville-based Drupad Gaonkar and Deep Naik will hold one on mime.  The Ten10 fair will be held on February 27 and 28 from 10 am to 6.30 pm at Bommayapalayam, Old Auroville Road.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Burmese days||American journalist Gene Fowler’s sentiment that ‘news is history shot on the wing’ comes true nearly every day across the world. For many families in southern India, particularly Tamil Nadu, this has meant watching the declaration of military rule in Myanmar (formerly Burma) this month with more than just a passing interest, because the two regions share a history that goes back several centuries. Emperor Rajendra Chola (1014-1044 AD), expanded his empire to the Bay of Bengal, including parts of southern Burma. By the mid-19th Century, Tamils migrated to Burma which was also a British colony annexed through the three Anglo-Burmese wars. Though Burma was separated from British India in 1937, just 10 years before the subcontinent would gain its own Independence from the Raj, the ties that bind have continued to hold. There was a mass exodus of Indians from Burma after the Second World War and after the military dictatorship took over in 1963. Despite this, many maintain links with their family members who chose to stay on in Burma. Returning home After the coup d’etat of 1962, which marked the political dominance of the army in Burma, Indian expatriates, were asked to either become citizens or leave the country. About 1,55,000 persons of Indian origin returned to India for good from Burma between 1963 and 1970. They were resettled in ‘Burma Colonies’ set up by the Indian Government in cities like Chennai, Tiruchi and Madurai. Many of the affluent Chettiar community expatriates (who had made their name in finance and business) in Burma had started offshoring their earnings in India early on, but the bulk of the Tamil population — people working as indentured labourers, farmers, petty traders and professionals — had to leave at short notice. “In 1965, I came with my younger brother and sister to India. My other relatives are still in Burma. My mother had said we were going for a wedding and would be back in two days, but only later did I realise that she had fooled me,” says M Sundarraj, a former mason who resettled in the Burma Colony in Navalpattu town near Tiruchi. His neighbour S Govindan, a retired security guard at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), recounts his return with 15 family members by ship. “We were sent to the camp at Gummidipoondi where we were counselled about our future prospects. The Indian authorities advised us about where we could go, depending on our skills,” says Govindan. Though originally from Ramanathapuram district, the two men relocated to Navalpattu because of the presence of BHEL and the Ordnance Factory Tiruchi (OFT) nearby. “It was a big culture shock for us. The poverty and climate were unbearable. But somehow, we managed to settle down here,” Govindan says. One of his many co-passengers was A Panthanam, an 80-year-old homemaker whose mother was a Burmese national. “My father was a farmer [originally from Bhuvanthi near Madurai] and we were a family of 12 children. We hadn’t visited India in a long time. In the 1960s, Indian farmers feared losing their crops and property to Burmese guerrilla fighters, which is why my husband and I decided to return,” she says. E Jaffersha travelled back voluntarily with his sister to Madurai in 1969, in the hope of studying Medicine. But life had other plans. “The savings sent by my father to my relatives for safekeeping got misused, and I was unable to join the PUC course that would help me get into college. I obtained a diploma in Homoeopathy after being trained by a doctor in Madurai and later got professionally licensed by the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in Tiruchi,” he says. While his sister was married to their cousin in Madurai, he tied the knot with a Burmese returnee. “The initial days were tough, but I was lucky to meet helpful people along the way. I even stood for local elections,” says Jaffersha, who runs a clinic from his home in Burma Colony, Gundur. Indelible links Sri Pilikan Muneeswarar Sri Angala Parameswari Thirukovil in Mathur, Pudukottai district, has been frequented by worshippers since 1963. Burma resides in the name of this temple (Pilikan or Pelikha is a village near Kyauktan, Myanmar), and also in the shrine’s foundation. “This temple was built with a handful of soil from Burma in 1963. Since then, small amounts of the mud have been shared in Chennai, Thanjavur, Tiruchi Airport and Navalpattu to build temples in areas where Burmese returnees live,” says R Bhagyam, who has been its priest since the beginning. The cultural exchange between Burma and southern India was largely nurtured by the Chettiar community, says columnist and Chennai chronicler V Sriram. “Chettiars, particularly the Nagarathar Chettiars from Karaikudi, made their fortune in Burma as financiers of agriculture and trade,” he says. He adds that before the Great Depression of 1929, the common interest rate for trading in Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka would be decided in the Nagarathar Chatram on Coral Merchant Street in Madras, and communicated via telegram. “As there was a large Tamil population in Burma, it ranked very high in terms of the performing career of many Carnatic musicians in the 1940s,” says Sriram. Back in India, Burma has lingered not just in settler colonies, ‘Burma Bazaars’ and atho and idiappam eateries, but also in little things like the vetthilai petti (known in Burmese as kun it ), a tall bamboo container coated with pitch and lacquer used to store betel leaves, nuts and lime, traditionally gifted to brides. As Chintamani, a Madurai homemaker who returned in 1963 with her parents and siblings from Bago, Burma, shows us her vetthilai petti over a video conference call, she pulls out other mementos that she has kept safe over the years. “These are the Union of Burma Airways (UBA) flight tickets that brought us to Calcutta from Rangoon,” she says. “And this is the passport of my paternal grandmother Meenachi, issued in 1916. She was a widowed petty trader who split her time between Burma and her native village near Karaikudi to support her family.” In Navalpattu, Tiruchi, Sundarraj brews a pot of Burmese tea that he brought back after a recent visit while Govindan wets a piece of sandalwood and grinds it on a circular stone slab to get a paste that is dabbed on the face. “This used to be a common skin coolant in Burma, and we now use it when we want to remember our days there,” he says. Memories, luckily, don’t need visas to travel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/burmese-days/article33928860.ece
25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Madras’ spiny namesake||In 2011-2012, when ecologist Brawin Kumar was in the town of Nanguneri, near Tirunelveli, he was told multiple tales about pangolins and peacocks making their way into nearby farmland. But the most interesting report he got, was of “a kind of rat. At least, it looked like a rat, but it had no tail. And it has a lot of thorns.” He visited the village again and again, to catch sight of this creature that no one in the area could identify. It took multiple visits before he finally saw one, crawling away from him towards a cover of trees. He tried to be quiet, but ended up sneezing. Immediately, the mystery creature curled into a ball of spines. At the time, Brawin was with the Coimbatore-based NGO ZOO/WILD, with whom he quickly put out questionnaire surveys in Tamil, trying to trace the creature’s sightings. The results told them a lot, but also very little. The Madras hedgehog, also known as the bare-bellied hedgehog, was discovered in 1851 in what was then known as the Madras Presidency, says Brawin, over phone from Nagercoil. These insectivorous spiny mammals “have been on this land since before human evolution,” claims Brawin, “And yet, there is no mention of them even in our folk tales”. Neither is there a name assigned just for it: “In Tamil, we call them mul eli – mul meaning thorn, and eli meaning rat – or irmal eli aka cough rat,” says Brawin, clarifying that the creature is not in fact a rat. Their strongest connection to humans in central Tamil Nadu is an unfortunate one: as an ingredient in traditional medicine, or in household remedies for coughs, rheumatism and the like. “Some shops in Nagercoil still sell hedgehog oil,” he says. While the local populace seems well aware of the creature and its behaviour, “the animal is still rare to sight, and in the last 20 years its population has declined drastically.” The latter, he states, is mainly due to habitat changes, development, and its capture for domestication or sale: “Semi-arid areas were converted to monocrop plantations, arid ones were occupied. People tried keeping these hedgehogs as pets.” Over the last six years of his fieldwork, Brawin has managed to spot the hedgehog only 19 times. He has seen more of them as roadkill, in the same stretch of time. Almost invisible  “Generally, when it comes to wildlife and conservation, people are more concerned with large animals and charismatic mammals: the flagship species,” he says, adding, “But of the 423 animals we have in India, 50% are rats and bats. Besides these, we have shrews, pangolins, hedgehogs and other small mammals, each less than two kilograms that are not always looked at.” Usually, these smaller creatures end up indirectly benefiting from human efforts to conserve the larger mammals they share a habitat with. But for this hedgehog, the case is different “because it often dwells in urban landscapes: in backyards of homes in semi-arid areas of low elevation,” says Brawin. In fact, some of the creature’s homes might be considered the polar opposite of a protected wildlife area — Brawin has seen them mainly in windmill farms. Newer habitats are still being discovered, adds Brawin: “There are some records and I have also noticed them in some high-elevation areas of the Western Ghats and mostly in the Eastern Ghats.” But the records, he reiterates, fall far short of what they should be. One reason could be that this animal, not being endangered, is not listed in the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act. “There is no preserved specimen of this hedgehog, other than one skeleton in the Madras Museum,” he points out. Even outside a museum, in the everyday world, the Madras hedgehog is not commonly spotted, adds Brawin: “They are nocturnal, and have unique habitats that have only been seen in selected patches.” Researching other species of hedgehogs would not entirely help — as the hedgehogs in India are distinct in many ways. For instance, hedgehogs in the UK, Africa and Central Asia hibernate in winter, but the ones in South India estivate in summer instead. Brawin himself had no idea about this till 2014, when he came upon a Madras hedgehog in Tirunelveli that alarmed him. “It weighed very little, and I thought it was sick or dying. But I read up, and found out that for these creatures go into their burrows and sleep continuously for two months, to reduce their metabolic activity. They are in dormant state.” They don’t dig much, but instead use burrows previously dug by other mammals, like pangolins. Their home range is long — they keep moving and only stay in one place for long during breeding season.” In Tamil Nadu, they can be found in parts of Tiruppur, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Karur and Namakkal, besides a few locations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. “This is a rare animal, and it is our own. We should know about it, protect and preserve it,” he signs off, adding “At the very least, we should be encouraging it to live.”  life on hold  Not everyone hibernates. Different creatures go into a state of dormancy or suspend their biological development at different times of the year, based on a variety of factors  Hibernationa state of dormancy that warm-blooded animals go into during winter, preserving energy at a time when food sources are scarce  Brumationis similar to hibernation, but practised only by cold-blooded animals like reptiles  Estivationis when an animal goes into a dormant state during a hot period, to wait out water scarcity or harsh heat.

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The tree and its stories||In 1996, when German visual artist Birgitta Volz was dabbling with wood printing and tree bark printing, she felt particularly attracted to a rather “unspectacular” willow ( Salix caprea ) tree. She immediately started working on a large, abstract composition as the tree’s bark patterns were not uniform. But owing to strong winds, she had to give up. A few days later, when she looked at the result, she was shocked — “My composition looked like a life-size witch!” Incidentally, Volz found out that in the Alps, there is a mention of a character ‘the white woman or salic woman’ who is referred to as the changing spirit of the willow. This was the start to a long and eye-opening journey with bark printing for the artist, who moved to Auroville in 2005. The technique involves applying organic colour onto tree bark, and superimposing it with paper or fabric, to receive prints that mimic patterns seen on the outer skin of the bark. The artist, who has 100 solo shows and over 200 group shows across 20 countries to her credit, is currently showing a collection of bark prints in an exhibition titled Temple Tree at the Pavilion of Tibetan Culture International Zone, Auroville. “I have always loved wood prints and slowly learned to take prints from uneven and huge wooden planks, where one can’t use a press. I even did my own wooden sculptures and printed them. Then in 1994, I printed a piece of fresh bark for the first time and to my surprise, it worked,” says Volz. She has not looked back since. “The tree gets a good cleaning with a brush before I apply a thin layer of organic oil colour on the outer skin. Then I pin paper or fabric on it, and rub the colour through, with soft pressure,” Volz explains, adding that the technique is completely harmless to the tree, since there are no chemicals or solvents involved. The prints are left to dry overnight. While most prints may seem abstract, some patterns give way to figures that arise naturally. “I never manipulate the tree. The print making is like meditation in motion. I rarely see images on the bark; all I control is the composition. Figures become visible only later in the studio. I sometimes draw or paint around what I discover, to make them perceptible,” Volz adds. In her current exhibition, the focus is on prints from a tree located next to the Pavilion of Tibetan Culture. When she started working on this tree, she had a “vague feeling that [the Hindu god] Ganesha would show up”. And, so half of the prints feature abstract manifestations of Ganesha. A tree, says Volz, says a lot about the environment it is in. “It seems as if the trees record the history of their place, and of its ‘clandestine’ inhabitants,” she adds. For instance, a couple of years ago, she had printed a 3,000-year-old baobab tree that led her to a lot of stories surrounding African culture. She has also been to Bangladesh to print one of the walls of an old palace. By May, the artist plans to move most of her prints to Germany, since the climate in Auroville is not ideal for the paper.  Temple Tree will be on   view till March 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-tree-and-its-stories/article33928859.ece

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I have become more courageous now’||Shruti Haasan was barely six when she first stepped into a recording studio. The occasion was momentous: she was to croon a few lines for composer Ilaiyaraaja in Thevar Magan . “I knew it was important because my father (Kamal Haasan) was nervous that I get it right,” she recalls, over phone from Mumbai. “I just remember going to this really cool place and having a new experience. It’s only later that I realised the value of it, and what it meant to my life and music.” The memory of that occasion might be hazy but the experience prodded her on to take up a career in the arts. Her latest musical outing is the ‘Yaazha Yaazha’ track for upcoming Tamil film Laabam, in which she co-stars with Vijay Sethupathi. She credits composer D Imman for roping her in to sing the track, a melody which, she says, utilises her vocals in a unique manner. “When [Imman] called me, I asked, ‘Do you think people would expect me to sing this?’. He said ‘No, that’s why you ought to sing it’.” Her varied musical influences during childhood contributes a lot to the musician she is today. “My mom had impeccable taste in music. My dad is a wonderful singer himself; when we hang out we sing together. He introduced me to The Who and The Beatles which changed my concept of how one can write a song,” she says. Shruti started out as a singer-musician, but slowly branched out to acting as well. “It took me many years to get as comfortable with acting. But now, I cannot imagine removing that from my life because I express a different part of my artistic self through cinema.” A few years ago, Shruti Haasan was eyeing a lot of big-ticket projects in Tamil; she was seen in Suriya’s 7aum Arivu and Vijay-starrer Puli . With the recent influx of OTT platforms, Shruti has been in the thick of things; she was seen in Amazon Prime’s Tamil anthology Putham Pudhu Kaalai in 2020, and more recently in Netflix’s Telugu anthology Pitha Kathalu . “The industry is very different from what it was a decade ago. I have become more courageous now,” she remarks. Also part of the new Shruti Haasan we are seeing is her playing a mother in recent Telugu hit Krack , starring Ravi Teja. “A lot of people questioned me for that. It was a risk I was willing to take, and it really paid off. These were not risks that I would have taken before.” This year will see more of the risk taker in Shruti. Laabam , which has been in the making for a long time, will revolve around farmers — a hot topic currently. “People will connect with the storyline, especially with the situation in the country (farmers’ protest),” she says, adding, “I feel that it is important to make statements through cinema.” Her other biggie, Pawan Kalyan-starrer Telugu film Vakeel Saab , strives to do that. It is a remake of acclaimed Hindi film Pink . “Making such films is important. And then, if you have someone like Pawan Kalyan who can influence the masses, it’s great. Anybody in a position of influence using it to provoke thought is powerful,” says Shruti, who is also part of Prabhas-starrer Salaar and has an Amazon Prime web-series lined up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/i-have-become-more-courageous-now/article33928444.ece

25 February 2021||February 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Hittu wicket||My taste buds are on fire. I am biting into ragi hittu (or ragi flour balls), made of finger millets dipped in sandege — a fiery chutney-like gravy made using roasted garlic and pepper — at Nanga Hittu; a newly-opened restaurant in Coimbatore that serves the traditional cuisine of the Badagas, a native tribe of the Nilgiris. The buttery hittu has a small depression on top into which molten ghee is poured. There is also a choice of avarai uthakka ,  a  curry made with three varieties of seasonal beans and potato, or kappa koi uthakka (chicken gravy) and adu baadu uthakka (mutton gravy) to go with it. Paintings tracing the origin of the Badagas adorn the walls as we dig into white rice after adding avarai uthakka to it; this nutritious and wholesome gravy is a staple at Badaga weddings. It is believed that the Badagas have lived in the Nilgiris for thousand of years. Throughout the Nilgiris, they live in nearly 400 villages called hattis, a cluster of of houses surrounded by tea on low hillocks. Unlike the other hill tribes like the Todas, Kotas, Kurumbas and the Irulas, the Badagas embraced change that came with the British. The restaurant started by Vignesh Chandran, a Badaga, along with Deepa Sudhakar from Udhagamandalam, is an attempt to revive and promote forgotten recipes of the community. “This is the first time anyone has come up with an exclusive restaurant for Badaga cuisine,” says Deepa, adding, “Our restaurant is a talking point among the members of the International Badaga Association in the US now.” Reviving memories The cook, Uma Murugan,who sports traditional Badaga attire: a white cloth wrapped around her shoulders and another worn as headgear, says, traditionally, Badagas consumed varieties of millets.“We used to make a steamed dish with ootukudi (bamboo shoots) once a year. It is collected after trekking deep into the forest. With people moving to the plains for education and jobs, the dish has been forgotten now,” she sighs. Another forgotten dish is hatchike , a dessert made with little millet or saamai ; it involves roasting, boiling and pounding the millet to de-husk it before soaking it in hot milk and topping with grated coconut. Uma and her husband Murugan Palani, who are from Kinnakorai village in Udhagamandalam, have stuck to tried and tested recipes. The result? A delicious and honest taste. A special spice powder they call hatti maas hudi , which is made from roasted chillies, coriander seeds,cinnamon, asafoetida, and khus khus, is used in the vegetarian reparations. For the meat-based curries, a deep black masala made from chillies, whole coriander seeds,jeera, pepper, and cloves is used. “This is an effort to revive forgotten recipes and keep the memories alive, and to also give a taste of our food to non-Badagas,” says Deepa.She describes the aroma that fills homes when they make thuppadahittu , a deep-fried snack from maida dough mixed with sugar, khus khus, elaichi and mashed bananas. They are also reaching out to elders in the villages to retrace recipes that have been popular in the last five decades. At the moment, Nanga Hittu serves lunch and snacks like thuppadahittu , ragi hittu and pothittu (wheat dosa served with a sweet concoction made of coconut milk and khus khus). As we talk, a platter of thuppadahittu and hutti kaapi (black coffee sweetened with jaggery) makes its way to the table. I tear a piece, dip it in the black coffee and then eat it, just the way the Badagas do.  The restaurant is at Thangam & AMP Junction Mini Mall, Cheran Nagar, Mettupalayam Main Road, Coimbatore.   For details, 99529-98443/ 9500269697.   looking back Badaga farmers are known for their mixed farming of millets, barley, wheat and vegetables including potato, carrots and cabbage, and hence the food they eat often uses seasonal and locally-grown vegetables. They also took to cultivation of beans and cauliflower on a large scale besides spices like cardamom and pepper, till the British-owned tea and coffee plantations took over the landscape.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hittu-wicket/article33928861.ece
25 February 2021||JAIPUR,||Universal health scheme to be launched in Rajasthan: Gehlot||No new tax was levied in the budget for 2021-22 presented by Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in the State Assembly on Wednesday, while the relief measures to the tune of Rs. 910 crore were announced for farmers, industrialists, real estate players, traders, tour operators and common people through various exemptions. Presenting the Congress government’s first paperless budget, Mr. Gehlot, who also holds the Finance portfolio, announced the launch of a universal health care scheme worth Rs. 3,500 crore stipulating medical insurance of Rs. 5 lakh to every family in the State. A separate agriculture budget would also be presented from the next year, said Mr. Gehlot. The budget projected a revenue deficit of Rs. 23,750.04 crore and fiscal deficit of Rs. 47,652.77 crore for the financial year 2021-22. The fiscal deficit was 3.98% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). Mr. Gehlot said the State’s revenue receipts had declined by 23% during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Centre had slashed the GST compensation by Rs. 14,000 crore. The sectors which were given priority in the budget included agriculture and animal husbandry, health, education, social security and good governance. Mr. Gehlot said the economic resources would be mobilised with a “far-reaching vision” despite the difficult financial conditions. The Chief Minister announced the implementation of a new model of public health under which the Right to Health Bill will be brought. The deferred salaries of State government employees will be paid to them, while 1,200 new English medium Mahatma Gandhi Schools will be opened in the next two years. Mr. Gehlot also announced a Rs. 500-crore package for development of tourism, which was adversely affected during the pandemic. The unemployment allowance paid to eligible youths will be increased by Rs. 1,000, while Rs. 5,000 and citation will be given to good samaritans who save lives in road accidents under the Jeevan Rakshak Yojana. ‘Robust management ’ Mr. Gehlot later told reporters that the State government would fulfil the promises made in the budget through a “robust financial management”. He said the Centre should find ways to provide relief to the people from the burden of fuel price hike. The Congress government would complete its five-year term, said Mr. Gehlot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/universal-health-scheme-to-be-launched-in-rajasthan-gehlot/article33928461.ece
25 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||To beat the soaring heat, ‘tent city’ in Singhu finds new abode||A ‘tent city’ that had come up at a petrol pump near the Singhu border protest site in December last year, is being shifted to a vacant ground a few metres away to offer some respite from the soaring heat in the city. Around 50 tents were pitched on the ground by Wednesday. Trenches have also been dug up along the perimeter to avoid waterlogging during heavy rain. Around 150 insulated tents were pitched at the petrol pump when the mercury had dipped and the city received record rainfall. However, with the temperatures now soaring, volunteers at the tent city said that it had become inconvenient for protesters to continue living inside the tents under direct sunlight. Protesting farmers had recently cleared the ground of shrubbery and bushes. Jatin Singh, one of the managing team members, said: “We have now shifted to this ground. As of now, 50 tents have been installed. We are also storing blankets as we do not know how long we will have to continue living here. What if the next winter arrives?” More facilities Speaking about the other arrangements, Mr. Singh said: “We will also be making separate washrooms for women for bathing purposes. On all sides of the vacant ground, we have dug trenches so that if it rains, the water can get accumulated there and not create waterlogging as the ground is on a lower level. We have brought inverters as well and are deciding what to do about the sewerage. There is a possibility that we can connect it to the lines of the adjacent industries.” Lights have also been installed on the ground and there are plans to beautify the area with posters, Mr. Singh added. Support from Dhansa Meanwhile, a group of people from Haryana reached the border on foot from the Dhansa border. The group, which started its march last week, intends to visit all the border protest sites along Delhi. Yoginder Shastri, a farmer from Haryana’s Jhajjar district, said: “We started our march five days ago from the Dhansa border and went to the Tikri border first. It took us three days to reach the Singhu border from Tikri. On our way, we have tried to spread the word in the villages on the anti-farmer policies and laws brought in by this government. After we finish the entire march by visiting the other borders as well, we will decide on our next course of action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/to-beat-the-heat-tent-city-in-singhu-shifts-to-vacant-land/article33928884.ece
25 February 2021||Lucknow,||U.P. Assembly passes Bill on conversion amid protests||Amid protests by the Opposition, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly on Wednesday passed by voice vote a Bill to curb religious conversions carried out by fraudulent or any other undue means, including through marriage. The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Bill, 2021, seeks to replace the ordinance promulgated in November last year that provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs. 50,000 for violators. The Opposition Congress and BSP demanded that the Bill be sent to a select committee. However, the Bill was passed in the House as Aradhana Misra, the Congress Legislative Party leader and Lalji Verma, the leader of BSP in the Assembly, protested. Opposing the legislation, Ms. Misra said that marriage is a personal matter of an individual. “This is an issue on which comprehensive discussion and debate are needed. Hence, instead of taking a decision in haste, it should be sent to the select committee,” she said. BSP leader Lalji Verma said that the Constitution guarantees the right to free profession, practice and propagation of religion. “This Bill is against the Constitution. Hence, the government should either withdraw this Bill or send it to the select committee,” he said. The Samajwadi Party members did not participate in the debate. ‘Null and void’ Under the Bill, a marriage will be declared “null and void” if the conversion is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the District Magistrate. The Bill mainly envisages that no person shall convert, either directly or indirectly from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-assembly-passes-bill-on-conversion-amid-protests/article33928466.ece

25 February 2021||New Delhi,||Plea seeks simplification of child adoption process||Lengthy and cumbersome adoption procedures of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) and the increasing number of childless couples has given rise to a “grey market” for adoption, an NGO told the Delhi High Court on Wednesday. NGO Yatharatha Foundation told the High Court that as per information on CARA website, around 30,000 couples have registered for adoption, but only 2,989 children are available and therefore, there was a “huge prospect for grey market of adoption and which has been thriving due to cumbersome, lengthy, tedious procedure under the CARA”. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Delhi government, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and CARA seeking their stand on the NGO’s plea seeking simplification of the adoption procedure. Hotspot for middlemen The NGO, represented by senior advocate Salman Khurshid, told the court that IVF and surrogacy centres have become a hotspot for middlemen “who misguide childless couples by touting a convenient and quick method of adoption instead of lengthy and cumbersome legal procedure”. The NGO, in its petition has claimed that children adopted through such middlemen are usually victims of kidnapping, trafficking or given away by their biological parents for money.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/plea-seeks-simplification-of-child-adoption-process/article33928879.ece
