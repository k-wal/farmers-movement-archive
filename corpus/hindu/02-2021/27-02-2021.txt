27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Assembly polls to kick off on March 27||The Assembly elections in the States of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam and the Union Territory of Puducherry will be held between March 27 and April 29, the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced on Friday. The counting of votes will be held together on May 2. At a press conference, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said polling to 126 constituencies in Assam would be held in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6. Voting in Kerala (140 seats), Tamil Nadu (234) and Puducherry (30) would be held in a single phase on April 6. West Bengal would see polling in eight phases, up from seven last time, on March 27, April 1, April 6, April 10, April 17, April 22, April 26 and April 29. The State has 294 constituencies. 2 Lok Sabha bypolls The ECI also announced byelections to two Lok Sabha constituencies — Malappuram in Kerala and Kanniyakumari in Tamil Nadu — on April 6. Bypolls to a Lok Sabha seat each in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and 18 Assembly seats across the country would also be held. However, the schedules would be announced separately. Mr. Arora said advance teams of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) had been sent to all the poll-bound States and the Union Territory. In addition, the ECI issued a circular on February 8 for the formation of committees comprising the Chief Electoral Officers, the State police nodal officers and the State CAPF coordinators for coming up with security plans and monitoring the deployment of forces. Two special police observers had been appointed for West Bengal and two special expenditure observers for Tamil Nadu, given the concerns in the two States, Mr. Arora said. Terming Tamil Nadu an “expenditure-sensitive State”, he said two elections had to be rescinded in the past, referring to the Vellore and R.K. Nagar polls. If need be, more observers would be sent to West Bengal, he said when asked about the law and order situation in the State, Mr. Arora added. The COVID-19 guidelines issued by the ECI in August 2020, ahead of the Bihar election, would apply. The guidelines were being reviewed regularly. Only two persons and two vehicles would be allowed per candidate while filing nominations. Online filing would also be allowed. The ECI would issue revised social media guidelines after reviewing the Centre’s new guidelines. With over 18 crore electors spread over 824 Assembly constituencies, the five elections would be the largest electoral process to be held during the pandemic, Mr. Arora said. Mr. Arora said that the ongoing vaccination programme would boost the confidence of electors. The ECI had decided that its officials in the headquarters and the Commission itself would get vaccinated once the front line poll workers received the vaccine. To a question about concerns over the functioning of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), Mr. Arora said, “Any machine can malfunction” but categorically added that the “EVMs cannot be tampered” with.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assembly-polls-to-kick-off-on-march-27/article33946382.ece
27 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||GHMC mulls OTS once again||Cash strapped GHMC is mulling over offering a second round of One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme for property tax defaulters in the city, at the fag end of the financial year. The proposal has been submitted to the government for its approval, official sources informed. The OTS scheme entails rebate of 90% in the interest payable on the property tax arrears accumulated up to the financial year 2019-20. It allows the defaulters to pay the total tax amount, along with 10% of the accumulated interest for the period, towards full settlement of arrears. Last time, the scheme was announced from August 1, 2020, with the aim of improving the property tax collections which were hit badly during the COVID-19 lock down. Though it was targeted to collect Rs. 1,000 crore during the period of the scheme which was initially up to September 15, GHMC could not achieve it even after two extensions up to November 15. Officials blame the Dharani portal work which was initiated around the same time for the underachievement. The scheme could not be extended further owing to the model code of conduct kicking in for GHMC elections. During the three and a half months of the scheme, GHMC could collect only Rs. 275 crore under the OTS. As per the GHMC records, a total of 5.46 lakh property owners owed Rs. 1,478 core to GHMC by way of property tax, and Rs. 1,018 crore compounded as interest at 2% per month, before announcement of the scheme. Property tax collections in the current year may not reach the targeted Rs. 1,862 crore in the coming one month’s time before end of the financial year, given the fact that the collection up to February 25 amounted to only about Rs. 1,350 crore. Another round of OTS is the only hope to improve the collections. However, the scheme cannot be announced forthwith owing to the model code of conduct in force for the MLC elections. The code will remain till counting is completed, probably up to March 20, which will leave only 11 days for the scheme till the financial year end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ghmc-mulls-ots-once-again/article33946688.ece
27 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CM tasks Balan to engage striking PSC rank holders||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday tasked Law Minister A.K. Balan to engage striking PSC rank holders in talks. The DYFI leadership too has opened negotiations with the agitators. Mr. Balan was likely to meet them on Sunday. The government wanted to avoid the optics of PSC rank holders agitating indefinitely in front of the Secretariat as it makes a concerted political pitch for a second innings in power. Moreover, the government did not want the youth to "play into the hands of the Opposition.” The Congress and the BJP have expressed solidarity with the agitators. Both parties had demonstrated across the State accusing the government of backdoor appointments. Many of the protests had culminated in police action injuries to both sides. Indefinite fast Youth Congress leaders were on an indefinite fast at the PSC rank holders’ agitation venue. Congress MLA Shafi Parambil said the government had lied that there was no legal provision to revive the expired civil police officer rank list. Two SFI leaders had discredited the rank list and precipitated its expiry by cheating in the PSC test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-tasks-balan-to-engage-striking-psc-rank-holders/article33946726.ece

27 February 2021||Special Correspondent NEW DELHI,||NHRC issues show cause to MoD on civilian killing||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a show-cause notice to the the Ministry of Defence (MoD), asking why it should not recommend Rs. 5 lakh as relief for the family of a citizen killed in Army firing in Arunachal Pradesh in 2017, an NHRC statement said on Friday.  Indiscriminate firing The “innocent citizen”, Thingtu Ngemu, died in the “indiscriminate firing by the Army unit of 21 Para Special Forces (PSF) during an operation against Naxalites in Nantok circle, Changlang district, Arunachal Pradesh” on the intervening period of June 14-15, 2017, it said. Special case “The Commission has communicated that the case needs to be treated as special because the Judicial Enquiry Magistrate has held that the PSF personnel are responsible for the death of an innocent citizen. The Commission has also emphasized that if the Defence Ministry pays the relief amount to the victim’s family on the basis of its show cause notice in such cases, it will send positive signals amongst the locals and the credibility of the Armed Forces shall also improve. The response is expected within four weeks,” the NHRC said. It registered a case on June 29, 2017, based on an intimation by the Changlang Superintendent of Police. Its investigation found that the PSF personnel did not cooperate with the judiciaal enquiry. “After considering the relevant evidences, the Judicial enquiry officer found that the Army Unit of 21 Para Special Forces (PSF) of Jorhat had laid ambush within the reachable range of civilian/villagers, without any knowledge of local civil police or villagers, which was undesirable and dangerous for the inhabitants,” the NHRC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nhrc-issues-show-cause-to-mod-on-civilian-killing/article33946793.ece

27 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Housing for lower and middle income groups is a priority, says Jagan||Apart from achieving the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations by 2030, town planners have to focus on housing strategy for the low income group (LIG) and the middle income group (MIG), Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said. He was delivering the inaugural address virtually from Amaravati, of the two-day 69th National Town and Country Planning Conference that began here on Friday. The conference is being organised by the Institute of Town Planners, India. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said housing for the LIG and MIG segments was one of the main programmes of the State. The town planners should deliberated and give ideas on how it could be achieved, he said. He also said that strategies to counter environmental issues and climate change, and how to tide over problems pertaining to water supply should also be deliberated upon by the experts. “We are open to suggestions and ideas, and will implement them if they are feasible,” he said. The Chief Minister also urged the participants and experts to come up with ideas on integrated coastal development plan. “We have about 974-km of coastline, and Visakhapatnam will stand out to be the biggest beneficiary,” he observed. ‘Planned development is the future’ Earlier, Principal Secretary (Municipal Administration and Urban Development) Y. Srilakshmi pointed out that the urban agglomerations in the State had seen unplanned development and the future lies on planned development. “De-congesting towns and cities is in focus, but moving people outside the cities and towns by providing all basic amenities and proper and cheap connectivity is a challenge for the urban planners,” she said. Model colonies The State government had already focussed on LIG housing, and 17,000 layouts were developed in two months to provide 30 lakh house sites. “And now, it is paying focus on MIG housing,” she said. “The State government is working on developing model housing colonies with the idea of providing 12 plots per acre of 200 square yards each, and every colony will have modern facilities such as gymnasiums, banks, open theatres, community centres, parks, club houses, wide roads and office spaces,” she said. Elaborating on the office spaces, she said that post COVID-19, the concept of ‘walk to work’ had emerged, and every model housing colony would have a plug-and-play facility. And all these would come at an affordable price, Ms. Srilakshmi added. She further said that plans were afoot for better waste management by the municipalities and corporations. ‘Clean AP’ “Under the CLAP (Clean AP), a 100-day programme, efforts are on to clean the State by implementing the segregation of dry, wet and hazardous waste at the source points,” she said. Ms. Srilakshmi also said that in the State there were about 120 sites that contained ‘legacy waste’ such as the Kapuluppada dump, and the total waste lying there was over 1.10 lakh tonnes of different kinds. Implementing biomining process, the waste would be segregated into re-usable and recyclable waste, wet waste and inert waste. “The reusables will be sent back to specific industries. Wet waste will be converted into compost, while the inert waste will be used for land filling.  ‘Win-win situation’ “It is a win-win situation for the civic bodies, the people and the industries,” she observed. President of ITPI N.K. Patel spoke about various functions of the institute and how the earlier conferences had helped in policy making. ITPI vice-president V. Ramudu, secretary-general B. Khodankar, and APRC chairman B. Balaji spoke on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/housing-for-lower-and-middle-income-groups-is-a-priority-says-jagan/article33946377.ece

External Affairs Minister S.

27 February 2021||VILLUPURAM,||Fiscal prudence collapsed: Stalin||Fiscal prudence and discipline in the State have collapsed due to the lopsided policies of the AIADMK government, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Friday. This had pushed the State back by over 50 years, he alleged. Speaking at the party’s poll outreach programme at Theevanur, Mr. Stalin said the hefty loans raised by the government had increased Tamil Nadu’s debt burden to Rs. 5.7 lakh crore. Media criticism “With the Assembly election around the corner, the AIADMK government has finalised tenders to the tune of Rs. 40,000 crore and emptied the State’s coffers,” he alleged. Mr. Stalin said he was amused that a section of the media had been criticising the DMK’s outreach programme. “A section of the newspapers is getting government advertisements. As a result, they have been criticising the DMK to appease the Chief Minister,” he claimed. While the Chief Minister had announced a waiver of crop loans to the tune of Rs. 12,000 crore, the government had allotted only Rs. 5,000 crore for the scheme in the interim Budget. How then will the waiver benefit 16 lakh farmers, the DMK president M.K. Stalin asked.

27 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Woman gang-raped in Hapur, no breakthrough yet||A saleswoman was allegedly gang-raped by three men in Hapur, 70 km from Delhi, when she was returning from work in Ghaziabad to her residence in neighbouring Gautam Buddha Nagar on Wednesday night, police said. The Hapur police have registered an FIR against three unidentified men under section 376D of the IPC. Till Friday evening, no breakthrough was made by the Uttar Pradesh police in the case. Sarvesh Mishra, Additional Superintendent of Police, Hapur, said the 30-year-old has said in her complaint that she was returning from work in a departmental store in Indirapuram area of Ghaziabad in an autorickshaw. “At Lal Kuan border of Ghaziabad, she took another shared autorickshaw for Noida. After a passenger got down, the driver and two accomplices overpowered her, took her to a secluded spot in the Pilakhwa area of Hapur and sexually assaulted her.” Mr. Mishra said, after the crime, the victim was put in an autorickshaw and dropped off on NH9. She first reached the Masuri police chowki in Ghaziabad and was then taken to Masuri police station where she lodged a complaint. Spot of crime The spot of crime, police sources said, is near the Ganga canal that forms the Ghaziabad-Hapur border. “The Masuri police chowki is closer to the spot than Pilakhwa police station. The Ghaziabad police shared the information with us in the early hours and we sent the victim for medical examination and registered an FIR against three unidentified men on Thursday morning,” said the ASP. Mr. Mishra said no external marks of injury or resistance were found on her body. “In cases of gang rape, many times victims are not able to offer resistance,” he said. No physical evidence has been found so far at the spot identified by the victim. “It was night and as the area was new to her, she was a bit confused,” said Mr. Mishra. He said the police were questioning local autorickshaw drivers and owners who ply in Ghaziabad. “One of the teams is identifying such drivers. It will take a couple of days. As the victim has somewhat recovered from the shock, a forensic team was sent to Noida to make sketches of the suspects with their help.” Police delay? Local sources claimed that the Ghaziabad police at Masuri police station didn’t inform senior officials immediately and took time in informing the Hapur police. “We are looking into possible lapses in responding to a serious case,” said Iraj Raja, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Ghaziabad. On the possible lapse in security in Ghaziabad, he said, “It seems she took the autorickshaw from the flyover on Lal Kuan on NH9 highway. Once a vehicle crosses city limits, it becomes difficult to track it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/woman-gang-raped-in-hapur-no-breakthrough-yet/article33946602.ece

Cadres of the ULFA (I) had on December 21 abducted drilling superintendent Pranab Kumar Gogoi from Assam’s Sivasagar district and radio operator Ram Kumar from Bihar. They were engaged by the New Delhi-based Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Ltd at a hydrocarbon drilling site in Arunachal Pradesh’s Changlang district. The outfit had threatened to take “extreme action” against the two men if their company failed to pay the ransom by February 17. “The police, along with the Army and the Indian Air Force, conducted operations while trying to ensure that they are not harmed. Modern technology was used too, but the topography has made the efforts very difficult,” R.P. Upadhyaya, Director-General of Police in Arunachal Pradesh, told journalists. He said the security forces had been using every channel to get the duo released while indicating that the extremists could be keeping the Quippo employees hostage across the border in Myanmar. ULFA(I) chief Paresh Baruah had extended the deadline for Quippo to get its employees released.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/search-on-for-oil-firm-staff-abducted-by-ulfa-i/article33946795.ece

27 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||KSDMA issues temperature warning||Although parts of the State are reporting a rise in day temperatures, current indications show the State is less likely to experience an intense heat wave this year, given the higher possibility of showers in March and April. Many districts have been receiving light to moderate rainfall through February which has prevented day temperatures from shooting up. Kerala, in fact, can expect more intense summer showers in March and April compared to last year, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Meteorological Centre here. In an extended range forecast issued on Friday, the IMD has predicted isolated or scattered rainfall in the State till March 4, and below normal rainfall for the week starting March 5. “The State had received heavy rainfall in January. That, and the fact that several districts have been receiving light to moderate rainfall in February, have served to hold the temperature down so far,” K. Santhosh, Director, Met Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, said. That said, parts of the State have reported a rise in day-time temperatures. On Friday, Alappuzha recorded 36.6°C, which is 3.5 degrees on the higher side from the normal for the district. On Friday, the maximum temperature in Kottayam was 2.1 degrees above the normal of 33.9°C. Palakkad, which has a normal day-time temperature of 35.9 degrees recorded 36.4 degrees and Punalur, 35.5 degrees against a normal of 35.8 degrees. With the summer closing in, the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has asked the public to be on guard against rising temperatures. The authority has urged the public, especially pregnant women, elderly, and children, to avoid direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and take precautions to avoid dehydration and sunburn by drinking more water. It is advisable to carry bottled water, caps, and umbrellas while travelling, it said. The Labour Department will reschedule working hours for labourers if daytime temperatures rise beyond normal levels, the KSDMA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ksdma-issues-temperature-warning/article33946729.ece

27 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||HC clears decks for polls to urban local bodies||A Bench of Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Friday cleared the decks for municipal elections by dismissing a batch of writ petitions which challenged the State Election Commission’s notification for elections to urban local bodies (ULBs). The petitioners’ argument was that since the elections could not be conducted as per the original schedule i.e. on March 23, 2020, owing to various reasons, the entire previous election notification had become infructuous by efflux of time. The fresh notification for holding the elections on March 10, 2021 commenced only from the date of withdrawal of nominations, and it was issued nearly after 11 months from the abandoned election programme. In the meanwhile, several persons might have become eligible to file nominations. When the election is commencing afresh, it should begin with the preparation of voters’ list, filing of nominations, scrutiny and etc. The impugned notification is, therefore, manifestly arbitrary and impermissible in law, the petitioners contended, but in vain as the court maintained that it cannot interfere with the election process at this stage. It may be noted that the State Election Commission had issued the notification for elections to urban local bodies on February 15, 2021 to continue the process from the stage of withdrawal in respect of 12 Municipal Corporations and 75 Municipalities/ Nagar Panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-clears-decks-for-polls-to-urban-local-bodies/article33946361.ece
27 February 2021||COIMBATORE,||GST fake bill trading racket busted||Officials of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence, Coimbatore Zonal unit, have arrested one person for issuing fake bills with a taxable value of Rs. 55 crore. According to a release, the officials conducted simultaneous searches on the residential and business premises in Erode, Namakkal, and Coimbatore of the key person on February 25. He had multiple fictitious registrations in Erode, Namakkal, and Coimbatore to generate and pass on fraudulent input credit. All the firms were dealing with TMT bars and rods and MS scrap in and around these three places. The invoices were issued without supply of goods with a taxable value of approximately Rs. 55 crore and passed on fraudulent input tax credit of around Rs. 9.9 crore to various entities. The firms were owned and controlled by the key person and he had four separate GST registrations with PAN numbers of his relatives and friends. Invoices were generated and issued from these without supply of goods. The invoices were raised for two of his companies in Erode that would take fraudulent credit and use it to settle off the GST liability. This led to revenue loss to the government. The officials recovered during the searches printed bill books of the fake firms, cheque books and cheque leaves of the bank accounts of the fictitious companies. The offender admitted to issuing fake bills through multiple fictitious registrations, the release said. Further investigations are on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-fake-bill-trading-racket-busted/article33946557.ece
27 February 2021||Mumbai,||Iqbal Mirchi’s wife, sons declared economic fugitives||A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court in Mumbai on Friday declared the wife and two sons of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi as fugitive economic offenders in a money laundering case. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) in December had moved an application seeking that the court “declare Junaid Iqbal Memon and Asif Iqbal Memon (sons of Mirchi) and Hajra Memon (wife) as fugitive economic offenders”. ED had filed a complaint against these three and 13 other accused in December last year stating that Mirchi had bought properties in India using money earned through illegal activities and later also sold them for redevelopment. The agency’s complaint mentioned that the three family members were the beneficiaries of the assets earned by Mirchi through proceeds of crime. ED has alleged that Mirchi had purchased three assets – Sea View, Marium Lodge and Rabia Mansion – in 1986. Officers claimed Mirchi was involved in narcotics smuggling and operated an extortion racket for several years and listed eight cases to prove his involvement in criminal activities since 1984. A case filed in 1994 at MRA Marg police station was taken as the base case to initiate a money-laundering inquiry against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/iqbal-mirchis-wife-sons-declared-economic-fugitives/article33946847.ece

This is for the benefit of whom? There should be some rationale behind the decision,” Ms. Banerjee said hours after the ECI announced the poll schedule. It is for the first time that elections in West Bengal will be held in eight phases.

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Two die while cleaning sewage tank||Two persons died of asphyxiation on Friday while cleaning a sewage tank located behind the defence facility inside Fort St. George, which houses the Secretariat. The police said the sewage was pumped to a tank behind the defence establishment on Flag Staff Road. The cleaning contract was given to Srital Systems in Madhavaram. The private contractor engaged five men from Sathya Nagar. All of them entered the tank and were cleaning it. Around 11 a.m, one of the workers, K. Santhosh, 35, collapsed and his colleague K. Raja, 40, who tried to rescue him, also fell unconscious. The others — Venkatesh, Panneerselvam and Manivannan — managed to get out of the tank. The staff from the defence establishment pulled out Santhosh and Raja and rushed all the workers to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Santhosh and Raja were declared dead owing to asphyxiation, the police said. The police booked a case against the contractor under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, and Section 304A of the IPC (Causing death by negligence).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/2-die-while-cleaning-sewage-tank-inside-fort-st-george/article33946483.ece

CEO||Flying squad teams (FSTs) and static surveillance teams (SSTs) will immediately commence work in all districts to enforce the model code of conduct that came into force on Friday, Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said. Addressing the media after the announcement of the election dates, he said all the provisions of the model code of conduct would be strictly enforced, with all departments and observers working together. Mr. Sahoo said the State would have 88,963 polling stations, including 23,000 stations which had been added for the upcoming Assembly election to ensure adherence to personal distancing norms in view of COVID-19. On the concerns raised by a section of political parties regarding the location of polling booths at some places, he said that around 70% of those issues had been addressed and the remaining would be resolved soon. Around 6,000 to 7,000 polling stations had been identified as sensitive, he said, adding, “These numbers may change, as they are dependent on a number of factors, including who the candidates are.” He said members of the public could report violation of norms through the phone number 1950 or by using the cVIGIL mobile application. As per the norms, persons carrying more than Rs. 50,000 in cash should have proof about the source of the money and its intended purpose. On potential violations through online transfer of money, Mr. Sahoo said guidelines were in place for banks to report any large-volume or suspicious transaction. He said 45 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force had arrived, and they would be deployed across districts for “area domination exercises”. “More companies of personnel would be sent later, as per the requirement,” he added. In a letter sent to all Additional Chief Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and Secretaries of all departments, Mr. Sahoo asked for the submission of the attested copy of the latest page of the Government Order (G.O) Register to ensure that no new schemes or orders are issued after the announcement of the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/we-will-start-work-at-once-says-tn-ceo/article33946478.ece

27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Three new clusters detected in Bengaluru||Three new COVID-19 clusters, all in the Yelahanka zone, with a total of 19 positive cases were detected in Bengaluru on Friday. This takes the overall number of such groups to six over the past two weeks. Two of the clusters were detected in educational institutions: five cases at Agragami College and nine students tested positive at Sambhram Academy of Management Studies. The third cluster, with five cases, is in a residential complex, Purva Venezia Apartments. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the detection of new cases was the result of elaborate testing taken up across educational institutions where students from neighbouring States, especially Kerala and Maharashtra, study. Testing has been intensified, especially in nursing colleges, where most of the students hail from Kerala. Conservative estimates suggest there were nearly 18,000 nursing students in different colleges in the city. In the last three days, as many as 1,156 students were tested at Sambhram Academy of Management Studies, of whom nine were found to have contracted COVID-19. At Agragami College, of the 217 students who were tested, five tested positive. Mumbai link BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Health) Rajendra Cholan said another cluster had been reported at Purva Venezia apartments. A total of 111 residents were tested of whom five were found positive. “We believe it spread from a family who had travelled from Mumbai to the city,” he said. According to Mr. Prasad, though some students from neighbouring States had come to the city with a COVID-19 negative report, they tested positive a few days later. “If more than five cases are reported from one location, it is termed a cluster. The cases in the other three clusters have not increased.” The city’s first cluster was reported on February 13 at Manjushree College of Nursing in Kaval Byrasandra, where 40 students tested positive just days after the college reopened. In the second cluster at SNN Raj Lakeview, an apartment complex in Bilekahalli, a total of 108 residents tested positive. Another cluster was reported at SJR Watermark Apartment at Ambalipura, where 27 residents tested positive for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/three-new-clusters-detected-in-bengaluru/article33946330.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Polls being held in changed political landscape||The announcement of the Assembly election schedule for the four States of Kerala, West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry has ushered in a set of polls that will take place in a very different political landscape from the one seen in 2016. In Tamil Nadu, the two big Dravidian leaders — M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa — are no longer in the fray. In West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has emerged as the primary opposition to the ruling Trinamool Congress, lead by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, a big jump from the mere three seats it clocked in 2016. In Kerala, the State with an almost unbroken record of two rival fronts coming to power in alternate elections, may or may not follow its old pattern. In Assam, the BJP faces a Congress-All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) tie-up, a far cry from when the late Tarun Gogoi, former Chief Minister, had raised the question “Who is Ajmal (AIUDF chief)?” at a press conference. In Puducherry, a scrambling Congress hopes to counter anti-incumbency against its own government by seeking sympathy after its fall. According to political scientist Rahul Verma, for the BJP, the stakes are higher in the eastern States of Assam and West Bengal rather than in the south, where it is part of alliances or only hopes for some improvement in vote percentage, as in Kerala. “In Assam, the BJP has a sitting government and in West Bengal, the party is the main challenger. In both States, the Central government’s own push for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been different and sometimes contradictory. For the BJP, the polls are important in these two States as it will take further the breach that it has made into eastern and northeastern India,” he said. “For regional parties, the big question will be on just how much space to cede to the BJP, both as a rival in polls and as an alliance member, as in Tamil Nadu,” he added. Eyebrows have already been raised at the attempted appropriation of Congress leader Kamaraj by the BJP in Tamil Nadu. The elephant in the room in this entire season is, in fact, the Congress’s internal leadership issue. The party is not fighting with any national strategy. It is allied with the Left in West Bengal and it’s fighting against the Left Democratic Front in Kerala. In Assam, it has tied up with the AIUDF, and in Tamil Nadu, it is not in a great position to bargain for seats from its dominant ally, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The strategy is, therefore, piecemeal. If the party does not do well, the Group of 23 leaders, who wrote asking for the leadership question to be settled, will appear to have justification for their demands. The Assembly polls are largely determined by local issues and factors, with national issues not really coming into play. Therefore, while these set of polls may not exactly spell the national mood out, each party’s performance, whether the BJP or the Opposition, will have a huge effect on the parties’ morale in the 2021 election in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/polls-being-held-on-changed-political-landscape/article33946339.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Select a vaccination centre, book appointment||The Union Health Ministry on Friday announced options for advance self-registration, on-site registration and facilitated cohort registration for potential beneficiaries of the second round of COVID-19 vaccinations starting on March 1.

Giving details of the simplified process of registration through three routes, the Ministry said the beneficiaries will be able to self-register in advance by downloading the Co-Win 2.0 app and through other IT applications such as Arogya Setu. This will show a list of government and private hospitals serving as COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) with the date and time of the available schedules. The beneficiary will be able to choose the centre of his and her choice and book an appointment for vaccination. On-site registration will allow those who cannot self register in advance to walk into the identified CVCs and get themselves registered on-site and then vaccinated. The Ministry added that under the facilitated cohort registration, the State government and Union Territory administrations will take a proactive lead. “Specific date(s) for COVID vaccination will be decided where target groups of potential beneficiaries will be vaccinated. The State/UT health authorities will ensure that the target groups are actively mobilised and brought to the vaccination centres,” the Ministry’s release said. It added that under all the three routes, all beneficiaries would be captured on Co-WIN 2.0 platform and would be issued a digital QR code-based provisional (on receiving the first dose) and final (on receiving second dose) certificates. “These can be downloaded from the link shown in the SMS [which] the beneficiary shall receive after the vaccination. Print out of these certificates can also be taken from the Vaccination Centres,” the Ministry said. Free of cost The vaccination will be free of charge at the government vaccination centres and the beneficiary will have to show a photo ID document for proof of age (preferably Aadhar card or EPIC card) and certificate of co-morbidity (if required). Those taking the COVID vaccine at any designated/empanelled private health facility will have to pay a pre-fixed charge. The Ministry has directed States/UTs to keep a vaccination scale-up plan ready both within the government and private facilities and also the number of vaccine doses administered. It added that all beneficiaries, regardless of the mode of access, must be advised to carry any one of the photo ID document including — Aadhar Card, Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC), Photo ID card specified at the time of registration in case of online registration (if not Aadhar or EPIC), certificate of co-morbidity for citizens in age group of 45 years to 59 years (signed by a registered medical practitioner) and employment certificate/ Official Identity Card — (either but with photo and date of birth) for health care and frontline workers. “The fundamental shift in this phase is that citizens in the identified age groups, as also those healthcare workers and frontline who have been missed out or left out of the present phase of vaccination, can select vaccination centres of their choice. Also private sector hospitals will be involved as COVID vaccination centres to harness their potential to expand the vaccination capacities,” said the Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/select-a-vaccination-centre-book-appointment/article33946342.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka to move SC against T.N. project||Terming the Tamil Nadu’s decision to utilise surplus water in Cauvery basin as “illegal” Home, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said that Karnataka will approach the Supreme Court for a legal recourse. “The link scheme that Tamil Nadu has started will hurt Karnataka’s interest. Officially and legally, the surplus water has not been distributed among the riparian States,” he told reporters here after attending a high-level meeting of technical and legal experts to decide the future course of action. The Minister also said that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had already written to the Union government to advise Tamil Nadu not to go ahead with the project. The decision follows Tamil Nadu government’s move to lay foundation to the Cauvery-Vellaru-Vaigai-Gundar link scheme last Sunday. The link scheme proposes to utilise the surplus water in the Cauvery basin and transfer it to its Southern region. Mr. Bommai said: “It is not right on the part of Tamil Nadu to utilise surplus water before it is allocated. Under the provisions of The Inter State Water Disputes Act, it is illegal and cannot happen without the proper allocation.” He also accused Tamil Nadu of being an impediment to every project proposed by the State in the Cauvery basin. “It opposed additional allocation of Cauvery water to Bengaluru. It was only after Karnataka opposed Hogenekkal drinking water project that serves Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri district that it agreed for 9 tmcft allocation to Bengaluru. Even the Hogenakkal project was started without permission.” The Home Minister said that Karnataka’s stand was that even the surplus water had to be shared between the riparian States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-to-move-sc-against-tn-project/article33946317.ece
27 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘PSU banks, insurers important’||While the government was promoting private enterprises wherever possible, India still needed an effective presence of public sector banks and insurers and the government would continue with banking reforms to strengthen the financial system, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. “Our top priority is to ensure that the depositor as well as the investor experiences trust and transparency. The old ways and old systems of banking and non-banking sectors are being changed,” Mr Modi said, pointing to the ‘severe harm’ done to the banking and financial sector ‘10-12 years ago in the name of aggressive lending.’ Mr. Modi was addressing a webinar on effective implementation of Budget provisions regarding financial services. The government, he said, had taken steps to free the country from a ‘non-transparent credit culture’ where non-performing assets (NPAs) were brushed under the carpet. “We understand the uncertainties of the business and recognise that every business decision is not underlined by bad intentions. In such a scenario, it is the responsibility of the government to stand by business decisions taken with clear conscience, we are doing this and will continue to do so,” he stated. The new policy of disinvestment of public sector enterprises covered the financial sector as well, and private enterprises were being promoted wherever possible, he noted. “Still, along with this, an effective participation of the public sector in banking and insurance is still needed by the country. To strengthen the public sector, equity capital infusion is being emphasised. Simultaneously, a new ARC (asset reconstruction company) structure is being created which will keep track of the NPAs of banks and will address loans in a focussed way,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/psu-banks-insurers-important/article33946348.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Second wave of infections unlikely: expert||A recent surge in infections notwithstanding, India is unlikely to see a “second wave” in infections, says Manindra Agrawal, Deputy Director, IIT, Kanpur, and one of India’s leading mathematicians who is involved with the National ‘Super Model’ initiative led by the Department of Science and Technology. As on Friday, India has confirmed a little over 11 million infections since March 2020 of which 1,52,895 were active ones. Professor Agrawal told The Hindu that based on the model, this would at most rise to 11.3 or 11.5 million infections by April 2021 — or about 3,00,000-5,00,000 new confirmed infections over the next 10 weeks (approximately). He and other scientists are working on a formal update of the model but were awaiting confirmed data on recoveries for the next two weeks, he said. The current wave of infections — averaging 13,000-16,000 new confirmed infections a day since February 23 — was primarily being led by Maharashtra and would not last beyond “two-three weeks” in March, he said. The reason, he said, is because around 60% of India’s population had already been exposed to the virus and the country had reached herd immunity, or where the number of susceptible individuals were too few to allow the virus to exponentially grow. Whether herd immunity levels have been reached is moot, because the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) reported that only 21% of Indians were estimated to have been infected, as per its third national serological survey conducted from December 17 to January 8, 2021. The Super Model’s estimate is about thrice that number. “The ICMR numbers are based on the numbers in whom antibodies have been detected. But we know now that antibody levels can wane but still be enough to confer immunity. Given the relaxations in movement since months, only 20% exposure cannot explain the confirmed symptomatic infections, active cases and recoveries that we now see,” he added. He said the resumption of local train travel in Maharashtra and the increased contact between persons was a reason for the renewed spike last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/second-wave-of-infections-unlikely-expert/article33946354.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||23.79 lakh register for free digital library service||The success of the government-run digital library initiative, which was launched last year in February – weeks before the nationwide lockdown was imposed – has come as a surprise even to the authorities. In one year, over 23.79 lakh people signed up for services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a closer look at the data reveals that a majority of subscribers to the free service did not download a single e-book or video. According to data provided by the Department of Public Libraries, around 10.9 lakh e-books and 5.49 lakh videos have been accessed so far. Of the 23.79 lakh who registered under the Karnataka Digital Public Libraries (KDPL)initiative, the majority – 4.11 lakh people – were from Dakshina Kannada district. On the other hand, the number of registrations from Bengaluru Urban district was much lower with 2.37 lakh users. The maximum number of people were from the North zone (77,160), while the East zone had the least with 7,956 registrations. Across Karnataka, the least number of users were from Kodagu district with only 1,773 people signing up for KDPL. The digital library was launched on February 26, 2020, and less than a month later the nationwide lockdown was enforced owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. On why a significant chunk of users have not accessed any of the digital resources, Satish Kumar S. Hosamani, Director of the Department of Public Libraries, said that more than 10 lakh users had registered in January and February this year. “As they are newly registered, they are yet to access our e-books or videos,” he said. Kannada writer Baragur Ramachandrappa said that there was a need to spread more awareness on digital libraries. “We are in the transition period and people slowly are switching from reading hard copies of books to accessing texts in digital format. Most, however, still prefer hard copies,” he said. However, Kuntady Nithesh, co-founder of the website ‘Ruthumana’, which ventured into digital and audio books a year and a half ago, that there was definitely an audience for e-books. “We have to ensure that the books are in the right format as the interface is important. Unless the user interface is good, people will not make reading e-books a regular habit,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2379-lakh-register-for-free-digital-library-service/article33946314.ece
27 February 2021||Kolkata,||Eight-phase polls on BJP’s request: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday questioned the reasons behind the Election Commission of India’s decision to hold the Assembly election in the State in eight phases. “West Bengal has 294 seats, why will elections be held here in eight phases? This is for the benefit of whom? There should be some rationale behind the decision,” Ms. Banerjee said hours after the ECI announced the election schedule. This is the first time the election in West Bengal is spread over eight phases. The earlier occasion when the State went to polls with the highest number of phases was during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when polls were conducted in seven phases. The Chief Minister, who is also the chairperson of the Trinamool Congress, said these dates were fixed on the request of the BJP. She raised strong objections to holding polls in different phases in the same district. “In South 24 Parganas, since we are strong, elections are held in three phases … Is it at the instructions of [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah,” she asked. Ms. Banerjee also raised questions on the appointment of police observers, and said one of them was deployed in the State during the 2019 Lok Sabha election as well. The Trinamool said the Election Commission should consider West Bengal “as their own State and not from the eyes of the BJP”. The Chief Minister, however, said that even in the 23-day election game, she would defeat the BJP as she is from the grassroots. “I know every nook and corner of West Bengal very well and will foil all conspiracy,” she said. Welcoming the eight-phase election schedule, the BJP said that it was a matter of shame that West Bengal had to have elections in so many phases because of a history of political violence. “Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee seems to be mistaking the Election Commission of India with the State Election Commission, which has been working at the whims and fancies of the State government, and we have seen the results [of that] in local polls,” said State BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya. BJP leader and party observer in the State Kailash Vijayvargiya said all political parties in the Opposition had demanded that polls be spread across several phases. The Left parties and Congress welcomed the decision, and said Central forces should be deployed in advance. Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammad Salim said the eight-phase election was a reflection of the law and order situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-questions-eight-phase-polls-in-bengal/article33946334.ece
27 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Left-Cong. alliance is emerging as an alternative in West Bengal’||The Left parties questioned the eight-phase poll schedule for West Bengal, saying the Election Commission of India (ECI) failed to give a credible justification for stretching the polls to nearly a month. Communist Party of India- Marxist (CPI-M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the ECI should have explained the reason for this, when in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry the polls could be wrapped up in a single day and in Assam in three phases. “These elections are going to be crucial. The overall objective today is to keep the BJP at bay ... In Bengal, the basic alternative that is emerging, on the strength of the people’s struggles in the past few months, braving the repression of the Trinamool government, is the secular democratic alliance of the Left-Congress,” he said. To defeat the BJP in Bengal, it was necessary to defeat the incumbent Trinamool government, said Mr. Yechury. “The anti-incumbency against the Trinamool government is feeding the BJP.” CPI general secretary, D. Raja, said the ECI should have explained the apprehensions due to which they were extending the polls over eight phases in Bengal. Welcoming the schedule, Congress general secretary Pawan Kumar Bansal said the ECI should ensure that the polls are conducted “without fear or favour”. He said the party would raise important issues such as increase in cooking gas, petrol and diesel prices and growing unemployment after the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/left-cong-alliance-is-emerging-as-an-alternative-in-bengal/article33946336.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. welcomes India-Pak. ceasefire agreement||The United States has welcomed the announcement by India and Pakistan that they would observe the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC). The White House called for the two countries to build upon this progress and the State Department encouraged a reduction in tensions and violence along the LoC. “The United States welcomes the joint statement between India and Pakistan: that the two countries have agreed to maintain strict observance of a ceasefire along the Line of Control starting on February 25. This is a positive step towards greater peace and stability in South Asia, which is in all shared — is in our shared interest. And we encourage both countries to keep building upon this progress,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at Thursday’s briefing. “We welcome … the joint statement between India and Pakistan that the two countries have agreed to maintain strict observance of a ceasefire along the Line of Control starting on February 25. We encourage continued efforts to improve communication between the two sides and to reduce tensions and violence along the Line of Control,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday. On U.S. role In response to a question on the role of the U.S., if any, in brokering the agreement between India and Pakistan, Mr. Price did not identify any specific actions but articulated the general U.S. position — a reduction in tensions and a condemnation of cross-border terror as well as a dialogue on Kashmir and other issues. “ I think what I can say ... is that we had called on the parties to reduce tensions along the Line of Control by returning to that 2003 ceasefire agreement. We have been very clear that we condemn the terrorists who seek to infiltrate across the Line of Control,” he said. “When it comes to the U.S. role, we continue to support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues of concern. And as I said just a moment ago, we certainly welcome the arrangement that was announced that will take place — go into effect, I should say, on February 25,” added Mr. Price. Former U.S. President Donald Trump had ruffled feathers in New Delhi with repeated offers to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir. Mr. Trump had announced in July 2019 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to mediate on Kashmir with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar “categorically” assuring Parliament that no such request was made. UN, EU welcome deal “The Secretary-General is encouraged by the joint statement issued by the militaries of India and Pakistan on their agreement to observing the ceasefire at the Line of Control in Kashmir and engaging through established mechanisms,” spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. “He hopes that this positive step will provide an opportunity for further dialogue,” the spokesperson said. The European Union (EU) also welcomed the ceasefire agreement. “This is an important step in the interest of regional peace and stability on which to build further bilateral dialogue,” said Nabila Massrali, EU spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-welcomes-india-pak-ceasefire-agreement/article33946340.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC exploring avenues to offer quick relief to accident victims||The Supreme Court is exploring the creation of a nationwide online mechanism to help road accident victims and their families get compensation within a short time of the accident. A Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul is considering various avenues to speed up the compensation process, including the setting up of a national grid to seamlessly disburse compensation across States to the online submission of police records and accident claim documents in Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals. The court’s intervention came on a writ petition filed by one of India’s largest insurance firms, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company, on the plight of victims who have been waiting for years for compensation. Bajaj, drawing on its “pan-India experience” in the insurance sector, said in many parts of the country the police take months to even file an accident report for submission before the claims tribunal. The Act requires “contemporaneous” collection and verification of information about an accident. Delay would destroy crucial and important evidence. The company argued that delay also adds to the trauma. Advocate Vipin Nair intervened to argue that Supreme Court’s own Artificial Intelligence Committee, headed by Justice L. Nageswara Rao, has also been considering a virtual mechanism to speed up the compensation process. Acknowledging the submission that it was time to embrace technology to improve justice administration especially during the time of a pandemic, the Bench asked Additional Solicitor General Jayant Sud to hold a virtual conference with stakeholders on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-exploring-avenues-to-offer-quick-relief-to-accident-victims/article33946344.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||2,170 illegal religious structures on public lands in Bengaluru||A third survey conducted by the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on the directions of the High Court of Karnataka has found that there are 2,170 religious structures built illegally on public land in the city, and 277 of them were built after September 29, 2009, the cut-off date set by the apex court for preventing such constructions. A report on the outcome of the survey was submitted before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum on Friday during the hearing of a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the High Court for enforcing the Supreme Court’s 2009 directions on preventing illegal religious structures on public properties. In an affidavit, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told the court that there are 1,893 illegal religious structures on public land built prior to September 2009. The commissioner stated that 240 of the 1,893 structures will have to be removed, while the remaining 105 can be relocated and 1,548 can be regularised as per the apex court’s guidelines. Another 277 structures built on public land after September 2009 cannot be tolerated as per apex court’s directions and they will be removed after issuing show cause notices to those managing them, he said. Pointing out that the survey found a total of 3,335 and 379 religious structures built on private land prior to and after September 2009 respectively, the commissioner said BBMP officers are analysing documents like sale deeds, building plan, etc., to ascertain whether these structures are actually built on private land and if they have encroached public streets or footpaths. First survey After conducting the first survey during March-June 2020, the BBMP had told the High Court that there were only 17 illegal religious structures built on public land after the September 2009, and 94 such structures built prior to 2009. However, the court had observed that “even a child cannot believe” that there are only 17 illegal structures built illegally after September 2009 while directing re-survey. In the second survey, the BBMP had identified a total of 1,588 religious structures built illegally on public land and of which 1,337 were found to have existed prior to September 2009. The BBMP conducted the survey for a third time as the court found fault with the methodology of the second survey as religious structures on private properties were not surveyed. While clarifying that the lack of understanding of the apex court’s 2009 directions in proper perspective by the field staff had resulted in the difference in outcome in the surveys, the commissioner apologised to the court.  The apex court on September 29, 2009, had directed all the State governments not to allow or legalise any construction of religious structures on public lands illegally from that date, and those built prior to that date can be regularised or relocated or removed by framing a proper policy by the respective governments. The Bench adjourned further hearing till March 26 asking the BBMP to submit the status of action taken based actions proposed on survey result.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2170-illegal-religious-structures-on-public-lands-in-bengaluru/article33946322.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Minister to talk with PSC rank holders||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday asked Law Minister A.K. Balan to hold talks with the striking PSC rank holders. The decision comes even as the DYFI leadership has opened negotiations with the agitators. Mr. Balan is likely to meet the protesters on Sunday as the government attempts to resolve the issue ahead of the Assembly elections polls in April. Moreover, the government did not want the youth to “play into the hands of the opposition” as the Congress and BJP have expressed solidarity with strikers. Both parties have held demonstrations across the State accusing the government of backdoor appointments. Many of the protests have led to clashes with the police leading to injuries on both sides. Youth Congress leaders are on an indefinite fast at the venue of the PSC rank holders agitation. Congress MLA Shafi Parambil said the government had lied that there was no legal provision to revive the expired Civil Police Officer’s rank list. Two SFI leaders had discredited the rank list and precipitated its expiry by cheating in the PSC test. The slew of backdoor appointments had denied educated youth their chance for government employment. On Wednesday, the cabinet announced the creation of posts above the requisite number in the Sports and Youth Affairs Department to employ 82 athletes who had won gold, silver and bronze medals for Kerala in the National Games. It also generated supernumerary posts to accommodate striking athletes without waiting for vacancies. The government had also decided to raise a new police batallion to create 100 new CPO vacancies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/minister-to-talk-with-psc-rank-holders/article33946332.ece
27 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Free RT-PCR test for flyers from abroad||The mandatory RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 at airports for foreign travellers coming into the State will be done free of cost by the State government, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said. The Minister said here on Friday that as the Centre had given strict instructions regarding the conduct of RT-PCR tests for those coming from abroad, the tests cannot be avoided. The traveller would be allowed to leave the airport after giving the sample and the results would be sent within 6-8 hours to the mobile number provided. According to the guidelines, the expatriates may not use a public transport facility from the airport to reach his destination. They will be going straight into home quarantine for seven days. Even if they have tested negative in the RT-PCR test, they are advised to remain home for another seven days on self observation, the only exception being emergency travel. The test will be repeated on the eight day. On the other hand, if they tested positive in the RT-PCR test, they will go into institutional quarantine. Ms. Shylaja said that airport surveillance was being strengthened as it was highly likely that the second wave of COVID-19 is likely in 16 States where the case graph has been rising. In a single week, the total number of new COVID-19 cases in the country had gone up by 31%, she said. Mobile RT-PCR labs Meanwhile, in an attempt to increase the quantum of RT-PCR tests rather than rapid antigen assays, the State has decided to engage mobile testing labs. Ten such labs will be deployed by March 15, with each lab performing 2,000 tests a day. The idea is that these mobile labs together can perform up to 30,000 RT-PCR tests a day, in addition to the 25,000-odd tests done daily by other accredited labs. The mobile testing facility has been outsourced to a Hyderabad-based firm, which will perform the tests at the rate of Rs. 448.2 a test. The cost will be borne by the Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd. The first of these labs will start operating from Thiruvananthapuram airport from Saturday and three more mobile labs will be stationed at the other airports from next Tuesday. The other mobile labs will operate from Kollam, Kottayam, Kozhikode, Thrissur, Kasaragod and Palakkad. The mobile lab will be stationed at one point and the district health administration can choose the testing sites and send field workers for swab collection. The order issued by the Health Secretary in this regard said that if there was a delay in reporting the results in 24 hours or if there were any discordant results, the lab’s licence would be cancelled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/free-rt-pcr-test-for-flyers-from-abroad/article33946325.ece

The National Investigation Agency has started a parallel probe, a senior official said here. The SUV with around 2.5 kg of gelatin sticks was found parked on Carmichael Road near ‘Antilia’, the multi-storey residence of Mr. Ambani on Thursday evening. There was no assembled explosive device, detonators or batteries inside, the police said. CCTV footage showed that the SUV drove to the spot in the early hours of Thursday, and its driver left in another SUV. “The owner of the vehicle, Hiren Mansukh, visited the Police Commissioner's office in south Mumbai this afternoon after he saw visuals of the SUV found near Ambani's house,” the police official said. The letter in the vehicle was in a blue bag next to the driver’s seat, while the gelatin sticks were kept in a packet with the name of its manufacturer, “Solar Industries, Nagpur”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/suv-with-gelatin-sticks-found-near-ambanis-house-was-stolen/article33946356.ece

Further, the firm is requested to present its data with more clarity,” said the minutes of the February 24 meeting of the SEC made public on Friday. A spokesperson of Dr. Reddy’s said, “We understand the importance of effective investigation and we will approach the regulator with the requisite data soon.” The SEC meeting asked Covaxin maker Bharat Biotech, which sought permission to conduct phase III clinical trial of the vaccine candidate in children aged 5-18 years, to submit efficacy and safety data of ongoing Phase III clinical trial in adults along with the age subgroup analysis.  20 mn doses for Brazil On Friday, Bharat Biotech said it has signed an agreement with Brazil for supplying 20 million doses of Covaxin. Under the deal worth 1.6 billion reals ($290 million), the vaccine will be delivered in the second and third quarter of 2021. “There is a strong interest in Covaxin from many countries and the company is fully committed to ensuring supplies promptly and efficiently,” a statement from the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-seeks-more-data-to-clear-sputnik-v/article33946349.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Elephant electrocuted in Ramanagaram||An elephant was found dead on Friday morning in Ramanagaram. It is suspected to have been electrocuted. Forest Department officials said the incident took place around 4 a.m. on a farmer’s land. Kiran Kumar A., RFO, Ramanagaram, the single tusker, aged around 35, strayed towards the Handigundi  State forest, probably from Channapatna. “There was an irrigation pump set transformer on a farmer’s land, which it may have come in contact with, suffering a fatal electrocution,” he said. The postmortem has been conducted, and the forest department will issue a notice to the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited, officials said. The RFO said this was the first such incident in the range. However, sources said there are illegal connections, which are a point for concern. Past incidents Last October, two elephants were found dead in the Kodihalli range near the Bannerghatta National Park. Preliminary investigations indicated electrocution. Local residents had blamed illegal electric fencing on private properties outside the park as the cause of death. Earlier, in August, an elephant was electrocuted in Mugguru village adjoining the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, close on the heels of an elephant death due to electrocution at M.M. Hills. The Forest Department had said in this case, the tusker had ventured out of the natural habitat in search of fodder and come into contact with a power cable connected to the fence of a farm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/elephant-electrocuted-in-ramanagaram/article33946415.ece
27 February 2021||Hassan,||Driver from Rajasthan killed in elephant attack||A truck driver, a native of Rajasthan, died in an elephant attack on NH 75 near Maranahalli in Sakleshpur taluk on Thursday night. This is the third death due to elephant attack in Hassan district in the last two months. Wakil, 25, was found dead around 8 p.m. in the Kagineri reserve forest area. He had parked the container truck nearby. Local people had noticed the movement of a herd in the area for the last two to three days. The Forest Department staff, who reached the spot, also noticed the footprints of elephants nearby. Wakil was alone in the truck.

Normally, the family of those who die in elephant attack get Rs. 7.5 lakh. So far, 62 people have died in elephant attacks in Hassan district in the last 10 years. Last week, Forest Minister Arvind Limbavali held a meeting with the people of Sakleshpur on the the man-elephant conflict. Elephant found dead Bengaluru Staff Reporter writes: An elephant was found dead early on Friday morning in Ramanagaram. It is suspected that it could have been electrocuted. Forest Department officials said the incident occurred around 4 a.m. on a farmer’s land. Kiran Kumar A., RFO, Ramanagaram, said the tusker, aged around 35, strayed towards the Handigundi S tate forest, probably from Channapatna. “There was an irrigation pump set transformer on a farmer’s land, which it may have come in contact with,” he said. The post-mortem has been conducted, and the Forest Department would issue a notice to the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. (KPTCL), officials said. The RFO said this was the first such incident in the range. However, sources said there were illegal connections, which were a matter of concern.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/driver-from-rajasthan-killed-in-elephant-attack/article33946363.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||India, China agree to establish new hotline||He stressed that restoring normality to the broader relationship would first require complete disengagement and then de-escalation along the border. “It was necessary to disengage at all friction points in order to contemplate de-escalation of forces in this sector,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) quoted him as saying. “That alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship.” Underlining how both sides have viewed differently the impact of the border crisis on the broader relationship, Mr. Wang said “there has been some wavering and back-pedalling in India’s China policy”, because of which “practical cooperation between the two countries has been affected”. “Decades of experiences have shown repeatedly that heightening differences does not help solve problems, and that it only erodes the basis of mutual trust,” he said, adding that both sides should avoid the “wrong path of mutual misgivings and suspicion, still less the path of retrogression” and “should handle the boundary question properly to prevent the bilateral relationship from sinking into a negative cycle”. “While that the two countries have boundary disputes is an objective fact, which should be taken seriously, it is not the whole of China-India relations, and it should be put at a proper place in the overall bilateral relations,” he stressed. India, for its part, made it clear to China that it is not realistic to insulate the relationship from the boundary crisis, and emphasised that in its view, peace on the border is a prerequisite for the rest of the relationship to develop. China, however, has hit out at India’s economic measures, such as banning Chinese apps and stricter curbs on investment following last year’s tensions, viewing India’s “whole of government” approach as going against a past consensus of containing differences while cooperating elsewhere. Mr. Jaishankar said with the completion of disengagement in the Pangong Tso (lake) area, both sides “should now quickly resolve the remaining issues along the LAC” and “once disengagement is completed at all friction points, then the two sides could also look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area and work towards restoration of peace and tranquillity”. Mr. Wang said the situation on the ground “has been noticeably eased” and he called for both sides “to cherish the hard-won relaxation, and work together to consolidate the progress, keep up the consultation momentum, further ease the situation, and improve the border management and control mechanisms”. “The two sides also stressed need to advance the boundary talks to build up mutual trust and realise peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” he stated. Agreeing to set up a hotline so both Ministers could be in more regular contact, both sides stressed the importance of “timely” communication in the wake of last year’s crisis. This hotline will be in addition to the military hotline between the Indian Army’s Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO) and China’s Western Theatre Command. Army chief General Manoj Naravane said in January last year that the proposal for military hotline, which had been mired in bureaucratic delays for years, had been accepted by both sides after all procedural issues were resolved.  The two Foreign Ministers met in Moscow in September and agreed that the situation in the border was “not in the interest of either side” and to continue dialogue and “quickly disengage”. Working out the modalities of disengagement, however, proved to be complicated and took several months. Both sides broadly agreed on a plan to disengage at the ninth round of military-level talks in January, which began to be implemented earlier this month. On Thursday, the MEA said the completion of disengagement on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso (lake) last week was “a significant first step” towards resolving the remaining issues with China along the LAC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-agree-to-establish-new-hotline/article33946327.ece

Therefore, the focussed approach on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines/ SOPs, as envisaged in the guidelines issued on 27.01.2021; need to be enforced strictly by States and Union Territories,” the order said. The earlier guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, issued on January 27, are applicable till February 28. The guidelines permitted the opening of cinema halls and theatres at a higher capacity than the 50% seating strength. Swimming pools were also permitted for use by all. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation in a circular said: “In partial modification of circular dated June 26, 2020, the competent authority has further extended the validity... regarding scheduled international commercial passenger services to and from India till 23.59 p.m. IST of March 31, 2021.” However, international scheduled flights may be allowed on select routes by the competent authority on case-to-case basis, it said. Scheduled international flight operations were suspended from March 23 last year. The restriction will not apply to cargo flights and flights specifically approved by the regulator, the circular added. All kinds of social, religious and cultural gatherings, which were earlier restricted to a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity with a ceiling of 200 persons in closed spaces, were allowed. It said the Ministry of Civil Aviation may take a decision in consultation with the MHA for further opening up of international air travel.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Centre and Chairman of the National Commission for Backward Classes on a petition filed by G. Mallesh Yadav, from Telangana, and Alla Ramakrishna, a resident of Andhra Pradesh, for a national census on the basis of caste to identify and uplift the really backward among them. “A caste can be, and quite often is, a social class in India… Caste represents an existing, identifiable social group or class encompassing an overwhelming majority of the country’s population,” the petition, represented by advocate G.S. Mani, contended. Mr. Mani said the inclusion of backward classes in the State and Central Lists cannot be done mechanically. Forward castes and the creamy layer reaping the benefits of reservation should be excluded for the truly poor and downtrodden among backward classes. “Most of the benefits are knocked up by away by forward castes and the creamy layer. That will leave the truly backward backward forever,” Mr. Mani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-seeks-govt-reply-on-caste-wise-census-of-bcs/article33946355.ece

The seized stock included 117 gelatine sticks and 350 detonators. RPF sources said the bags containing the explosives were found hidden under the seat of a woman passenger in D1 compartment. The passenger, hailing from Chennai, was later arrested by the Government Railway Police (GRP) under the Explosives Act. The case will be investigated by a special police team. RPF squad members said they carried out an extensive search of the train following clear intelligence inputs. After the seizure, they checked all the compartments of the train. Woman’s version The arrested woman told the RPF and the police that the explosives had been purchased and shipped by train for sinking wells in Kannur. She produced a few photographs of ongoing works in an attempt to substantiate her claim. Following the RPF alert, senior police officers reached the spot to quiz her. They said the woman was on her way from Chennai to Thalassery. A preliminary inquiry revealed that the woman was temporarily settled in Koothuparamba, doing odd jobs.

As Wayanad MP, Mr. Gandhi had every right to highlight the woes of farmers in his constituency. He had also expressed solidarity with the coastal community. The LDF had attempted to betray them by conspiring to allow foreign trawlers into their traditional fishing grounds. Mr. Gandhi's short voyage with seafaring fishers had irked Mr. Vijayan. Unlike the Chief Minister, Mr. Gandhi related to people. The Chief Minister had lied that Mr. Gandhi had turned his back on farmers agitating in New Delhi. Mr. Gandhi had participated in their strike and got arrested. Mr. Vijayan had shielded Prime Minister Narendra Modi by stating that the Congress was inherently responsible for the farmers’ agitation. Mr. Vijayan had struck a pact with the Modi government. The Centre's investigation in the gold smuggling case had reached a dead-end. The CBI continued to stonewall the SNC Lavalin case proceedings in the Supreme Court. BJP State president K. Surendran had forgotten about the gold case.

27 February 2021||New Delhi,||SC declines plea in tiger killing case||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to proceed further with a contempt action against Maharashtra forest officials over the killing of Avni, a “man-eater” tigress, in 2018, after realising that the decision to kill the cat had been confirmed by the court itself. “If the decision to kill the tigress was confirmed by the Supreme Court, we are not going to reopen it,” Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, leading a three-Judge Bench, addressed petitioner Sangeeta Dogra. Ms. Dogra persisted that the officials took part in “celebrations” after the tigress was shot down. “The investigation [into the death of the tigress] was going on, how could they celebrate at a function?” Ms. Dogra said. Advocate Kartik N. Shukul, for the forest officials, however categorically denied that his clients were “directly or indirectly” a part of any celebrations. Chief Justice Bobde said the celebrations may have been by the villagers. “The officers have sent a note that they have not celebrated,” the CJI said. The court allowed Ms. Dogra to withdraw even as the latter said she had presented a “very serious issue”. “It is a very serious issue but we cannot interfere at this stage… Next time you come in advance. We will stop it,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed the petitioner. In the previous hearing, the court had issued notice to Vikas Kharge, Principal Secretary, Department of Revenue and Forests, Mumbai, and other Maharashtra Forest Department officials on Ms. Dogra’s contempt petition. The court had, last time, also decided to examine the claim that the tigress was really a man-eater. Avni is claimed to have killed 13 villagers. The animal was reported to have been shot dead near Borati village in Yavatmal by a team of Forest Department officials and civilian hunter Asgar Ali. The incident had triggered outrage among wildlife activists, who alleged that no efforts were made to tranquillise Avni and they called it “murder in cold blood”. Officials had, at the time, said a team of three Forest Department personnel and Mr. Ali shot the tigress, officially known as T-1, on the Borati-Warud Road in Yavatmal, news reports said.

The 24-year-old activist, who was in the Karnal jail, was released after the bail order. Her counsel Arshdeep Singh Cheema told The Hindu that she was released late in the evening. She was arrested by the Sonipat Police on January 12. Justice Avneesh Jhingan observed in his order that while dealing with the bail application, it would not be appropriate for the court to go in detailed discussion with regard to merits of the allegations. “The contentions are being considered only for purpose of deciding grant of bail. As per the case of the petitioner, she was heading a peaceful protest for getting wages of the workers. On the other hand, the case of the State is that it was a case of vandalism and hooliganism.”  Petitioner’s contention As per the pleadings, the petitioner, along with some workers, was making a peaceful protest outside a factory premises in Kundli to raise grievances regarding non-payment of wages to some of the labourers. Whereas the case of the State was that the protest turned violent, police officials were attacked and in the process, injuries were inflicted to police personnel.

27 February 2021||Hyderbad,||Govt. trying to intrude into private conversations: Asad||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday accused the government of attempting to intrude into private conversations, even as he claimed that the new social media rules that seek to know content of such messages were based on vague grounds. Taking to Twitter, and quoting a media report, Mr. Owaisi said that messaging services are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that only the sender and receiver of the message can view them. The Centre’s decision to find the originator of the message, which could be forwarded, was forcing messaging services to trace the originator on ‘vague grounds’, he said. He explained that these ‘vague grounds’, those of “sovereignty/integrity of India, security of State, friendly relations with foreign States, or public order”, could cover all types of lawful speech, from news reports on @PMOIndia’s weakness on Chinese intrusions to “Modi job do”. He further stated that tracing messages could lead to spoofing “where bad actors can falsify originator information to frame innocents”, and pointed out that originators have no control over how many times the message could be forwarded. Raising concerns on surveillance, Mr. Owaisi tweeted, “Govt already has too many powers to surveil. We don’t have privacy laws that protect us from a govt that constantly wants to know about our private conversations. There’s no parliamentary oversight or judicial or redress against abuse of power. These rules must be opposed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-trying-to-intrude-into-private-conversations-asad/article33946326.ece

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||KfW defends funding for SWD project||Residents along East Coast Road plan to meet at the weekend to discuss the future course of action on the construction of an integrated stormwater drain network. This follows a response from KfW, the German Development Bank and the project funding agency, which said the project was essential to prepare Chennai for environmental and urbanisation challenges. Residents’ welfare associations along the ECR have been opposing the project covering the areas between Kottivakkam and Uthandi, arguing that the project would hinder groundwater recharge. They have made representations to several organisations to halt the project that is being executed by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Bank’s response Responding to their complaint, Carolin Gassner, director, South Asia, and Rainer Sunnen, principal portfolio manager, KfW, wrote to the associations that the project was assessed in depth before financial agreements were signed. Their environmental and social impact had also been reviewed. Following the concerns raised by residents, the project was reviewed again and discussed with the Greater Chennai Corporation. Ms. Gassner said although the localities were along the seashore and of sandy soil formation, there would be more flooding for two reasons: degree of urbanisation and climate change due to which extreme rainfall events were on the rise. The project design had incorporated several elements to allow only excess run-off to the sea, and rainwater harvesting blocks would be installed at 20 locations. On questions about coastal regulation zone clearance and the environmental impact on aquifers, the KfW said responses had been submitted to the National Green Tribunal. It was awaiting a decision from the NGT on how to proceed on the issues in early March. KfW had invited residents to provide suggestions for the project implementation through the proposed consultative committee. It asked them to register complaints directly with the GCC. Residents of Palavakkam said the work had been halted at many places and trenches closed at some sites, including Palkalai Nagar. “We are waiting for the next hearing at the NGT in early March. We plan to discuss the measures at a meeting shortly,” said a resident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kfw-defends-funding-for-swd-project/article33946482.ece
27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T. Nagar multi-level parking complex finds very few takers||The Greater Chennai Corporation’s seven-storey multi-level car park in T. Nagar began functioning on Friday. Located at the Theagaraya Road-Thanikachalam Road junction, the facility evoked poor response from vehicle users, including two-wheeler riders who preferred to park on the street. With the civic body keeping it a low-key affair, there seemed to be lack of awareness about the facility being thrown open to the public. Even a parking attendant in Panagal Park was unaware of it. A scooterist, who parked his vehicle in front of the Pondy Bazaar police station, said, “I have work on this side of the road. I would rather park here.” No information A parking attendant in the area said she tried to persuade vehicle users to use the facility but many wanted to complete their chore quickly and leave. At the car parking complex, six attendants have been posted to help park cars. Built at a cost of Rs. 40.79 crore, the complex can accommodate 317 cars and 418 two-wheelers at a time, with separate entry and exit gates and boom barriers. The lifts that carry the vehicles can be accessed only through access cards and are controlled from a CCTV-enabled control room. An official said 56 cameras had been installed in the parking lot. A car owner wanted to park his vehicle all by himself. When the attendants told him that there were sensors and only they were allowed access, he drove away. Happy experience However, those who used the facility were happy about the system. R.S. Mani of Medavakkam, who had come with his family, found it a novel experience. He was surprised at the ease with which the process was completed. “I thought they will sit in the car and take it up to the lot. I was worried about them retaining the key. But they returned it to me,” he said. A user said it took just 90 seconds to park or remove the vehicle. ‘Unaffordable rates’ Baskaran, an employee at a garment shop in Pondy Bazaar who commutes from Perambur, said: “They are charging Rs. 5 per hour. I work 10 hours a day. I will end up spending Rs. 1,500 on parking alone for a month. It is unaffordable. The shop owner said he will work out a way to ensure that we employees get a pass.” “No one can enter the parking lot as it is fully automated. In case of malfunction, a mechanic alone can access it,” said an official. The road stretch connecting Lakshmikanthan Street and Theagaraya Road has been taken over to facilitate easy parking access. “The access has to be cut as otherwise there will be problems for vehicle users,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/t-nagar-multi-level-parking-complex-finds-very-few-takers/article33946492.ece

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Bill to provide 10.5% special quota to Vanniyars passed in Assembly||Barely half-an-hour before the model code of conduct kicked in for the 2021 Assembly election on Friday, the AIADMK government pushed through legislation to temporarily provide for 10.5% special reservation for the Vanniakula Kshatriyas within the quota for the Most Backward Classes (MBCs). The Bill provides for internal reservation for the MBCs and Denotified Communities. The Most Backward Class of the Vanniakula Kshatriyas will get 10.5%, the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities 7% and the Most Backward Classes 2.5%. This quota will be created from within the 20% reservation for the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities. They will now get a special reservation of seats in educational institutions, including private educational institutions, and in government services. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami introduced the Bill at a sitting on Friday afternoon, after news of the Election Commission’s press conference to announce the dates for the Assembly election broke before noon. Mr. Palaniswami made it clear that this was a temporary arrangement. “The reservation provided for in this Bill will be temporary. Once the caste-based census is completed, this will be revised based on the findings,” he said. PMK’s agitation The PMK, a key ally of the AIADMK, had organised an agitation demanding exclusive reservation for Vanniyars in government jobs and higher education. Initially the PMK leadership had demanded 20% reservation but scaled it down after meetings with a delegation of Ministers. The Bill was passed by a voice vote in the absence of the Opposition parties, which have boycotted the session. “This Act is based on the recommendations made by the committee led by Justice M.S. Janarthanam (retired) in 2012,” Mr. Palaniswami said after the Bill went through the House. The Chief Minister said these communities had been protesting to demand separate reservation. He said PMK founder S. Ramadoss and other leaders of the community had long been demanding a separate quota for the community. “We have brought in the legislation today based on the requests,” he said. He said these communities had been seeking a separate reservation as they could not compete with the other castes and communities in the list of the MBCs and Denotified Communities so as to get their legitimate share of the benefit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bill-to-provide-105-special-quota-to-vanniyars-passed-in-assembly/article33946507.ece
27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘To say that I follow Stalin’s lead is false propaganda’||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday rejected DMK president M.K. Stalin’s contention that he was implementing the policies that the DMK leader had been promising during his Assembly election campaign. Addressing journalists in Chennai, he said: “The Leader of the Opposition claims that the Chief Minister ‘is waiving loans only because I have promised it...’ This is false propaganda. Every party has an ideology of its own. They are not in power so they can say anything. The State government gets an estimate, announces it and implements it.” The government had been fulfilling the needs of farmers, the poor and women by waiving offf arm loans, jewel loans and loans taken by self-help groups. Reiterating that he hails from a farming family, Mr. Palaniswami said the government knew when the people were in need of help. Answering questions about the State’s mounting debts, he said, “No State announces policies with money in hand. All States take loans to implement policies for growth. People are important. No State is without debt. Only because of these policies, Tamil Nadu has grown even in these difficult times when the economies around the world have suffered.” He added, “Mr. Stalin himself admitted that the State had a debt of Rs. 1,05,000 crore in 2011. What was the situation then and now? What is the cost of laying a road then and now? The DMK [government] took loans to implement policies.” Mr. Palaniswami questioned why the DMK did not demand farm loan waiver either in Parliament or in the Assembly. “They did not do it. They will do it only for the election. We do what is important for the people at a certain point of time,” he said. Claiming that these announcements were not linked to the Assembly election, he said, “Mr. Stalin keeps saying that I only announce schemes but will not implement them. We have created a situation wherein we have implemented the schemes.” Loan waiver certificates were being given to farmers. He reiterated that there was no scope for corruption in the e-tendering process. Citing the example of the Cauvery-Gundar project, the Chief Minister said the scheme would not be implemented fully at one go. “It is done over a period of time. Many of the schemes are implemented through the World Bank — only after it sanctions them, stipulating rules for implementation, do we call for tenders. These allegations are made for political reasons.”  Every party has an ideology of its own. They [Opposition] are not in power. So they can say anything||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/to-say-that-i-follow-stalins-lead-is-false-propaganda/article33946509.ece

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||30,000 MBBS, 24,000 PG seats added in 6 years: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that around 30,000 MBBS seats and 24,000 postgraduate seats in medicine have been added since the present government came to power in 2014. Addressing the 33rd convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University through videoconferencing, he said the number of MBBS seats had gone up by 50% and postgraduate seats by 80% since 2014. Stating that the government was keen to transform the health sector, he pointed out that the National Medical Commission, the newly-formed regulatory body, would bring in more transparency. 11 new medical colleges Pointing out that 11 new medical colleges had been approved in Tamil Nadu in districts that did not have one until now, he said the Union government would provide funding for each of these colleges. The Prime Minister lauded the fact that around 70% of those graduating from the university this year were women. Appreciating all the graduates and the women in particular, he said that their success and the success of the institution would have made the “great MGR very happy.” The late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran’s governance was full of compassion towards the poor, he said. “The subjects of healthcare, education, and empowerment of women were dear to him,” he added. Recalling the inauguration of a hospital built with India’s assistance by him in Dickoya in Sri Lanka that served the Tamil community there, Mr. Modi said that too would have made MGR happy as he was born there. COVID-19 response The Prime Minister said that India had not only handled the COVID-19 pandemic better, it had also helped other countries by producing medicines and vaccines. Sudha Seshayyan, Vice-Chancellor of the university, said this was the first time in the university’s history that a Prime Minister was delivering the convocation address. Governor Banwarilal Purohit presided over the function in the presence of Minister for Health and Family Welfare C. Vijayabaskar and Principal Secretary of the department J. Radhakrishnan. A total of 21,889 undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral and post-doctoral students received their degrees in medical, dental, AYUSH and allied health science courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/30000-mbbs-24000-pg-seats-added-in-6-years-modi/article33946527.ece

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I am drenched in tears of joy, says Ramadoss||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday said that he was “drenched in tears of joy” after Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami tabled and passed a bill that ensures 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyar community in education and jobs within the ‘Most Backward Class’ quota in the State Assembly. In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss thanked Mr. Palaniswami for “ensuring social justice” for the Vanniyar community after 40 years. “I am drenched in tears of joy and [his son] Anbumani Ramadoss is also in a similar state of mind. When he told me about the news, he couldn’t control his tears. He was emotional and crying profusely. I couldn’t stop his tears.” he said. “The reason for the tears is that the Vanniyar community, which is now in a very bad state, will improve because of this,” said Dr. Ramadoss. According to him, the 10.5% reservation would ensure proper representation for the Vanniyars and they would get 10,500 jobs if the government recruits 1,00,000 people. “If there are 6,000 medical seats, around 630 seats would be ensured for Vanniyars. It would improve the social status and livelihood of Vanniyars. I protested for this for the last 40 years,” he said. Fight not over Stating that the fight for social justice is not complete, he said the representation for the Vanniyars should be comparable to its population. “We have reiterated this to the State government and we have been promised that a census would be done in the next six months and proper representation would be provided. “Mr. Palaniswami has given this assurance in the State Assembly as well. After the victory in the State Assembly election, PMK will ensure victory in these as well,” he said. He added that Vanniyars – who are more than 2 crore in population – didn’t get proper representation in education and jobs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-am-drenched-in-tears-of-joy-says-ramadoss/article33946516.ece
27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Short film launched||Half Is Ours , a short film by Shakti, a non-partisan citizens group, was launched at the Madras School of Social Work on Friday. Produced by an organisation working for higher representation of women in elected bodies, the short film depicts the need for more elected women representatives to highlight the issues faced by women. “Tamil Nadu might have the highest percentage of women Ph.Ds, postgraduates, GER of women and better labour force participation of women, but we have only 8% women MLAs now and have never had more than 14% MLAs,” said Tara Krishnaswamy, co-founder, Shakti. Thamizhachi Thangapandian, MP, actor and politician Prakash Raj, advocate and AIADMK spokesperson Shivashankari and social activist Shalin Maria Lawrence participated in an interactive discussion about “Penn and Politics (women and politics).” Social conditioning “Social conditioning plays a huge role in preventing women from political participation. Reservation for women is not something that we have to beg for. It is our right and we should take the first step to demand it,” said Ms. Thamizhachi. Ms. Shalin said when even women with social and caste capital were intimidated, the threat to those from marginalised backgrounds who enter the political sphere was much more. “Recently in Tamil Nadu, a Dalit woman panchayat leader was not allowed to hoist the national flag. There are at least 17 women who have come forward and shared such stories of discrimination,” she said. Stating that it was a tough journey ahead for women in politics, she said that parties in Tamil Nadu were united against women’s representation. “The effort and force that women show in their daily lives — this is what they should bring to politics and break barriers,” she said. Since the Constitution ensured equality, Ms. Shivashankari said that more women should seize the opportunity and come forward into the political sphere. “A woman’s political representation empowers society as much as it empowers women,” said Mr. Prakash Raj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/short-film-launched/article33946531.ece

A. Kanagaraj, president of the association, and K.R. Nandhakumar, general secretary, said that with the examinations being cancelled, there were concerns about learning being affected as students had only recently returned to schools and begun attending physical classes. “Exam fees were collected last year and this year for Classes 10 and 11 and yet, there is now a sudden announcement about the cancellation of these exams. We also demand clarity on whether this applies to classes in schools coming under other boards like the CBSE,” Mr. Nandhakumar said. Clarity sought The association members further stated that there needed to be clear announcements on whether schools could continue to call senior students to the campus following the announcement. “We also want some decisions to be made for students of middle and primary classes, and need to know whether schools can reopen for them,” they said. A delegation of the protesters met the School Education Commissioner and the Directors of School Education and Matriculation Schools to submit representations on their concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-pass-announcement-riles-teachers-parents/article33946480.ece
27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||D. Pandian no more||Senior Communist leader and former State secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) D. Pandian died at age 89 in Chennai on Friday morning due tomultiple health problemsA two-time former MP is survived by two daughters and a son. Pandian was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Wednesday in an unconscious state with sepsis and hypoglycemia. He was put on life-saving medications and ventilator support. He breathed his last at 10.05 a.m. Born in Vellaimalaipatti near Usilampatti, Pandian joined the CPI when he was an intermediate student of Alagappa College, Karaikudi, in 1953. He won the students’ union election and later became an English teacher at the college. He was actively involved in the Tamil Nadu Kalai Ilakkiya Perumandram, a literary wing founded by the late Communist leader P. Jeevanandam. Pandian was an outstanding orator and participated in Kamban Kazhagam functions in Karaikudi, and his talent was spotted by Jeevanandam. Pandian campaigned in the 1957 Assembly elections under a pseudonym. However, newspapers published his original name and the college principal asked him to resign. He was appreciated by the founder of the college, Alagappa Chettiar, who presented him the works of Marx and Engels, bought in London when he was a student. When differences of opinion with the CPI political line resulted in disciplinary action against him and senior leader M. Kalyanasundaram, they joined hands with the late Mohit Sen to found the United Communist Party of India (UCPI). Pandian had functioned as the State secretary of the party. Sriperumbudur blast He rejoined the CPI in 2000 and functioned as its State secretary for three terms. As the editor of Janasakthi , the official organ of the CPI, he penned several political articles. He also authored books and translated Communist literature.  Pandian was to translate the speech of Congress leader and former Prime MinisterRajiv Gandhiat the election campaign meeting in Sriperumbudur, where the latter was assassinated in May 1991. Pandian sustained severe injuries in the blast. Initially, police mistakenly included his name in the list of those killed. “I still carry small pieces of shrapnel in my body. That is a different issue. Now I am speaking up for the Tamils, who are being decimated,” Pandian would say, whenever he was asked about his becoming an aggressive campaigner for the Sri Lankan Tamil cause in the last phase of the civil war in that country. He was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1989 from the North Madras (now North Chennai) constituency. In 1991, in the election held shortly after Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, he was once again elected from the same constituency. On both occasions, he contested on the Congress’s Hand symbol, as the UCPI was part of the Congress-led alliance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-leader-d-pandian-no-more/article33946522.ece

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||U. Ve. Sa., composer of Tamil keerthanas||The relatively lesser known face of U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer (U.Ve.Sa.), the grand old man of Tamil, has drawn the attention of Tamil scholars and musicians. He had composed keerthanas on Lord Muruga at Ilanthai Nagar in Sri Lanka and published them in 1891. Author and vocalist T.M. Krishna has set two of them to music and rendered it on the occasion of U.Ve.Sa.’s 166th birth anniversary on February 19. “The compositions are proof of U.Ve.Sa.’s knowledge of music. He had set them to particular ragas and I was able to tune them to music because of the spread of music in the words. They give a lot of scope for an elaborate rendition in a concert,” said Mr. Krishna, who has already sung the keethanas in ragas Suruti and Sahana . “I will soon render the other songs,” he said. The two songs have been released on YouTube with an introduction by historian A.R. Venkatachalapathy. Those who are familiar with his autobiography would know that U.Ve.Sa., born into a family of musicians, learnt music from Gopalakrishna Bharathiyar, the author of Nanda Charitram, when he was in Mayiladuthurai. But he quit learning music since his Tamil teacher Meenakshisundaram Pillai was against it. Writer Perumal Murugan, who has done an elaborate study of U.Ve.Sa.’s works, said the book containing the keerthanas was among his first to be printed. It was titled, Ilanthainagar Dhandapani Virutham.  On request The keerthanas were written on a request from Jaffna philanthropist Kumarasamy Chettiar, who had bought copies of Seevaka Chinthamani and distributed them in Jaffna. “After falling ill, he constructed a temple for Muruga at Ilanthai Nagar and requested U.Ve.Sa. to pen 10 viruthams on the main deity and a few more songs on the presiding deity,” said Mr. Perumal Murugan, who has written a detailed article on this — U.Ve.Sa. Thulangum Keerthanikal.  Kumarasamy Chettiar was particular that the songs should bear the name of the village. The songs cover various genres, including Oosal, Etcharikkai and Mangalam . The Etcharikkai song was set to raga Saveri by U.Ve.Sa. himself. The book was reprinted again in 1944 by U.Ve.Sa.’s son.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/u-ve-sa-composer-of-tamil-keerthanas/article33946966.ece

The road has a very high vehicle count of over two lakh a day, leading to congestion on a daily basis. The NH wing of the State Highways Department has taken up the work on behalf of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at a cost of Rs. 209.32 crore. “A total of passenger car units of 1.92 lakh vehicles a day take the road. Even if the number touches one lakh a day, it is necessary to widen the road. This will help reduce accidents too since service lanes are coming up along this stretch. The space between the lane and the stormwater drain will have paver blocks,” said an official of the Highways Department. The work has been allocated to three contractors so that it can be completed within a year, which is the target set for the project.

27 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Deaths in railway accidents down 57% in 2020: police||The Government Railway Police (GRP) has said there was a 57% drop in railway accidents and associated deaths in the State in 2020. According to statistics provided by the GRP, 2,517 deaths were reported in 2018, and of these, 2,173 were men and 344 were women. In 2019, the number of casualties was 2,619, including 2,292 men and 327 women. However, in 2020, 1,137 deaths were reported — 957 men and 180 women. “Due to the efforts of our officers from the GRP, the railway accident deaths reduced by 57% in 2020,” said C. Sylendra Babu, DGP, Railways. Awareness programmes The GRP conducted 14,845 awareness programmes on railway station platforms, level-crossings, adjacent villages, colleges and accident-prone areas. Four short films on safety were released on social media platforms, senior GRP officers said. “We have identified 116 accident zones across the State. The highest number is in Chennai and suburban areas, followed by Coimbatore, Madurai and Jolarpet,” Mr. Babu said. He said the COVID-19 lockdown may have been one of the reasons for the reduction in deaths, but that alone could not account for the 57% drop in deaths. “Goods, workmen, medicine and trial run trains were plying even during the lockdown period. Hence, the reduction was due to the enforcement efforts of GRP and the awareness programmes,” Mr. Babu said. Preventive work He said utmost importance and priority was accorded to the prevention of accidents due to trespassing on railway tracks. “This preventive work, which paid rich dividends, will continue in the coming months,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deaths-in-railway-accidents-down-57-in-2020-police/article33946915.ece

27 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Become exporters, FPOs told||The Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) should be turned into direct exporters through capacity building. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) should work with Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) and NABARD to set up an APEDA cell to train officials on export promotion, who will in turn train the FPOs, said APEDA Chairman M. Angamuthu here on Friday. Inaugurating ‘TAN Food 21,’ a two-day agricultural expo held at Agricultural College and Research Institute here, organised by Madurai Agri Business Incubation Forum (MABIF) and POTAN Super Foods Producer Company Limited, he said APEDA intends to provide technical support to identify the produce of farmers. If laboratory testing, packaging and marketing is done properly, farmers will earn premium returns. A few interventions are necessary. There is a need to set up a Centre for Perishable Cargo at Madurai airport and AEPDA will work towards achieving this. APEDA will work towards identifying issues and fulfil gaps in transporting rice through rail services. "We will develop a sea protocol for transporting a list of selected horticultural produce," he added. APEDA will take it up to the Ministry to declare a Moringa Special Export Zone in Tamil Nadu. Steps will be taken to ease the process of obtaining certification for organic produce. APEDA will work towards market promotion of products with Geographical Indication (GI) tag by organising regular buyer-seller meets. Madurai has been an important hub for agri business. Sustainable efforts are important to earn great returns from agri business. TNAU Vice-Chancellor N. Kumar said there was an increase in interest among the public in using traditional products. Similarly, the farmers are more interested in cultivating traditional paddy varieties. The process of obtaining organic certification must be eased. The thrust on FPOs has been increasing in the past 5-6 years. So, all departments must work together in promoting more FPOs. Baiju N. Kurup, General Manager, NABARD, Tamil Nadu, said that TNAU is an important partner in executing various projects of NABARD. MABIF is one of the leading forums set up by NABARD. The focus of NABARD is to engage MABIF to ensure efficient working of FPOs. M. Natchimuthu, Chairman of POTAN and AAVAARAM Group, said that moringa was one of superfoods of Tamil Nadu. The State contributed to a major share of production of moringa and a Moringa Special Export Zone must be declared in the State. Tamil Nadu Agricultural College and Research Institute Dean V.K. Paulpandi delivered the welcome address. Mr. Angamuthu also inaugurated an exhibition of agricultural and traditional food products. A total of 165 stalls consisting of farmers and FPOs were selling various food products. A buyer-seller meet and a meet to engage FPOs with the startups was organised as part of the expo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/become-exporters-fpos-told/article33946648.ece
27 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Take steps to bring down fuel price’||The Union government must take steps to contain the spiralling prices of petrol and diesel, said Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (MADITSSIA) president B. Muruganantham. In a release, he said fuel prices had been increasing in the last two months and it seemed the price of petrol might rise to more than Rs. 100 a litre. “Since construction materials, medicines, groceries, vegetables and raw materials of micro and small scale industries were transported through lorries, the increase in fuel prices would have a cascading effect - an increase in lorry freight will lead to price escalation of essential commodities,” Mr. Muruganantham said. In the end, the common man would be affected. When input and delivery cost for micro and small industries increase, it would affect the sales. Lorry owners had decided to organise a strike against the rise in fuel prices. So, the Union government must take steps to promote use of electrical vehicles and take steps to reduce fuel prices, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-steps-to-bring-down-fuel-price/article33946819.ece

Baskaran distributed revolving fund to caregivers of persons with mental disabilities who are part of SUBITCHAM (a family fellowship for mentally retarded and mentally ill) and NAMMBIKKAI (a self-help group of caregivers) - both functioning under M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation headed by C. Ramasubramanian, State Nodal Officer of Police Well Being Programme. Justice Baskaran congratulated the efforts of Dr. Ramasubramanian in providing service to the community at a function here on Thursday. He said that after visiting one of the de-addiction centres run by the Foundation he came to know how addiction to tobacco products and alcohol forced youngsters to commit crimes. An awareness must be created among students about ills of addiction to tobacco and alcohol products. The students must be engaged in providing counselling to those who suffer from addiction, suggested Justice Baskaran. If medical profession is termed noble, these services should be termed divine, said Justice M.S. Ramesh of Madurai Bench of Madras High Court. While doctors treated ailments, only a few like Dr. Ramasubramanian ensure that the larger community is also benefited, he said. R. Subramanian, HC judge, congratulated the efforts of the Foundation in providing services to persons with mental disabilities. K. Samidurai, secretary of Indian Association of Lawyers, High Court advocate Govindan, Dr. Ramasubramanian, Executive Director R. Rajkumari, and Director of programmes K.S.P.

27 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Fiery speech in Madurai was Pandian’s last one||He was brought to the dais on a wheelchair. But the visibly fragile-looking D. Pandian had lost not even an iota of his typical touch of extempore speech. That speech has now become the veteran Communist leader’s last public address, given at a well-attended ‘Political Awakening’ conference organised by the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Madurai on February 18. The veteran Communist leaderdied on Friday morning. “Only the bones in my legs and hip are not cooperating. But my brain is very much intact,” he said while starting his speech amidst a huge round of applause. Even in a state of such ill-health, Pandian was able to recall the Keeladi archaeological excavations and several ancient Tamil literary works associated with Madurai on the occasion. He was highly critical of the AIADMK government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). No one who wants to make Tamil soil a slave for someone can set foot on the land, he had said. “We will prevent them. Nothing will change on its own. We have to bring about the change,” he told cadres. The Communists, even without being in power in the State, had managed to get lots of benefits for farmers and no force could subdue the Red Army, the proud Communist leader had said. He not only said “I will wake up this country with my words, till I breathe my last,” but also lived up to those words.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fiery-speech-in-madurai-was-pandians-last-one/article33946518.ece
27 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Age limit challenged before High Court||A teacher aspirant from Virudhunagar district has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court challenging the School Education Department’s decision to reduce upper age limit for recruitment of teachers from 57 to 40 for the open category and from 57 to 45 for the reserved category. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice R. Hemalatha directed the State to file a counter affidavit in the petition filed by S.Sumathi of Aruppukottai. She said that based on the decision to reduce the age limit, Teachers Recruitment Board had issued a notification for the post of PG Assistants and the reduced maximum age limit was fixed. Reducing the upper age limit was arbitrary and thousands of teacher aspirants would be affected as a result. Therefore, the rules prescribing the new maximum age limits should be declared illegal as people who were preparing for several years for the examination would be deprived of participating in the recruitment process, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/age-limit-challenged-before-high-court/article33946818.ece
27 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Pay compensation to girl’s family, says HC||The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has directed the State government to pay a sum of Rs. 5 lakh to the family of an eight-year-old girl from Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district who died after developing complications when she was administered anesthesia by an anesthetist. The inquiry committee had concluded that there was no medical negligence. The court was hearing the petition filed in 2017 by the girl’s mother Tamil Selvi. She said that her daughter who was suffering from tonsils and had been admitted to Government Hospital in Aruppukottai. While preparing her for a surgery, anesthesia was administered to her. However, she developed complications. She was referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai for further treatment. But the child went into a coma and subsequently died. The mother of the child alleged that it was a case of medical negligence and sought compensation. An inquiry conducted on the incident concluded that there was no medical negligence. The court took note of the fact that the child was administered a drug known as Propofol. It was not an intrinsically dangerous drug and was administered to children above three years. However, it is said that there may be implications on children with mitochondrial diseases. There was nothing on record to indicate that the deceased child had such a disease, the court said. Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that there were always instances when a drug does not accord with the body of the patient and that leads to unfortunate complications. The case on hand appears to be one such. Therefore, there was no ground to hold that the anesthetists had committed any act of medical negligence, the judge said. However, taking into account that neither the petitioner nor her child was at fault, the judge observed that when a patient was admitted to a government hospital for treatment and he / she suffers any injury or death which was not anticipated to occur in the normal course of events, even in the absence of medical negligence, the government was obliged to disburse ex-gratia to the affected party. The court said that in the case on hand, liability has to be fastened on the government. Since the institution happens to be the government institution, the State government will have to necessarily face the consequences. A corpus fund has been created by the State government. It appears that every government doctor contributes a certain sum of money towards this corpus fund and whenever compensation is directed to be paid by the courts, the amount will be drawn from this fund and paid, the judge said and directed a compensation of Rs. .5 lakh be paid to the family within eight weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pay-compensation-to-girls-family-hc/article33946652.ece

27 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||PM trying to mislead people of U.T., says Narayanasamy||Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to mislead the people of the Union Territory. Addressing a press conference on Friday, he said Mr. Modi, during his visit to Puducherry on Thursday, gave the people a wrong impression that the Centre had invested in projects worth Rs. 4,000 crore. He said that of the Rs. 2,426 crore Sattanathapuram-Nagapattinam four-lane road work, which the Prime Minister inaugurated, only 2% passed through the Karaikal region. The project was approved by the United Progressive Alliance government in 2014. The Mairie Building, inaugurated by the Prime Minister, was renovated using funds sanctioned by the World Bank. The construction of a JIPMER building at Karaikal and a minor port at Puducherry were sanctioned four years ago by the Centre on the request of the territorial administration, he said. “He completely tried to mislead the people by making it look as if all these were new projects. Tell us what the role of the Centre was in the renovation of the Mairie Building? The foundation was laid by our government, and former Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi did not allow us to inaugurate the building. No new projects were announced by the Prime Minister during his visit,” he said. The Prime Minister’s accusation of “non-performance” against his government was unfounded as the government was not allowed to execute its responsibilities by Ms. Bedi, he said. “As many as 52 Cabinet decisions were blocked or referred to the Centre by Ms. Bedi. We made a complaint against her to the Prime Minister three years ago. The Centre did not act on our complaint till recently. The government was able to function for the last four-and-a-half years with all limitations,” he said. PCC chief A.V Subramanian, who was also present, said the Congress would start accepting applications from aspiring candidates for the Assembly election on February 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-trying-to-mislead-people-of-ut-says-narayanasamy/article33946920.ece

Launching the rooftop garden initiative at the Tiruvetriyur Primary Health Centre (PHC), he said there were 59 PHCs in the district. In phase one, it had been proposed to take up rooftop garden in 20 PHCs. With fund support from the Tamil Nadu Grama Bank’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity, the project would be taken up. The objective was multi-pronged, said Mr. Dinesh and added that the greens raised in the rooftops would be given to the young pregnant women, who required iron, protein and vitamin. “Remaining healthy and fit during the pregnancy period is very important,” he noted. Apart from the doctors and para-medical teams at the PHCs, the role of the village health nurses (VHN) in monitoring the pregnant mothers was pivotal. Hence, patients, who visited the PHCs would be given the greens and the VHNs would do the follow-up, the Collector said and added that in the process of raising the rooftop garden, the premises would also be kept clean. The water required for the garden was very minimum, he said and hoped the project would benefit the womenfolk in the district so that they can make up for their deficiencies by consuming rich greens which have sufficient minerals. The respective BDOs and other designated officers would monitor the programme, he added. Deputy Director (Health) Porkodi, AD (Panchayat) V. Kesavadasan, Lead District Manager D.

27 February 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Rs. 565 crore Mettur surplus water scheme launched||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday said 24-hour three-phase electricity supply would be provided to farm pumps from April 1. “This is a government that fulfils the needs of farmers,” he said after inaugurating the Rs. 565 crore Mettur surplus water scheme here. Listing the schemes executed for farmers, he said the resolution of the Cauvery water dispute under the AIADMK government was a milestone. It was his government that had declared the Cauvery delta region a protected agricultural zone. This was the only government that had waived farm loans twice in its five-year term, he said. “Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had promised to waive off farm loans in the 2016 election manifesto, and the promise was kept soon after she entered office. Now, at the request of farmers, farm loans to the tune of Rs. 12,110 crore taken from cooperative banks have been waived. The waiver will benefit about 16.43 lakh farmers,” he said. “Most of the time, requests made during the election period are included by political parties in their manifestos. This is the only government that fulfils farmers’ requests before election,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami said the scheme to fill dry lakes with surplus water from the Mettur dam had been a long-pending demand of farmers in the region. He lauded K. Manivasan, Secretary of the Public Works Department, Collector S.A. Raman, former Chief Secretary K. Shanmugham and other officials for completing the project in a short period of time. Only 0.5 tmc of water was required to fill all the lakes and 214 cusecs would be lifted for a 30-day period. The Chief Minister said that to prevent the pollution of the Cauvery and its tributaries, the State had sought Rs. 10,711 crore in assistance from the Centre to execute the ‘Nadanthai Vazhi Cauvery’ scheme and had submitted a detailed project report. He later visited the M. Kalapatti lake, where the water was discharged.  At the requests of farmers, farm loans to the tune of Rs. 12,110 crore taken from cooperative banks have been waived||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mettur-surplus-water-scheme-launched-will-cost-rs-565-crore/article33946497.ece

27 February 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||DPCs remain saviours of farmers||Direct purchase centres (DPC) of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation have once again proved that they are the saviours of farmers in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts - be it a normal cultivation season or not - as they have almost received the entire quantity of paddy harvested during this samba/thaladi season. Around 1,000 DPCs were opened in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts during the current samba/thaladi season which was marred by unseasonal rains. According to Agriculture Department sources, farmers having their fields on high terrains in these two districts, such as Thirukattupalli, Nannilam and other areas, could harvest good quality of paddy while others ended up harvesting drenched and slightly inferior quality paddy as their fields bore the brunt of nature’s fury. The average yield was well below the normal average of 6,000 kg per hectare at several places in these two districts. It was 3,200 kg in Thanjavur district. Harvesting has been completed on 1.02 lakh hectares as on February third week out of 1.36 lakh hectares on which samba/Thaladi paddy was raised in the district. The average yield in Tiruvarur district was 2,250 kg per hectare. So far harvest has been completed on 1.32 lakh hectares out of 1.47 lakh hectares of cultivated area. Though the unseasonal rains at the start of samba/thaladi harvesting season this year presented a grim picture with respect to marketability of paddy with higher moisture content in the private market, official sources said the decision to allow procurement of paddy with a moisture content of about 20% brought a much-needed relief to the farmers. Around 4.27 lakh tonnes of paddy had been procured through 489 DPCs in Thanjavur district, and around 3.16 lakh tonnes in Tiruvarur district through a similar number of DPCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dpcs-remain-saviours-of-farmers/article33946629.ece

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Arul Vadivel, counsel of the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission, said the Commission, which had summoned 943 persons, had so far inquired 640 persons. Of the 33 persons summoned to appear before the Commission during the 25th phase of the inquiry, 26 responded to the summons and recorded their statements in the form of affidavits. During the 26th phase of the investigation, which might commence on March 15, the Commission would grill the revenue departments officials, injured policemen, doctors who treated the police personnel injured in the violence besides others. After registering case against 27 persons in connection with the violence that erupted during the anti-Sterlite agitation on May 22, 2018, the CBI, the investigating agency, had identified 44 more persons involved in violence – mostly stone pelting - and included their names in the case. Hence, the Commission would summon these 44 persons also asking them to appear before it for inquiry. IAS and the IPS officers who were serving in the district during the firing would be summoned and questioned in the last phase of the probe. Mr. Vadivel categorically stated that the Commission would summon Mr. Rajinikanth to depose before it personally to record his statement as there was no possibility of interrogating him through videoconferencing. “If Mr. Rajinikanth prefers, he may be asked to appear before the Commission in its Chennai office instead of coming to Thoothukudi,” Mr. Vadivel said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sterlite-protest-commission-to-grill-rajinikanth-in-person/article33946651.ece

27 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Ensure transparency in crop loan waiver: farmers||Officials must ensure transparency regarding crop loan waiver in primary agricultural cooperative societies, said farmers here on Friday. Raising the issue at the farmers’ grievance redress meeting here on Friday, P. Ayyakannu, president, Desiya Thennindia Nadigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, alleged irregularities in the waiver and urged the Collector to instruct the cooperative societies to put up the list of beneficiaries. M.P. Chinnadurai, district president, Tamizha Vivasayigal Sangam, said though the government announced that Rs. 12,110 crore of crop loans would be waived, the allocation of only Rs. 5,000 crore in the State budget for the purpose had created doubts in the minds of farmers. He urged the authorities to ensure that all genuine farmers received the benefit without giving room for discrimination or irregularity. While welcoming the loan waiver, P. Viswanathan, president, Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam, urged the government to take steps to waive the crop loans sanctioned by commercial banks too. Waiver certificate Earlier, Collector S. Sivarasu said loan waiver certificates were being issued to 66,881 farmers whose crop loan dues to the tune of Rs. 525.59 crore had been written off. This includes principal component of Rs. 481.59 crore and interest of Rs. 44 crore. Those who had not received the waiver certificate could approach the societies, he said. Mr. Ayyakannu urged the Public Works Department and the district administration to ensure adequate release of water into canals to meet the requirements of cash crops during summer. N. Veerasekaran, organiser, Ayyan Vaical Pasanatharar Sangam, said they were entitled for water supply for 11 months a year and the district administration should ensure adequate water supply in the irrigation canals for the annual crops such as sugarcane and banana. While welcoming the implementation of the Cauvery-Gundar river link scheme, R. Subramanian, deputy secretary,Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association, however, insisted that only flood discharges from the Cauvery should be diverted into the proposed link canal and the flow in the river should not be tapped when rains were sparse. Ayilai Siva. Suriyan, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the Communist Party of India, urged the Tangedco to give free farm power connections to all applicants. With rising fuel prices, farmers could ill afford to irrigate their fields using diesel motor pumpsets, he said. Friday’s ‘in-person’ meeting was held after a gap of a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the meeting will remain suspended for the next couple of months owing to the announcement of Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-transparency-in-crop-loan-waiver-farmers/article33946958.ece

With most of the government buses off the road, passengers who had come from different places to Tiruchi en route to their respective destinations had to wait at the Central Bus Stand without knowing when the next bus would come. The bus stand which is usually abuzz saw only private buses operating. Only a few government buses could be seen on the roads. A passenger, Ramuthai, who had come all the way from Chinnamannur in Theni district accompanied by another elderly woman to the Tiruchi central bus stand on her way to Thuraiyur said, “As there was no government bus service at Chinnamannur, we took a private bus. But we don’t know when we could reach Thuraiyur on time,” she said. Another passenger, Veeraiyan, hailing from Thanjavur who arrived here on his way to Tiruppur, said he had to take a private bus from Thanjavur to Tiruchi. Upon reaching the Central bus stand in the afternoon, Mr.Veeraiyan was on the look out for a bus to Tiruppur where he works in a private textile unit. “I am not sure as to when I will get a bus,” he said adding he must reach there before evening. There were many like these people.

27 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Microsurgery saves baby’s finger||Doctors at Kauvery Hospitals here have successfully performed a microsurgery to replant a finger of a 11-month-old baby. The baby’s finger came under a heavy object and was nearly crushed, the doctors said. The baby was brought to the hospital with its ring finger almost amputated due to the injury in January. A replantation surgery was conducted, instead of a transplantation to restore the finger. “Replantation is reattachment of a body part which is was done through microsurgery where blood vessels, tendons and nerves are repaired,” a release from the hospital said. Magnification of 25 times was used for the five-hour-long surgery. The baby is now recovering with near normal function of the finger. A microsurgical team led by S. Skanda, Senior Consultant, performed the surgery. The doctors said, for replantation to be successful, the amputated part must be brought to the hospital as early as possible. It must be wrapped in a plastic bag, put on ice and packed. The time that the amputated part is without blood supply makes a great difference in survival of the amputated part post replantation and in overall functional outcome, the doctors said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/microsurgery-saves-babys-finger/article33946959.ece

27 February 2021||Tiruvallur,TAMIL NADU||Serving selflessly, this teen started early||A few years ago, a school student from a village near Mambakkam in Tiruvallur district had to drop out and start working to provide for his family. He might have continued that way, outside the school system, but for the efforts of another student, D. Narmadha. The daughter of a daily wage earner, Ms. Narmadha went around collecting money and gave it to his mother, convincing her to send him back to school. Now, the boy is pursuing Class XI at a school in Chennai. He is not the only child that Ms. Narmadha, 17, a Class XII student of the Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School at Uthukottai, has helped. With the assistance of teachers and staff members of the Integrated Rural Community Development Society (IRCDS), she has helped quite a few children stay on in school, in the most extenuating circumstances. In recognition of her work, she was given the State Award for Girl Child Empowerment by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday. “Through some friends, I came to know that a girl of Class VIII had to stop her education owing to family pressure. I spoke to her parents, but they did not listen to me. So I took a few teachers along and spoke to them. Now she is back at school. I have also stopped child marriages after getting information through friends,” says Ms. Narmadha, a resident of Velagapuram in Tiruvallur district, who aspires to become a Collector. Not a rosy life However, life has not been rosy for Ms. Narmadha either. Her father Devan and mother Kokila are daily wage earners. “I earn Rs. 250 a day and my wife Rs. 100. We live in a remote village. But we don’t want all these factors to affect the education of our children. We want our eldest son D. Naveen Kumar, studying in college, and daughters Narmadha and her younger sister D. Dakshayani, studying in Class XI, to pursue higher education and help others,” says Mr. Devan. His daughter has been doing social work ever since she was in Class VIII. “She became a member of our IRCDS and Children Believe, an NGO, after she attended our free tuition classes. We started speaking about child rights in the class and the kids formed a group to help children in villages, and we provided training,” says P. Stephen, programme manager, IRCDS. Ms. Narmadha led the other children in stopping child marriages and rescued child workers in her village. “Her village does not even have a proper bus service to the town. Despite all odds and her family circumstances, she has been fighting steadily for child rights. Along with teachers, she has created awareness of the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme, dengue and COVID-19 in the villages. She has also mobilised laptops to help children attend online classes. She also won awards from government officials earlier,” Mr. Stephen adds. She is now striving to make her village child-friendly. “I want to ensure that all children’s rights are protected,” she says. Mr. Devan says his daughter has made him proud: “She is helping other girls come up in life. What more does a dad need?”  Her village does not even have a proper bus service to the town.

27 February 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||‘PM has no locus standi to criticise us’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday said the country would not forget the communal riots in Gujarat, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had no locus standi to criticise the DMK. Speaking at an election outreach programme at Theevanur, near Tindivanam, he took exception to Mr. Modi attacking the DMK during his campaign in Coimbatore on Thursday. Referring to Mr. Modi’s charge that the DMK, when in power, had unleashed violence in all districts and women were the worst-affected, Mr. Stalin sought to know on what basis Mr. Modi had made such an allegation. “The country has not yet forgotten the Gujarat riots of 2002. The BJP established a record in machinations and cruelty in 2002. How can Mr. Modi forget this after moving from Gujarat to Delhi,” he asked. The Prime Minister should abstain from making unfounded allegations against the DMK, Mr. Stalin said. Did Mr. Modi know about the BJP enrolling members including history-sheeters and those with criminal antecedents in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, he asked. The Prime Minister should order the Central investigation agencies to check the antecedents of those who had recently joined the party, the DMK leader added. Mr. Stalin said the Prime Minister was part of the corruption “nurtured” by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. By joining hands with them, Mr. Modi had shown that he was part of the corrupt administration, he added. Mr. Stalin asked whether the Prime Minister had forgotten the cruelty unleashed on farmers protesting against the three Central farm laws, and the brutal action taken against those who protested against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Attacks AIADMK Fiscal prudence and discipline in the State had collapsed due to the lopsided policies of the AIADMK government, This had pushed the State back by over 50 years, Mr. Stalin said. The DMK president said the hefty loans raised by the government had increased Tamil Nadu’s debt burden to Rs. 5.7 lakh crore. “With the Assembly election around the corner, the AIADMK government has finalised tenders to the tune of Rs. 40,000 crore and emptied the State’s coffers,” he alleged.  “A section of the newspapers is getting government advertisements. As a result, they have been criticising the DMK to appease the Chief Minister,” he claimed. Loan waiver Mr. Stalin termed the jewel loan waiver and another waiver for self-help groups announced by the Chief Minister in the Assembly an “election stunt”. “The Chief Minister has made these decisions, knowing full well that the election dates would be announced in the evening [on Friday]. People know this has been done for selfish reasons,” he said, speaking at the DMK’s poll outreach programme at Madurantakam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-has-no-locus-standi-to-criticise-us/article33946529.ece

27 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Are we testing enough people?||Although Karnataka has been maintaining a test positivity rate (TPR) of below 1% for the past two months, the number of daily tests have reduced to below 70,000. While health officials said that a daily target of 75,000 tests has been fixed and that district officials have been told to ramp up testing, the number of tests have hovered around 60,000 per day in the last one month. The number of tests rose to 76,799 on Friday after a long time. In fact, the number of tests started falling after the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination on January 16. From over one lakh a day, the number hovered around 90,000 till January-end. This further reduced to 50,000 in the first week of February when the State, based on recommendations of the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), fixed a target of 75,000 tests per day. The numbers have slightly gone up in the last one week, hovering around 65,000. State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra told The Hindu that although the indicative daily target of 75,000 is not being met, the State was testing far more than the recommended 10 contacts for every positive case detected. “For a case load of around 500, we are testing nearly 65,000 people, which is a comfortable testing rate as of now,” he said. Stating that the focus now is on targeted testing, the Commissioner said, “We have issued an advisory asking officials to do more random testing in places where there are large crowds. Besides, all contacts of positive patients, ILI and SARI cases will be mandatorily tested.” He said testing will be ramped up further based on the emerging scenario. However, sources said the swab collectors are finding it hard to meet the target, mainly because people are hesitant. While the focus at health facilities has shifted towards vaccination, the number of people eligible has also decreased, sources said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said it is difficult to find primary and secondary contacts of positive patients besides those with ILI/SARI symptoms and other eligible persons to be tested now. “With most being asymptomatic, they resist testing. Also, with the number of cases coming down, there is complacency. But, we cannot afford to stop following COVID-19 precautions now when the outbreak of a second wave is not far away,” he said. “There should be strict enforcement of rules in weddings, social, political and religious gatherings to avoid another surge. People attending these events can be silent super-spreaders (as most are asymptomatic). Mask culture, which is gradually weaning away, should become a part of our life now,” Dr. Manjunath said adding that those coming from high-risk States should volunteer to get tested. Referring to the recent massive protest by private school managements and teachers, Dr. Manjunath said all teachers should now be tested. V. Ravi, TAC member and former senior professor and head of neurovirology at NIMHANS, said as of the now the State’s testing rate is comfortable when compared with the number of new cases reported daily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/are-we-testing-enough-people/article33946427.ece
27 February 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Against odds, BSY manages to stay afloat politically||When Bharatiya Janata Party veteran and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa celebrated his 77th birthday in February 2020, not many leaders, including those close to him, were confident that he would remain in the office for one more year. That is because the BJP central leadership had begun the process of searching for an alternative to replace the ageing leader. Now the BJP’s Lingayat strongman, who is celebrating his 78th birthday on Saturday, has upset political calculations of many leaders by continuing to stay in power and proving that he is a political survivor. No alternative It is not that the party high command has set aside its plans to find an alternative leader. But the leadership is yet to zero in on any leader, considering it is not easy to find an alternative  in the State which has its own divisions in terms of caste and regional identities. “Everyone knows that Mr. Yediyurappa is getting old and the party needs an alternative leader who can revitalise administrative machinery through fresh ideas and energy. But it appears that so far it has not been possible to find such a dynamic leader,” observed a senior leader from the party State unit. “But it does not mean that Mr. Yediyurappa is completely safe as the sword of Damocles is hanging on his head since the central leadership has kept a watch on him in the wake of allegations of groupism, corruption, and nepotism,” the leader added. Mr. Yediyurappa’s political detractors feel that any of these allegations transforming into a legal tangle may expedite the process of finding a successor. But his supporters hope that the party may not toy with the idea of replacing him if he manages to complete at least one more year in the remaining term of about two years. But there is a curiosity in both the camps about the high command’s next move. Missed chances There is a feeling among a section of the party strategists that several leaders let go off the opportunity given to them by the party to grow politically. “The opportunity for political growth started for many Ministers right from 2008. While some actually did well as Ministers, they could not build a political constituency,” observed a strategist. Apart from the ability to understand the pulse of people, Mr. Yediyurappa’s advantage is that his detractors do not want to lose the government in the political tussle. In fact, the importance of being in power for the BJP was underscored by party national general secretary in charge of Karnataka Arun Singh, who recently asked Mr. Yediyurappa’s detractors to forget individual differences in the interest of the party ideology as the government had implemented and brought about laws in tune with party’s “core ideology” such as the anti-cow slaughter Act. Carrot and stick On its part, the high command appears to have adopted a carrot and stick approach as it has sent a message earlier by ignoring Mr. Yediyurappa’s fervent plea for ministerial expansion on the one hand and trying to pacify his detractors on the other. The game of suspense has continued with respect to leadership change as the party high command has kept both the pro- and anti-Yediyurappa camps on tenterhooks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/against-odds-bsy-manages-to-stay-afloat-politically/article33946456.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Namma Cargo launched; service to operate in 88 taluks in State||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday launched the ‘Namma Cargo’ services at the Vidhana Soudha, where the State road transport corporations, barring the BMTC, will transport parcels to generate more revenue. The service is being implemented across 109 bus stations in Karnataka and select locations in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, said a press release. The Transport Department estimates that luggage revenue generation would go up to Rs. 70 crore to Rs. 80 crore a year. Operations by the three road transport corporations — KSRTC, NWKRTC, and NEKRTC — cumulatively cover 51 lakh km with 14,500 schedules and carry 38 lakh passengers every day. In the first phase of the initiative, Namma Cargo will operate in 88 taluks in Karnataka and 21 inter-State locations. The Transport Department also aims to expand the service to provide home deliveries. Contest Incidentally, the name, ‘Namma Cargo’ was the winning entry for a contest that the KSRTC had launched to suggest names for the parcel and cargo services. Relief The family of the seven employees who died after contracting COVID-19 were given Rs. 30 lakh compensation. “Action is taken to pay the compensation to the remaining employees who succumbed to the disease,” said the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/namma-cargo-launched-service-to-operate-in-88-taluks-in-state/article33946458.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kaggadasapura lake rejuvenation begins||Kaggadasapura lake in east Bengaluru, crucial to the Bellandur-Varthur series as an upstream lake, has finally got a shot at survival with rejuvenation work being kicked off on Friday. Taken up under the Nava Nagarothana grants, work is expected to include improvements to the lake bed, wetland and sewage diversion. C.V. Raman Nagar MLA S. Raghu said the first step will be to desilt the lake, which is likely to take around 45 days. “After that, we will have to plan sewage diversion, as sewage from all the surrounding areas is coming into the lake. We have kept a six-month timeline for the project,” he said. He added that work on the upstream Bhairasandra lake was started two months ago. The condition of the lake has been a bone of contention between local authorities and residents, with the latter alleging lack of upkeep. In fact, soon after the frothing of Bellandur and Varthur lakes made international headlines, frothing was noticed in Kaggadasapura lake too, leading to questions about the efficiency of rejuvenation efforts for the downstream lakes when the upstream lakes were in a poor state. In 2019, a multi-department survey of Kaggadasapura lake and the adjoining Bhairasandra lake was carried out to check the extent of encroachment following directions from the Lokayukta. According to the Koliwad Committee report, 3 acres and 34 guntas of both the lakes have been encroached upon by both private and public parties. Suresh N.R., convener of United Bengaluru, said they had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta in 2017 after they found evidence of encroachment in both lakes. United Bengaluru had alleged that the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has spent crores of rupees to beautify the area around Kaggadasapura lake by building bunds, a play area and seating area, but had done nothing to rejuvenate the water body or enhance the water holding capacity. Mr. Raghu said, “The extent of encroachment of Kaggadasapura lake is over 2.5 acres. We have already warned the encroachers to voluntarily remove the structures, failing which the Urban DC will get them removed,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kaggadasapura-lake-rejuvenation-begins/article33946420.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Trucks go off roads||More than two lakh trucks across Karnataka went off the roads in response to the Bharat Bandh call given by traders and the transport sector against the recent fuel price increase. While truckers had threatened to block highways in the State, the police did not allow any road blocks, which left traffic unaffected. G.R. Shanmugappa, General Secretary, South Zone Motor Transporters Welfare Association, who led the one-day strike said it was peaceful without any law and order issues. “This was a one-day token strike. But we have decided to go on an indefinite strike from March 15, if our demands including tax cuts for fuel are not met by then,” he said. Business mostly remained unaffected. “Trucks that were on the road Thursday night reached the destinations on Friday morning. They resumed plying on Friday after 6 p.m. So business remained unaffected,” said a prominent trader. Traders had announced support to the bandh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/trucks-go-off-roads/article33946433.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Criminal case against editor of online portal||The Chitradurga police have registered a criminal case against G. Mahantesh, editor, The File, an online portal over publication of a report. The complainant, associated with Muruga Mutt, Chitradurga, has taken objection to the report that spoke about a court declining bail to the brother of the seer in a rape case. The report also had the photo of the seer. The complainant contended that the seer was in no way related to the case and the report was “malicious”. The Chitradurga Police have booked Mr. Mahantesh under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and under Section 505 (1) (b) of the IPC for “intent to cause fear or alarm to the public, whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against public tranquillity” and Section 507 of the IPC for Criminal Intimidation. Mr. Mahantesh termed the FIR “an intimidation tactic” and said he had complained to the Press Council of India. “The sections that the FIR lists are clearly unrelated to the grievance of the complainant. Moreover, they never even contacted me, the editor, over their grievance. Right away they have booked a criminal case, which is not a good precedent in the State,” he said, adding he would fight it out legally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/criminal-case-against-editor-of-online-portal/article33946464.ece

The “Gold Mohur” was minted at Bijapur's Dar-uz-zafar Mint. “This is the first time that the existence of the coin has come to be known. It has not been listed anywhere,” auction organiser Rajender Maru of Marudhar Arts said. The floor auction will be held on Saturday and Sunday during the numismatic exhibition being organised by Marudhar Arts. According to Mr. Maru, Kam Baksh, who was the Governor of Deccan in the Mughal empire had minted this coin during his stay in Bijapur. “Very few Mughal rulers had come till Bijapur and minted coins,” said Mr. Maru. Kam Baksh ruled very briefly in 1707-1708 after the succession war in the post-Aurangzeb death. The coin – weighing 10.9 grams and measuring 22.5 mm – has Persian legend neatly arranged in four calligraphic division.

27 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Foundation stone laid for completing works at Bairadi Kere||Nearly four years since taking up the works of developing the Bairadi Kere, a waterbody off the busy Mangaluru-Bengaluru national highway in the city, Minister for Environment, Ecology and Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar on Friday laid the foundation stone to complete the pending works related to the lake development.

Apart from building retaining walls, the other works taken up included dredging, building a jogging track, a garden, and a small swimming pool. In the last four years, retaining walls on the three sides of the lake has been built. The wall on the western side, where there are a few tiled houses and a residential apartment, has been built partly because of litigation by the tiled houses residents. On Friday, Mr. Yogeshwar laid the foundation stone for works estimated at Rs. 99.8 lakh that includes silt removal and de-watering, building granite stone masonry wall, laying an inter-locking pavement, building compound wall and drain, and laying steel railing. An official from MUDA said that the decision is yet to be taken on how to rehabilitate the tiled houses nearby. The Minister planted a few saplings of fruit-bearing trees to launch the drive of MUDA and Green Tigers, a body of green enthusiasts, of greening Bairadi and 16 other water bodies that the MUDA is rejuvenating. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Yogeshwar said the Tourism Department will release Rs. 25 lakh for installation of seats and providing other basic amenities for tourists at the park. The department will work towards improvement of tourism facilities in Dakshina Kannada and harness its tourism potential. Mangaluru City South MLA D.

27 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||This green warrior fights a lone battle against throwing trash into Netravathi||After a week-long awareness campaign by two NGOs to dissuade people from throwing trash on the flanks of NH 66 close to the Netravathi Bridge, a green warrior has continued to wage a lone battle against garbage dumping at the site. Anti Pollution Drive (APD) and Hasiru Dala conducted the drive from January 18. Continuing the mission, Nagaraj Raghav Anchan from Bajal stands on the flanks of NH 66 (just before the Netravathi Bridge from Ullal side) from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. holding placards in Kannada and English. Asked how long he was planning to continue this, he said, “Till the Mangaluru City Corporation installs CCTV cameras on about 1 km stretch from Kallapu to Netravathi Bridge.” MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar has told Mr. Anchan that tenders were floated for CCTV installation and the work would be done soon. A Hasiru Dala warrior, Mr. Anchan runs a stationery material shop at Bajal and was also actively involved as recycling coordinator with Ocean Plastics. “I was already operated on my legs and the back when I was a sportsperson; yet I continue to accomplish the mission,” he said. While people have almost stopped throwing garbage into the backwaters of Netravathi following the campaign, old trash continue to smear road flanks and river bank. NGOs will undertake a clean-up drive on Sunday to clear the backlog, Mr. Anchan said adding otherwise all the trash would join the river. Many motorists from the suburbs travelling to Mangaluru in the morning hours, who used to throw garbage earlier, have stopped the same. Mr. Anchan said a majority of those littering were working couple who would leave home early while garbage collection by local administration was done at around 11 a.m. The other reason was that local administrations were collecting Rs. 100 per month from households to lift garbage. He spoke to panchayats who agreed to collect the garbage fee while collecting property taxes. Ullal CMC was already doing this. “You feel the pinch when paying directly from the pocket; if it was indirectly collected, you won’t mind,” he reasoned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/this-green-warrior-fights-a-lone-battle-against-throwing-trash-into-netravathi/article33946830.ece

27 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘Mysuru MP should work on tribal development’, say activists||Social activists working on tribal development have lashed out at Mysuru MP Pratap Simha for his remark that adivasis converting to Christianity cannot avail themselves of government benefits. Mr. Simha had made the remark during the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting on Wednesday. M.B. Prabhu, who works on tribal issues based out of Veeranahosahalli on the fringes of Nagarahole, said that the statement of the MP was not legally tenable. “If adivasis converting to other religions were to be deprived of government benefits that is due to them because of their Scheduled Tribe status, then the entire north-eastern part of the country and central India would be affected.’ The MP’s statement is codemnable as it goes against the doctrine of social justice and equality enshrined in the Constitution and the freedom to follow the religion of one’s choice, said Mr. Prabhu. “His argument does not stand legal scrutiny and instead of worrying about conversion the MP should focus on tribal development’’, he added. Development through Education (DEED), a Hunsur-based NGO also working on tribal issues, echoed similar views. S. Sreekanth of DEED said no credence need to be attached to Mr. Simha’s statement as the status of the adivasis and their backwardness does not change merely because of their adherence to another religion which, he said, was a matter of individual choice and faith. Mr. Sreekanth said there are far more important issues plaguing the adivasis living in the taluks of Hunsur, H.D.Kote and Periyapatana as elsewhere in the State and Mr. Simha should resolve them first. Listing out the issues threatening the existence of adivasis, the two social workers pointed out that the State government had rejected the applications of more than 5000 tribals seeking benefits under the Forest Rights Act from Mysuru district. The MP should apply his mind to such critical issues instead of making statements that tend to damage social harmony, according to the activists. Mr. Sreekanth said nothing prevents the MP from urging the State government to take up the rehabilitation of more than 3,400 tribal families in Hunsur and H.D .Kote as per the recommendations of a committee established by the High Court of Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-mp-should-work-on-tribal-development-say-activists/article33946863.ece

In response to the one-day strike call given by various truckers’ associations, the Mysuru District Lorry Owners’ Association, with the support of various other goods transporters’ associations here such as RMP Lorry Owners’ Association, suspended goods transport and the truck owners staged a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office condemning the skyrocketing petrol and diesel prices.

The association urged the Centre to take immediate steps for restricting the hike in fuel prices. The truck owners were facing losses with fuel prices going out of control. While seeking the government’s intervention to reduce the premiums for third party insurance, he said the hike in highway toll fees had also affected truckers.

27 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Former Mayors call for suspension of Tanveer Sait||The rift in the Congress over its alliance with JD(S) has led to divisions in the Mysuru unit with two former Mayors belonging calling for suspension of former Minister and Narasimharaja Assembly constituency MLA Tanveer Sait. Former Mayors Arif Hussain and Ayub Khan addressed a press conference alongside Mysuru City Congress Committee president R. Murthy on Friday, accusing Mr. Sait of joining hands with former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy to “humiliate” former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Taking exception to the sloganeering against Mr. Siddaramaiah in front of Mr. Sait’s residence on Friday, Mr. Hussain said Mr. Siddaramaiahwas the “voice of Muslims”. “It is because of Mr. Siddaramaiah that the minorities in the State have been able to hold their head high.” Though Mr. Siddaramaiah had instructed Mr. Sait to secure the post of Mayor for Congress as per the understanding with JD(S), Mr. Sait had brokered a ‘deal’ with Mr. Kumaraswamy to not only hand over to the latter’s party the post of Mayor, but also have people shout slogans against Mr. Siddaramaiah, Mr. Hussain alleged. The entire Congress was with Mr. Siddaramaiah, he said. Deputy Mayor Anwar Baig was also present at the press conference. Mr. Ayub Khan said he and Mr. Hussain had opposed Mr. Sait’s decision taking in the Council to support the JD(S) candidate and walked out when the voting for the post of Mayor was taken up. “Before we entered the Council hall for the Mayoral polls, we were informed that we had to vote in favour of Congress candidate Shanthakumari. But, when Mr. Sait asked us to vote for JD (S), we suspected a conspiracy and walked out”, Mr. Khan said. Both Mr. Khan and Mr. Hussain reported the matter to KPCC Working President R. Dhruvanarayan, who had been deputed to the polls as KPCC observer. “Even he was not aware that the Congress was supporting the candidate of the JD(S)”, he said and added that their efforts to contact Mr. Siddaramaiah over the phone went in vain. The instructions of the party should come from either the KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah or the KPCC observer. “When none of them had taken such a decision, we did not cast our vote. The rest of the Congress corporators did as per the directions given by Mr. Sait as most of them are first-time corporators and Mr. Sait is a senior leader of the party in Mysuru, who is not only a former Minister, but also a five-time MLA”, Mr. Khan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/former-mayors-call-for-suspension-of-tanveer-sait/article33946871.ece
27 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||MCC urged to constitute ward committees||A section of citizens and social activists have demanded the constitution of ward committees within the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) limits. Addressing a press conference here on Friday the citizens including G.R. Vidyaranya, Malavika Gubbivani, and.Bhamy V .Shenoy said this should be constituted as per the KMC Act, 1976 and the 74th amendment of the Constitution. The activists said this was imperative for people’s participation in a democracy to ensure transparency and accountability in administration. The demand for area sabha and ward committee is not an old one and several efforts have been made in the past 10 years, according to the social activists who alleged that the MCC has been unresponsive so far, forcing them to approach the High Court. Explaining the background to the PIL filed in the High Court, the activists said multiple requests were made during the last 10 years to the MCC Commissioner and the elected representatives to constitute the area sabhas and wad committees. Mysuru even experimented with a model ward committee and even a ward parliament due to activism by some active citizens and an MLC. But it got stuck only with solid waste management and was never institutionalised as a citizens’ participatory platform. The High Court has admitted the writ petition and the next hearing is scheduled for March 13, according to the activists. “We are confident that a favourable verdict will be given by the High Court and MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag will implement the same’’, said Ms. Malavika Gubbivani. “The Constitution has given us a golden opportunity to get our ward and area developed as per our requirement and we should not waste this opportunity’’, she added. Another activist, Shobhana Sambasivan, spoke of long standing problems in parts of the city which have not been solved and said the constitution of the ward committee can help resolve the issues and also usher in transparency and accountability in the working of the MCC. In the meanwhile, the activists have appealed to the people of Mysuru to take the concept forward and those interested in involving themselves in the area sabha or ward committee activities can call 7259936111.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-urged-to-constitute-ward-committees/article33946865.ece

27 February 2021||MYSURU/BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Row in Cong. over tie-up with JD(S) for Mysuru mayoral polls||The alliance between the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) in the recent mayoral polls in Mysuru has sparked off a row in the Congress with the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and a section of partymen strongly disapproving of the tie-up, which had come by ceding the coveted post of Mayor. The former Minister Tanveer Sait, who had confabulated with JD(S) leaders for continuing the “secular” alliance in the hung Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) council, as well as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar had reportedly come under fire for forging the partnership without discussing the matter with Mr. Siddaramaiah, who is from Mysuru. Supporters protest Soon after rumours began to float that Mr. Sait will be served with a notice for his role in stitching together the alliance, his supporters gathered in front of his house in Mysuru and shouted slogans against Mr. Siddaramaiah and the former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar. Mr. Sait, however, justified his decision to align with the JD(S) by “sacrificing” the post of the Mayor for the larger objective of the party to prevent the “communal” BJP from coming to power.  Sait to give explanation Though he had not received any notice from the party, Mr. Sait said he would give a detailed explanation. He sought to know whether questions had been raised by party leaders on the alliance per se or on the Congress ceding the post of the Mayor even though it was the party’s turn to occupy the post as per an understanding with the JD(S) after the 2018 polls to the MCC council. Mr. Sait claimed that Mr. Siddaramaiah himself had entrusted him with the responsibility of holding talks with the JD(S). On the day of the mayoral elections, Mr. Sait said he desperately tried to speak to Mr. Siddaramaiah over the phone, but in vain. However, he said, he had kept the KPCC president informed about the developments during the polls. Mr. Siddaramaiah and some leaders identified with his camp had reportedly questioned Mr. Shivakumar about the tie-up with the JD(S) while describing the party as an “unreliable partner”. A section of Congress leaders not only claimed that Mr. Siddaramaiah had been kept in the dark about the talks with the JD(S), they also feared that the truck would provide a weapon to the BJP to brand the regional party as the “B team” of the Congress. Report sought Mr. Shivakumar reportedly told Congress leaders that he was unaware about the reasons for the party’s failure to secure the Mayor’s post. He admitted that he had spoken to JD(S) leader from Mysuru S.R. Mahesh with regard to the alliance and not with the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. KPCC working president R. Dhruvanarayan, who had been deputed to the mayoral polls as the party’s observer, has been asked to submit a report on the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/row-in-cong-over-tie-up-with-jds-for-mysuru-mayoral-polls/article33946453.ece

The South Western Railways has entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MoU) with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to undertake the restoration. As per the plan, the stations – Devanahalli, Doddajala, Avathihalli and Nandi Halt on the KSR Bengaluru-Chikkaballapur-Kolar railway line – will be restored to their former glory. The Bengaluru-Chikkaballapur light railway (narrow gauge - 62 km) has a rich history. It is the earliest example of private-public partnership. The railway line was constructed by an Indian company under a guarantee from the then princely state of Mysore. Construction was sanctioned in 1909 and completed gradually in sections. The Chikkaballapur to Yelahanka stretch was opened in 1917, and the full route up to Bengaluru in 1918. South Western Railways said that work will be undertaken in two stages. In the first stage, INTACH will undertake the renovation, restoration and preservation of the station buildings in consultation with Railways, and identify partners for funding the initiative under CSR. In the second phase, railway stations in Rajanukunte, Oorgaum, Champion and Chintamani will be developed as heritage railway stations. In a press release, SWR said that there are plans to develop an art-cum-cultural-cum convention centre at Doddajala. An ‘interpretation centre’ for monuments, a café or snack counter at Devanahalli station are also on the cards. At Avathihalli, SWR plans to build a silk museum and resource centre along with a park. Nandi Halt station will have a rail museum, café, restaurant, cultural performance centre, pop-up weekend craft markets, and an amphitheatre. Last year, rail enthusiasts and heritage lovers carried out a campaign demanding that SWR restore its historical structures. Meera Iyer of INTACH Bengaluru Chapter said, “That entire region is so full of history, from megaliths to millennium-old temples to medieval forts to the birthplaces of some very important historical figures. It is also famous for the sericulture industry. It would be fabulous if these could be showcased.” Some buildings are currently not in use, such as Devanahalli, while others like Doddajala are used only for a couple of hours a day. “So, along with conservation and restoration of the station buildings, there also needs to be a suitable and sustainable use for the station buildings, something which is acceptable to all parties concerned.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/swr-joins-hands-with-intach-to-restore-heritage-railway-structures-of-colonial-era/article33946424.ece

Shivaram Karanth Layout of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). At a press conference on Friday, chairperson of the committee Justice A.V. Chandrashekar said that those who had built buildings prior to August 3, 2018, can submit their records online or by visiting help centres that will be set up for this purpose. To facilitate the process, the committee has launched an online web portal (jcc-skl.in). A decision has been taken to open five help centres. Starting March 1, 2021, the help centre at Government Urdu Primary School, Medi Agrahara, Vaderahalli Panchayat will start accepting applications. The remaining four centres – a community hall in Somashettyhalli; Government School Byalakere; Dr. Ambedkar community hall at Singanayakanahalli; and BDA head office at Kumara Park West – will be opened at a later stage. The BDA had issued a preliminary notification for formation of the layout on December 30, 2008. It was challenged in the Karnataka High Court, which quashed the preliminary notification on November 26, 2014. The BDA challenged the High Court order in the Supreme Court. The SC cancelled the HC order, and directed the BDA to issue final notification for formation of the layout. The apex court had also appointed a committee, headed by Justice A.V. Chandrashekar, with former DGP of the State Dr. S.T. Ramesh and former BDA commissioner Jayakar Jerome as members. To protect the interest of people, who lawfully built houses prior to final notification, the committee has been asked to submit a report after looking into requests of owners of the buildings and review documents submitted by them. Justice Chandrashekar said that final notification was issued for formation of the layout in 17 villages of Yeshwanthpur Hobli, Hesaraghatta Hobli and Yelahanka Hobli of Bengaluru North taluk for 3,546 acres. As per satellite imagery and the BDA study, around 7,500 buildings have come up on the notified land between 2008 and 2018, he said. When asked about the timeline to submit the report, Justice Chandrshekar said, “We have been asked to submit a report in six months. It is difficult to say when we will complete the task as it involves various works, such as verifying documents submitted by the owners and inspection.” To help the committee in the process, a decision has been taken to rope in the service of retired BDA and police department officials. More than 40 law students have been trained to assist the general public in submission of records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shivaram-karanth-layout-panel-to-accept-documents-for-buildings-on-notified-land/article33946431.ece

Further, the statement pointed out that while the Bengaluru police accused two former Congress councillors of conspiracy, the NIA’s chargesheet was silent on their role, blaming SDPI entirely. “Even the aggrieved MLA Akhanda Sreenivasa Murthy believes R.

27 February 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Farmers put on alert over fall armyworm infestation||The Agriculture Department has issued an advisory to farmers in Wayanad district in the wake of the infestation of fall armyworm (FAW), which causes extensive damage to crops. The pest attack has been reported on maize and plantain cultivations in various parts of the district, including Perikkallur and Pulpally in Panamaram block panchayat and Edavaka in Mananthavady block panchayat. “The invasive pest damaged maize crop in various parts of the country. It was found that it has damaged the plantain crop in the district, especially the nendran variety of plantain,” said Principal Agriculture Officer Sajimon K. Varghese. The lepidopteran pest, indigenous to the Americas and spreading across the world, migrated to India in June 2018. It feeds on leaves and stems of more than 80 plant species, causing major damage to crops such as maize, rice, sorghum and sugarcane, vegetable crops, and cotton. In other districts The pest attack on maize was reported in some parts of Thrissur and Malappuram districts two years ago, and it was brought under control. However, a recent survey in the district in December found that it had attacked two-to-four-month-old plantain crop, said Mr. Sajimon. According to the officer, a female moth lays 100 to 200 eggs inside the whorls of leaves. The worms that come off the eggs eat the lower portion of leaves, and the colour of the leaves turns from green to white. If farmers found such infestation, they should contact the nearby Krishi Bhavan or the phone numbers 9495756549 or 9447530961, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-put-on-alert-over-fall-armyworm-infestation/article33946743.ece

Two KFD cases have been reported in the district this year so far. Three persons had died of the disease and 29 KFD cases were reported in the district last year. As the viral disease, transmitted to humans through a species of ticks found on monkeys, had been mainly reported from hamlets adjacent to forest on the Kerala-Karnataka border, the public should be vigilant against the disease, especially during the peak period from February to April, she said. The Health Department officials should adopt all possible steps, such as intensifying the vaccination drive and organising awareness programmes in villages during the period to tackle any outbreak of the disease, Ms. Abdulla said. Medicine stocks Medicines, including antibiotics, and fluids should be stocked to meet any emergency. The personal protection measures include gloves, gumboots, and lotions to be supplied to the people in the KFD-hit areas, she said.

He was speaking after inaugurating the newly constructed Mambaram bridge through videoconferencing on Friday. The Chief Minister said the government had been able to move forward with emphasis on infrastructure development despite the floods and the COVID-19 outbreak. Although work on the new bridge had been under way earlier, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government took over land for the approach road after it came to power. There was a delay in changing the layout, as the structure came up over a National Waterway. Tourism He said the new bridge fulfilled the long-standing need of the residents of Mambaram. The bridge would be useful for people from other districts to easily access the tourist destinations in Kannur, he added. The Chief Minister said before the LDF government came to power, vegetable production in the State was six lakh tonnes. But at present, it is 15 lakh tonnes. Kerala has become self-sufficient in vegetable production. The State will also become self-sufficient in milk and egg production. Such products will be sold through co-operative societies. Agricultural products will soon be exported from the State. The aim of the government was to bring people together and enable development, said Mr. Vijayan, adding that the government had fulfilled the promises made in the poll manifesto. The Mambaram bridge, built across the Anjarakandi river on Kannur-Koothuparambu road, connects Peralassery and Vengadu panchayats in Dharmadam constituency. An adjoining road of 200 m to Kannur and 92 m to Koothuparambu have been constructed along with the bridge. Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran presided over the function.

He was speaking through video conference after inaugurating the water taxi allotted at Parassinikkadavu as part of the cruise project. ‘Thacholi Othenan’ The water taxi named “Thacholi Othenan” was designed by the Kerala Tourism Department and Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) as part of the project. Malabar had great potential for tourism. However, full advantage of the possibilities could not be taken till now, Mr. Surendran said. With the opening of the Kannur airport such possibilities had increased. It was in this context that the government had formulated a massive tourism project connecting the rivers of Kasaragod and Kannur districts for the development of tourism in North Malabar. Rs. 325-crore project Mr. Surendran said the project was being jointly implemented by the Central and State governments at a cost of Rs. 325 crore. The government planned to inaugurate the first phase of the project this year, the Minister said. He said the State government had sanctioned Rs. 4.67 crore for the purchase of six boats. One of these boats was built and given to the tourism department. The KSINC had informed the government that one boat would be available in March and the remaining four in May. Six persons The taxi, which is eight metres long and 2.08 metres wide, can carry six persons besides the driver. Earlier, a water taxi with a speed of 10 kmph was launched at Parassinikkadavu. It was the first water taxi in Malabar and the second one in Kerala. James Mathew, MLA, presided over the function held at Parassinikkadavu boat terminal.

Twelve projects are complete, including a small pilot stretch of the smart road concept on Abraham Madamakkal Road, at a cost of around Rs. 100 crore. The completed projects include a roof-top solar panel project on 28 buildings, integrated command, control and communication centre, e-health system for the Ernakulam General Hospital, scheme to distribute household bins for waste segregation, open air theatre at Fort Kochi, and the renovation of a stretch of the walkway at Marine Drive. Major projects like the Rs. 166-crore sewage treatment system for West Kochi are hanging in the balance, with some hesitation from residents. Shanmugham Road, Park Avenue Road, and the stretch from Jos Junction to Durbar Hall are also awaiting smart road status, with underground ducts for cables, pavements, and cycle lanes. Minor bridges in West Kochi and the construction of new blocks at the General Hospital, Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital, and the Mattancherry Women and Child Hospital are also in the implementation stage, officials at CSML said. While CSML was formed in 2016, a consultant came on board only by the end of 2017, and work began to be tendered and awarded in 2018, they added. The project is being implemented in divisions one to five of West Kochi and divisions 62, 66 and 67 in the central area of the city. Road work has been progressing at an excruciatingly slow pace, according to Kochi Corporation councillors. Manu Jacob, who represents Ernakulam North, said roads were dug simultaneously at multiple spots for drain work in the division, and work was left incomplete. “In the Cloth Bazaar area, the road was dug up for around three months, inconveniencing shop owners,” he added. Antony Kureethara, councillor representing Fort Kochi, also pointed out that the work in his division was progressing slowly. “It has been over a year since they took up drain work on KB Jacob Road. That has reached nowhere,” he said. Some projects also turned out to be half-baked, like the cycle track that was painted onto Park Avenue and Abraham Madamakkal roads. “These tracks are useless. Strangely, on the stretch between Marine Drive and the High Court, the track is right beside the median, which is unsafe,” said Joby Raju, founder of Pedal Force Kochi, a group of cyclists. Besides, it looks like it has turned into a convenient parking spot, he added. “Some designs are clearly not smart enough,” said Shagzil Khan, another cyclist. “The idea was good, but it needs to be developed. In a meeting with officials, we were told the cycle track was a pilot project that would be better designed and implemented soon,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/major-csml-projects-hang-in-balance/article33946753.ece

27 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Under-age riders give road users the jitters||Under-age drivers and numerous other youths are pooling in money to purchase power-packed two-wheelers, often without the knowledge of their parents, and use them for racing on city roads, Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) officials have said. Enforcement personnel have come across the practice during routine vehicle inspection. “It was found that a group of higher secondary school students had pooled in their pocket money to purchase a used motorbike which was put up for sale in OLX. They used to park it beside the road, so that parents would not come to know of they moving around on a two-wheeler. They also made four keys so that they could take turns in using the bike,” said Shaji Madhavan, Enforcement RTO (Ernakulam). “We were in for another surprise on learning that the sale was not entered in the vehicle’s registration certificate. The original owner and the used vehicle dealer will be questioned. Parents must understand that under-age driving attracts a fine of Rs. 25,000 that has to be remitted in court. In addition, minors who were caught driving vehicles could be produced before the juvenile court,” he added. Awareness about the practice has made people give tip-offs to enforcement personnel. It helped officials apprehend around 40 motorists recently near Cusat. They included teenaged youths, including girls, who were charged for offences such as riding triple on two-wheelers. The MVD has also roped in drivers of school buses to be on alert for students wearing school uniform found driving bikes and cars, it is learnt. Road users have to be wary of under-age drivers as well as others who lack driving skills and maturity, said Ernakulam RTO P.M. Shabeer. “Instances of youth driving ‘superbikes’ in a reckless manner are increasing. Accidents can happen when they borrow such bikes and drive around, since it takes many days to get accustomed to their power and brakes,” he added. The MVD is devising an action plan to keep tabs on such drivers, for which two Assistant Motor Vehicle Inspectors have been deputed. They will observe roads that such people use for racing. Ultimately, such rider groups must bring in some self-regulation, since they are endangering the life of other road users too, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/under-age-riders-give-road-users-the-jitters/article33946764.ece

27 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Police expose narcotic trade centred on rented spaces||The seizure of two loads of banned tobacco products at Perumbavoor earlier this week seems to have exposed a thriving business model centred on rented shop rooms and houses. The Perumbavoor police had on Sunday seized banned tobacco products from 12 shop rooms that eventually filled up two tipper lorries during a drive focussed on rented rooms on the direction of K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). Since then, Mr. Karthik has formed a special investigation team (SIT) led by Deputy Superintendent of Police N.R. Jayaraj to probe the incident. “We are after the organised network behind the large-scale smuggling in of tobacco products. While the products are largely smuggled in from other States, their business would not be possible without the cooperation of locals,” said Mr. Karthik. Several shop rooms, which were closed down following the lockdown and have not opened since then, seem to be easily available for such clandestine activities. “The 12 rooms seem to have been converted into storerooms for banned tobacco products, which were then surreptitiously retrieved in the night for sale in smaller lots,” said Rahul Raveendran, Station House Officer, Perumbavoor, and a member of the SIT. Perumbavoor being the hub of the migrant community that is largely dependent on tobacco products, the business model seems to make sense. The police have identified nearly 50 different types of tobacco products popular among migrant workers. Since the seizure from shuttered shop rooms, the police have expanded their surveillance to line buildings with multiple rooms rented out to migrant workers, and that has paid rich dividends. The police seized another half-a-load of banned tobacco products from three such rented houses and have identified more such houses for further inspection. They plan to arraign in the building owners as co-accused to force them to look beyond mere profit while renting out space. The police, however, remain handicapped by the relatively minor punishment that entails the seizure of tobacco products. “We have destroyed tobacco products worth over Rs. 50 lakh in over a week. Inflicting such a loss, thus making the business unfeasible, seems to be the only viable way to deal with it,” Mr. Raveendran added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-expose-narcotic-trade-centred-on-rented-spaces/article33946766.ece

The public sector Nadukkara Pack House at Muvattupuzha aims to export at least 2,000 tonnes of nendran bananas each year. The European Union presents huge market opportunities for Indian banana producers and exporters owing to the shortage of supply from its traditional suppliers like Latin American countries. It is hoped that the success of the project will pave the way for new market prospects, by integrating Kerala in the global value chain and thereby ensuring farmers better and consistent prices. The reduced logistics cost though the sea route, which is 1/7th of the cost of air transportation, is expected to augment the income of farmers by 20%. In the latest export, around 10 tonnes of banana are intended to be shipped to London. The bunches that will be harvested on February 27 will be transported to the APEDA Certified Pack House at Nadukkara. After the packhouse treatments, the produce will be packed in cartons, pre-cooled and flagged off from the Pack House on March 5. It will be shipped after necessary port clearance to London Gateway Port.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nendran-banana-to-be-shipped-to-europe/article33946760.ece

This causes accidents at the curve near the metro station (where nine youths died in accidents during the past six months). These establishments must rebuild their compound walls, while the posts must be relocated. This will considerably increase the view of the curved road. It is shocking that accidents are occurring even after reflectors and sign boards were erected at the curve to forewarn motorists, the traders’ body has said and warned of an agitation if preventive measures are not taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/relocate-posts-walls-say-traders/article33946765.ece
27 February 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Toll collection at Kollam bypass blocked||A move to start toll collection on Kollam bypass without the permission of the State government or district administration was blocked by the police here on Friday. The agency in charge of collecting toll had made all arrangements for the toll plaza in Kureepuzha to go operational from 8 a.m. and the police had to intervene when they went ahead with the plan amidst growing protests. Reportedly, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) authorities informed Kollam Collector B. Abdul Nasar about the decision to start toll collection through a Whatsapp message on Thursday and proceeded with the plans despite the district administration expressing its apprehensions. Though youth organisations of various political parties took out protest marches to the plaza on Friday morning, the situation did not escalate after the police closed the counters. PWD Minister G. Sudhakaran had earlier approached Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari to avoid toll collection on the bypass. The bypass connecting Mevaram and Kavand was commissioned in April 2019 and the Minister had informed the Centre that the State did not want to impose toll for the amount it spent on the project. The total cost of the project completed on 50:50 cost sharing basis between the State and the Centre is Rs. 352 crore and the Centre had informed that it would collect toll for its share of the fund that came to around Rs. 176 crore. The communication received from the Centre3 said as per the Financial Participation Agreement signed between the two governments on January 17, 2014, the State government was obliged to levy the toll. It also instructed the Kerala government to collect the toll fee and remit it to the Central government until full realisation of the investment was incurred by the Centre.  Gazette notification The gazette notification for collection of toll fees was published on September 15, 2020, and according to the agreement, the State would have to remit toll to the Centre to take care of maintenance expenses. At present, Kollam bypass is a partially completed project with works to widen the stretch progressing. The authorities had to cancel an earlier attempt to start toll collection due to strong opposition from the public, as a good percentage of local residents were using it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/toll-collection-at-kollam-bypass-blocked/article33946747.ece

Mr. Dhotre lauded the collective efforts of the faculty, staff, and students of the institute in achieving various milestones — the all-India 23rd position in engineering; third position in architecture in National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF); and eighth rank among Institutes of National Importance, Central Universities and CFTIs in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA) 2020. He acknowledged the active contributions of the NIT-C alumni to the development of the institute, currently celebrating its diamond jubilee. The Minister also appreciated the NIT-C for successfully taking ahead its projects and academics during the COVID-19 period. He said government initiatives such as Digital India were instrumental in taking technology to the doorstep of commoners, while Unnat Bharat Abhiyan and Atmanirbhar Bharat would help India leap forward technologically. Education policy Mr. Dhotre said the National Education Policy (NEP) was framed so as to transform India into a knowledge superpower. It would help set up an Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) and upgrade the academic curriculum to include flexible entry-exit options. He emphasised the importance of holistic education, and collaboration among government agencies and the industry. The allocation of Rs. 50,000 crore for the National Research Foundation in the Union Budget would be a boon to ideate, incubate and innovate technological solutions. As part of making technology accessible to commoners, academic institutions should endeavour to publish their activities in local languages, promote interaction with schools and make their research and laboratory facilities accessible to young students, said Mr. Dhotre. Student intake The student intake to NIT-C has increased by 37% during the last five years. The new Mega Hostel-II for Boys, constructed by the Central Public Works Department at a cost of Rs. 165.24 crore, has 1,500 single-occupancy rooms and will be beneficial to the large student community with representation from across India and abroad.

The development comes when the JD(S) has been creating a political confusion over the merger of the party with the LJD. The breakaway faction leaders, including its vice president Kanjikkavu Kunhikrishnan and general secretary Unni Modakkaloor, said they had decided to go ahead with the merger in protest against the anti-democratic and anti-secular stance of the Central committee of the party led by former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda. The unification will be officially held at the Indoor Stadium here. LJD State president M.V. Shreyams Kumar, MP; district president Manayath Chandran, former MLA M.K. Premnath and others will take part in the function. LJD State secretary general Sheikh P. Haris said the merger proposal of the JD(S) was a ploy to sabotage the seat-sharing process in the Left Democratic Front for the Assembly polls. The JD(S) was in alliance with the BJP in Karnataka Legislative Council. So a merger would not be possible unless that party comes out publicly on its political position with the BJP, Mr. Haris said. Meanwhile, Mr. Shreyams Kumar said the hurdle to the merger was the current political inclination of the JD(S) towards the BJP. The LJD was not opposed to a merger with the JD(S). However, that party had made a U-turn at every opportunity in Karnataka. It also did not take a specify stand on the farmers’ protests as well, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jds-kerala-ljd-to-merge-tomorrow/article33946769.ece

The debate eventually led to the first agenda that was put to vote in the new council, with the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) managing to pass it on the strength of its majority even as the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) opposed it. The BJP councillors first raised questions over an agenda item for a bill of Rs. 9.08 lakh for the electrical, plumbing, and other works as part of the beautification work at Erumakkuzhi. Soon, the UDF councillors also joined in raising questions over how the particular individual was selected to execute the work. Both the parties demanded that the agenda be set aside. Responding to them, Deputy Mayor P.K. Raju asked why they were finding fault with a project which the Corporation was proud of. Below estimate Mayor Arya Rajendran said the previous council had approved a technical committee, which had estimated that the work could be completed at Rs. 11 lakh. However, it had been completed at Rs. 9 lakh, below the estimate. After an extended discussion, the agenda was put to vote, with 53 voting for and 40 voting against it. BJP councillor Anilkumar raised questions on how the Ulloor guest house ended up with the E.K. Nayanar Charitable Trust. Works standing committee chairperson D.R. Anil said the trust had participated in an auction conducted by the Corporation. It paid Rs. 2.85 lakh per month in rent, and the facility provided stay and free food for people from across the State who came in for treatment at the Government Medical College and the Regional Cancer Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bill-clearance-sparks-off-heated-debate-at-council/article33946947.ece
27 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cong. has double standards on fishers’ cause: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the Opposition of double standards in protecting the livelihood of the fishing community. The Congress remained hell-bent on spreading canards to mislead the section at the cost of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, even while having historically sacrificed the fisherfolk’s interests to open the seas for foreign trawlers, he said. Inaugurating the valedictory of the southern leg of the LDF’s Vikasana Munnetta Jatha led by CPI national secretariat member Binoy Viswam shortly after the announcement of the Assembly election in the State on Friday, Mr. Vijayan asserted the LDF government’s commitment towards the coastal community. Reiterating the LDF stance on the deep-sea fishing controversy, the Chief Minister blamed the Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) top management for keeping the government in the dark on a decision which ran against the grain of its fisheries policy. Inquiry puview While pointing out that Additional Chief Secretary T.K. Jose has been tasked with probing the circumstances that led to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the US-based company, he added that the allegation that a top official of the KSINC misbehaved with a woman journalist, who had approached him for a clarification on the MoU, will also come under the purview of the inquiry. “While the LDF government has pursued several steps for the welfare of the fishing community, including many in the aftermath of Cyclone Ockhi, the Congress had worked against them since 1991 when they had paved way for foreign firms to engage in deep-sea fishing in Indian seas. Despite the Congress and BJP attempts to cast aspersions, the people will see through such ploys,” he said. Rahul criticised Mr. Vijayan accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of being reluctant in targeting the BJP in those States where the parties were engaged in a direct electoral battle. He also decried Mr. Gandhi’s recent comments on north Indian voters which, according to him, lacked political propriety. Expressing confidence over the LDF’s prospects at the upcoming polls, the Chief Minister said that government succeeded in realising several dreams, including the National Highway development, Kochi-Mangaluru GAIL pipeline, and Edamon-Kochi power highway projects, that were hitherto considered impossible in Kerala. The State also managed to circumvent its problem of limited resources by reinventing the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board to undertake projects worth Rs. 63,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-has-double-standards-on-fishers-cause-cm/article33946779.ece
27 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||The devout will offer Pongala from homes this year||This year, the annual Attukal Pongala will be held sans thousands of women, from near and far, stoking the fire under makeshift hearths that line city thoroughfares for kilometres to prepare their varied offerings to Bhagavathy. In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, Pongala is to be offered at homes itself, and even the traditional ‘nivedyam’ by the temple priests at the end has been dispensed with. What do city residents have to say about a spiritual festival that has grown into much more being limited by the still-raging pandemic and whether the hearths at home will become the new normal in the future? Prasannakumari Vijayakumar, a homemaker who regularly offers Pongala at a house near the Attukal temple, says as the Pongala will be offered at home with the goddess in people’s hearts, the spiritual spirit of the festival remains intact. If one is sincere, one will derive complete satisfaction, just as before. “Though offering Pongala in proximity to the temple is a different experience, this year it will be as if the deity has visited their homes. There will be no ‘pottis’ to sanctify the offerings, but it will be like any other puja done by us at home,” she says. V. Shobha, vice president of the temple trust, says following the directions on COVID-19 protocols is everyone’s social responsibility, a good deed that is akin to praying to the goddess. Offering Pongala at home is an opportunity provided by the goddess. Moreover, the temple has continued to attract people every day for offering prayers. This shows their belief in the deity remains strong. Ms. Shobha says the crowds will return to the temple surroundings next year as it is what people desire. The atmosphere of offering Pongala at the temple is novel. Of camaraderie For Roshni Pillai, State Programme Manager in the Kudumbashree mission, the ritual has been about family and friends coming together to offer Pongala, being welcomed by an unfamiliar household, and meeting up with some other Pongala regulars. Ms. Pillai regrets there will be none of that joy and celebration this year. She is glad though that a festival that had been Thiruvananthapuram’s own will now be celebrated in homes across the State. Though she believes heartfelt prayers can be offered anywhere, she laments that she would not see hearths being lit by a fire from the main hearth at the temple, and the nivedyam being offered by the temple priests. Writer Sreedevi Kartha believes the sanctity of the temple is independent of the noise and crowds thronging there. The idea of the goddess is entwined with nature, but the Pongala that sees thousands of people crowd together in a limited area, light hearths, and release noxious fumes into the air does not gel with it, she says. Ms. Kartha says she believes in protecting nature, and not harming it is the biggest Pongala one can offer, especially birds and animals that are harmed or dislocated from their natural environment owing to the Pongala each year. How does the Pongala become spiritual if it adversely affects other living forms, she asks, expressing hope that this year marks the start of people offering Pongala at their homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/after-long-a-pongala-without-the-crowds/article33946809.ece

Ms. Khosa urged people to follow COVID-19 safety protocols, including physical distancing, while offering Pongala at their homes. She also appealed to them to cooperate with the arrangements put in place by the district administration in connection with the Pongala. On the temple premises, Pongala would be offered only at the main hearth. Only minimum number of people should take part in the ritual and observe COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. Pongala should not be offered by the roadsides and in public places. The temple trust should ensure this, she said. People should also avoid reaching the temple in droves to pray after offering Pongala at their homes. Those reaching the temple for prayers should avoid crowding on the premises. Children below 10 years of age should not be brought along. The Collector said ten sectoral magistrates had been posted on special duty in the temple surroundings to ensure compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Police personnel too had been deployed for crowd control. Their directions should be followed by all, Ms. Khosa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pongala-only-at-homes-collector/article33946810.ece

The LDF leadership has tested the water with coalition partners. The CPI(M) and the CPI have announced that they were willing to give up a few of their seats to billet the newly arrived KC(M) and LJD. LDF talks next week The insurrection in the NCP over the Pala seat had ended with Mani C. Kappan's defection to the UDF. The CPI(M)-CPI consultations are in the offing next week. The UDF seat budgeting deliberations are on. The UDF leadership's talks with P.J. Joseph faction of the Kerala Congress (M) has reached the end-stage. The KC(Jacob) group led by Anoop Jacob has demanded an extra seat and Piravom in Ernakulam. The RSP has demanded two additional seats. The Congress was reportedly against ceding extra seats to the two parties. It has also cold-shouldered P.C. George of Kerala Janapaksham (Secular) attempts to join the UDF. In Congress The Congress candidate selection has also entered its penultimate stage. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy are scheduled to finalise the list in consultation with the party's national leadership in New Delhi on March 10. The Congress has reportedly given weightage to candidates with a high chance of success and shunned apportioning of seats to party factions. The NDA is expected to go into the final round of seat-sharing talks after BJP State president K. Surendran completed his "Vijaya Yatra" in the capital on March 7.  BJP candidates The BDJS, the primary partner in the NDA in Kerala, has proven to be accommodative of the BJP's demands. The BJP's national leadership would announce the party's candidates for the Assembly elections in New Delhi next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coalitions-to-finalise-seat-sharing-soon/article33946777.ece

Relief The State government had on February 17 announced a package of relief schemes to help IT companies tide over the COVID-19-induced crisis. However, a subsequent order was issued later in which some of the promises were nullified, said the G-Tech officials. “We would like to bring to your notice that the only relief measure in the GO was the extension of rent waiver of 10,000 sq ft for companies holding space up to 25,000 sq ft for April, May, and June of 2020. This was already announced by your office, six months ago soon after the onset of the pandemic,” the letter said.  Letter It further added that the industry that was relieved after the announcement was left with practically no support at all, contrary to the sentiment post the CM’s industry interaction on 16th that he personally did to understand the situation which smaller companies in particular are going through. Speaking to The Hindu , G-TECH Secretary Binu Jacob said the smaller companies in IT parks were facing a major crisis, and some were on the verge of moving out owing to the continuous cost pressure while some have left the space to optimise their costs. Rent goes up He said that the rent had gone up progressively by 5% annually, owing to which it was now on a par with or above that for IT companies in some metro cities. “This will send out the wrong message to the industry and likewise companies leaving will bring down the revenues of the parks,” the letter to the Chief Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/g-tech-demands-rent-waiver-for-smaller-it-companies/article33946750.ece

Ramachandran Pillai has said. People will not switch loyalties this time, as is the State’s wont in every Assembly election, he added. He was addressing a public meeting organised here on Friday in connection with the conclusion of the North Kerala Vikasana Munnetta Jatha led by CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan. ‘An alternative’ The victory of the LDF is necessary to develop an alternative at the national level against the ‘communal-corporate alliance’ in the country, he said. A secular-democratic alliance should be formed against this alliance. The socio-economic developmental policies of the LDF government were a model for the entire country. These policies aimed at solving the issues of common man. In the last five years the government faced many challenges including floods, Nipah and COVID-19. But it stood with the people. There should be a continuation for the LDF rule for taking development works further ahead. ‘Agitations abound’ “The country has been witnessing unprecedented agitations. Farmers are protesting for their survival. Prices of essential goods are skyrocketing. The county is in the 94th place in the Global Hunger Index,” he said. While the entire country was going through a terrible period during the COVID-19 outbreak, 100 top billionaires in the country saw their wealth increase manifold. Under the Narenda Modi rule, the rich become richer and the poor become poorer, he said. “The BJP government is playing the communal card to divert the attention of the people from real issues. The minority communities in the country have been cornered and made insecure. Citizenship Amendment Act, Ayodhya verdict, revocation of special status of J&K, and law against ‘love jihad’ are part of it. The BJP government has been jeopardising the secular fabric of the county,” the veteran leader said. The LDF is totally prepared to face the Assembly elections, said Mr. Vijayaraghavan. “We are facing the election with confidence. The developmental activities undertaken by the LDF in the last five years is our strength,”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-sure-to-re-elect-ldf-says-srp/article33946953.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Battle lines drawn with poll date fixed||With Kerala set to go to the polls on April 6, the three major fronts in the State are in a political war-gaming mode for an Assembly election barely 40 days away. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the poll dates for four States and a Union Territory on Friday. Fronts confident The UDF will finalise its seat-sharing on March 3. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the victory was in sight. The LDF government’s corruption was the central electoral plank. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's interventions in Kerala will tip the scale in favour of the UDF, as witnessed in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan said 2021 would mark a watershed in Kerala's political history. Voters would gift the ruling front a second innings in power sheerly on its stellar governance record. The LDF foresaw no issues in seat-sharing. It would campaign for development and welfarism and against communally divisive politics. The BJP has braced itself for a tight-three cornered fight. It hoped to increase its vote share and emerge as a force that could tip the balance in the triangular contest. Given BJP’s "Congress-free" India theme, the UDF feared cross-voting, if at all, could advantage the LDF. The BJP has also leaned heavily on saffron politics to attract Hindu votes. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Aditya Yoginath had flagged off the BJP's campaign tour, Vijay Yatra, in Kasaragod recently. The election season saw the LDF, UDF and NDA attempting to build bridges with communities. The coalitions also tried to sidestep thorny issues that could potentially mar their electoral prospects. For one, the LDF reached out to the NSS by withdrawing cases against save Sabarimala campaigners. It promised consultation before any action on the women’s entry issue. The government engaged striking PSC rankers in talks and expedited their placement. It cancelled an exploratory deep-sea fishing agreement with a foreign firm after the pact caused disaffection among Church-backed traditional fishers. The LDF has also attempted to outdistance gold smuggling-related controversies. Similarly, the UDF engaged Christian community leaders to steady their wavering base in Central and South Kerala. The Congress national leadership met Hindu and Muslim community leaders.  The BJP has avoided the fuel price hike and farmers’ agitation. It has also reached out to the Christian community on "love jihad" and rising Islamism. It has positioned itself as a powerful national alternative to the UDF and the LDF, and posited an aggressive Centre-supported economic modernisation plan for the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/battle-lines-drawn-with-poll-date-fixed/article33946776.ece

27 February 2021||AMBAJIPETA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farmers asked to focus on coconut byproducts||Dr. Y.S.R. Horticultural University Vice-Chancellor T. Janakiram has urged coconut farmers to show interest on byproducts which have a good demand in the market. The Vice-Chancellor advised the farmers to take up new varieties as per the recommendations of the researchers for getting a good yield. He was participating in a virtual national seminar on ‘Coconut Production and Value Addition’, jointly organised by the university and Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod, at Horticultural Research Station (HRS) Ambajipeta in East Godavari district on Friday. Mr. Janakiram said byproducts of coconut such as coconut milk, coconut cream, desiccated coconut, skimmed milk, coconut oil, coconut chips, coconut vinegar, tender coconut water, coconut candy, chocolates and biscuits and other products had good demand. “Dr. Y.S.R. Horticultural University is planning to supply quality and high yield varieties to the farmers. The institute has entered Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the traders in this regard,” he said. Coconut milk is an instant product. The milk can be used in sweets, deserts, cakes, cookies, ice creams and many dishes. Coconut oil has gained importance as a dietary fat because of its high contest of lauric acid. The oil is preferred as it does not elevate blood total cholesterol, lowers blood cholesterol if consumed along with coconut kernel and decreases serum triglycerides, said the scientists. Deputy Director General (Horticulture Science) A.K. Singh was the chief guest. Former Director ICAR-CPCRI K.U.K. Nampoorthi and Director (A) Anitha Karun spoke on ‘strategies for enhancing production of quality planting material’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-asked-to-focus-on-coconut-byproducts/article33946392.ece
27 February 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Simhachalam land issue likely to have impact on Zone VIII||The long-pending issue of ‘pancha gramalu’, lack of drains in Landa garuvu and the proposal to establish a mortuary at the Gopalapatnam hospital are likely to have a considerable impact on Zone VIII (old Zone VI), in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) elections. The two-decade-old problem of ‘pancha gramalu’ (Simhachalam land issue) has been testing the patience of people of the five villages — Purushottapuram, Vepagunta, Adavivaram, Gopalapatnam and Cheemalapalli — which are now a part of the GVMC. The roofs of some of the houses are leaking but they cannot reconstruct the slabs, take up major repairs or even sell their property to raise funds to meet urgent family needs, as the matter is said to be in court. Ryotwari pattas Between 1976 and 1996 over 10,000 people are said to have constructed houses and shops on these lands. The travails of the owners began during 1996 with the issue of ryotwari pattas on these lands to the Simhachalam Devasthanam by the then Chandrababu Naidu government, says A. Aja Sarma, general secretary of the Forum for Development of North Andhra (FDNA). The subsequent efforts by Mr. Naidu to make amends, in a bid to resolve the issue, failed. The Congress government under Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and the present YSR Congress Party government also failed to resolve the issue, he said. “The ‘pancha gramalu’ issue will not have much impact in GVMC elections. All parties had included the issue in their manifestos before every general election but no one could provide a solution so far,” says Visakhapatnam West MLA and TDP leader P.G.V.R. Naidu.  Viral fevers Though there are CC roads in Landa garuvu, there are no drains or piped drinking water supply to the area. Water is supplied through tankers once in two days, according to the residents. The stagnation of waste water in the front yards of homes, due to absence of drains, is resulting in the breeding and proliferation of mosquitoes. The borewell dug up by the authorities had become defunct and has not been repaired. Viral fevers and skin diseases are common.  Mortuary proposal Residents of the area are up in arms against the proposal to set up a mortuary on the premises of the Gopalapatnam hospital and are even planning to move the court. The hospital is located in the midst of VUDA Colony and several other residential areas, which have been in existence for a long time. “The mortuary was sanctioned as part of the plan of Andhra Pradesh Vaidya Vidhan Parishad to develop area hospitals in the State. The building to be constructed for the mortuary could be used for any purpose, depending on the needs and as per the decision of of the hospital committee,” says Mr. P.G.V.R. Naidu, who is also the chairman of the hospital committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmc-polls-simhachalam-land-issue-lack-of-drains-likely-to-have-impact-in-zone-viii/article33946924.ece

Chandrababu Naidu is frustrated after the Kuppam debacle in the panchayat elections and has termed the TDP manifesto for the municipal elections as “farce and impracticable”. Addressing a press conference at the party central office here on Friday, he said that in Kuppam, the TDP could manage to win only 14 of the 89 seats as people were fed up with Mr. Naidu for four decades. Since the TDP lost in the polls, Mr. Naidu came running to the town ahead of municipal polls, otherwise he would have never visited Kuppam even for filing nomination, he alleged. “The TDP manifesto for municipal polls is a farce as Mr. Naidu cannot implement it as Leader of Opposition. He failed to implement the promises while in power, leaving people and welfare to the wind. Mr. Naidu failed to recognize the services of his party workers, including Jr NTR. Mr. Naidu, who had earlier taken junior NTR for an election campaign, had sidelined him after the defeat,” said Mr. Rambabu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/impracticable-ambati/article33946896.ece

Addressing the media here, Mr. Kannababu, who was the Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on KSEZ that submitted its report recently, said, “Mr. Naidu had imprisoned the farmers who protested against parting with their land for the KSEZ and subjected them to different means of harassment.

27 February 2021||Madanapalle (Chittoor dt.),ANDHRA PRADESH||When ‘Jana Gana Mana’ got its tune||It is common knowledge that Rabindranath Tagore authored the national anthem ‘Jana Gana Mana’ in 1911. But, not many know that it was translated into English as ‘Morning Song of India’ and given a tune on February 28, 1919 during Tagore’s brief stay at Madanapalle. Then a nondescript town, Madanapalle got a coveted place in history as Tagore chose to stay with Irish poet James H. Cousins, then principal of Besant Theosophical College. Till then, ‘Jana Gana Mana’ was just a lyric. It became a song after the principal’s wife Margaret Cousins gave it a tune. She had carefully studied the meaning of each line and composed the musical notes, which Tagore had happily approved. Before ‘Jana Gana Mana’ was declared the national anthem on January 24, 1950, two days before India became a republic, then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had asked musician Herbert Murrill to give his opinion on the tune. Original document sold “Murrill had felt it was a bit slow. He had increased the tempo and modelled it on the lines of the French national song La Marseilles,” says K.S.S. Seshan, a retired professor of history of the University of Hyderabad. In an interview to The Hindu , Prof. Seshan, who has settled in Madanapalle after his retirement, recalls how the college campus remains a witness to those inspiring moments. “The original document on which Jana Gana Mana was written was preserved at the college for several years, before it was sold to an American art collector for a fabulous, but undisclosed price. It was necessitated by the withdrawal of grants by the Government of Madras, which took offence to the faculty and students participating in the Home Rule Movement led by Annie Besant,” says Prof. Seshan. However, a photocopy was made before the original document left the country forever. Prof. Seshan brushes aside the recent controversy that erupted on social media platforms that Tagore had written the national anthem in honour of King George V. “When Tagore had rendered ‘Jana Gana Mana’ for the first time, it was at the same convention that the Indian National Congress had felicitated the king. Though it was widely surmised that Tagore had mentioned the king as ‘Bharata Bhagya Vidhata’ (dispenser of India’s destiny), he did not bother to scotch the rumours which persist even till today,” says Prof. Seshan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-jana-gana-mana-got-its-tune/article33946419.ece

Both the parties are jointly contesting 33 divisions out of 50 divisions in the Fort City. The BJP has fielded 20 candidates while the Jana Sena Party has given tickets to ten candidates. Leaders of the two parties have been highlighting civic problems such as lack of drinking water facility, bad roads, delay in taking up underground drainage works and lack of civic infrastrucutre in newly-developed colonies. “The city is dependent only on Thatipudi reservoir and the Champavati river for its water needs. Around 2.5 lakh people need 32 millions of litres per day but the actual supply is below 20 MLD. The situation is worse during the summer with water being supplied only twice a week. The TDP which ruled the civic body previously did not focus on improving water supply facilities. The YSRCP government has also failed to come up with a long-term plan. That is why we are highlighting this issue during our campaign,” said Midatana Ravikumar, Vizianagaram district general secretary of Jana Sena Party. He hoped that the party candidates would win in their respective divisions. BJP Vizianagaram Assembly in-charge Kusumanchi Subba Rao, Jana Sena Party Political Advisory Committee member and in-charge of Vizianagaram district Palavalasa Yashaswi asked the candidates to meet maximum number of voters during their campaign. “The Narendra Modi government has launched the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, housing for all and many other schemes to improve to benefit people of urban areas.

27 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Kidnapped makeup artist rescued, four arrested||In a swift action by Banjara Hills police a 35-year-old production manager and makeup artist in Tollywood was rescued from the clutches of kidnappers in less than six hours after he was abducted on Thursday afternoon. The victim, K Amarnath Reddy is a resident of Srinagar Colony under Banjara Hills police station limits. According to police, on Thursday evening, victim’s wife Kalpana Reddy approached police stating that her husband Amaranath went to his office at Madhapur and around 1.20 p.m. she received a phone call from her husband stating that he was kidnapped and asked to transfer Rs. 4 lakh to production manager Pradeep Natarajan’s account to set him free. Soon, the kidnappers started calling her and told her that they had paid Rs. 4 lakh to her husband and demanded that the amount be repaid immediately, before 5 p.m., or else they would take Mr. Amarnath to Chennai and kill him.  Unknown persons  The victim told his wife that around seven unknown persons had kidnapped him from Madhapur and if he did not give the money they were threatening to kill him and also that were beating him, Joint Commissioner of Police (West) A. R. Srinivas said. Based on Ms. Kalpana’s complaint, a case was registered and special team were formed to trace the victim and nab the accused. Cash arranged “We arranged the cash and photos of the same were sent to the kidnappers from Ms. Kalpana’s phone and later kidnappers instructed her to come to Srinagar Colony, Banjara Hills along with cash at 6.30 p.m.,” he said. The police laid a trap and nabbed one of the kidnappers, Paluru Lokesh Kumar, a cinema artist from Chennai while handing over the money. However, Mr. Pradeep managed to escape from the spot. Other kidnappers While being interrogated, Mr. Lokesh shared the phone numbers and whereabouts of the other kidnappers, and based on their call details record and call phone tower location, the other members of the group — V. Kumara Guru, S. Jagadish and P.K. Ganesh Kumar — were nabbed by Nalgonda police. Police said that one Junaid and Anu of Chennai cheated Mr. Amarnath Reddy and his friend B. Venkatesham of Rs. 13.5 lakh after they promised to introduce them to a noted film actress. Money recovery In the meantime, Amarnath approached Mr. Pradeep Natarajan and others, who were already friends with the former, and requested them to settle the matter with Mr. Junaid and recover the amount of Rs. 13.5 lakh and promised to pay Rs. 4 lakh. “After they managed to recover the money, Mr. Amarnath did not pay Rs. 4 lakh to the accused Pradeep and others. As a result they hatched a conspiracy to kidnap Mr. Amarnath and get the money,” police said, adding that Mr. Pradeep was still at large.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kidnapped-makeup-artist-rescued-4-held/article33946693.ece
27 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||CBI probe sought into lawyers’ murder||Telangana Congress stepped up its offensive against the TRS government meeting the Governor, Tamilisai Soundararajan and demanding that a court-monitored CBI inquiry be launched into the daylight murder of lawyer-couple, Vaman Rao and Nagamani, since the police and TRS leaders were facing accusations. A delegation of Congress led by TPCC president. N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and consisting of Manthani MLA, D. Sreedhar Babu, Sangareddy MLA, T. Jayaprakash Reddy and MLC, T. Jeevan Reddy met the Governor at Raj Bhavan on Friday morning and submitted a memorandum. Later, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy told reporters that the brutal murder of High Court advocates Gattu Vaman Rao and PV Nagamani in Manthani reflected the murderous politics in Telangana due to the rising sand mafia. He said Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekhar Rao did not even condemn the murder and claimed this sent a signal to the TRS leaders that they will be protected. The deceased Vaman Rao and his wife Nagamani had filed several cases against the local TRS leaders involved in illegal sand mining and land grabbing. They also filed a case against the Manthani police officials for the custodial death of a Dalit, Seelam Rangaiah, he reminded. The Bar Council of Telangana and also the Bar Council of India had written to the Telangana High Court Chief Justice terming it an attack on the judiciary, he said. ‘Reveal phone data’ The TPCC chief claimed that people did not have confidence in the police as the Ramagundam Police Commissioner, Satyanarayana was dancing to the tunes of Peddapalli district ZP chairperson and former TRS MLA, Putta Madhu. He is close to the Chief Minister and justice will be denied if the Telangana police investigate the case given the allegations against them. Manthani MLA and former Minister, D. Sreedhar Babu said police were trying to give a personal rivalry colour to the murders citing some land dispute in a village and construction of a temple to dilute the role of TRS leaders. He wanted to know why the police were not gathering the call data record of the leaders on that particular day when IT Minister, K.T. Rama Rao boasts of using technology day in and day out. It was a shame that the lawyers were killed on the Chief Minister's birthday. Congress MLC, T. Jeevan Reddy reminded that when TDP leader Paritala Ravi was killed during the Congress rule a CBI inquiry was sought by the government. He asked the CM to seek CBI enquiry to prove the government's innocence. Later, the delegation also met DGP M. Mahender Reddy and submitted a memorandum. The Congress leaders said the DGP assured them of fair investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cbi-probe-sought-into-murder-of-lawyer-couple/article33946417.ece
27 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS joins MLC election fray with hope||The last minute decision to enter the Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar Graduate MLC constituency election by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is not an impulsive one but looks like well-thought out and all it was looking for was a candidate with a fresh face to avoid criticism from the word go. It wanted to beat the perception of it being weak in the MLC elections with a good strategy. The confident tone and an aggressive stand taken by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president, K.T. Rama Rao is not superficial or just to boost the morale of the party leaders but based on the ground work the party has done, according to party sources. Unlike the previous elections where the party banked more on the Telangana sentiment, fresh with their win in general elections, this time registration of graduates as voters was done aggressively involving all the Ministers and MLAs in their respect ive constituencies. An average of 8,000 to 9,000 graduates were enrolled this time in each constituency while some were more aggressive like in Medchal constituency where 12,000 graduates were enrolled as voters. Marri Rajashekhar Reddy, incharge of Telangana Rashtra Samithi Malkajgiri Parliamentary constituency says they had a focussed drive and enrolled 12,000 in the constituency in addition to 4,000 voters in the colleges run by his family. Mr. Reddy says youngsters expressed lot of confidence in IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao for his dynamism and the way Hyderabad has become the destination of big IT players. "Media plays up the perception created against the government but on the ground the Next Gen has strong hopes on KTR," he said. Another factor that the party feels will boost the chances of its candidates is the strong network it had built in the last six years even in the villages. Based on its massive win in the local body elections in the districts, the party has created strong leadership may it be as Sarpanches, MPTCs, ZPTCs or Councillors in the Municipalities. "We have at least 1,000 leaders in every district at all levels. This is in contrast to 2015 Graduate MLC elections when the lower level leadership was not that strong," said a party strategist. Party has also changed its campaign style this time reaching out to individual voters. In the 2015 it was more like the general elections. "This time we realised that individual voters have to be touched." After KTR made it clear to the MLAs of six districts, which will be part of the Graduate MLC elections, that the onus of victory lies on them there is a surge in campaigning even at the village level. Wall writings and banners could be seen even in remote villages in deep jungles of Medaram in Mulugu district in favour of Telangana Rashtra Samithi candidate Rajeshwar Reddy indicating the seriousness involved. Adding to this aggression is the financial muscle that the party can stretch is definitely a concern for the opposition parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-joins-mlc-election-fray-with-hope/article33946708.ece
27 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bereaved father moves High Court||A writ petition seeking transfer of the investigation into the lawyer couple murder case to CBI from the Ramagiri police of Ramagundam commissionerate has been filed in Telangana High Court. The plea filed by slain advocate Gattu Vaman Rao’s father Gattu Kishan Rao is likely to come up for hearing in next two to three days. The petitioner also wanted five police officers, including Ramagundam Police Commissioner V. Satyanarayana, to be transferred from their present postings to ensure free and fair investigation of the case. Vaman Rao and his wife P.V. Nagamani, both practising lawyers of Telangana High Court, were hacked to death during daytime on the outskirts of Kalvacherla on Manthani-Peddapally road on February 17. A day after the murder, police arrested three persons Kunta Srinu, Chiranjeevi and Kumar accusing them of involvement in the gory killing of the wife and the husband. An accomplice of the trio and alleged key conspirator, Bittu Srinu, was also picked up on the day of their arrest. His arrest was announced four days later formally, after interrogation of nearly four consecutive days. The petitioner contended that police forced him to write complaint as per their whims and fancies instead of facts and thus completely deviated from the line of investigation. The police were trying to project that the murders were executed due to a local temple issue which was not correct, according to the petitioner. He stated in the plea that police were imposing several restrictions on them to ensure real conspiracy behind the double murders did not come to light. He maintained that his son and daughter-in-law had lodged complaints on different occasions against local politicians with regard to mining and sand mafia in Peddapalli and Manthani areas. He claimed that a letter written by his daughter-in-law Nagamani over the alleged custodial death of a dalit Sheelam Rangaiah was taken up as PIL petition by the HC. Despite threats from some politicians and local police officers over proceeding with the PIL plea, the lawyer couple fought believing that local mining and sand mafia had a role to play in Rangaiah’s local death, the petitioner stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bereaved-father-moves-hc/article33946701.ece
27 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP ready for debate on employment generation||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has charged TRS working president and Minister K. T. Rama Rao with presenting “utter lies” and “falsehoods” on the jobs generated in the last six years and challenged either him or Chief Minister K. Chandrasekar Rao for an “open debate” in the Osmania University campus on the issue. BJP national vice-president D.K. Aruna and former chairman of Legislative Council K. Swamy Goud claimed that Mr. Rama Rao and other leaders of TRS were deliberately “fudging” figures to claim ownership over all the employment generated including in the private sector and demanded the Government first come out with facts on the number of vacancies in the government and how many have been filled thus far. “Therefore, mixing up public, private sector jobs and claiming credit is cheating them once again just before the elections to the Graduates constituency for the Legislative Council," said Ms. Aruna. The senior BJP leader sought the Government's response to the steep rise in unemployment from six per cent in 2014 to 33% now if the TRS government claim of providing employment to a majority was true. Mr. Swamy Goud said the Kamalnathan Committee had reported about four lakh jobs during the time of division of Andhra Pradesh but only 2.70 lakh were on rolls in TS. "What happened to the other jobs? The TSPSC has been deliberately whittled down and each department is being allowed to recruit giving backdoor entry to chosen ones," he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-ready-for-debate-on-jobs/article33946703.ece
27 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||BJP has DNA of lies, falsehood and Cong. corruption: TRS||Describing 'Congress with DNA of corruption' and 'BJP the DNA of lies and falsehood', the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) hit back at the opposition parties questioning the employment figures released by the TRS working president, K.T. Rama Rao. At a press conference here on Friday, Government Whip Balka Suman, Whip Bhanuprasad and spokesperson Ravula Sridhar Reddy reiterated that the opposition parties were resorting to falsehood on the jobs given by the Telangana government despite clearly revealing the figures department wise. Mr. Suman asked the BJP leaders to reveal the figures of jobs given in the states ruled by the BJP. They are nowhere near Telangana but BJP continues to spread falsehood which has become part of its DNA, he said.He also ridiculed BJP national vice president D.K. Aruna questioning her contribution to the Telangana movement. She did not even resign as MLA during the agitation and she had no right to question Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao, who was willing to give his life. He used quite harsh words against BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and said he knows nothing except personally targeting the TRS leaders with sensational comments. Why is he not talking about the Central government's decision to privatise all the PSUs, he asked and said BJP has no moral right. Mr. Sridhar Reddy demanded the BJP to reveal how many Telangana youngsters got jobs in the 12 crores jobs created as claimed by the Modi government. He claimed the BJP is insulting the self-respect of Telangana and said if that party has some love for Telangana it should immediately announce Bharata Ratna to P.V. Narasimha Rao and secure IT exemption for Singareni employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-has-dna-of-lies-and-cong-corruption-trs/article33946706.ece

27 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS figures are false and fabricated: Sravan||AICC spokesperson, Sravan Dasoju has claimed that the government was afraid of a debate on the jobs given after the formation of Telangana and alleged that the recruitment list released by the TRS working president, K.T. Rama Rao as 'false and fabricated'. Mr. Sravan turned up at the Telangana Martyr's Memorial at Gun Park along with other Congressmen after challenging KTR to come for a debate on the jobs. "You have disappointed the Telangana youth by abstaining from the debate," he said. Mr Sravan argued that even the leaders from the United Andhra Pradesh who were blamed at the peak Telangana movement seem to be better than the present government. Former Chief Minister, N Kiran Kumar Reddy, who opposed Telangana, alone had filled 1.10 lakh jobs and Congress issued job notifications in 2006, 2008, 2012 and 2013 and filled about 1.50 lakh jobs, he claimed. Rejecting the TRS claims, he explained that there were 4.19 lakh sanctioned jobs at the time of 2014 with 3.12 lakh employed in the government and 1.07 lakh vacant. With the formation of new districts and gram panchayats, the total number of sanctioned jobs should have been increased to 5.19 lakh, he claimed. "As per the Biswal Commission, the state has only 2.28 lakh employees while 4.19 lakh sanctioned jobs are available, which means 47% of sanctioned jobs are currently vacant in Telangana." He also accused the government of removing nearly 10,000 field supervisors working for the MGNREGA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-figures-are-false-sravan/article33946707.ece

27 February 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Discoms in Haryana passing off power theft as sales to farmers’||Senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka has written to the finance and electricity departments of the Haryana government, pointing out that power distribution companies in the State were trying to pad off power theft as sales to farmers. Mr. Khemka, who is currently Principal Secretary, Archaeological Department (Haryana), has written to both the departments, stating that the “Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) has been admitting inflated claims of discoms for agriculture pumpset (AP) sales to farmers, burdening the public with huge Rural Energy (RE) subsidies. This public fraud is unfortunately not contested by the government before the HERC. The great fudge enables the discoms to claim over 9,200 million units (MU) as total AP sales and receive RE subsidy of Rs. 6,900 crore from the government without a murmur, helping the discoms to pad off power theft as sales to farmers.” He added that the average Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses of the two discoms (Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam) after accounting for AP sales are 19%. “If the AP sales are properly metered and accounted for at the farmer’s end, the true T&D losses of the discoms may be closer to 40%. A study was carried out earlier by the agriculture department in October 2007, wherein AP consumption was estimated at 1,115 MU, in the event of no rains when crops needed maximum irrigation. In the year 2007-08, the discoms were claiming RE subsidy for 5,639 MU, which in the span of the last 12 years has risen steadily by 65% to over 9,200 MU, without change in either the gross cropped area or the cropping pattern,” he wrote in the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/discoms-in-haryana-passing-off-power-theft-as-sales-to-farmers/article33946621.ece
27 February 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Chaos outside H.P. House, 5 Cong. MLAs suspended||Rowdy scenes were witnessed outside Himachal Pradesh Assembly in Shimla on Friday after the Opposition, Congress, MLAs blocked Governor Bandaru Dattatreya’s vehicle as he was about to leave the complex following his address on the first day of the budget session. Five Congress MLAs, including Leader of the Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, were suspended for the rest of the session till March 20. An FIR has been registered against them. Inside the House, while the Governor was delivering his address, the Opposition members, led by Mr. Agnihotri, said the address did not mention any pivotal issues such as the farmers’ concerns on Centre’s farm laws, spiralling prices and unemployment. As they continued shouting slogans, the Governor ended his speech saying it should be considered as read. The Congress MLAs then staged a walkout and started a sit-in. When the Governor was about to leave, they surrounded his vehicle demanding that he should tell why did he not finish his speech. “The Governor was set to leave from the Speaker’s gate where the Congress MLAs sat on a dharna. I, along with Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and other Ministers, was escorting the Governor to his vehicle. We requested them (Congress MLAs) to clear the way, but they surrounded the vehicle and started pounding it, and manhandled the marshalls. This is an unfortunate day in the democracy,” Speaker Vipin Parmar told The Hindu . FIR lodged “After this, the House was again convened. A resolution was passed and five Congress MLAs — Mukesh Agnihotri, Harsh Varhan Chauhan, Vinay Kumar, Satpal Raizada and Sunder Singh Thakur — were suspended for the rest of the session,” he said. The Congress MLAs alleged that they were pushed and manhandled by the BJP members. “There was no manhandling of the Governor, instead our MLAs were manhandled by the BJP members as they pushed us,” Mr. Agnihotri told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/chaos-outside-hp-house-5-cong-mlas-suspended/article33946625.ece

27 February 2021||GURUGRAM,||Auto fares too low, complain drivers in Millennium City||Narender Kumar Shukla has been running an autorickshaw in the Millennium City for the past 15 years. He finally got a meter installed on his vehicle two days ago. Though elated that he now need not argue with passengers over fare, the 47-year-old feels that the fare decided by the administration is too low compared to Delhi where the CNG rates too are significantly less. Win-win situation “The installation of meters is a win-win situation for both the driver and the passenger. Passengers feel that autorickshaw drivers always overcharge, but now they will be happy to pay as per the fare shown in the meter. The drivers too need not argue over fare,” said Mr. Shukla, who claimed that it took him three days to get the meter installed. “The meter was installed on Tuesday, but it wasn’t working. I came on Wednesday, but the staffer did not turn up. So I came again the next day to get it fixed,” said Mr. Shukla, standing with fellow autorickshaw drivers at an open ground near Maharana Pratap Swaran Jayanti Park in Sector 29. Meter installation He said that the authorities charged Rs. 2,950 for meter installation and another Rs. 50 for fixing a “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” sticker on his autorickshaw. He, however, feels that the rates fixed by the authorities are too low compared to Delhi and that too with the CNG rates in Haryana are higher. Gautam, another driver, added that the fare for the first 1km was Rs. 25 in Delhi, whereas it was only Rs. 12 in Gurugram. “The CNG is Rs. 10 per unit costlier in Gurugram. Besides, there are fewer passengers in Gurugram compared to Delhi, which has several railway stations, metro stations and shopping malls,” said Ratan. Chhote Lal, another auto driver, got meter installed on February 3, but said that the passengers did not prefer to pay according to the meter. Haryana Auto Chalak Sangathan State president Mahavir Singh demanded that the process of meter installation should be put on hold for a few months since the auto drivers were already struggling to make both ends meet as an aftermath of lockdown and the installation charges were an additional financial burden on them. Call to put it on hold “Things are still far from normal and an autorickshaw driver hardly manages to earn Rs. 300-400 per day. In this situation, the installation charge of Rs. 3,000 is an additional burden on them. Besides, the installation rates are higher in Gurugram than Delhi,” said Mr. Singh. He also reiterated the demand to increase the minimum fare and bring it at par with Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/auto-fares-too-low-complain-drivers-in-millennium-city/article33946563.ece
27 February 2021||Guwahati,||Masked men in Meghalaya attack labourers from Assam, one killed||Officials in Meghalaya’s West Khasi Hills district have sent seven labourers home in Assam after masked men attacked them at a construction site on Wednesday night. A labourer died of his injures in hospital. The missionary college where they were working has also been closed for an indefinite period in view of the attack. Police said that about 15-20 masked miscreants, armed with sharp and blunt weapons, attacked the eight men from Assam’s South Salmara-Mankachar district bordering Bangladesh when they were sleeping inside the St. Xavier College complex in Shait-Shait Umriod village in South West Khasi Hills district. The college authorities took the injured labourers to the health centre at district headquarters Mawkyrwat, about 15 km away. But given the seriousness of the injuries, the doctors there referred them to the Civil Hospital in State capital Shillong, where one of them – 22-year-old R. Mondal – died. “The labourers were sent back to Assam while the body of the man who died was handed over to his kin. We have so far arrested two people and efforts are on to nab the other suspects,” district Superintendent of Police Maxwell B. Syiem told The Hindu on Friday. Father L. David Nukhu, college vice-principal, said the labourers had been brought on February 10 for constructing the college administrative block and a girls’ hostel. The department concerned in the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council had given permission to bring them.  ‘Opposed by locals’ “But on February 22, the headman and other members of the village authority came and told us the labourers cannot work in the college. We shifted them to another place and let them come to work on February 24 after the village authority granted them permission. The attack happened that night,” he said. Approval sought In a statement, the college authorities said they had sought the approval of top officers and Ministers, including Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma, to bring the labourers besides explaining to pressure groups such as the Khasi Students’ Union why the workers were needed. Condemning the incident, Mr. Sangma said: “We will ensure the miscreants involved are not allowed to go free and such incidents do not happen in the future.” There have been instances of non-locals having been attacked in Meghalaya, where pressure groups have been demanding implementation of Inner-Line Permit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/masked-men-in-meghalaya-attack-labourers-from-assam-one-killed/article33946620.ece

27 February 2021||Mumbai,||Can’t interfere with culling: HC||The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court in a recent order refused to interfere with the culling of birds in poultry farms as “curtailing the spread of bird flu certainly would be a priority and a task to be done at war footing”. The court said the decision solely rested with authorities. A Division Bench of Justices S.V. Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni on February 18 was hearing two petitions filed by Ashraf Poultry Farm and Pioneer Poultry Farm, which were sealed on February 4. The owners challenged an order passed by authorities directing the culling of birds and destruction of eggs in their farms.  The assistant government pleader said the authorities took the decision as infected birds were found in 21 farms in the vicinity of the petitioners’ farms. He said the petitioners claimed their farms lay beyond one kilometre from the infected farms, but areas within 2.5 km from the infected poultry were declared as infected zone and up to 10 km as surveillance zone. He said the decision was taken to safeguard the life and health of the general public. The Bench said, “The authorities ought not to have taken drastic steps of culling the birds.

27 February 2021||Navi Mumbai,||7,872 people listed ‘negative’ by mistake: NMMC probe||A three-member investigation team formed by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has found that 7,872 people were erroneously listed as having tested negative for COVID-19. NMMC Commissioner Abhijit Bangar formed the team in November last year to probe allegations by Maratha Kranti Morcha activists that the kin of negative patients who had not been tested for COVID-19 were also listed as having tested negative on the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) website. The activists said even relatives who had died 10 years ago were listed ‘negative’. The NMMC had suspended Dr. Sachin Nemane, the nodal officer in-charge of conducting antigen tests, following a data entry error. Mr. Bangar had said when a person tests negative, the details of the kin are entered as ‘NA’, but the operator marked them ‘negative’. After a three-month-long probe, the team submitted a 11,591-page report, which said it was evident there was an error in recording the results. Mr. Bangar said the team verified the claims by making calls to 1.52 lakh people who were tested to check if they had actually undergone the tests and if their names matched with the inventory of used rapid antigen testing kits between July 16 and November 30. Of them, 98.94% confirmed that they had undergone the test. The team found that the NMMC had purchased 2.40 lakh rapid antigen kits, of which 2.13 lakh were used and 4,717 were defective, while 21,679 were found at the Central drug depot and the NMMC’s various testing centres. The total used kits and tests conducted also matched. ‘Will take action’ Mr. Bangar said, “A total of 2.13 lakh antigen kits were used, but the number of tests registered on the ICMR website was 2.21 lakh. So, there were 7,872 additional entries. This was due to faulty registration. No financial irregularities were found. The data operator marked the kin of ‘negative’ patients as ‘negative’ without conducting a test. There was no error in any of the ‘positive’ cases. We will fix responsibility and take action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/7872-people-listed-negative-by-mistake-nmmc-probe/article33946800.ece
27 February 2021||New Delhi,||Development work faster if elected to power, says AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party on Friday said the BJP has failed to carry out its duties in the three municipal corporations. It also said if AAP is elected to power in the municipal corporations, then development works will be carried at a faster pace as it is in power in the State as well. “The civic bodies have three major legal constitutional responsibilities — cleanliness of Delhi, building and upkeep of small roads and streets in localities, cleanliness and beautification of all the parks under its jurisdiction. However, the BJP-ruled civic bodies have failed spectacularly in each of these responsibilities and have indulged in rampant corruption,” said AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha. He alleged that the BJP gave its councilors “repeated opportunities” to make money by bringing new candidates every five years. Mr. Chadha appealed to the people of Delhi to come together to rid of the corruption that has become the norm in the city. ‘Vote for AAP on Sunday’ He requested the people to vote for AAP candidates in the by-election to five seats on Sunday. Also, senior AAP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said retired Additional District Judge Sukhbir Singh Malhotra has joined the party on Friday. “People are inspired by the work of Kejriwal government in education, healthcare, water, roads and Wi-Fi, and want to join AAP,” Mr. Sisodia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/development-work-faster-if-elected-to-power-says-aap/article33946569.ece

The petition was moved in the Delhi High Court after the Supreme Court on February 8 said it had made a “mistake” by agreeing to examine the matter. It asked the petitioners to move the High Court instead. In the plea, filed through advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, the victims of the alleged franchisee racket have claimed that the company floated bogus companies such as Hyper Supermarket and Hyper Mart to invite investors, like the petitioners, who were then duped of their money. The petition seeks an investigation by the CBI, ED and SFIO (Serious Fraud Investigation Office) or by a Special Investigation Team into various offences, including money laundering and black money hoarding, allegedly committed by the directors and beneficiaries of the company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/petition-in-hc-for-probe-into-franchisee-scam/article33946564.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. confident of win in all 5 municipal wards||The Delhi Congress on Friday said judging from the response it has been getting from public meetings and padayatras, it is confident of winning all five municipal corporation wards. AICC in-charge of Delhi Congress Shakti Sinh Gohil alleged that Delhiites feel betrayed and let down by the BJP and AAP as they had hoped that these parties will create miracles but got only disappointment. “People have now realised that it was a very big mistake to re-elect the BJP to the civic bodies and AAP to the Delhi government. The Congress candidates for the five wards are experienced workers, who have done grassroots-level work in their wards and are familiar with the local problems unlike BJP and AAP leaders, who swindled development funds to line their pockets.” Mr. Gohil said. ‘Same sides of a coin’ He added that in the past few years, BJP and AAP only accused each other of fund misuse, stalled developments and corruption. He said both the parties are the two sides of the same coin.

BJP national general-secretary Bhupendra Yadav, East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir, North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri threw their weight behind the candidates for the five wards. “In the past six years, the Kejriwal government’s way of functioning has stalled developmental activities in the city. The people will give him and his party a befitting reply,” Mr. Yadav said. Mr. Gupta, while leading a padayatra in support of party candidate Siyaram Kanojia, asserted that they would win all five wards by huge margins. “Of these five, four wards had AAP councilors, who are now MLAs, but in spite of this, there has been no development in these areas and power, water supply, roads, sewers are simply missing,” he alleged. Mr. Bidhuri said AAP MLAs and councillors had made most of the city a garbage bin. “People are forced to drink impure water. It is time to elect those who know the areas’ issues,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/lop-tiwari-other-senior-bjp-leaders-take-out-roadshows/article33946567.ece

27 February 2021||COLOMBO,||India cannot abandon us, says Sri Lanka||Seeking India’s “proactive” support at the UN Human Rights Council, where a resolution on Sri Lanka will be soon put to vote, the Secretary to Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, “India cannot abandon us”. “If the world is one family, as your Foreign Minister has said, then we are immediate family, isn’t it,” Admiral Jayanath Colombage (retired) said, citing External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s reference to ‘ vasudhaiva kutumbakam ’ in his recent address to the Council. The Foreign Secretary, a former Navy Commander, spoke to The Hindu on Sri Lanka’s prospects at the ongoing session in Geneva, Indo-Lanka relations, Colombo’s broader foreign policy choices, and strategy for reconciliation from “within”, and regional cooperation. Sri Lanka, Mr. Colombage said, would be “very uncomfortable” if countries in the region did not extend support in Geneva. He expressed hope that India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh — who are among members of the current Council — will back Sri Lanka, since the countries had similarities, “are battling COVID-19 and facing allegations of human rights violations”. “Our President’s [Gotabaya Rajapaksa] first letter requesting support was to the Indian Prime Minister, and his first meeting here was with the Indian High Commissioner. Because we are very conscious of South Asian solidarity,” he said, adding: “Sri Lanka is in dire need of support from our friendly neighbours. And we are not asking anything extraordinary, we are asking something based on your neighbourhood first policy, based on Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).” His appeal comes at a time when Indo-Lanka bilateral ties have come under strain, following a series of decisions taken by Colombo on development projects involving India and China. On whether Sri Lanka would consider India’s possible abstention at the Council as support, the Foreign Secretary said he hoped for “proactive” and “constructive” commitment, rather than abstention, which is “neither here, nor there.” All the same, seeming prepared for adoption of the likely hostile resolution, he said: “It’s difficult for a country from the Global South to win the vote... because of the Council’s double standards and hypocrisy,” he said, pointing to rights abuse and police brutality in the developed world. Punitive measures like an economic sanction would hurt the people more than the government, Mr. Colombage said, arguing that reconciliation mechanisms must be evolved within the country. “We can’t do anything just because someone points a gun at our head and says, okay reconcile. It will never happen.” Asked how the government might address the evident trust deficit within the country — the minorities have repeatedly expressed scepticism on domestic programmes that are yet to deliver — he said communities torn apart in a 30-year war would take time to reconcile. India’s vote It remains to be seen how India might vote on the Sri Lanka resolution that draws from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet’s damning report on Sri Lanka's “alarming path towards recurrence of grave human rights violations”, which Colombo has categorically rejected. With the Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government co-sponsoring the 2015 resolution, a vote was not required. At the Interactive Dialogue on Sri Lanka at the Council last week, India reiterated Mr. Jaishankar’s message in Colombo in January, and called upon Sri Lanka to take necessary steps for addressing Tamils’ “legitimate aspirations”, including through the process of reconciliation and full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution. But the Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary indicated a preference for a clean break from existing laws. It is “high time” Sri Lanka had a new, “people-centric” Constitution, he said, underscoring the need to “move on”. “It is going to be challenging to abolish provincial councils, rather we should empower them to deliver,” he said, amid persisting calls from some in the Rajapaksa government and its support base for their abolition. All the same, the Foreign Secretary does not see the existing 13th Amendment as a solution. The 13th Amendment came about with the aim of ending the violence and developing war-affected areas, he said, of Sri Lanka’s only legislative guarantee so far on power devolution to the provinces, including those with a Tamil majority. “Let us look back and see whether any of those two main objectives were achieved because of the 13th amendment. The answer is no. The war dragged on until 2009, and much more killing took place after 1987. And then, development could not take place through the Provincial Council system,” Mr. Colombage said, even as Tamil parties continue demanding full implementation of the 13th Amendment since the civil war ended in 2009. Despite Tamil parties seeking greater power devolution within an “undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka”, as senior Tamil leader R. Sampanthan unfailingly states, Mr. Colombage views their demands as leaning towards separatism, “although they do not use the Tamil Eelam word.” “When you say that you want a federal state, you want more devolution of powers, you want police powers, you want land powers, right? So that means you are asking for almost a separate state,” he said, referring to powers that the 13th Amendment envisaged, but the Centre is yet to part with. “I personally feel that India also should not really harp on the same thing that prevailed in 1987, because the dynamics have changed. India is concerned about the Tamils living in Sri Lanka, rightfully so, because there is a sizeable Tamil population in India, nothing wrong in it.” Flagging Sri Lanka’s foreign policy “dilemma”, he observed that a developing country should be able to make decisions based on economics, based on needs, but unfortunately, a country like Sri Lanka “is not free” to make that decision. “Before we make even an economic decision, we have to think of the strategic consideration of the powers in the Indian Ocean Region,” he said, of being “sandwiched” between the two factors. Major power game “Now, where should we draw the line? Should we say, okay, north of this line is to country A, and south of this country could be country ABCD? Is that what we want?” he asked. Sri Lanka, a “small country” spanning some 65,000 sq. km, was seeing how best it can maintain neutrality, he said, while staying away from “the major power game”, maintaining friendly relations for economic purposes with all the countries, and keeping India’s strategic security concerns in mind. “That will determine our foreign policy, and we are determined to balance these factors.” On Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s recent visit to Colombo, he said it should not be seen as Sri Lanka attempting “to join a bloc” or country, against others. “It is a bilateral visit.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-cannot-abandon-us-says-sri-lanka/article33946302.ece
27 February 2021||Washington,||Biden, Saudi King hold talks ahead of Khashoggi report||President Joe Biden held a long-delayed first phone call on Thursday with Saudi King Salman ahead of an imminent U.S. intelligence report expected to link the Arab kingdom’s powerful Crown Prince to the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr. Biden kept the King waiting in his long list of calls to U.S. allies after being sworn in five weeks ago. And when he did reach out to the Saudis, it was pointedly to the King and not the expected successor Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The telephone diplomacy was all part of what the White House is calling a reset in relations in the wake of Khashoggi’s horrific 2018 murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. A U.S. intelligence report on the incident, in which Khashoggi is believed to have been killed and then chopped into pieces, is being made public “soon,” the White House said. It is expected to state that the Crown Prince in some capacity was connected to the killing, which involved a whole squad of Saudi agents positioned at the consulate before Khashoggi visited. Khashoggi, a Saudi national who wrote for The Washington Post and was a U.S. resident, had been an outspoken critic of the young prince. The White House said that Mr. Biden and the 85-year-old King emphasised the countries’ security ties and “the U.S. commitment to help Saudi Arabia defend its territory as it faces attacks from Iranian-aligned groups.” However, Mr. Biden also “affirmed the importance the U.S. places on universal human rights and the rule of law.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-saudi-king-hold-talks-ahead-of-khashoggi-report/article33946304.ece
27 February 2021||Beirut,||U.S. strikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria kill at least 22||The U.S. military has struck Iran-backed militias in eastern Syria, killing at least 22 fighters, according to a war monitor. In its first military action against Iran-linked groups since Joe Biden became President five weeks ago, the Pentagon said it had carried out air strikes on Thursday at a Syria-Iraq border control point used by Iran-backed groups, destroying “multiple facilities”, in retaliation for a spate of rocket attacks targeting its troops in Iraq. “At President Biden’s direction”, the U.S. raids targeted “infrastructure utilised by Iranian-backed militant groups in eastern Syria”, spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. “These strikes were authorised in response to recent attacks against American and coalition personnel in Iraq, and to ongoing threats to those personnel,” he said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 22 fighters were killed when the strike hit three trucks loaded with munitions near Albu Kamal. Militia border posts were also destroyed, the war monitor said. It said all the dead were from Iraq’s state-sponsored Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, a group that includes many small militias with ties to Iran. Syria condemned the strike as “cowardly American aggression”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-strikes-on-iran-backed-militias-in-syria-kill-22/article33946311.ece
27 February 2021||Lagos,||Gunmen abduct 317 Nigerian schoolgirls||Gunmen abducted 317 girls from a boarding school in northern Nigeria on Friday, police said, the latest in a series of mass kidnappings of students in the West African nation. Police and the military have begun joint operations to rescue the girls after the attack at the Girls Science Secondary School in Jangebe town, according to a police spokesman in Zamfara State, Mohammed Shehu. One parent, Nasiru Abdullahi, said that his daughters, aged 10 and 13, are among the missing. “It is disappointing that even though the military have a strong presence near the school they were unable to protect the girls,” he said. “At this stage, we are only hoping on divine intervention.” Resident Musa Mustapha said the gunmen also attacked a nearby military camp and checkpoint, preventing soldiers from interfering while the gunmen spent several hours at the school. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Several large groups of armed men operate in Zamfara State, described by the government as bandits, and are known to kidnap for money and for the release of their members from jail. “We are angered and saddened by yet another brutal attack on schoolchildren in Nigeria,” said Peter Hawkins, UNICEF representative in the country. “This is a gross violation of children’s rights and a horrific experience for children to go through.” He called for their immediate release. Nigeria has seen several such attacks and kidnappings over the years, notably the mass abduction in April 2014 by jihadist group Boko Haram of 276 girls from the secondary school in Chibok in Borno State. More than a hundred of the girls are still missing. Friday’s attack came less than two weeks after gunmen abducted 42 people, including 27 students, from the Government Science College Kagara in Niger State. The students, teachers and family members are still being held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gunmen-abduct-317-nigerian-schoolgirls/article33946307.ece
27 February 2021||Washington,||MBS behind ‘capture or kill Khashoggi’ operation||Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, approved of an operation to capture or kill dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi who was murdered in 2018, according to a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment released on Friday in a manner choreographed to limit damage to U.S.-Saudi ties. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote columns for The Washington Post critical of the Crown Prince’s policies, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the Crown Prince in the kingdom’s Consulate in Istanbul. Riyadh has denied any involvement by the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler. “We assess that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,” the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in the report posted on its website. “We base this assessment on the Crown Prince’s control of decision making in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman’s protective detail in the operation, and the Crown Prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/mbs-behind-capture-or-kill-khashoggi-operation/article33946359.ece

Five judges at the Supreme Court gave a unanimous decision in the case of Shamima Begum, whose legal battles have come to be seen as a test of how U.K. treats nationals who joined the jihadists. They found her right to a fair hearing did not override considerations such as public safety, and that the decision to block her return should remain until she can participate “without the safety of the public being compromised”. “That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible,” the head of the Supreme Court, Judge Robert Reed, said. “But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind.” Now 21, Begum left her home in London at the age of 15 to travel to Syria and married an IS fighter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-top-court-rejects-is-brides-legal-bid-to-return/article33946310.ece

27 February 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka to allow burial of virus victims||Sri Lanka on Friday cleared the burial of COVID-19 victims, reversing its nearly year-long policy of mandatory cremations that the country’s Muslim community denounced. The change in the government’s position follows Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s recent visit, when he reportedly urged the Rajapaksa administration to respect Muslims’ burial rights. “While Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi did not give a reason in her announcement reversing the ban, official sources said Khan had raised the subject with both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa during his trip,” AFP reported. “I thank the Sri Lankan leadership & welcome the Sri Lankan govt’s official notification allowing the burial option for those dying of Covid 19,” Mr. Khan tweeted on Friday. In April, a month after the pandemic struck Sri Lanka, the government banned burials of victims, based on unsubstantiated claims that the practice might contaminate groundwater, further spreading the virus. Despite senior virologists terming the claim baseless, and the World Health Organization permitting both, burials and cremation, the government stuck to its position. Several members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) had raised the issue, both in Sri Lanka and at global fora, including the 46th session of the UNHRC. As many as 14 OIC countries are among the 47 current members of the Council, and will soon get to vote on a contested resolution on Sri Lanka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-to-allow-burial-of-virus-victims/article33946308.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Gunning for victory in Bengal||The 2019 Lok Sabha election in West Bengal is a traumatic memory for Ali Hussain Mansuri, a resident of Barrackpore, about 50 km Kolkata. From a few days after the polls in 2019 till weeks before the Assembly polls of 2021, Mansuri went knocking on the doors of the Bhatpara police station with two complaints: one against the vandalism and looting of his shop and the other against his house being set on fire. In both the complaints, addressed to the officer-in charge of Bhatpara police station, which have been stamped as received, Mansuri mentions “violence anddanga(riot)” in May 2019. Almost a month after the riots, which erupted on the day the by-polls to the Bhatpara Assembly seat were held in Barrackpore, on May 19, the people of Darba Line returned home under police protection, but Mansuri did not. He chose to live about 500 metres away from his earlier residence near Choti Masjid. Since then, he has been going around distributing copies of the police complaints to whoever he thinks might be able to help him. The riots killed at least seven and injured dozens of people. The causes of the deaths and violence are contentious and differ depending on which family or political party you speak to. Some attribute it to political violence, others to communal strife. But what is evident is that since then, Barrackpore has emerged as a centre of conflict. It is, like many other places in West Bengal before the polls, a region on edge. Riots along the banks of the river Hindus and Muslims, largely Hindi- and Urdu-speaking, have worked in the jute mills along the banks of the Hooghly river in Barrackpore for nearly two centuries. They have survived on meagre wages producing yarns of jute. These areas are dilapidated and the economic distress of the inhabitants conspicuous. But it is not only talk of job loss and lockouts that dominate conversations today, but also the creation of political and communal divisions. Darba Line, located in the Kankinara Jute Mill complex on the banks of the Hooghly, is a cluster of low-roofed homes. The houses lie on both sides of a lane that is so narrow that two people cannot cross it at the same time. There is fresh paint on the doors and new plaster to hide the vandalism that occurred in May 2019. The people talk in hushed voices while recollecting the harrowing memories of the bloodshed and chaos. They know very well who the masked men were who looted their belongings and set their houses on fire. Before the turn into Darba Line lies a common bathroom where, under a large iron pipe, mill workers bathe in the open. “Have you ever seen a toilet in the jute mill quarters,” asks Subha Protim Roychowdhury, a civil rights activist. In the Kankinara Jute Mill and the adjoining Reliance Jute Mills, the common toilets for mill workers look identical: they are two-storey structures with handwritten signs in Hindi pointing to separate staircases for men and women. These toilets are rows of compartments not higher than four feet. They have no doors. “In the jute mills, on both sides of the Hooghly, such structures are not uncommon. These common bathing spaces and common toilets are reminiscent of what was once a composite mill culture,” he says. Roychowdhury lives on the other bank of the Hooghly in similar quarters that witnessed the Telinipara riots in May 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown. The riots happened on two days: May 10 and May 12. On May 10, several shops were attacked on Ferry Ghat, largely a Hindu-dominated region. On May 12, people from the community came out in large numbers with weapons alleging that the members of the other community were not maintaining COVID-19 norms. Several houses were attacked and ransacked. Roychowdhury says these riots were manufactured; that rumours regarding the spread of COVID-19 triggered them. Social media was used to heighten the campaign and Internet was suspended for days in parts of Hooghly after the riots. About 11 km from Telinipara is the Chinsurah Dunlop ground. This is where Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in a chopper for a large public meeting on February 22, 2021. At the meeting, for which several trees were cut, he accused the Trinamool Congress of appeasement and alleged that Durga Puja was not allowed to be held. He promised the crowd, comprising workers of the jute mills who have been grappling with frequent lockouts and job cuts, of “development for all and appeasement for none” if the Bharatiya Janata Party is voted to power in the State Assembly elections to be held from March 27 to April 29. The crowd burst into applause on hearing this promise. On the other bank of the river in Barrackpore, Roychowdhury and his associates Sandip Sinha Roy and Bijay Kumar Rajak gathered testimony of those affected by the violence. The outcome is a report by civil rights and research collective group AAMRA and is titled ‘West Bengal: Post Ramnavami Communal Violence; Bhatpara Riot 2018-2020’.  The communal and the political It is difficult to point out when these fissures started appearing in the social fabric of Barrackpore, but there were instances of communal flare-ups even before the 2019 explosion. The Hazinagar riots of November 2016, triggered by an attack on a Muharram procession, and the unrest following attacks on Ram Navami processions in 2017 and 2018 were alarms that were ignored. Seven people were killed in the communal riots in 2019 — Ram Babu Shaw, Dharmendra Shaw, Rajesh Shaw, Prabhu Shaw, Lala Chowdhury, Mohammed Mustak and Mohammed Halim. According to the family members of these victims, some of them died in a crude bomb explosion and some were killed in police firing. Three of them, including 17-year-old Ram Babu Shaw, were puchka sellers (street vendors). All the deaths were reported within a 2-km radius in the Kankinara-Bhatpara area. While the families of the victims are united in their grief, they are divided in their opinions about political parties. This is because the Trinamool Congress and the BJP leadership have reached out to the families in different ways. Mustak’s son, Parvej, and Halim’s son, Tabrej, got jobs as contractual workers in the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services Department. For at least three of the five Hindus killed in the violence, the BJP MP from Barrackpore, Arjun Singh, arranged a compensation of  Rs. 5 lakh each. Some like Shyamali Devi, Prabhu Shaw’s widow, have failed to meet the criteria of compensation from either side. Shyamali, who has to take care of three daughters after her husband’s death, was appointed as a contract worker in Bhatpara Municipality. But she lost her job and has not got a salary for four months after Singh lost control of the municipality following defection to the BJP. The violence which started in May 2019 continued to rage for the next 20 months. Activists like Roychowdhury point out that it is becoming difficult to separate the communal from the political. As communal passions subsided, the area was gripped by a bloody feud over area domination, and political murders became a regular affair. While there are definite numbers on how many have been affected in the communal riots, it is difficult to point out exactly how many people have died in the political violence. By some estimates the toll could be more than a dozen. Even the supporters of the ruling party were not spared. In June 2019, a local Trinamool Congress leader from Nimta, Nirmal Kundu, was shot dead by men on motorbikes. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras. Among the other Trinamool Congress workers killed in the political violence was Akash Prasad in November 2020. Earlier, in September 6, 2020, two people died while allegedly manufacturing crude bombs at Kamarnati in the southern fringes of Barrackpore. Frictions From October 2020, the Barrackpore subdivision was flooded with posters of a young, bearded man, a 35-year-old BJP youth leader. Manish Shukla was gunned down by semi-automatics on October 4, 2020, not even 100 metres from the police outpost in Titagarh. While most political murders have not created much of a ripple except for the customary tweets by political parties, the murder of Shukla, which was again caught on CCTV cameras, shocked the entire State. But this has become more routine now. In the last week of January 2021, 35-year-old Trinamool Congress worker Rumani Khan was shot dead in Ward Number 18 of Barrackpore. Only a month earlier, on December 12, 2020, Saikat Bhawal, a 28-year-old BJP worker, was beaten to death in Halisahar area of the subdivision. Bhawal was distributing party posters when he was killed. The political strife has not only created divisions across families but also within families. Sagar Bhawal, Saikat Bhawal’s 23-year-old brother, says that while the BJP leadership has offered monetary compensation, a local Trinamool MLA approached his sister-in-law and offered her a job in the Fire Department. “She does not stay with us anymore. We would never have accepted such an offer,” he says. “My brother was the only earning member in the family. After his death there is no one to take care of me and my mother. And now the family too is divided,” he laments. There is also friction between the Bengali and non-Bengali populations. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee addressed her first political meeting from the Naihati Muncipality building on Ghoshpara Road on May 30, 2019. She had met family members of the supporters of the Trinamool Congress who were driven out of their houses after the polls. “I remember parts of her highly charged speech,” Rajak says, “including her reference to a dialogue from a Mithun Chakraborty blockbuster, ‘marbo ekhane (will beat you up here)’”. Banerjee was enraged after locals had chanted ‘Jai Shri Ram’ at her convoy in Bhatpara area. She vented her anger against the non-Bengali speaking people of the jute mill belt saying that they were indulging in hooliganism while the State was providing them food and shelter. Defections and cases Long before defections became commonplace in West Bengal politics, Barrackpore saw Arjun Singh, a four-term Trinamool Congress MLA, defect to the BJP. Singh wanted to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Barrackpore but the party decided to favour Dinesh Trivedi. Singh switched to the BJP and defeated Trivedi by a margin of over 14,000 votes in a contest marked by violence. Following Singh’s defection, a number of civic bodies slipped out of the Trinamool Congress’s grip, but after a few months, the legislators returned to the ruling party. Political violence in the region has been marked by area domination, capture of party offices, wresting control of civic bodies, and killings. Singh’s office-cum-residence ‘Majdoor Bhawan’ stands at the intersection of two jute mills, the Meghna Jute Mills and the Auckland Jute Mills, on Ghoshpara Road. By 10 a.m, more than 50 visitors gather at his place. This house was in the news a few days ago when it was attacked by crude bombs. The video was tweeted by the State BJP leadership. The house has been in the news earlier too, with the police conducting frequent raids.  At Majdoor Bhawan, on a winter morning last year, Singh was in a hurry to visit an injured party worker, but still made time to meet the people. “The lockdown has left me with no money. Can you ask my landlord to consider my request,” a woman pleaded. Another visitor wanted him to pressurise his employer so that he could retain his job. Before leaving his office, Singh also chided a party worker who had beaten up a technician. “What will you people do when we come to power,” he asked. A few days later at Dalhousie, with a smaller group of people at his lawyer’s office, the Barrackpore MP talked about the criminal cases against him. “I may hold the record of having the highest number of cases against me. It had reached 96 at one point, now it has come down to 66,” he said. Emphasising his century-old family connection to the jute mills, Singh said, “Barrackpore was made a prestige fight by Mamata Banerjee. If it was Singur and Nandigram that brought down the Left rule, Barrackpore will be the Waterloo for the Trinamool Congress.” Communal overtones in campaign The campaign before the Assembly election has not only got shriller, but the communal overtones too have become more pronounced. At a rally organised on January 9, 2021, at Barrackpore, senior Trinamool Congress leaders including MP Kalyan Banerjee and Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim raked up the issue of the riots and warned that there could be riots again during the next Ram Navami. The TMC MP went a step further and referred to the Hathras gang-rape in Uttar Pradesh and Sita in one line, triggering outrage on social media. In mid-February, Singh welcomed Trivedi, his political rival, into the BJP after the latter resigned as a Rajya Sabha MP from the Trinamool Congress. The BJP began making plans for its Rath Yatra (or Parivartan Yatra), which was expected to pass through Ghoshpara Road in Barrackpore. On February 15, at a well-attended meeting at Naihati, not far from where Banerjee had addressed the 2019 meeting, Trinamool Congress leader Omprakash Mishra referred to the harmonious coexistence of Bengali and non-Bengali-speaking populations of the region. “Fifty per cent of the people here are Hindi speaking and the remaining are Bengali,” he said. Around the same time, when the political campaign was gathering pace, activists under the banner of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, under the leadership of Debasish Paul and Sandip Sinha Roy, rallied about 150-riot affected victims including Mansuri to the office of the Sub Divisional Officer, demanding compensation. While the development brought some hope to Mansuri, who was called by the local authorities to submit his police complaint along with his bank account details, he decided not to return to his old home and handed over the keys of the Darba Line quarter to the jute mill administration. On February 25, 2021 the BJP president J.P. Nadda visited Mangal Pandey Park in Barrackpore, had lunch at the home of a family of a jute worker at Gouripur Naihati, not far from Gouripur Jute Mill, which has been closed since the late 1990s. He also participated in the conclusion of the Parivartan Yatra. A few weeks ago, Mansuri reopened his quilt and pillow shop in Kankinara after taking a loan of about Rs. 50,000. While business has started trickling in for the first time since May 2019, fears of a fresh communal flare-up continue to haunt the 64-year-old jute mill worker. On February 25, Mansuri opened his shop with a lot of hesitation as the Parivartan Yatra was supposed to pass by his shop. Later in the day, he heard from Sandip Sinha Roy that the Parivartan Yatra had been denied permission on Ghoshpara Road because of violence in Kanchrapara further north. Mansuri heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Whatever has to happen will happen. I have opened the shop today. But how can we live in constant fear?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/gunning-for-victory-in-bengal/article33946300.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The Biden touch to sober, yet substantive ties||One year since former United States President Donald Trump spoke about the India-U.S. relationship, and his own relationship with his “true friend” Prime Minister Narendra Modi in glowing terms at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, much has changed for both countries. The U.S. has changed its leadership, growth prospects for both India and the U.S. — the two countries which have the highest number of coronavirus cases in the world — have dimmed considerably, and even the name of the stadium has changed. The new U.S. President, Joseph Biden, has spent much of his first month in office changing Mr. Trump’s policies, including reversing the U.S.’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council, and cancelling the “Muslim” ban and other immigration policies, among a slew of other domestic measures through executive orders. The connect this time It would seem, however, that Mr. Biden is not at present planning to change the course Mr. Trump chose in building closer ties with India, including the push for the Quadrilateral and Indo-Pacific policy. Mr. Biden called Mr. Modi right after he had called all treaty alliance partners, but before he spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or King Salman of Saudi Arabia. There have been calls between the U.S. Defence Secretary and National Security Adviser with their Indian counterparts. There were also two calls between the U.S. Secretary of State. Anthony J. Blinken. and the External Affairs Minister. S. Jaishankar, in addition to a virtual Quad Ministerial meeting that included the Foreign Ministers of Japan and Australia. Mr. Biden’s Climate Change Envoy John Kerry also appeared on a discussion with Mr. Jaishankar, where he praised India’s efforts on renewable energy and emissions, and charted an ambitious course ahead of the U.S.’s “Earth Day Summit” on April 22 (https://bit.ly/3pZOLHM). The State Department spokesperson also revealed plans for an “an overarching memorandum of understanding (MoU) to enhance health cooperation” which will deal with COVID-19 testing, vaccination and critical drug supplies. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden’s decision to lift restrictions and caps on a number of visas and green cards has no doubt relieved the Modi government of one of the constant sources of worry that India has had with the U.S. Given the list of “Priorities” for the administration listed by the White House on its website (https://bit.ly/3kq3tXk), it is safe to say that on a majority of issues, including COVID-19, climate, health care, immigration and restoring America’s global standing, New Delhi and Washington are already engaging each other, and are on the same page. China on the horizon Where then, if at all, might trouble lie? While these are still early days to hazard anything, certain preliminary indicators could provide a clue. To begin with, there is China. There is no doubt that China’s aggression at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in early 2020 brought India and the U.S. closer, galvanised greater military cooperation, intelligence sharing, and what former Trump National Security Council Director Lisa Curtis called America’s “moral and material support”. Events at the LAC also made New Delhi give up years of hesitation over holding Malabar Exercises for the Quad, and hold two Quad ministerial meetings in the past year. The difference this year is that the Biden administration takes charge as India and China have disengaged from their heights in the Pangong Tso area, and are discussing what could be a long-drawn disengagement and de-induction of troops. As a result, the Modi government may have to be more reticent with the Biden administration as it seeks to take on China strategically. For the Biden administration too, which is walking a fine line with statements on the challenge from China as a competitor in areas such as defence, trade and technology, but also the need for cooperation in certain areas such as climate change and where it is in the U.S.’s “interests to do so” (https://bit.ly/3uyJL0q) , the messaging is likely to be more mixed than before. Meanwhile, there will be areas where India may become collateral damage: in his latest executive order on securing America’s supply chains, for example, Mr. Biden has sought action in areas such as pharmaceuticals where India is a major producer and could be hit if the U.S. insists on localising production (https://bit.ly/3koJhoZ). The order is especially significant given that India-Japan-Australia are already working on a trilateral Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) to counter their dependence on Chinese goods, that the U.S. is not a part of. Getting it right on rights Human rights is the next area where India and the U.S. could be at odds both on the bilateral front and in the region, given Mr. Biden’s commitment to put human rights “at the centre of Foreign Policy”. The U.S. readout of his call with Mr. Modi held that a “shared commitment to democratic values is the bedrock for the U.S.-India relationship”, and Mr. Biden and U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris are expected to be more vocal on these issues which the Modi government has been prickly about. After four years of what former diplomat Ashley Tellis called Mr. Trump’s “values holiday”, the U.S. is back to commenting on issues that India considers its internal affairs and what it calls “crackdowns on freedom of speech”. In the past month, the U.S. administration has weighed in on India’s lifting of the Internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir, farmers’ protests and the government’s face-off with Twitter. It is unlikely that the Biden administration will brush away the Modi government’s actions to shut down international agencies — Amnesty, Greenpeace, Compassion International — in the same way as the previous administration did. Further afield, the U.S. will want India to partner in ensuring human rights in South Asia, particularly given its current term in the UN Security Council. Practically every call between the respective capitals has mentioned concerns over the coup by the Army in Myanmar (Burma). However, while Washington has stepped up sanctions and called for the Suu Kyi-NLD government to be reinstated, New Delhi has spoken only for the “rule of law” and democratic processes to be upheld, and the Ministry of External Affairs has laid emphasis on India’s interests in the region. A similar situation could arise over Sri Lanka which faces a country-specific resolution at the Human Rights Council for alleged wartime excesses in 2009 operations against the LTTE, and India’s support for its neighbour would place it closer to Beijing’s position than to Washington’s. Russia bonds, trade concerns Other areas of possible discord outlooked (flagged) by experts will be over India’s ties with Russia, in particular the arrival of the S-400 missile systems which will attract sanctions under the U.S.’s Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a law that the Democrats in Congress pushed through during the Trump administration. Mr. Biden’s administration will seek to implement the law more stringently, calling it a “powerful tool” in its dealings with Turkey on the S-400 purchase and the Nord Stream2 pipeline project from Russia. Trade is an ongoing concern from the Trump era, and India is still hopeful of reversing the U.S. decision to cancel its GSP status for exports. Meanwhile, the mega Indian investment plan announced during the “Howdy Modi” visit — Petronet India’s $2.5 billion stake in U.S. company Tellurian’s Driftwood LNG project — has ended abruptly after the MoU signed in September 2019 lapsed. Afghanistan and Pakistan On Afghanistan, New Delhi has charted an independent course from the U.S., standing firmly with the Ashraf Ghani government and resolutely refusing to engage the Taliban. This is pragmatic, but it also means the U.S. will continue to see India as “not part of the problem, not part of the solution”, and seek more support from Pakistan to facilitate its exit. In particular, the U.S.’s pre-Trump formulations that conflate peace in Kashmir in order to help its desired outcomes in Afghanistan, as its recent statement on the India-Pakistan LoC ceasefire shows, will become a sore point for New Delhi. Above all, the shift from a year ago is likely to be evidenced by the stark contrast in Mr. Biden’s personal style from that of his predecessor. While South Block mandarins no longer wake up in the morning dreading the damage control required for the latest tweet from the U.S. President, it is clear that Mr. Biden is not as big on pushing the personal connection with Mr. Modi as Mr. Trump or even President Barack Obama was. The difference will make for a more sober, but perhaps more substantive bilateral relationship in the four years ahead. suhasini.h@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-biden-touch-to-sober-yet-substantive-ties/article33946294.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Imparting direction to science in India||National Science Day, on February 28, is a moment to celebrate the progress that India has made in science and technology research, thanks to its science policies. It is also an opportunity to ponder about the problems that we face in research. As for the metrics on scientific research in India, there is the good news, the not-so-good news, and some hope. Publications and patents The good news: from the report published by the National Science Foundation of the U.S. in December 2019, India was the third largest publisher of peer-reviewed science and engineering journal articles and conference papers, with 135,788 articles in 2018 (https://bit.ly/3qWY7FN). This milestone was achieved through an average yearly growth rate of 10.73% from 2008, which was greater than China’s 7.81%. However, China and the United States had about thrice and twice the number, respectively, of India’s publications. The not-so-good news is that publications from India are not impactful. From the report, in the top 1% of the most cited publications from 2016 (called HCA, or Highly Cited Articles), India’s index score of 0.7 is lower than that of the U.S., China and the European Union. An index score of 1 or more is considered good. The inference for India is that the impact, and hence the citation of publications from India, should improve. The other relevant report is on patents filed by India. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) through their Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is the primary channel of filing international patent applications. In its report for 2019, WIPO says India filed a modest number of 2,053 patent applications (https://bit.ly/3pYlddN). Compared to the 58,990 applications filed by China and 57,840 by the U.S., India has a long way to go. This was the first time that China filed more patent applications than the U.S. The Indian Government put in place the National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy in 2016 to “stimulate a dynamic, vibrant and balanced intellectual property rights system”. One of the objectives is human capital development (https://bit.ly/3pYwZoe). The mission to foster innovation, replicate it at scale and commercialise it is a work in progress consequent to the policy. However, we need hawk-eye’s focus à la China which filed just 276 patent applications in 1999 but rose to become an innovation titan in 2019. Science policies over time India realised early as a republic the need to use science to become a welfare state. As Robert Browning said in “Apollo and the Fates”, ‘Tis Man’s to explore..., ... Up and down, inch by inch, with the taper his reason’, it behoved us to chart new frontiers in science that would suit our priorities. There have been four science policies till now, after 1947, with the draft of the fifth policy having been released recently. India’s first science policy adopted in 1958, Scientific Policy Resolution, aimed to develop scientific enterprise and lay the foundation for scientific temper. It led to the establishment of many research institutes and national laboratories, and by 1980, India had developed advanced scientific infrastructure with sufficient scientific personnel. The focus in the second science policy, Technology Policy Statement, in 1983, was technological self-reliance and to use technology to benefit all sections of the society, while strengthening research in fields such as electronics and biotechnology. The Science and Technology Policy 2003, the first science policy after the economic liberalisation of 1991, aimed to increase investment in research and development and brought it to 0.7%. The Scientific and Engineering Research Board (SERB) was established to promote research. In 2013, India’s science policy included Innovation in its scope and was called Science, Technology and Innovation Policy. The focus was to be one of the top five global scientific leaders, which India achieved through building partnerships with States, establishing more research and development centres and collaborating in international projects such as the Large Hadron Collider in the European Union. The draft of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy 2020 (STIP2020), the fifth science policy that was released in January 2021 offers hope to research in India (https://bit.ly/3dO9s73): it has an ambitious vision to “double the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) researchers, Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) and private sector contribution to the GERD every 5 years” and to “position India among the top three scientific superpowers in the next decade”. STIP2020 defines an Open Science Framework which will create a “one nation, one subscription” solution that will give all individuals and institutions in India access to all top journals through a central subscription. This scheme will provide fillip to improving access to knowledge. It also defines strategies to improve funding for and participation in research. India’s Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) is currently around 0.6% of GDP. This is quite low when compared to the investments by the U.S. and China which are greater than 2%. Israel’s GERD is more than 4% (https://bit.ly/3dM1WJV). A key reason for India’s low funding in R&D is the low private sector contribution. STIP2020 defines solutions to improve funding thus: all States to fund research, multinational corporations to participate in research, fiscal incentives and support for innovation in medium and small scale enterprises. These are good ideas. The new measures should not become a pretext to absolve the Union and State governments of their primacy in funding research; the government should invest more into research. Key areas and focus Other critical focal areas are inclusion of under-represented groups of people in research, support for indigenous knowledge systems, using artificial intelligence, reaching out to the Indian scientific diaspora for collaboration, science diplomacy with partner countries, and setting up a strategic technology development fund to give impetus to research. Science diplomacy is at the fore now with India offering COVID-19 vaccines to many countries; formulating a policy around it will yield dividends. Support for indigenous knowledge systems should enable them to improve upon their limitations in subscribing to transparency and verifiability. The policy seeks to define strategies that are “decentralized, evidence-informed, bottom-up, experts-driven, and inclusive”. It is in draft stage and will have to be finalised and placed before the cabinet for approval. It makes the right moves and strikes the right notes to make India future-ready. More specific directives and implementation with a scientific temper without engaging in hyperbole will be key to the policy’s success; and its success is important to us because, as Carl Sagan said, “we can do science, and with it we can improve our lives”.

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Open minds||The Centre has saved itself from continuing embarrassment at the international level by withdrawing the Education Ministry’s ill-thought-out guidelines for holding online conferences, seminars and training sessions. The sweeping circular, issued in consultation with the External Affairs Ministry, created a bottleneck for scientists in public universities, colleges and organisations and erected new bureaucratic barriers in a pandemic-hit phase when virtual conferences are the only viable channel for researchers to collaborate with global peers. Academicians and others organising the events were, as per the January circular, required to get prior official approval and ensure that the conference topics do not relate to security of the state, border, the northeast, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and broadly, any “internal matters”. Event organisers were also mandated to give preference to technological tools and channels not owned or controlled by hostile countries or agencies. The effect of such a vague and abstruse set of instructions could only be to abandon efforts to organise conferences. To their credit, Indian scientists spoke out, and the Indian Academy of Sciences sounded a warning on the order’s detrimental effect on development of science, prompting a rethink. The pandemic from last year has underscored the value of virtual collaboration for many, although it cannot be argued that it completely substitutes for face-to-face interactions, trust-building and team formation. Without hurdles posed by visas, expensive travel, physical disability and so on, thousands of scientists have been able to participate in online conferences. Attendance at such events grew by 80% in 2020 over 2019 for the Plant Biology Worldwide Summit and over 300% for the American Physical Society meeting, as also for international meetings on cancer, lasers and electro-optics. Many scientists also think a combination of post-COVID-19 physical conferences and new possibilities enabled by virtual collaborations promise to forge even stronger alliances. An entirely new avenue has also opened up for national conferences with global experts taking part that researchers and students in the smallest towns can attend. This cannot, however, happen if institutions are bound by a bureaucratic straitjacket. India has made good strides in some fields with a growing number of peer-reviewed publications, especially in chemistry and physical sciences, as the Nature Index notes. Moreover, rigorous work can help allay concerns, such as on biopiracy, by documenting natural assets. The humanities, too, need to be freed from paranoid restrictions on research topics, curbs on scholars, and the growing pressure to sanctify cultural notions of science and history. Good sense has prevailed on the issue of online conferences, and it should lead to a more liberal approach to all research.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/open-minds/article33946289.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A colonial relic||A sessions court in Delhi has affirmed the belief that a dispassionate scrutiny of outlandish claims by the police is necessary for protecting the liberty of those jailed on flimsy, often political, reasons. Rejecting the purported evidence presented by the Delhi Police against climate change activist Disha Ravi, as “scanty and sketchy”, Judge Dharmender Rana has granted bail to the 22-year-old arrested for nothing more than editing a document shared among a network of activists raising global support for the farmers’ protests against three central laws. Even though it was quite obvious that the claim of a global conspiracy behind the unsavoury and violent incidents that took place on January 26 in New Delhi lacked credence, the order of bail is still notable for subjecting the specific charges to strict judicial scrutiny at a fairly early stage. In particular, the judge has applied the established test for a charge of sedition under Section 124A of the IPC to pass muster: that the act involved must constitute a threat to public order and incitement to violence. He found that there was not even an iota of evidence indicating that the ‘toolkit’, a shared Google cloud document with ideas on how to go about amplifying the protests, in anyway incited violence. He was clear that there was no causal link between the violence and Ms. Ravi, a conclusion that confirmed widespread criticism that the arrest was unnecessary, and that the entire case was nothing more than a reflection of government paranoia. The episode highlights a trend that has caused concern in recent times: the tendency of the rulers to treat instances of dissent, especially involving strident criticism of policies and laws in which particular regimes are deeply invested, as attempts to provoke disaffection and disloyalty. Hence, it is significant that the judge not only saw Ms. Ravi’s activism as related to her freedom of speech and expression, but went on to say that an attempt to reach a global audience is part of that freedom. In the backdrop of the claim that those who prepared the toolkit made common cause with Khalistani separatists, Judge Rana showed refreshing clarity in maintaining that mere interaction with a group with dubious credentials could not be used to consider someone culpable. It should also be underscored that such bail orders should not be rare or special, but be routine judicial responses to cases in which there is a mismatch between the accusation and the evidence. It is by now fairly clear to everyone except, perhaps, the government and its vociferous supporters, that there is no place in a modern democracy for a colonial-era legal provision such as sedition. Too broadly defined, prone to misuse, and functioning as a handy tool to repress activism, the section deserves to be scrapped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-colonial-relic/article33946290.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||India ‘out of recession’, GDP grows 0.4%||India’s economy resurfaced to growth territory in the third quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2020-21, clocking a 0.4% rise in the gross domestic product (GDP), as per data from the National Statistical Office (NSO). GDP had shrunk in the first two quarters by 24.4% and 7.3% as per revised data, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, marking a technical recession. The NSO has also revised its advance national income estimates for FY21 to project an 8% decline in GDP, compared with the 4% growth seen in FY20. The NSO had earlier estimated a 7.7% shrinkage for FY21. The Finance Ministry termed the 0.4% real GDP growth in Q3 as a return to ‘the pre-pandemic times of positive growth rates’ and a reflection of a ‘further strengthening of V-shaped recovery that began in Q2’. India’s farm sector remained resilient, clocking a 3.9% growth in Gross Value Added (GVA) to the economy in the October-to-December quarter, after recording a 3.3% and 3% rise in the first two quarters, respectively. For the full year FY21, the NSO expects only two sectors to record positive growth in GVA — agriculture (3%) and electricity, gas, water & other utilities (1.8%). Overall GVA is expected to contract 6.5% in the year, led by an 18% dip in trade, hotels and other services, a 10.3% decline in construction, and an about 9% fall in mining and manufacturing GVA. In Q3, manufacturing, construction and financial, real estate and professional services staged a return to growth for the first time in the year after two bad quarters. Manufacturing GVA grew 1.6% after dipping 35.9% and 1.5% in the first two quarters. Construction saw the sharpest recovery – with GVA rising 6% after falling 49.4% and 7.2%. Services including trade, hotels, transport and communication remained in trouble, with GVA declining 7.7%, though it was better than the -47.6% and the -15.3% reading in Q1 and Q2. The Finance Ministry said the resurgence in manufacturing and construction augured well for them to drive growth in FY22 and added that services, which account for more than 50% of India’s GVA and the biggest source for pushing consumption, had done remarkably better in Q3. “Real GVA in services has also improved from a contraction of 21.4% in Q1 to a negligible contraction of 1% in Q3,” the Ministry said. “Given the uncertainties around investments and exports, recovery prospects... hinge critically on uptick in private consumption... one would expect support from public policy,” said Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist and head of research, Bandhan Bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-out-of-recession-gdp-grows-04/article33946279.ece
27 February 2021||MUMBAI,||Current inflation target band apt for next 5 years, says RBI report||With the next review of the flexible-inflation targeting (FIT) framework coming up soon, the Reserve Bank of India, in the Report on Currency and Finance for FY21, said the current inflation target of 4% with a +/-2% tolerance band is appropriate for the next five years.  The RBI said the period of study in this report was from October 2016 to March 2020 commencing with the formal operationalisation of the FIT framework in India but excluding the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, in view of data distortions. The report said trend inflation had fallen from above 9% before FIT to a range of 3.8-4.3 % during FIT, indicating that 4% is the appropriate level of the inflation target. The report said an inflation rate of 6% is the appropriate upper tolerance limit for the target. “A lower bound above 2% can lead to actual inflation frequently dipping below the tolerance band while a lower bound below 2% will hamper growth, indicating that an inflation rate of 2 % is the appropriate lower tolerance bound,” it said.

(TII) is adopting a three- pronged strategy to insulate itself from the cyclical nature of the auto sector. “We want to reduce our dependence on auto because being an auto-component supplier, we feel there are two challenges to it,” said Vellayan Subbiah, MD. “One, it is very capital intensive and two, it is very cyclical and cyclicality does not create an ability to generate consistent and constant cash flows.” The Murugappa Group firm has identified three growth engines. TI-1 refers to the existing divisions, TI-2 to a venture capital-led approach to growth such as expansion into optic lenses and electric three-wheelers and TI-3, growth through acquisitions such as CG Power. According to him, TI-1, which are organic businesses, might grow 6%- 8% and it was not fair to put too much pressure on them. TI-2 is ‘yet to become operational’ and TI-3 will kick in with the CG Power numbers next year. Recently, TII had announced its maiden foray into electric three-wheelers at an outlay of Rs. 200 crore. It had roped in a Korean firm for design and technology. “We are going to start manufacturing and selling electric three wheelers. It will be around, perhaps, the December to January timeframe. We already have a working prototype.” TII had also forayed into the manufacture of optic lenses. Operations may start by the end of Q1 of FY22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tube-investments-picks-three-growth-engines/article33946272.ece
27 February 2021||Pune,||‘Domestic businesses need more govt. support’||Calling for more governmental support for domestic businesses, Minister of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar on Friday stressed the need for strong policies to foster and promote manufacturing in India. He was speaking at the inaugural session of the fifth Asia Economic Dialogue 2021. “It is the business of government to support domestic businesses. And not just big businesses but especially micro, small and medium enterprises… We need to stand up for our businesses,” the Minister said. He pointed out that there existed a huge potential for manufacturing which had not been fostered by the right policies at home till now. It is the business of the government to support businesses. “Every government in the world does that, we in India haven’t done that enough. However, I think that is changing.” he said. He observed that jobless growth was not “a testimony to the policies of a growing country” and that a lot more people-centric policies were needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/domestic-businesses-need-more-govt-support/article33946274.ece
27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Coffee output may drop as rain lashes plantations||Untimely rains and hailstones that lashed plantations in the last six days causing large-scale berry dropping is expected to impact arabica and robusta coffee production by 30% for the 2020-21 crop year, as per estimates by planters. According to Coffee Board’s post-monsoon estimates, during the crop year 2020-21, India was expecting an arabica production of 1.02 lakh metric tonnes (MT) and robusta production of 2.4 lakh MT. India’s total coffee output for the year was estimated at 3.42 lakh MT against last year’s 2.98 lakh MT. “As of now, we lost over 30% of our arabica coffee due to rains in January. Also, heavy rains in February along with hailstones [compressed] robusta volumes by another 30%,’’ said Karnataka Planters’ Association (KPA) chairman S. Appadurai. “The berry fall is causing irreparable damage for growers,” said Bose Mandanna, a planter. “In the last six days, most plantations got 3-10 inches of rain, lashing the plant-bearing, matured berries and pushing them to the ground,’’ said H.T. Pramod, former chairman, KPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/coffee-output-may-drop-as-rain-lashes-plantations/article33946277.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Core sector output rises 0.1% in January||India’s eight core sectors recorded a meagre 0.1% rise in output in January, propped up by a 5.1% rise in electricity, 2.7% growth in fertilisers and 2.6% growth in steel production, even as the other five sectors contracted. The core sectors had recorded a marginal growth of 0.2% in December, as per updated data, compared to a 1.3% contraction estimated earlier. Core sectors have an almost 40% weightage in the index of industrial production, and economists expect overall industrial output to record less than 1% growth in January. “This anaemic growth is a concern as this reflects physical production that has now declined by 8.8% for the year,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings. “Therefore, while the monetary value-added number has been positive, the same does not hold here,” he added. “Cement has now de-grown for three months which is disappointing as this reflects developments in the construction sector which was expected to pick up,” said Mr. Sabnavis. “The mood in the real estate sector has not recovered as the focus is on disposing off inventory rather than going in for new projects,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/core-sector-output-rises-01-in-january/article33946278.ece

27 February 2021||AHMEDABAD,||An ever-learning master of his art||“One game at a time.” “I don’t look too far ahead.” These are the cliches associated with modern-day India cricketers, whenever they are asked about their personal targets. But R. Ashwin is different. Not just on the pitch but off it as well. It’s his artistry with the red cherry that makes him stand out on the field of play whenever he wears India’s jersey. Perhaps it’s the confidence he derives from his on-field exploits that leads to the eloquent engineer from Chennai talking nonchalantly about his personal targets. No wonder then that after becoming only the fourth Indian — and the second-quickest in the world in terms of Test appearances — to scale Mt. 400 during the two-day win over England in the third Test, Ashwin had no qualms saying “I won’t be surprised if I surpass myself in the future as well”. One of Ashwin’s strengths is his ability to assess the conditions and bowl accordingly. It was evident during the pink-ball Test at Motera, where he and left-arm spinner Axar Patel ran through England’s hapless batsmen twice in less than two days. Realising that only the odd ball was turning viciously, he convinced Axar to bowl wicket-to-wicket lines and it reaped huge dividends. Add to that his mastery of subtle variations, and Ashwin becomes virtually unplayable in Asia. Ollie Pope, the England youngster, is unlikely to forget how he was flummoxed by Ashwin from either side of the umpire in both the innings during the third Test. Having joined the 400-club at 34, an age when spinners are conventionally supposed to be at their peak, it was pertinent to ask the man whether he feels that he is bowling at his best right now. “This question has been asked quite a few times in my career. In 2015-16 people were asking me the same thing when I went through that lovely phase in ’15-16-17. And now people are asking the same,” he told Star Sports on Thursday. “One thing is for sure — I have always looked to improve and every time I have thought I have bowled well, I have always found another gear. So I’ll not be surprised if I surpass myself in the future as well.” If Ashwin indeed switches to a higher gear over the next few years, you can rest assured that both opposition batsmen and statisticians will have an even harder time keeping up with him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/an-ever-learning-master-of-his-art/article33946443.ece
27 February 2021||BENGALURU,||‘Success in singles will follow soon’||Last week, Ankita Raina became India’s first WTA champion since Sania Mirza, when she won the doubles title at Phillip Island Trophy in Melbourne partnering Russia’s Kamila Rakhimova. The 28-year-old spoke to The Hindu about her memorable time in Australia, during which she made her Grand Slam main draw debut and broke into the top-100 in doubles. Excerpts : How happy are you following your maiden win? It means a lot. Winning a tournament at this level for the first time gives you great confidence. I have many fun memories on court with my partner. I enjoyed it. You are the third woman after Sania Mirza and Shikha Uberoi to enter the top-100 in doubles while representing India. How is the feeling? I feel proud and honoured. It’s because of the hard work of my team and sacrifices of my family that I have got this far. My goal is to play main draw of all Slams this year. I was able to do it once in doubles. Now I want do it in singles and break into the singles top-100 just like how I did in doubles. How will this result change things and will you start expecting more from your doubles play? I’ve always played both doubles and singles in juniors and pro circuit, and doubles has always helped my singles game and performance. So, I don’t think it’ll put more pressure. How it will change things…. I feel the same [success] will follow in singles soon! How was the overall Australian Open experience, starting from the qualifiers in Dubai? It’s been such a learning experience. So many mixed emotions and many firsts. In Dubai, I got to the final qualifying round [in singles] and lost a close match. It was the farthest I’d gone in a Slam. I enjoyed my hits during quarantine with my cohort partner. Also having one of my coaches from my academy, Utsav Mukherjee, really helped and I’m thankful to him. Is this the best start you have had to a season? How are you looking to build on it? Yes. I made the main draw of a Slam. So definitely it’s been the best and winning my first WTA! Going forward, I’m going to speak to my coach and tell him about the things I noticed in my game that needs work. The idea is to keep continuing the process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/success-in-singles-will-follow-soon/article33946407.ece

27 February 2021||Bengaluru,||Vinay Kumar announces retirement||Former India cricketer and Karnataka captain R. Vinay Kumar announced his retirement from international and First Class cricket on Friday. Vinay played one Test (against Australia at Perth in 2012), 31 ODIs and nine T20Is. The 37-year-old last featured for India in the limited-overs home series against Australia in 2013. Vinay was an outstanding performer in his 17-year domestic career. He scalped 504 wickets in 139 First Class matches, and is the highest wicket-taker among fast bowlers in Ranji Trophy history. He also has 225 and 194 wickets in List-A and T20 matches respectively. With the bat, he scored two centuries and 17 fifties in First Class matches. Successful tenure His most significant achievement came during his tenure as Karnataka captain, when he led the side to back-to-back treble winning seasons in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Vinay time and again lifted the spirits of the Karnataka team with his never-say-die, workhorse attitude. In 2019, after an immensely fruitful and long association with Karnataka, Vinay joined the Puducherry team. He also represented Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore in 11 IPL seasons. Vinay came from a humble background, as a promising junior cricketer in his hometown Davanagere. While playing for Tumkur Zone, he was spotted by Y.B. Patel and B. Siddaramu, who offered him a spot in Neptune CC in the KSCA fifth division league in Bengaluru. The next season, Vinay represented powerhouse first division team Swastic Union CC (1). He soon made his Karnataka debut, in a Ranji Trophy match against Bengal in 2004. The Bengal duo of Rohan Gavaskar and Sourav Ganguly count as Vinay’s first wickets in domestic cricket — an auspicious start indeed. In 2010, Vinay made his India debut, taking the wickets of Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara in a T20I against Sri Lanka at Gros Islet (St. Lucia).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/domestic-giant-vinay-kumar-bids-adieu/article33946446.ece
27 February 2021||Chennai,||‘Hurricane’ Yusuf decides to call it a day||He was a force of nature when he waded into an attack. ‘Hurricane’ Yusuf decimated bowlers with strokes of thunder. In his retirement from the game, announced on Friday, cricket has lost one of its most devastating strikers. Yusuf Pathan’s blitzkriegs swung games, shut opposition out. Influential, he was part of three IPL winning teams, represented Rajasthan Royals, Kolkata Knight Riders, and Sunrisers Hyderabad. And Yusuf was in Indian teams that triumphed in the World Twenty20 in South Africa, 2007, and the ODI World Cup of 2011, in the sub-continent. A man for the big occasion he certainly was. The sort of batsman, who, in his pomp, would put fear in a bowler. Not many batsmen cleared the ropes with the authority that this man from Baroda did. The explosive Yusuf did so by a mile. Endearing soft side He was as brutal with the willow as they come. Yet, there was an endearing soft side to the 38-year-old Yusuf, Irfan Pathan’s elder brother. He was a man of peace, loved animals and birds. In fact, he kept several of them in a private place of his own in Vadodara. Yusuf has invariably been associated with the IPL. However, some of his bravest knocks have come in the Indian colours. Ahead of India’s tour of South Africa in 2010, some elements spread the word that Yusuf was not comfortable against short-pitched bowling. And in the Cape Town ODI, the South African quicks peppered Yusuf with short-pitched balls. The courageous Yusuf took blows on his body, hooked and pulled during his 59 but did not give his wicket away to a lifter from a fast bowler. And he followed this with a pulsating 105 in the Centurion ODI. Yusuf could gun down attacks away from the sub-continent as well. Vital contributions He made 810 runs and took 33 wickets for India in 57 ODIs. And there were some vital contributions during his 22 T20Is for India. Of course, he flirted with danger at the crease and there lay his charm. In full flight Yusuf was a thing of beauty. In the mayhem he caused, there was a symphony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hurricane-yusuf-calls-it-a-day/article33946447.ece

27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Will continue to fight for title: Rodriguez||It may be hard to win LaLiga , Spanish football’s top division, but Ramon Rodriguez, Sevilla’s sporting director, reiterated the club’s identity — ‘the team that never gives up’. Lying fourth in the table behind Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona, he said Sevilla would attempt to play its best. “We are very close to the top. There will be no room for mistakes. We don’t want to take pressure. We will go match by match,” said Rodriguez in an online interaction with Indian media. Looking at the next match against Barcelona, Rodriguez said that Sevilla was in good space with its morale high and good physically. However, he conceded “you are never the favourite when you play Barcelona,” and not just because of Messi’s presence. On Sevilla’s collaboration with Bengaluru Football Club, Rodriguez felt it would be mutually beneficial for both sides and that the Indian club would improve on the technical and tactical aspects. “We can help Bengaluru improve its structure,” he said. Quite happy about many Spanish players figuring in the Indian professional league, Rodriguez felt that the sport in India would gain a lot with such exposure. Giving an insight into Sevilla’s famed talent scouting, Rodriguez revealed that he watched about 50 matches in a month while the rest of the club’s scouts watched about 60 to 70 matches a month in different part of the world. With tons of data providing clarity about the strengths of the players, the talent scouts combine it with their observation, which has been reduced to watching matches online owing to the pandemic, to gauge the players.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-continue-to-fight-for-title-rodriguez/article33946577.ece

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Vinayaka ensures success||Abirami Bhattar begins his Abirami Andadi with a verse in praise of Lord Vinayaka, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse. In the Thirukkadaiyur temple, Vinayaka is called Kallavarana Pillayar. Upon instructions from the Goddess, Vinayaka is said to have stealthily taken away the nectar over which the asuras and devas were fighting. Hence he earned the name Kallavarana Pillayar or Chora Ganapathi. This is a unique feature in the Thirukkadaiyur temple. When Vinayaka is with Ambal and Siva, he is called Soma Ganapati, just as Muruga in the company of Siva and Parvati is called Somaskanda murthy. No venture is undertaken without prayers being offered to Vinayaka, for he is the one who removes all obstacles, and ensures the success of the endeavour. When Lord Siva set out to destroy the forts of the three demons, He did not take leave of Vinayaka. And so, the axle of His chariot broke, says Arunagirinatha, in his Thiruppugazh. Vinayaka helped His mother too. Ambal had to destroy Pandasura. Pandasura’s brother wanted to help him. So he placed a yantra in the middle of Ambal’s army. This yantra was called the jayavignayantra, that is a yantra that served as a hurdle to victory. So, the Goddess was unable to kill Pandasura. Vinayaka stepped in, and broke the yantra. And only then was Ambal able to kill Pandasura. Abirami Bhattar sings of Ganapathy in Chidambaram temple because in Chidambaram he is Karapaga Vinayaka, one who gives whatever a bhakta seeks. Chidambaram is also the most important temple for Saivites. Ganapathy is said to be white in colour. Some say he is red. But Abirama Bhattar says he is dark like clouds. This is to show his compassionate nature and his generosity in giving, like a rain-laden cloud.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vinayaka-ensures-success/article33946434.ece

27 February 2021||New Delhi,||Deepak in semifinals||Asian silver-winner Deepak Kumar (52kg) entered the semifinals to be assured of a medal and a clash with reigning Olympic and World champion Shakhobiddin Zoirov at the 72nd Strandja memorial boxing tournament in Sofia. Deepak defeated Bulgaria's Darislav Vasilev 5-0 to make the last-four stage. However, it was a largely disappointing day for Indians with former youth World champion Jyoti Gulia (51kg) and Bhagyabati Kachari (75kg) bowing out of women’s competition. With their loss, India's challenge in the women's draw has come to an end without an medal.  The results: Men: 52kg: Deepak Kumar bt Darislav Vasilev (Bul); +91kg: Gurgen Hovhannisyan (Arm) bt Manjeet Singh.   Women: 51kg: Lacramioara Perijoc (Rou) bt Jyoti Gulia; 75kg: Naomi Graham (USA) bt Bhagyabati Kachari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/deepak-in-semifinals/article33946398.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||NEUFC silences Blasters, enters semifinals||Just over a month ago, NorthEast United FC had sacked its head coach Gerard Nus. The team was in the seventh spot in the Hero Indian Super League at that time. After that, it has been a remarkable comeback for the side under interim coach Khalid Jamal. NEUFC defeated Kerala Blasters 2-0 at Vasco’s Tilak Maidan on Friday to seal a semifinal spot, after ATK Mohun Bagan and Mumbai City FC, as it moved to third and finished with 33 points in the league stage. Blasters remained 10th with 17 points. NEUFC needed just a point to progress to the playoffs, but with Blasters looking threatening in the first half-hour, the Highlanders realised that many red flags were popping up. They were a transformed lot after that, scoring twice within the space of 12 minutes to throw Blasters off the rails. V. Suhair opened the tally before youngster Lalengmawia Apuia came up with a beauty in the injury time of the first half to pull NEUFC ahead. The NorthEast side made most of its moves down the left flank. The Kerala-born Suhair danced past two defenders and goalkeeper Albino Gomes to find the target in the 34th minute after a Khassa Camara pass deflected off Kone. Blasters’ defence, the team’s bane this season, was in disarray during this phase. A few minutes later, the 20-year-old Lalengmawia unleashed a long-range bullet from the left. It hit the crossbar and went in, giving Gomes no chance. His first goal in the ISL was easily one of the best this season.  The result: NorthEast United 2 (Suhair 34, Lalengmawia Apuia 45+1) bt Kerala Blasters 0.

The government is working on a sporting ecosystem. Khelo India excellence centres are coming up in Jammu and Srinagar besides Khelo India centres in 20 districts,” said Modi. He said the second edition of the Winter Games at Gulmarg will prepare sportsmen for bigger international platforms like the Olympics. “This event will make J&K a hub of sports activity,” he said. Modi said the players participating in the event epitomises the ‘one India, one nation’ spirit. “This year, participation has doubled from the States and Union Territories,” he said. He said the J&K sportsmen did well last time and those from across the country will watch them and learn from each other this time. An official told The Hindu that  around 1200 athletes and guests from across the country will participate in multiple events, including snowshoe race, ice skating, ice hockey, skiing, Nordic ski, snowboarding, ski mountaineering, ice stock, etc. Around 840 athletes will vie for honours in the competitions being held for the second time in a bid to promote sports activities and adventure tourism in the region. “A special team of doctors and ambulances have been directed to be available round the clock.

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Delightful Awadhi feast||It was a matter of ‘izzat’ or prestige, we’d been told. A friend’s son had got married, and the bride’s party was coming from Lucknow for a reception in Delhi. Now Lucknow-wallahs, as we know, are fiercely proud of their cuisine and convinced that nothing beats Awadhi food. But we Dillwallahas have our pride, too. So we were told by the groom’s family that we had to ensure the food served at the wedding reception would leave everyone licking their fingers. What does one do in a situation like this but knock at the doors of Kallan Bawarchi? Kallan Bawarchi was one of the best ustads of Old Delhi and he agreed to take care of the food. Those who have had his korma and biryani still go ecstatic about it. The reception, I am happy to say, had a table that people recalled for years after that. Kallan is no more, but his descendants haven’t forgotten the magic that he wielded with his karchi and degh. They are still cooking delicious Delhi dishes, as I learnt some days ago. I received a message from an outlet called Khansaama last week. They offer different kinds of non-vegetarian delicacies from the walled city, and deliver in Delhi NCR. The food is cooked by three chefs that Khansaama has engaged. Kallan Bawarchi’s dishes are among the dishes that it offers. The food, indeed, has all the flavours that Old Delhi is known for. The meat in the korma was tender, and the gravy had the mildly sweet taste of fried onions. I loved the stew – meat cooked with yoghurt and onions, and flavoured with red chillies, green chillies, black pepper, cardamom and ginger. The achari gosht – with its tangy, pickle-like taste -- was noteworthy as well, and the nihari was good, too. The gravy had soaked in all the flavours of the meat and spices, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, as I dipped a piece of the sweet khamiri roti into the gravy. The seekh kabab, however, needs to be addressed. It was much too dry and rubbery. Seekh kababs can lose their taste if not eaten soon after being taken off the grill. They are best when moist and soft – and hot! Khansaama was started last year, in the midst of the pandemic, and is going strong. The kitchen, one of the owners Sameer Ahmed tells me, is in Pahari Bhojala in Old Delhi. For orders, you have to call 9311611317 or 8595831317. The food is delivered in earthenware handis, which Khansaama tells us can be used later for plants. The rates are reasonable. They have some special platters that are value for money. A meat platter for two (Rs. 1,399) consists of korma, nihari, stew, biryani, kabab, rotis and dessert. The platter for two with chicken dishes is for Rs. 1,050. The Khansaama thhali is for Rs. 499 – and consists of biryani, korma, nihari, kabab, gulab jamun, a khamiri roti and a roomali roti. You can order a full plate or a half plate of the dishes -- korma and nihari (Rs. 499/Rs. 265), biryani (Rs. 500/Rs. 285), mutton stew (Rs. 499/Rs. 265), chicken achari (Rs. 380/Rs. 215). Shahi tukda is for Rs. 65. I had a bit of the shahi tukda and went back into time. A community meal now seems like an event from another age. Meanwhile, though, there is always Khansaama .

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I don’t belong anywhere’||Over the years, actor Manoj Bajpayee has turned into Mr Reliable, one of those rare actors who can rise above a bad script and lend it some semblance of respect. Give him a well-written role though, and a sensitive director, and you can see him transform on screen — like he did in Gali Guleiyan , Bhonsle and even Amazon Prime’s The Family Man . In his next outing on Zee 5, Silence Can You Hear It , co-starring Prachi Desai and Arjun Mathur, we’ll see him playing a cop investigating the mysterious disappearance of a woman. Bajpayee, the son of a farmer, has often said he thinks in Bhojpuri. Last September, he made headlines for rapping the number ‘Bambai main ka ba’, highlighting the plight of migrant workers. “The mindset of a migrant never changes, no matter how much you earn, how big a property you live in, how happy a family you have. It is a feeling of not belonging anywhere. It hangs in the air, neither here nor there. I’ve gone through that feeling,” he says, adding that this may be why he continues to try new things. Edited excerpts from an interview done over voice notes, rich with his trademark pauses: Your thoughts on Silence Can You Hear It and how you respond to the mystery/thriller/horror genre? This is one genre I’ve not done and the script is fantastic. I’ve worked with Kiran Deohans [producer], who was the cinematographer of Aks . He’s prolific and his wife, Aban, had been wanting to direct a feature for a long time. She loves this genre and when she pitched the film to me, I wanted to do it as an actor and a friend. The experience of making it was amazing: the livewire cast, the fun, the hard work. Reports from the edit room are encouraging too. You lost weight and immunity when shooting for Gali Guleiyan and said you felt you werebecomingthe performance. Are you involved at this level for every role?  When I am working on a film, that’s the only life for me at that point of time, and whatever that character demands we all go the extra mile to give it. My character in Gali... of a shopkeeper who observes people through a hidden camera, was one such. I could not afford to hold back. It [the character] was screaming out loud, so I had to go ahead and experiment, internally and externally. Somewhere on the 28th or 29th day, I started experiencing the sound of a whistle in my mind. I knew something was not right and we still had six days to go for my portion to get over. I requested Dipesh Jain [the director] to wrap up my scene in time and he, along with the producer, were very careful. I was almost on the verge of a breakdown and no one knew how to help. Dipesh kept getting me cold drinks to cool me down [laughs]. This, when all I possibly needed was to be put to bed and told to sleep. But it is worth it in the end.  This itch to perform, can you describe it?   I don’t know how to think of anything else, nor do I know when this madness of playing a character will go away. When I shoot, I don’t stay at home. I stay in a faraway hotel, so I can be secluded and in character. I don’t take messages or do interviews. I am not available to anyone but my family — we speak over the phone once or twice a week. They understand that the roles I do require this kind of aloofness and I am blessed that way. This itch is not an itch; it is a full-blown disease. I can’t describe it, but I feel complete fulfilment when I do a good scene. I feel a joy I don’t feel otherwise.  You’ve often said you don’t like nostalgia — everyone’s comfort zone.     Living in the past makes you still. You’re mentally always trying to go back, and it discourages you from being happy in the present or to look forward to a greater experience. I go back to my village [Belwa in Bihar’s West Champaran], and realise that my feelings are not the same. They belong to a different time, age and atmosphere, and cannot be repeated.        Having been in the industry for so long, does OTT help you carve new paths?   I came into the industry in the 90s. Doing one film your way was so difficult, like you were asking for the sky. Now, with OTT, there are so many offers, so many talented newcomers, superlative performers such as Pratik Gandhi, Pankaj Tripathi, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vijay Varma, Gulshan Devaiah, Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajkummar Rao. I am very glad they are doing well and creating a body of work they will be proud of. That has been my focus — creating a filmography that will give me some kind of satisfaction that I’ve done well. Silence Can You Hear It premieres on Zee5 on March 26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/i-dont-belong-anywhere/article33946187.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Petrol high||Let me tell you a kutti story. Why? Because, in our culture, we always begin with a story. Centuries ago, even before Mukesh Khanna was born, there was a great man called Ramarananda Pillarahamsa. Vexed with the slow pace of the time, this learned sage mixed a few magical herbs together, smoked a part of it, and used the rest to invent an oil he named vahana prayana thailam . When chariot wheels were greased with this oil, their horsepower doubled. Which was just as well because nubile vanakanyas of yore were fleet of foot and could outrun outdated chariots. With the invention of this oil, they became much easier to catch, and this resulted in a decline in the ancient divorce rate. Unfortunately for us, the diabolical Arabs, bent on destroying our family structure, built an underground tunnel into our ancient land via Kerala, bribed the caretakers with aromatic biryani, and took the formula and our massive oil stocks away. They named it petrol, and hid it under the desert sands. And that was how, we, the rightful owners of this invention, became slaves of the Arabs and their second cousins, the Mughals. (And that is why, to this day, we order six lakh biryanis per minute on Swiggy.) Cut to the present: petrol prices are skyrocketing. The ‘librus’, tukde-tukdes, urban naxals and andolanjeevis are going on and on about it. That’s because they don’t get the narrative. They don’t see the chronology. I say the price of petrol is not high enough. Here’s why. When the price of diamonds goes up, do we crib? Similarly, when Akki ups his fee, a Merc becomes more expensive or Sundar Pichai gets a salary hike, do we see it as a problem? No. We celebrate it. We put those things on the Forbes list. Let’s put our beloved land on the Forbes list of Number One in Petrol Prices. What better way for us to be perceived as a rich country, I say? That apart, I see the price rise as a masterstroke. Here’s why. If we steadily increase the price of petrol every month, this is what will happen. In the beginning, people will make up for the shortfall by driving their vehicles for a bit and pushing them manually for a bit. Result: all our vehicles automatically become hybrid vehicles, pollution will lessen, Greta Thunberg will shut up, our population will become fitter, gyms will close down, and Malaika, Ananya and Janhvi will be on the roads. Not in a bad way. But pushing their BMWS. Next, when the petrol prices become so high, as I hope they will, people will stop buying petrol altogether. And horses will come back in a big way. Imagine the scene. It’ll be like the Golden Age of the Gupta jis all over again. Where are we going to get so many horses for such a large population so quickly? I’ll answer that Nehruvian question even before you ask it. Babaji, always ahead of the game, would have developed horse’s eggs by then in his lab, using a patented mix of horseradish, peacock tears and duck flatus. Each family will buy the required number of horse’s eggs and hatch them in their 2BHKs. The little ponies will make great playmates for the children. And when schools reopen, the entire family can ride off in different directions. Daddy to the bar, Mummy to office, and little Chintu and Meghavarshini to school to learn to be patriots. Good times, I tell you, good times. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/petrol-high/article33946207.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Lutyens, Louboutin and levity||Continuing my India travels, I finally made it to Delhi to see my parents — after a year. While there, I was circumspect about stepping out, but did manage to meet a few people outdoors. I always have major real estate envy when I come to the capital. Its sprawling homes, with their large lawns and terraces, make even the swankiest Mumbai homes look cramped. Delhi wouldn’t be Delhi without its over-the-top indulgences. As I dug into a hot aloo-tikki on a cool evening in the massive garden of a beautiful Lutyens bungalow, my girlfriend leaned in to tell me about a mutual acquaintance. “I saw him recently and he went on about a dinner party where fabulous wines costing Rs. 3 lakh were served,” she sniffed. “Three lakhs!” I repeated. My friend continued, “So irritating. Why didn’t he tell me about it? There are hardly any events to wear nice clothes to. I would also have gone.” “But you don’t even drink,” I countered. She flashed me a smile and shrugged. I managed to meet my art gallerist pal Roshini Vadehra at her recently-renovated office terrace. Over tea and peanut butter cookies, she told me about On Site, a collaborative art show by four galleries at Delhi’s Bikaner House, including Vadehra, Nature Morte, Chemould Prescott Road and Experimenter. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to attend the show, nor the Covid-19 protocol friendly fêtes being planned, including a dinner hosted by art patron-socialite, Shalini Passi. Back in Mumbai, there’s talk of a second Covid wave. Given the uncertainty, I was glad I had hosted a small dinner party at home in early February. To liven things up, I had turned to Mona Ahuja, who creates fabulous table settings out of things she finds in people’s homes. In my case, that had meant placing a few of my coffee table books alongside candles, crystal and silver. I would never have thought to put these contrasting elements together, but Mona clearly has a gift. Another thing I was glad I did — because who knows when one can do so again — was to venture out to watch a movie. Not in any old movie theatre, but the cosy and glamorous one at the members-only Soho House, which I hadn’t visited in a year. My friend Anjali Gaekwar, who runs the fancy shoe brand Christian Louboutin in India, had invited me to a screening of a documentary on the designer. Alongside displays of the new fall collection and glasses of Champagne, I met Jim Sarbh, the Made in Heaven web series actor. He regaled us with a crazy lockdown story involving adopting a stray cat, whom he lost and then serendipitously found again. Later I sat socially-distanced in the small cinema and learned about Louboutin — did you know that he ran away from home as a teenager and spent a year in India? Afterwards, I went upstairs to dine outdoors, while a DJ played some tunes. For that magical hour and a half, it seemed as though the pandemic didn’t exist. Speaking of coming to India, it looks like February is the new December for NRIs. Because of travel restrictions, I have two friends visiting Mumbai at this very moment — one from Europe and the other from the US. It is wonderful to see old friends after ages, and it is also fun when they bring the world to your doorstep. My friend Jory Syed, a former Fendi executive and former PR head for Ermenegildo Zegna in the Americas, had carried some goodies for me by Jaline, a new resort label founded by New York-based Jacqueline Lopez.

I think the terms ACL tear and orthopaedic  were only possibly coined a few years after the first few ski slopes had been set up and people had hurtled down them at blistering speeds while trying to stay upright on what were basically two planks of wood. At some point in your life , you will feel the need to do this and rather than try to explain it away, here is me encouraging you to do it ; it’s way cheaper than a frontal lobotomy and all that snow and cold acts like a natural anaesthetic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/your-ultimate-gulmarg-ski-guide/article33946262.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Tempeh for mixed company||My first encounter with mock meat was at a tiny stall in Andheri five years back. Amid the throng of kiosks selling kebabs and tikkas was Chaap ki Chhap. It looked like any of its neighbours, skewers of cubed ‘meat’ hanging over an open flame. Except this meat was actually soya. More recently, I tried another variant — pulled jackfruit served on a latke , accompanying cups of delicate sencha tea. The jackfruit felt closer to meat than the soya did, with its stringy texture and ability to hold flavour. Today the options are increasing and the conversation around alternative meats is picking up — and not just because India Protein Day (February 27) is turning the focus on plant-based sources of the macronutrient. “The pandemic has taught us how animal agriculture is not sustainable and we have to move to superior sources of protein,” says Siddharth Kothari, Chief Investment Strategist of Om Kothari Group, which invests in plant-based protein. Interestingly, the people making the shift aren’t just vegans. “There are vegetarians looking to add more protein to their diet. Also, a lot of folks who label themselves non-vegetarian actually consume more vegetarian food and are missing out on nutrition potency. So they are seeking out alternative sources too,” says Siddharth Ramasubramanian, CEO of Vegolution, a Bengaluru-based nutrition start-up that makes vegetarian protein-rich food.  Faux and lovely  The last year has seen the launch of the Greenest range of kebabs in Delhi; plant-based chicken nuggets and kheema (from soybeans and peas) by Mumbai start-up Blue Tribe Foods; and jackfruit meat by Wakao Foods in Goa. There’s also ProPlant Foods working on a chicken alternative using elephant foot yam. And Bollywood actors Genelia and Riteish Deshmukh have announced a venture called Imagine Meats. “It is tasty and versatile. Today, people want to enjoy their food and feel satisfied that they are getting the nutrition they need, and plant-based protein fits these requirements,” says Ramasubramanian. This week, Vegolution will release a range of ready-to-eat tempeh products under the brand, Hello Tempayy. Made from fermented soybeans, its umami flavour and firm texture are pluses, as are its probiotic qualities and protein content — it contains all the essential amino acids and 18 gm protein (per 100 gm). Vegolution’s three options (Szechuan Chilli, Tawa Masala and Sriracha) are also fortified with Vitamin B12 and iron. Plant-based protein is a great transitional food for people who are trying to adopt healthier diets. “Consumers are ready to experiment with healthy offerings. If it is clean and wholesome, they will pay a little extra for it,” says Sairaj Dhond, of Wakao Foods. As a child growing up in Goa, he recalls eating the tropical fruit — which his grandmother called chicken- achi bhaji — in several home preparations. Dhond chose to work with jackfruit because it not only offered a similar texture and appearance to meat, but it is also nutritionally rich — chock-full of fibre, but with no fat or cholesterol.  Trials in the kitchen  A 2019 study by Mumbai-based nonprofit, Good Food Institute, had found that 63% of Indians are likely to purchase plant-based meat regularly. The numbers would have certainly gone up post pandemic, and brands are responding to this increase in consumer awareness by tying up with restaurants and food delivery services to better their visibility and reach. Vegolution is in talks with health food delivery spaces, restaurants, and cloud kitchens in Bengaluru, while Wakao retails at 27 outlets, and 30 restaurants and resorts in Goa. Yauatcha uses mock meat across their restaurants in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata — in dim sum, stir-fry and noodles, including their bestseller, Mock Meat Poached Peking Dumpling. “It has always been widely used in Cantonese cooking as an alternative,” says Kushal Lama, the head chef of Yauatcha Kolkata. “It is the middle ground that people can agree to when ordering for the table, as it is liked by both meat eaters and vegetarians.” Bastian in Mumbai chose to add it in the form of soy products and tofu. “We are seeing a growing consciousness among our guests to eat more plant-based food,” says Amol Phute, Chef de Cuisine, Bastian Hospitality Pvt Ltd. A few home chefs are also experimenting with creating their own alt-meats. Mumbai-based lawyer, Uma Arora, has been making tempeh for over a year. A family staple, she now takes orders under her brand, Culture Bakes. “People are becoming aware of plant-based protein, but there’s still a lot of education needed to convince them to make the switch,” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/tempeh-for-mixed-company/article33946246.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Calling homegrown writers||Ranjeet Pratap Singh (32), co-founder and CEO of Pratilipi, a homegrown storytelling platform, and Sumit Menaria, one of its star authors, share few similarities. While Singh is an engineer who grew up in Fattepur, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, Menaria — whose novel is scheduled to be published in the first week of March — is a chartered accountant who hails from Udaipur in Rajasthan. What bonds the two, however, is a love of books. And Pratilipi. The idea for the storytelling platform had gestated for many years, says Singh. While studying engineering in Bhubaneshwar, he had found that not only was the availability of Hindi content (offline) limited, it was also practically non-existent online. “I would crib that it should be my choice to read something in English; not because of lack of access,” he says, recalling that the pursuit of a career had him pushing aside thoughts about how to resolve the problem. But when he quit an unchallenging job a few years ago, he got thinking. And Pratilipi (Sanskrit for ‘copy’) was born. Incorporated in 2015, it now boasts 3 lakh writers in 12 Indian languages, including Hindi, English, Urdu and Odia, and has over 2.5 crore readers. “The idea behind it was very simple. We wanted to build a platform where anybody can publish their work, in any language, set in any place. While there is some public domain content [such as Jane Austen’s works], 99% is fresh, contemporary content published by new writers,” he says. The most popular format is the long story/novel. The ‘write’ stuff Menaria (29), who joined Pratilipi in 2017, started by writing poems and short stories. Following good reviews, he wrote a novel in Hindi, Tashree: Don’t Look into Her Eyes . Its success — with a total readership of 74,924 and a rating of 4.7 — has led to the book deal with Bhopal-based Manjul Publishing House and a comic book with Pratilpi Comics (launched in February 2020). “It isn’t the usual love story,” says Menaria, who was pleasantly surprised by the response to Tashree , a spiritual-thriller featuring a college girl. Incidentally, thrillers and romances do well on the site. Did 2020’s downtime reveal any new trends? “If you look at the various regions and languages, there are a lot of differences in what genres people like. But at the top are suspense/thriller, romance and horror,” says Singh, who used to devour Champak and Nanhe Samrat as a boy before moving on to classics by Premchand and Nirala. He says historical fiction also got a boost during the lockdown. Making story lists Interestingly, Pratilipi gathers data about everything, including where someone stopped reading a book. ‘‘We try to focus on [good] content, which is why the completion rate is one of the most important parameters.” Any work uploaded on the site has to be original or something that the writer owns the copyright to. “Also, any content that goes against Indian laws is not allowed, such as pornography and hate speech.” I had come across a story that seemed to violate one of these norms. “Readers can flag anything that violates our terms of service, and our content moderation team will take it down,” he says, adding that they have internal checks as well. Web series next Pratilipi recently announced a partnership with entertainment company Yali DreamWorks to develop and co-produce a web series based on a book trilogy — Murdo Ki Train , Shaitan Se Samjhauta and Niya — by Varsha Srivastava. There are other big plans too. “Along with Storytel and Manjul, we have an exciting licensing opportunity that I cannot talk about just yet,” says Singh. Meanwhile, people have been contacting Menaria for advice. “I tell everyone to start writing and to put it on Pratilipi.” Having finished his second novel, Anamika , last year, this is sound advice, indeed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/calling-homegrown-writers/article33946214.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Back in Bera||After 2020’s Calcuttascape: Musings of a Globetrotter , Rajasthan-born Sundeep Bhutoria has a coffee table book dedicated to the famed leopards of Bera. While the former is a compilation of the social activist’s columns and blogs, Bera Bond  takes us through his journey in 2016 — into the leopard colony in the forests of Rajasthan. The land where the big cats have been cohabiting with humans for over a century offered a “unique learning of coexistence and harmony that was both beautiful and bewildering”, says Bhutoria. With stunning photographs and inside stories — in his introduction, actor-writer Victor Banerjee paints a picture of a ‘Marwari cowboy’ courtesy Bhutoria’s jodhpurs and Stetson hat — the book was compiled during lockdown. The writer credits Bera-based conservationist and photographer Shatrunjay Pratap Singh, who was his guide.  Edited excerpts from an interview : Snapshots from Bera... One of the highlights of my stay was being able to name a leopard cub, at the request of the locals. I named it Gullu. In Bera, the sunsets are breathtaking, and it is not the angle at which the sun goes down or even the colour of the sky. It is the fruit bats that fill up the night sky just as the sun is about to sink into the horizon. They are noisy and smelly, and are attracted to fermenting fruit, but thousands of them in the sky is a sight to behold! What did you learn from Shatrunjay Pratap Singh?     The best thing about travelling with Shatrunjay was his ability to spot a leopard camouflaged against the landscape. He would just pass me the telescope and say something like, “After three rocks, there is one,” and then I would be able to see it. Leopards are reclusive animals, so they’re a lot harder to spot.

Abbott Bungalow has survived three generations — perhaps because it was built prioritising features like natural cooling, solar orientation and sustainable materials such as stone floors and walls made with chuna (lime), husk and mud. The very factors that are lacking in most ‘modern’ structures. This is one of the reasons why sustainability in design is now being recognised and rewarded. At the recently-concluded ArchDaily Building of the Year 2021 competition, for instance, natural materials were in the spotlight. Bamboo hostels in China, a circular glass Apple Store (with 1,461 white oak slats forming a central canopy) in Thailand, among others, were adjudged winners. What caught our eye: multipurpose residences on Iran’s Hormuz island, with colourful domes, built with architect Nader Khalili’s superadobe technique (using layered bags filled with adobe). If you’re wondering why domes... because they are familiar structures in the region and their small scale makes them compatible with the building capabilities of local craftsmen. As we enter a post-pandemic reality, built environments are set to evolve even more — embracing both local sensibilities and cutting-edge technology. Think upcycled wood, debris walls, plastic waste blocks, light generating cement, and air cleaning bricks. Research projects such as the one at Lancaster University a few years ago, which found that adding nanoplatelets of carrots and sugar beets ‘can strengthen concrete while reducing the volume of cement required’, are increasing too. India, for one, is looking into bamboo and recycled/upcycled materials such as plastic, carbon, and rice husk. On the down side, however, many of these experiments don’t find a place in mainstream construction. Experts say prohibitive testing and industrial production costs, the need for skilled labour and consumer willingness, to an extent, are to blame. “There is resistance to trying the offbeat,” says Pavitra Sriprakash, director of Chennai-based Shilpa Architects Planners Designers, who encourages her clients to use tiles made of recycled plastic or PET bottles as panel walls. What we need is more people adopting local, carbon negative, and alternative building materials. To spread the word, and to rethink old requirements. Here are five architects who are doing just that, and hopefully, paving the way for others to follow.                                                    Architect Deepak Guggari recalls playing with cardboard boxes as a child. Now it has come full circle with his project, Office in Cardboard. Shortlisted for the Dezeen Awards 2020 (in the large workspace interior category), the 2018 project’s partition walls are made entirely from honeycomb board (cardboard) and MDF. “As the client, Star Engineers, is eco-inclined, I thought why not let it reflect in the office. Although cardboard is a tough material, it is lightweight and has good compressive strength. It turned out to be fabulous,” says Guggari, adding that it was a zero-waste construction as any waste material was picked up by locals to upcycle. The nine-inch thick walls used at the 13,000 sq ft space are fabulous for acoustics, he explains, and they have interesting cross sections — a combination of sharp ends and rough cuts to give it an organic feel. Addressing drawbacks, Guggaru says he was worried about the monsoon but the structure has remained intact for two seasons and it is a success. “The other factor is that cardboard has to be used in a controlled atmosphere [air conditioned, no water, etc]. Which is why we tried not to have any internal wiring,” says the designer who now wants to experiment with mud and concrete walls, plastic bricks, and bricks from waste.

Addressing drawbacks, Guggaru says he was worried about the monsoon but the structure has remained intact for two seasons and it is a success. “The other factor is that cardboard has to be used in a controlled atmosphere [air conditioned, no water, etc]. Which is why we tried not to have any internal wiring,” says the designer, who now wants to experiment with mud and concrete walls, plastic bricks, and bricks from waste.

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Average apartment sizes on the rise||In a major trend reversal in the post COVID-19 pandemic world, ‘bigger is better’ is once again the catch-phrase on the Indian housing market. Anarock data confirms that average apartment sizes in the top seven cities have risen by 10% on a yearly basis — to 1,150 sq. ft. in 2020 from 1,050 sq. ft. in 2019. Past four-year trends indicate that average apartment sizes were reducing y-o-y since 2016. 2017 saw the maximum yearly decline of 13% in average apartment sizes in the top cities against the preceding year — from 1,440 sq. ft. in 2016 to nearly 1,260 sq. ft. in 2017. A fairly sudden change in consumer preferences to the backdrop of COVID-19 exigencies in 2020 first halted, then reversed the trend. Growth drivers The average apartment size is still highest in Hyderabad at 1,750 sq. ft. among the top cities — approx. 2x bigger than that in MMR where, at 932 sq. ft., average sizes continue to be the lowest. MMR nevertheless saw the maximum rise of 21% — from 773 sq. ft. in 2019 to 932 sq. ft. in 2020. Pune came next with a 12% annual increase in average apartment sizes — from 878 sq. ft. in 2019 to 986 sq. ft. in 2020. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants says, “The two main reasons for apartment sizes reducing in previous years were affordability and millennials’ preference for low-maintenance homes. Keen to generate more buyer interest with smaller price-tags, developers whittled down their flat sizes. 2020 saw an almost immediate reversal of buyer preferences. With the focus switching to accommodating the WFH and learn-from-home culture, flat sizes began increasing for the first time in four years.” Indian developers were quick to catch on that size matters again and the second half of 2020 saw average apartment sizes in the top seven cities increase by approximately 10%. MMR and Pune, which had the smallest average flat sizes among all top cities, saw the maximum increase in 2020 over the previous year — by 21% and 12% respectively. City-wise trends Here’s how India’s leading cities performed: While MMR saw the maximum rise of 21% in average flat size, the region continues to have the smallest average apartments among all top cities (932 sq. ft.)      Hyderabad still had the highest average apartment size of 1,750 sq. ft. in 2020, increasing by just 3% against 1,700 sq. ft. in 2019      Bengaluru’s average apartment size also increased by 3% — from 1,280 sq. ft. in 2019 to 1,320 sq. ft. in 2020  In NCR, average apartment size was 1,290 sq. ft. in 2020 as against 1,250 sq. ft. in 2019 — a y-oy increase of 3%  Chennai saw average sizes increase by 9% during the period — from 1,100 sq. ft. in 2019 to nearly 1,200 sq. ft. in 2020  In Kolkata, average apartment size increased by 10% — from 1,000 sq. ft. in 2019 to 1,100 sq. ft. in 2020  Pune saw average flat sizes increase by 12% in a year — from 878 sq. ft. in 2019 to nearly 986 sq. ft. in 2020  MMR saw the highest rise of 21% – from 773 sq. ft. in 2019 to nearly 932 sq. ft. in 2020 Anarock Property Consultants  The second half of 2020 saw average apartment sizes in the top seven cities increase by approximately 10%||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/average-apartment-sizes-on-the-rise/article33946266.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The magic of mud||Ihave been fascinated by mud houses for as long as I can remember. That feeling of being enclosed within earthen walls, with its natural fragrance and visual appeal is truly invigorating. Mud houses stay naturally cool and breathable and have proven to be healthy for us as well as the environment. Mud or earth is one of the most common building materials that has been used globally for centuries. Readily available all over the world, it is natural, pliable and attains strength over time. Being insulating and breathable, it is suitable for any climate. In addition, it is aesthetically pleasing, fairly easy to build with, does not need skilled labour and can be cost-effective if the mud is sourced locally. Dried naturally in the sun, mud construction does not involve the extensive firing or manufacturing process that other materials require, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable construction techniques. Here’s how you can use the material in different ways:  Adobe: This method was originally widely used in North Africa, and in southern Spain. The word ‘adobe’ means ‘mud brick’ in Spanish. Soil is combined with water and organic binders such as hay and straw which also offer the tensile strength required. This soil mixture is then moulded into bricks which are dried in the sun and stacked to form walls.  Rammed earth: It is one of the earliest methods found to be first used in China and parts of Europe. Today we can find rammed earth structures worldwide. The technique involves compacting a damp mixture of soil and organic binders or stabilisers into a formwork. The soil mixture is compacted in batches until the height of the wall is achieved. A long ramming pole is used for tamping (compacting) the soil into the mould. This method results in beautiful, monolithic wall surfaces. The finishing of the wall surfaces can be done by carving or mould impressions before the wall dries.  Cob: This is yet another method found to be used first in North Africa and Spain. It has been widely used in southwest England since the 15th century. In Old English, ‘cob’ meant ‘lump or rounded mass’. This involves creating small hand sized lumps of the soil and binder mixture and stacking them in rows, stitching (tying) them together and allowing them to dry naturally until the walls go up. The wall surfaces are literally ‘sculpted’ into shape, making cob construction a very aesthetic and sensory experience. Due to the simplicity and ease of construction, organic forms are a possibility using cob.  Compressed Earth Block (CEB): This is a method where walls are made from blocks of dampsoil and stabiliser compressed at high pressure. A mechanical press is used for compression. If the blocks are stabilised with a chemical binder such as cement they are called Compressed Stabilised Earth Block (CSEB) or Stabilised Earth Block (SEB). These blocks are then assembled onto walls using standard masonrytechniques. These techniques aside, some of the other methods of using mud include the straw bale and wattle and daub. Mud construction and its benefits have been long forgotten in the quest for modernisation and mass-produced building materials. Today, however, it is heartening to see a renewed interest in the use of mud construction from people wishing to build independent homes. Considering the state of our environment, this is a good time to focus on bringing back aspects of this wonderful construction methodology into the urban context.

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||NRIs eye luxury homes post-COVID||In an interesting twist in the post-COVID-19 real estate landscape, NRIs are once again scouting for Indian luxury homes. As per real estate consultancy Anarock’s latest consumer survey, at least 73% NRIs now prefer properties priced between Rs. 90 lakh and Rs. 2.5 crore. In the pre-COVID survey (H2 2019), just 41% preferred properties within this price bracket — most favoured affordable and mid-segment homes. 3 and 4 BHK options currently top their wish-list. The IT hubs of Bengaluru (24%) and Pune (19%) are seeing the highest NRI demand. Collectively, these two cities saw approx. 48,370 homes sold in 2020 — accounting for a 35% sales share among the top 7 cities. Prashant Thakur, Director & Head - Research, Anarock Property Consultants says, “The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the emotional association of long-term security with physical assets for NRIs. Close to 63% of the polled NRIs state this as their reason for buying homes in India now. They are also driven by the uncertainties posed by COVID-19. Luxury properties have emerged as a hot favourite with NRIs because of the depreciating rupee value translating into greater buying power, coupled with ongoing developer discounts and offers. A majority of NRIs are buying for end-use, not as investments.” According to the survey, at least 67% of the polled NRIs are looking for ready-to-move-in homes. If we consider the overall survey trends (including NRIs and resident Indians) just 29% preferred to buy ready homes, with another 27% respondents preferring under-construction properties that will be delivered within a year.  Of the total 24% survey respondents who already booked properties in the last six months, at least 38% were NRIs looking to make the most of the prevailing market conditions in India, including discounts, offers and lowest-best home loan rates. Also, 86% of the polled NRIs will only consider properties by branded developers who have the highest project completion capabilities, resulting in the lowest execution risk. Another reason for this choice is their desire to buy into projects with international-grade amenities. According to the survey, most NRIs seeking property in India are aged between 35 and 45 years. Close to 68% of the respondents considered real estate as the best asset class for them at this time. Regarding their outlook on residential prices, at least 44% respondents felt that prices will remain stable in the short-term (i.e. 12 months), while 27% feel they will increase during the year. Over the long term (i.e. in the next 5 years), 92% NRI respondents are of the opinion that prices will increase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/nris-eye-luxury-homes-post-covid/article33946271.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Petrol high||Let me tell you a kutti story. Why? Because, in our culture, we always begin with a story. Centuries ago, even before Mukesh Khanna was born, there was a great man called Ramarananda Pillarahamsa. Vexed with the slow pace of the time, this learned sage mixed a few magical herbs together, smoked a part of it, and used the rest to invent an oil he named vahana prayana thailam . When chariot wheels were greased with this oil, their horsepower doubled. Which was just as well because nubile vanakanyas of yore were fleet of foot and could outrun outdated chariots. With the invention of this oil, they became much easier to catch, and this resulted in a decline in the ancient divorce rate. Unfortunately for us, the diabolical Arabs, bent on destroying our family structure, built an underground tunnel into our ancient land via Kerala, bribed the caretakers with aromatic biryani, and took the formula and our massive oil stocks away. They named it petrol, and hid it under the desert sands. And that was how, we, the rightful owners of this invention, became slaves of the Arabs and their second cousins, the Mughals. (And that is why, to this day, we order six lakh biryanis per minute on Swiggy.) Cut to the present: petrol prices are skyrocketing. The ‘librus’, tukde-tukdes, urban naxals and andolanjeevis are going on and on about it. That’s because they don’t get the narrative. They don’t see the chronology. I say the price of petrol is not high enough. Here’s why. When the price of diamonds goes up, do we crib? Similarly, when Akki ups his fee, a Merc becomes more expensive or Sundar Pichai gets a salary hike, do we see it as a problem? No. We celebrate it. We put those things on the Forbes list. Let’s put our beloved land on the Forbes list of Number One in Petrol Prices. What better way for us to be perceived as a rich country, I say? That apart, I see the price rise as a masterstroke. Here’s why. If we steadily increase the price of petrol every month, this is what will happen. In the beginning, people will make up for the shortfall by driving their vehicles for a bit and pushing them manually for a bit. Result: all our vehicles automatically become hybrid vehicles, pollution will lessen, Greta Thunberg will shut up, our population will become fitter, gyms will close down, and Malaika, Ananya and Janhvi will be on the roads. Not in a bad way. But pushing their BMWS. Next, when the petrol prices become so high, as I hope they will, people will stop buying petrol altogether. And horses will come back in a big way. Imagine the scene. It’ll be like the Golden Age of the Gupta jis all over again. Where are we going to get so many horses for such a large population so quickly? I’ll answer that Nehruvian question even before you ask it. Babaji, always ahead of the game, would have developed horse’s eggs by then in his lab, using a patented mix of horseradish, peacock tears and duck flatus. Each family will buy the required number of horse’s eggs and hatch them in their 2BHKs. The little ponies will make great playmates for the children. And when schools reopen, the entire family can ride off in different directions. Daddy to the bar, Mummy to office, and little Chintu and Meghavarshini to school to learn to be patriots. Good times, I tell you, good times. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist.

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I don’t belong anywhere’||Over the years, actor Manoj Bajpayee has turned into Mr. Reliable, one of those rare actors who can rise above a bad script and lend it some semblance of respect. Give him a well-written role though, and a sensitive director, and you can see him transform on screen — like he did in Gali Guleiyan , Bhonsle and even Amazon Prime’s The Family Man . In his next outing on Zee 5, Silence Can You Hear It , co-starring Prachi Desai and Arjun Mathur, we’ll see him playing a police officer investigating the disappearance of a woman. Bajpayee, the son of a farmer, has often said he thinks in Bhojpuri. Last September, he made headlines for rapping the number ‘Bambai main ka ba’, highlighting the plight of migrant workers. “The mindset of a migrant never changes, no matter how much you earn, how big a property you live in, how happy a family you have. It is a feeling of not belonging anywhere. It hangs in the air, neither here nor there. I’ve gone through that feeling,” he says, adding that this may be why he continues to try new things. Edited excerpts from an interview done over voice notes, rich with his trademark pauses: Your thoughts on Silence Can You Hear It and how you respond to the mystery/thriller/horror genre?  This is one genre I’ve not done and the script is fantastic. I’ve worked with Kiran Deohans [producer], who was the cinematographer of Aks . He’s prolific and his wife, Aban, had been wanting to direct a feature for a long time. She loves this genre and when she pitched the film to me, I wanted to do it as an actor and a friend. The experience of making it was amazing: the livewire cast, the fun, the hard work. Reports from the edit room are encouraging too. You lost weight and immunity when shooting for Gali Guleiyan and said you felt you werebecomingthe performance. Are you involved at this level for every role?  When I am working on a film, that’s the only life for me at that point of time, and whatever that character demands we all go the extra mile to give it. My character in Gali... of a shopkeeper who observes people through a hidden camera, was one such. I could not afford to hold back. It [the character] was screaming out loud, so I had to go ahead and experiment, internally and externally. Somewhere on the 28th or 29th day, I started experiencing the sound of a whistle in my mind. I knew something was not right and we still had six days to go for my portion to get over. I requested Dipesh Jain [the director] to wrap up my scene in time and he, along with the producer, were very careful. I was almost on the verge of a breakdown and no one knew how to help. Dipesh kept getting me cold drinks to cool me down [laughs]. This, when all I possibly needed was to be put to bed and told to sleep. But it is worth it in the end.  This itch to perform, can you describe it?   I don’t know how to think of anything else, nor do I know when this madness of playing a character will go away. When I shoot, I don’t stay at home. I stay in a faraway hotel, so I can be secluded and in character. I don’t take messages or do interviews. I am not available to anyone but my family — we speak over the phone once or twice a week. They understand that the roles I do require this kind of aloofness and I am blessed that way. This itch is not an itch; it is a full-blown disease. I can’t describe it, but I feel complete fulfilment when I do a good scene. I feel a joy I don’t feel otherwise.  You’ve often said you don’t like nostalgia — everyone’s comfort zone.      Living in the past makes you still. You’re mentally always trying to go back, and it discourages you from being happy in the present or to look forward to a greater experience. I go back to my village [Belwa in Bihar’s West Champaran], and realise that my feelings are not the same. They belong to a different time, age and atmosphere, and cannot be repeated.  Can you go back and watch your work without critiquing it?   I mostly don’t watch my work as I’m too blunt and brash a self-critic. I have respect for reviewers and critics, but I look at things very differently. Craft is something I’ve always worked on — my voice, speech, diction, the sur . I look for the small rhythms, small gestures, the notes in speech. I am very finicky, and brutally frank [with myself] so I don’t need anyone else to criticise me.  Having been in the industry for so long, does OTT help you carve new paths?   I came into the industry in the 90s. Doing one film your way was so difficult, like you were asking for the sky. Now, with OTT, there are so many offers, so many talented newcomers, superlative performers such as Pratik Gandhi, Pankaj Tripathi, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vijay Varma, Gulshan Devaiah, Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajkummar Rao. I am very glad they are doing well and creating a body of work they will be proud of. That has been my focus — creating a filmography that will give me some kind of satisfaction that I’ve done well. Silence Can You Hear It premieres on Zee5 on March 26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/i-dont-belong-anywhere/article33946594.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Tempeh for mixed company||My first encounter with mock meat was at a tiny stall in Andheri five years ago. Amid the throng of kiosks selling kebabs and tikkas was Chaap ki Chhap. It looked like any of its neighbours, skewers of cubed ‘meat’ hanging over an open flame. Except this meat was actually soya. More recently, I tried another variant — pulled jackfruit served on a latke , accompanying cups of delicate sencha tea. The jackfruit felt closer to meat than the soya did, with its stringy texture and ability to hold flavour. Today the options are increasing and the conversation around alternative meats is picking up — and not just because India Protein Day (February 27) is turning the focus on plant-based sources of the macronutrient. “The pandemic has taught us how animal agriculture is not sustainable and we have to move to superior sources of protein,” says Siddharth Kothari, chief investment strategist of Om Kothari Group, which invests in plant-based protein. Interestingly, the people making the shift aren’t just vegans. “There are vegetarians looking to add more protein to their diet [especially athletes and those who take their fitness seriously]. Also, a lot of folks who label themselves non-vegetarian actually consume more vegetarian food and are missing out on nutrition potency. So they are seeking out alternative sources too,” says Siddharth Ramasubramanian, CEO of Vegolution, a Bengaluru-based nutrition start-up that makes vegetarian protein-rich food.  Faux and lovely  The last year has seen the launch of the Greenest range of kebabs in Delhi; plant-based chicken nuggets and kheema (from soybeans and peas) by Mumbai startup Blue Tribe Foods; jackfruit meat by Wakao Foods in Goa; and five tofu flavours (made from organic soybean) by Bengaluru’s Living Food Co. There’s also ProPlant Foods working on a chicken alternative using elephant foot yam. And Bollywood actors Genelia and Riteish Deshmukh recently announced a new plant-based venture called Imagine Meats. “It is tasty and versatile. Today, people want to enjoy their food and feel satisfied that they are getting the nutrition they need and plant-based protein fits these requirements,” says Ramasubramanian. This week, Vegolution will release a range of ready-to-eat tempeh products under the brand, Hello Tempayy. Made from fermented soybeans, its umami flavour and firm texture are pluses, as are its probiotic qualities and protein content — it contains all the essential amino acids and 18 gm protein (per 100 gm). Vegolution’s three options (Szechuan Chilli, Tawa Masala and Sriracha) are also fortified with Vitamin B12 and iron. Plant-based protein is a great transitional food for people who are trying to adopt healthier diets. “Consumers are ready to experiment with healthy offerings. If it is clean and wholesome, they will pay a little extra for it,” says Sairaj Dhond of Wakao Foods. As a child growing up in Goa, he recalls eating the tropical fruit — which his grandmother called chicken- achi bhaji — in several home preparations. Dhond chose to work with jackfruit because it not only offered a similar texture and appearance to meat, but it is also nutritionally rich — chock-full of fibre, but with no fat or cholesterol.  Trials in the kitchen  A 2019 study by Mumbai-based nonprofit, Good Food Institute, had found that 63% of Indians are likely to purchase plant-based meat regularly. The numbers would have certainly gone up post the COVID-19 pandemic, and brands are responding to this increase in consumer awareness by tying up with restaurants and food delivery services to better their visibility and reach. Vegolution is in talks with health food delivery spaces, restaurants, and cloud kitchens in Bengaluru, while Wakao retails at 27 outlets, and 30 restaurants and resorts in Goa. Yauatcha uses mock meat across their restaurants in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata — in dim sum, stir-fry and noodles, including their bestseller, Mock Meat Poached Peking Dumpling. “It has always been widely used in Cantonese cooking as an alternative,” says Kushal Lama, the head chef of Yauatcha Kolkata. “It is the middle ground that people can agree to when ordering for the table, as it is liked by both meat eaters and vegetarians.” Bastian in Mumbai chose to add it in the form of soy products and tofu. “We are seeing a growing consciousness among our guests to eat more plant-based food,” says Amol Phute, Chef de Cuisine, Bastian Hospitality Pvt Ltd, adding that they have been making an effort to include more items in their menu. A few home chefs are also experimenting with creating their own alt-meats. Mumbai-based lawyer, Uma Arora, has been making tempeh for over a year. A family staple, she now takes orders and, occasionally, supplies to restaurants under her brand, Culture Bakes. “People are becoming aware of plant-based protein, but there’s still a lot of education needed to convince them to make the switch,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tempeh-for-mixed-company/article33946792.ece
27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Calling homegrown writers||Ranjeet Pratap Singh (32), co-founder and CEO of Pratilipi, a homegrown storytelling platform, and Sumit Menaria, one of its star authors, share few similarities. While Singh is an engineer who grew up in Fattepur, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, Menaria — whose novel is scheduled to be published in the first week of March — is a chartered accountant who hails from Udaipur in Rajasthan. What bonds the two, however, is a love of books. And Pratilipi. The idea for the storytelling platform had gestated for many years, says Singh. While studying engineering in Bhubaneshwar, he had found that not only was the availability of Hindi content (offline) limited, it was also practically non-existent online. “I would crib that it should be my choice to read something in English; not because of lack of access,” he says, recalling that the pursuit of a career had him pushing aside thoughts about how to resolve the problem. But when he quit an unchallenging job a few years ago, he got thinking. And Pratilipi (Sanskrit for ‘copy’) was born. Incorporated in 2015, it now boasts 3 lakh writers in 12 Indian languages, including Hindi, English, Urdu and Odia, and has over 2.5 crore readers. “The idea behind it was very simple. We wanted to build a platform where anybody can publish their work, in any language, set in any place. While there is some public domain content [such as Jane Austen’s works], 99% is fresh, contemporary content published by new writers,” he says. The most popular format is the long story/novel. The ‘write’ stuff Menaria (29), who joined Pratilipi in 2017, started by writing poems and short stories. Following good reviews, he wrote a novel in Hindi, Tashree: Don’t Look into Her Eyes . Its success — with a total readership of 74,924 and a rating of 4.7 — has led to the book deal with Bhopal-based Manjul Publishing House and a comic book with Pratilpi Comics (launched in February 2020). “It isn’t the usual love story,” says Menaria, who was pleasantly surprised by the response to Tashree , a spiritual-thriller featuring a college girl. Incidentally, thrillers and romances do well on the site. Did 2020’s downtime reveal any new trends? “If you look at the various regions and languages, there are a lot of differences in what genres people like. But at the top are suspense/thriller, romance and horror,” says Singh, who used to devour Champak and Nanhe Samrat as a boy before moving on to classics by Premchand and Nirala. He says historical fiction also got a boost during the lockdown. Making story lists Interestingly, Pratilipi gathers data about everything, including where someone stopped reading a book. ‘‘We try to focus on [good] content, which is why the completion rate is one of the most important parameters.” Any work uploaded on the site has to be original or something that the writer owns the copyright to. “Also, any content that goes against Indian laws is not allowed, such as pornography and hate speech.” I had come across a story that seemed to violate one of these norms. “Readers can flag anything that violates our terms of service, and our content moderation team will take it down,” he says, adding that they have internal checks as well. Web series next Pratilipi recently announced a partnership with entertainment company Yali DreamWorks to develop and co-produce a web series based on a book trilogy — Murdo Ki Train , Shaitan Se Samjhauta and Niya — by Varsha Srivastava. There are other big plans too. “Along with Storytel and Manjul, we have an exciting licensing opportunity that I cannot talk about just yet,” says Singh. Meanwhile, people have been contacting Menaria for advice. “I tell everyone to start writing and to put it on Pratilipi.” Having finished his second novel, Anamika , last year, this is sound advice, indeed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/calling-homegrown-writers/article33946580.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘We are not going to budge till our demands are fulfilled’||Three months into the agitation against the farm laws, protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Friday said that they had left their villages in November with one aim in mind, which was to ensure that the laws are repealed. They added that they have not looked back since then. As the stalemate continues, despite several rounds of talks between the farmer leaders and the Centre, those who have been camping at the Capital’s border for over 90 days now remained firm and reiterated that they were not ready to return to their respective villages. Sukhdev Singh, a farmer from the Kapurthala district, said: “When we started out, we did not have a timeline. We only had one aim and after three months our aim is the same. The government should know that we are adapting to each season or circumstance and we are not going to budge till our demands are met.” “This will be a long fight and we are prepared for it. The unions will now have to give the next call so that we are able to get the government’s attention,” added Gurjeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district.  No question of returning Joginder Singh, a 63-year-old farmer from Punjab’s Taran Tarn district, who was one of the thousands who had reached the border on the first day, said: “Everyone knows what the government is up to. The only hope we have is that we are able to get what we want. In the last three months, we have devised mechanisms and made arrangements for ourselves. We are sitting here peacefully and there is no question of us returning.” Several of the farmers recalled how for the first one month they stayed away from their families and it was only later that a rotational system was devised among the farmers. Sukhjeet Singh, another farmer from Patiala, said: “When we first left our homes some of us carried clothes, while many did not. Then as we proceeded we faced barricades, trenches and police action. Finally, when we reached the Singhu border we knew that we were not moving from here unless the laws are repealed.” “For the first two months, many of us did not meet our families at all. It was only later that they started visiting us at the border and we started the rotational basis where we get to go home for a few days. In the last three months, villagers from Sonipat, Panipat and Karnal have been more than helpful to us,” said Mr. Singh. The protesting farmers have become permanent by now, said Gurlal Singh, another farmer from Taran Tarn. “There were several hurdles before us on our way to Delhi. But now that we have been here for three months, we have almost become permanent fixtures. As many as 25 of us had come here from our village in two trolleys and for the first month none of us went back. After the January 26 incident, one more trolley joined us at the border and we stay here on a rotational basis,” said Mr. Singh. Jaspal Singh, a farmer from Kapurthala district added, “When the need arises, more trolleys will join us here.

The project envisions an integrated development hub, bringing together residential, recreational and workplaces. It will be in close proximity to the Blue and Pink metro corridors. The project will be developed by the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) on roughly 30 hectares. 1,000 dwelling units Senior DDA officials said that as per current proposals, around 1,000 dwelling units, apart from those under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category, will be constructed in the first phase. According to the DDA, a provision of Rs. 500 crore has been allotted for 2021-22 and tenders have been floated by the NBCC. “As of now, there is a proposal to construct around 1,000 dwelling units and it is at the approval stage. We are waiting for statutory clearances like fire and environmental clearances. We are hoping to obtain the requisite clearances within a couple of weeks,” a senior DDA official said. “Once we obtain the requisite clearances, the declaration of the tenders is likely to be made and further work is expected to begin immediately,” the official added. Public transport Senior DDA officials connected to the project explained that the TOD policy was primarily aimed at encouraging use of public transport. “The policy mandates that residential, commercial, civic or institutional establishments have to be in close proximity to allow locals to access facilities like plazas and shared parks. This would also enable people to walk, cycle and use public transportation over personal modes of transport,” the official said. According to the TOD policy for Delhi, development along or around transit corridors can have higher floor area ratio (FAR) to accommodate more residential, office and recreational spaces in walking or cycling distance of the transit stations. On PPP basis DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said: “The NBCC has already floated tenders after approval of the proposal. The DDA will be building one set of residential area under the TOD project while the rest will be done on a Public-Private-Partnership basis.” The much-awaited TOD policy, which was approved by the DDA in September 2019, entails development of “high-density, mixed-use, mixed-income buildings within a short distance of a rapid public transport network”. In December last year, the land-owning agency had suggested modifications to the TOD policy by identifying 12 nodes which were meant to be mass transit stations according to influence zones identified by the DDA. “The provisions of this regulation shall only be applicable in the influence zones of such identified TOD nodes. A TOD approach in Delhi will help in bringing people and jobs closer to mass transit and lead to walkable, mixed use developments within influence zones of transit stations,” a senior DDA official said.  The policy mandates that residential, commercial, civic or institutional establishments have to be in close proximity to allow locals to access facilities like plazas and shared parks DDA official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/transit-oriented-hub-in-east-delhi-awaits-nod/article33946605.ece

27 February 2021||February 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Back in Bera||After 2020’s Calcuttascape: Musings of a Globetrotter , Rajasthan-born Sundeep Bhutoria has a coffee table book dedicated to the famed leopards of Bera. While the former is a compilation of the social activist’s columns and blogs, Bera Bond  takes us through his journey in 2016 — into the leopard colony in the forests of Rajasthan. The land where the big cats have been cohabiting with humans for over a century offered a “unique learning of coexistence and harmony that was both beautiful and bewildering”, says Bhutoria. With stunning photographs and inside stories — in his introduction, actor-writer Victor Banerjee paints a picture of a ‘Marwari cowboy’ courtesy Bhutoria’s jodhpurs and Stetson hat — the book was compiled during lockdown. The writer credits Bera-based conservationist and photographer Shatrunjay Pratap Singh, who was his guide.  Edited excerpts from an interview : Snapshots from Bera... One of the highlights of my stay was being able to name a leopard cub, at the request of the locals. I named it Gullu. In Bera, the sunsets are breathtaking, and it is not the angle at which the sun goes down or even the colour of the sky. It is the fruit bats that fill up the night sky just as the sun is about to sink into the horizon. They are noisy and smelly, and are attracted to fermenting fruit, but thousands of them in the sky is a sight to behold! What did you learn from Shatrunjay Pratap Singh?     The best thing about travelling with Shatrunjay was his ability to spot a leopard camouflaged against the landscape. He would just pass me the telescope and say something like, “After three rocks, there is one,” and then I would be able to see it. Leopards are reclusive animals, so they’re a lot harder to spot.

27 February 2021||New Delhi,||Lawyers oppose physical hearings from March 15||Several lawyers on Friday opposed in the Delhi High Court its decision to start holding completely physical courts with virtual proceedings only being held in exceptional cases. They urged that hybrid hearings, which will have both options, be held instead. Reasons, like resurgence of COVID-19 cases in various States, appearance of new strains, advanced age and co-morbidities of lawyers and their family members and a cleaner environment due to lesser vehicular use, were given before the court in support of holding hybrid hearings. Currently, 11 Benches of the HC on rotation hold physical courts while the others hold virtual proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lawyers-oppose-physical-hearings-from-march-15/article33946606.ece
27 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Restaurants focus on efficiency post pandemic||Speaking at an event organised by the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) on the changing dynamics of the restaurant industry post COVID-19 and the way forward, several restaurant owners said they felt the need to become more efficient so that they can reduce fixed costs and focus on quality of food. Anurag Katriar, President of NRAI, said that enough had been spoken about the crisis in the past one year and it was time to look ahead and explore opportunities. “We may need to redesign our offerings and retool our business models, but it is absolutely incumbent upon to move beyond the pandemic-induced status quo and regain our lost vibrancy.” Mr. Katriar said. Strong business model Stressing the importance of a strong business model to make the business more profitable and sustainable, Riyaaz Amlani, CEO & MD, Impresario Entertainment, said the pandemic has taught them more efficient management. “We need to develop a viable alternative to aggregators. Use your own fleet for delivery and remember three D’s for a sustainable business – delivery, discovery and digital mechanism,” Mr. Amlani said. He added that in India from the time a customer enters the restaurant to the time the food arrives, he makes contact with numerous employees. This, he feels, needs to change with people starting to multi-task. Share of service tax “A small but efficient team is better as the service tax that the customers are charged then gets distributed among fewer employees. This should encourage them to work more efficiently,” Mr. Amlani said. While many restaurants were forced to shut down, Sagar Daryani, Co-Founder & CEO, Wow! Momo and Wow! China said that the pandemic gave him the opportunity to open more than 50 new outlets. He said that the trick is to go lean and deliver the right food and food quality to ensure that the customer will come again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/restaurants-focus-on-efficiency-post-pandemic/article33946608.ece
