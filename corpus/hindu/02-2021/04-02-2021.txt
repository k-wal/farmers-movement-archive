04 February 2021||JIND,||Massive gathering in Haryana demands repeal of farm laws||With a massive “mahapanchayat” in Kandela village here on Wednesday, the farming community of Haryana signalled that it had jumped into the fray to seek the repeal of the farm laws with a renewed enthusiasm. Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said at the meeting that the farmers would emerge victorious if young people remained peaceful. Amid resurgence of the farmers’ agitation in Haryana in the wake of Mr. Tikait’s recent emotional outburst, the “mahapanchayat” adopted a five-point resolution seeking repeal of the contentious laws, besides a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, release of those arrested for the Republic Day violence and loan waiver. The participants raised their hands to support the resolution. Held at the behest of Kandela Khap, the meeting, addressed by Mr. Tikait and Balbir Singh Rajewal, heading a BKU faction in Punjab, saw participation of Khap leaders from across the State, besides thousands of farmers, including women. Series of panchayats A series of panchayats at village levels and Khap panchayats have been held across the State over the past few days reiterating support to the agitation. Addressing the gathering, Sangwan Khap president and Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan said the people of Haryana at the protest sites around Delhi outnumbered those from Punjab participating in the agitation, which, he said, had now become a “mass movement”. Mr. Tikait, amid loud cheers, said the unions were firmly fighting for the farmers’ rights and there would be no compromise on their self esteem. He said there was no need for more farmers to march to Delhi as of now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/massive-gathering-in-haryana-demands-repeal-of-farm-laws/article33744886.ece
04 February 2021||MYSURU,||Excavation unravels remains of a Jain temple in Halebid||The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has unearthed significant remains of what is presumed to be a Jain temple belonging to the Hoysala period at Halebid in Hassan district. The excavation, which commenced on January 20, is taking place near Shantinatha Basadi and promises to throw up interesting antiquities from the 11th to the 14th century when the Hoysala dynasty ruled parts of Karnataka. The excavation was initiated by G. Maheshwari, Regional Director, ASI (Southern Region), and it is being conducted under the direction of Shivkant Bajpai, Superintending Archaeologist, ASI, Bengaluru Circle. Dr. Bajpai said the mound where excavation is taking place measures 30 m x 20 m. “Based on the preliminary observation of the findings made so far, we can say that it was a Jain temple,” he said. The excavations have unravelled remains of a temple and the ASI will expose the entire structure. Earlier excavations had revealed some loose structures inthe area, and the ASI decided to take up further excavations in order to preserve the structure lest it is lost, as stones tend to get removed from the site for various local use, said Dr. Bajpai. Apart from exposing the remains of the temple, the ASI team has recovered a sculpture of a Jain upasaka . It is a classic Hoysala sculpture and measures around 2 ft in height, he added. The Hoysalas encouraged and patronised all sects and cults and the presence of a Jain temple close to the Hoysaleshwara temple underlines the harmony that prevailed during those times. The discovery of a new temple reinforces this view, according to Dr. Bajpai. ASI technical staff and other personnel, including A.V. Nagnoor, R.N. Kumaran, Sujana Stephen, Saranya, Basavaraj Mayachaari, and Murli Mohan are part of the team conducting the excavation. Dr. Bajpai said this was also an opportunity for students of history and archaeology to visit the place and learn how archaeological excavations are conducted and reinforce their theoretical knowledge. Students have access to some parts of the site, and some of them are already visiting the place, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/excavation-unravels-remains-of-a-jain-temple-in-halebid/article33745197.ece
04 February 2021||Hyderabad,||SSC exams to have only six papers||Tenth class students taking the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams this year will have to write just six papers instead of 11 with more choice in questions and increased time of the examination. It means, students have to write only one paper for each subject instead of two papers in the existing format. The reduced papers will, however, be applicable to only this year. The changes were made to give relief to students due to COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent disturbance of academic atmosphere including disruption of regular classes. The examinations will be conducted for a total of 600 marks including 480 marks for the Board exams and 120 marks for internals, which will be the average of two formative assessments. There will be no change in the existing weightage of marks - 80 marks for the Board exam and 20 marks for formative assessment for all six papers. As per the pattern, paper-I and paper-II of First Language, English, Mathematics, General Science (Physical Science and Biology) and Social Studies will be merged into a single paper instead of two papers for each subject. There will be no change in the second language paper,” a note issued by the government said. At the same time, students will also get an additional 30 minutes in the exam with the duration of the examination increased to 3 hours and 15 minutes instead of 2 hours and 45 minutes. Since classes were held online for a major part of the academic year due to the pandemic, students will get more choice in questions in all the papers. Questions will also be framed from the syllabus given under essential core concepts or units for classroom transaction for all subjects. Separate answer booklets will be given for Physical Sciences part-A and Biological Science part-B to facilitate separate valuation of answer scripts. The government has not changed the marks pattern of composite courses, OSSC courses and vocational courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ssc-exams-to-have-only-six-papers-this-year/article33745461.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. notice to Twitter on ‘farmer genocide’ hashtag||The Union government has issued a notice to Twitter to comply with its order of removal of content related to ‘farmer genocide’. The Centre alleged that the material was designed to spread misinformation to inflame passions and hatred, and warned that refusal to do so may invite penal action. On Tuesday evening, Twitter restored over 250 accounts, hours after blocking them due to “legal demand”. The platform, in a meeting with government officials, contested the order, arguing that these accounts were not in violation of Twitter policy, and declined to abide by the order. A source in the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), which sent the notice to the U.S.-headquartered firm, said Twitter was an intermediary and was obliged to follow the directions of the government and refusal to do so may invite penal action. “Twitter unilaterally unblocked accounts/tweets despite government order blocking... MeitY had passed an interim order on January 31, as a matter of emergency blocking 257 URLs and 1 Hashtag under section 69 A of the Information Technology Act, 2000...on the ground that these are spreading misinformation about protests and has the potential to lead to imminent violence affecting public order situation in the country,” the source said. The Centre, in its notice, quoted more than half a dozen Supreme Court judgments, including of Constitution benches, as to what is public order and what are the rights of authorities. The MeitY pointed out that the “prevailing situation” resulted into a “major public order issue” on Republic Day. “The statutory authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that no adverse public order situation takes place, and no cognisable offences are committed. In light of these developments and as a part of due process, an order was passed…,” the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-notice-to-twitter-on-farmer-genocide-hashtag/article33744901.ece
04 February 2021||Mumbai,||Varsities, colleges to reopen in Maharashtra from February 15||Maharashtra Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant on Wednesday said that universities and colleges in the State would reopen from February 15, with 50% attendance. Mr. Samant said that the 75% mandatory attendance required to appear for the examination had been waived in view of the novel coronavirus. “All colleges will have to adhere to the health guidelines and the standard operating procedures (SOPs). As far as conducting examinations are concerned, the universities will have to decide on whether to go for online or offline or to keep both the options open,” the minister said at a press conference. Mr. Samant further said that college and university hostels would be opened in phases as at many places hostels had been converted into quarantine centres. “We held a videoconference on February 1 with all the vice-chancellors to know their opinions about reopening of colleges and universities. It was directed to formulate SOPs for curriculum, examination management, and hostels etc.,” he said, adding that the local civic body administration needed to be taken into confidence before reopening colleges. “Electric and safety audits of all the hostels should be carried out before reopening them for students,” the minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/varsities-colleges-to-reopen-in-maharashtra-from-february-15/article33744916.ece
04 February 2021||HUBBALLI,||Protest in Hubballi opposing privatisation of power sector||Seeking repeal of the Power Bill 2020 and terming it as being against the interests of farmers, people and power corporation employees, a demonstration was staged here on Wednesday. The demonstration was organised by members of the All India Powermen Federation (AIPF) and the All India United Trade Union Congress (AIUTUC) in front of the office of Hubballi Electricity Supply Company (HESCOM) at Navanagar in Hubballi in response to a call for a nation-wide agitation. Addressing the protestors, president of the Dharwad district unit of AIUTUC Gangadhar Badiger said that after penetrating BSNL and railway sector, the privatisation policy has entered the power sector too. “The Union government wants to privatise the power sector at one stroke, which is highly condemnable,” he said. He said that with this move, the power sector which was hitherto an essential service will become a profitable commercial service. Consequently, the employees who have the status of government employees will become private company employees. And, the contract workers will be subjected to hire and fire policy, he said. He said that a privatisation exercise in the State of Odisha has resulted in the employees becoming scapegoats with the private company shunning its responsibility of providing gratuity and other benefits. Mr. Badiger said that in Uttar Pradesh the employees have successfully fought against such a privatisation move. AIPF and employees associations of KPTCL and HESCOM should take inspiration from the agitation in Uttar Pradesh and proceed towards fighting for their rights without making any compromise, he said. District vice-president of AIUTUC Bhuvana Ballari, district secretary Ramesh Hosamani and others led the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/protest-in-hubballi-opposing-privatisation-of-power-sector/article33745037.ece
04 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||SSC examinations will be held from June 7, says Minister||Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh on Wendesday said the State would conduct Secondary School Certificate (10th Class) Public examinations from June 7 to 16. At a press conference, the Minister said the Board of Secondary Education had released the exam schedule, according to which the examinations comprised seven papers which would be held from 9.30 a.m. to 12.45 p.m. He said to make up for lost academic time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, classes were being conducted for all sections from February 1. Students of Class 10 would attend classes till June 5. Final exams of Classes 1 to 9 were scheduled from May 3 and students would have vacations from May 15 to June 30 and the new academic year was proposed to be started from July 1, he said. Timetable Students of Class 10 will write their exam in first language (Group-A) and first language- Paper I (Composite Course) on June 7, second language on June 8, English on June 9, Mathematics on June 10, Physical Science on June 11, Biological Science on June 12, Social Studies on June 14, first language- Paper II (Composite Course) and OSSC main language Paper-I (Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian) on June 15 and OSSC main language Paper-II (Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian) and SSC Vocation Course (Theory) on June 16. Syllabus reduced Mr. Suresh said supplementary exams would be conducted after a gap of one month of the final exams. In view of the reduced work days due to the pandemic, the departments concerned had pruned 30% of the syllabus as classes could be conducted only on 167 days in the academic year. He said barring second Saturdays and Sundays, classes would be conducted on all days. ‘Best of the two’ Mr. Suresh said Intermediate students would be given a chance to improve their scores. In view of the lockdown, the government had declared all Intermediate students as pass without conducting any exams. The students seeking to improve their marks in certain subjects, could write the exams scheduled from May 3. They would be given the choice to retain “Best of the two”. This facility was being given in view of the possible problems the students may face in future while appearing for competitive exams or in job interviews, he said. The Minister said the government had decided not to increase examination fee this year in view of the financial problems of the people on account of COVID-19. He said barring an exam fees of Rs. 490, Rs. Rs. 10 for application form and Rs. 190 for Practical examinations, no extra fee would be charged from the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ssc-examinations-will-be-held-from-june-7-says-minister/article33744893.ece
04 February 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra mulls introducing ballot papers along with EVMs||Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Nana Patole has directed the State Law and Justice Department to prepare the draft of a Bill which provides an option to voters to exercise their franchise on ballot papers along with electronic voting machines (EVMs). Mr. Patole had on Tuesday called for a hearing of a petition filed with the office of the State legislature by one Pradip Uke arguing that such a law could be enacted under existing constitutional provisions and it only required an initiative from the State legislature. “Article 328 of the Indian Constitution and number 37 of the State list of seventh schedule of the Constitution provide rights to the State legislature to formulate a law on the manner of holding elections within the State. We are not saying to abolish EVMs completely. We are demanding an additional provision of ballot paper as well for whoever wants to use that,” said advocate Satish Uke, who represented Mr. Pradip Uke, in the hearing held in front of the Speaker. “Directions have been given to check the constitutional validity of the argument and prepare the draft of a Bill. We will go through every argument and constitutional provision. We will not work in a hurry,” an official from the Speaker’s office said. Despite several attempts, Mr. Patole could not be reached. Mr. Satish Uke said, “On EVMs, a voter can never be 100% sure about whom he or she has voted and whether that particular candidate has received the vote. It is a right of every voter to be 100% sure about it and also essential for the democratic process.” He further said that over the past few years, serious concerns and doubts had been raised over the EVMs and whether those could be manipulated. “We are not saying to abolish EVMs. A State government cannot do that. All that we are saying is to give an option of ballot voting in State and local body elections,” he said, adding that it would boost people’s confidence in the electoral process which would ultimately lead to an increase in voting percentage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-mulls-introducing-ballot-papers-along-with-evms/article33744915.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||In Jamia, Delhi police ‘should have shown’ some restraint: court||A city court on Wednesday remarked that though the Delhi police “used more force than necessary in some instances” while dealing with the December 2019 protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Jamia Millia Islamia, these were done in discharge of their official duties. “Likewise, it could also be argued that the situation perhaps could have been handled by the respondents [Delhi police] in a better way and that some restraint sho-uld have been shown by the police/respondents…,” Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal said in a 16-page order. ‘Bid to control situation’ “However, the lack of such restraint exhibited by the police/respondents and excesses committed in trying to control the situation are very much related to official duties of the respondents,” the judge said. The court’s observation came while dismissing a petition filed by Jamia Millia Islamia seeking to initiate proceedings against the police officers who stormed the university campus on December 15, 2019 without seeking any sanction and used “excessive and arbitrary force” while dealing with the anti-CAA protesters. A number of videos had shown that Jamia students, including those in the library, were badly beaten up by Delhi police personnel who had entered the university campus. Jamia Millia Islamia said that the police officers caused destruction of university property, fired tear gas shells and carried out lathi-charge. After the incident, the university made a complaint at Jamia Nagar police station, but no action was taken. Following this, the university moved the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-jamia-police-should-have-shown-restraint/article33745423.ece
04 February 2021||CHENNAI,||89 doctors have succumbed to COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu: IMA||A total of 89 doctors have died due to COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu, according to data published by the Indian Medical Association (headquarters). A majority of the deceased — 37 persons — were in their 60s, followed by 21 doctors in their 50s and 18 practitioners in their 70s. At least 40 of them were general practitioners, and nearly 30 were in Chennai. The IMA released the details of 734 doctors from across the country who lost their lives to COVID-19 as of Wednesday, after the Minister of State in the Union Health Ministry stated in the Rajya Sabha that only 162 doctors had died of the virus as of January 22. Expressing shock over the statement, the IMA said it was contrary to the data released by it. Of the 734 doctors who died, 431 were general practitioners. Twenty-five were aged below 35. As a community, doctors suffered a relatively higher viral load and case fatality rate. J.A. Jayalal, national president of IMA, said the data was collected from the respective State/local branches of IMA. “The Tamil Nadu government should expedite the process of granting solatium to the families of private practitioners who succumbed to the infection. Financial support is just one component, as we want the government to identify and honour doctors who sacrificed their lives,” he said. The IMA condemned the perceived apathy of the Union government in verifying the data given by the association, and the delay in disbursing solatium to the families of frontline workers who died. It urged the Centre to endorse the hard work and contribution of doctors in flattening the COVID-19 curve, and expedite the process of providing solatium. Dr. Jayalal cited the case of Chandrasekar, a 65-year-old doctor in Chennai, who conducted house visits during the pandemic. “He contracted COVID-19 and succumbed to the infection. He voluntarily came out and practised [medicine] during the pandemic, and it is important to recognise the sacrifices of such doctors,” he said. K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association, said two government doctors had succumbed to COVID-19 in the State so far, and the family of only one of the deceased had received solatium. “The government has assured us that the solatium for the other doctor’s family is being processed. We are expecting a solatium of Rs. 25 lakh from the State government and Rs. 50 lakh in insurance from the Centre. We hope the State government’s promise of a government job to a legal heir of the two families would be fulfilled,” he said. A. Ramalingam, convenor of the Federation of Government Doctors’ Association, said the State government readily granted solatium to the families of other frontline workers like those from the Police and Revenue Departments, and should accord the same importance to healthcare workers. A cross-section of doctors pointed out that many government doctors who contracted the infection did not receive the ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh and the one-month special pay announced by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/89-doctors-have-succumbed-to-covid-19-in-tamil-nadu-ima/article33744943.ece
04 February 2021||Mangaluru,||A leopard that changed its spots for a dog||For nine hours, they sat across a few feet from each other, neither making a move. Leopard and dog, predator and prey. The cat had chased the stray dog and both ended up in a rudimentary wash room of a farmhouse in Karnataka. Hearing the commotion, the farm owner locked up both animals together for about nine hours but finally, the cat made a fleet-footed escape and the dog emerged unscathed. The adventure near Kukke Subrahmanya on Wednesday surprised Forest Department officials lying in wait to rescue the leopard. The dog ran into the toilet, pursued by the cat, at the farmhouse of Jayalakshmi in Kaikamba of Bilinele village, on the fringes of Kidu Reserve Forest, in Dakshina Kannada’s Kadaba taluk. Deputy Conservator of Forests for Dakshina Kannada V. Karikalan said Ms. Jayalakshmi heard loud sounds at around 4 a.m. and found the leopard’s tail sticking out near the door. She promptly locked the door and informed the Forest Department. Forest personnel who rushed to the spot encountered an unusual sight from a window: the leopard and the dog sat opposite each other, quietly. Cage, net placed Mr. Karikalan said a cage was placed outside the washroom and a net was spread around it. An additional cage and net were also kept on standby. A darter and a veterinary doctor were summoned. The leopard and the dog were “taking rest” when the personnel closed all openings. Their mission was to make a hole on the asbestos sheet roof and dart the leopard. As the earthmover moved in, the leopard suddenly jumped towards the roof, bringing down a portion. It bolted through an opening, disappearing into the forest in a flash. The personnel found the dog unharmed. The family members then offered the dog some food. Just in case the leopard decided to pay a repeat visit, Mr. Karikalan said two cages were placed near the farmhouse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-leopard-that-changed-its-spots-for-a-dog/article33744889.ece

Senior superintendent of police Upendra Sharma said the man was arrested from RK Nagar. Three of his accomplices are still absconding. Mr. Sharma said the murder weapon has been seized and it will be sent for forensic examination. On January 12, four unidentified assailants on two motorcycles shot dead the 40-year-old station manager in front of his apartment at Punaichak and fled via R-block Digha Road. Singh was killed while he was waiting for the apartment’s gates to open after returning from office. “While no criminal record of the arrested man has been found in Patna, the police are searching if there are cases filed against him in other districts,” Mr. Sharma said. It took the police 22 days to crack the case. The personnel had to go through 600 GB data and footage of 200 CCTV cameras, besides walking around 100 km on foot to investigate the case, the police official added. The accused used stolen bikes to commit the crime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-held-in-indigo-station-manager-murder-case-3-accused-absconding/article33744914.ece

There is a rider, though — the decision will be revoked if COVID-19 cases go up because of protocol violations. Announcing the decision after a meeting with members and the chairman of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of the Kannada film industry, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said though the decision was against the recommendations of the Technical Advisory Committee, it was taken considering the hardships faced by artistes, producers, and other workers. Information and Public Relations Minister C.C. Patil said a Government Order and guidelines that need to be followed in theatres would be issued on Thursday. “Theatres can function with 100% occupancy from Friday,” he said. “This meeting was held as per the directions of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Exercising abundant caution with regard to COVID-19 and as perTAC recommendations, the Chief Secretary had issued a circular on Tuesday restricting seating to 50% in theatres. Although the Centre had allowed 100% occupancy, the States had been given powers to take a call depending on the prevailing situation in their jurisdiction,” Dr. Sudhakar said. “However, the film industry opposed this decision and requested us to reconsider it keeping in view the welfare of nearly one lakh people employed in the industry. They have also appealed to the Chief Minister to support them in these difficult times.” Mr. Patil said owners of cinema halls should strictly adhere to guidelines and should ensure that filmgoers also follow them.

The directive was duly approved by Director-General of Police S.K. Singhal and was circulated to the State Home Department and other senior police officers. Police verification is necessary for government jobs, licence for firearms, passports, etc. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav criticised the directive and accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of acting like a dictator. “In a challenge to Hitler and Mussolini, Nitish Kumar says if someone uses his democratic right against government by staging dharna-protest, he will not get a government job, which means neither will jobs be given, nor will protest be allowed. How this hapless chief minister with 40 seats is frightened!” he said in a tweet, attaching the police directive. Senior Congress leader and party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, too, criticised the government’s new directive. “The new police directive of the Bihar government is, in fact, an encroachment on the democratic rights of the common citizens of the State. How can a government issue such directives to frighten and stop people from staging protests and dharnas?” he asked. Left party leaders, too, attacked the State government on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bihar-govt-wont-hire-protesters/article33744898.ece

The survey, which was conducted by the community social media platform LocalCircles, received 25,000 responses from residents of 289 districts. It found that vaccine hesitancy in India dropped by 16% within a month, though 58% still remained hesitant even as close to 5 million healthcare workers were vaccinated. The percentage of citizens willing to take the vaccine rose from 31% in the first week to 38% at the end of the second week and 40% in the third week of January to 42% this week, a press release said. It asked the respondents if they would take the vaccines if senior leaders of the Centre and State governments, along with the Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assembly, take the jab. To this, 39% said the move would encourage them to take the vaccine immediately. Another finding was that only 13% citizens said they had access to data related to vaccination centres, daily vaccinations and adverse events in their district, while 62% did not have it and would like to get access to such data.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/42-of-people-willing-to-take-covid-19-vaccine/article33745399.ece

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde asked the petitioners to first approach the respective High Courts. The CJI said the Supreme Court would like to have the benefit of the High Courts’ conclusions before taking on the issue. “We have come to know that the Allahabad and the Uttarakhand High Courts are already seized of the matter. It would be advantageous to know what they have to say... We have already, in another case, declined the transfer of the case to us from the Allahabad High Court.” Denial of U.P. plea The top court recently denied a plea by the Uttar Pradesh government to transfer a plea challenging the religious conversion ordinance from the State HC to the SC. The Bench, on Wednesday, was hearing petitions filed by NGO PUCL and advocate Vishal Thakre against the implementation of the Prohibition Of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018. Senior advocate Sanjay Parekh, appearing for PUCL, argued that more States, like Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, were passing identical laws. Mr. Thakre’s petition said “rampaging mobs are lifting off people in the middle of wedding ceremonies” buoyed by the enactment of these laws. In December last, the apex court refused to stay the two laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-conversion-laws-row/article33744899.ece

As soon as the Lok Sabha convened at 4 p.m., Question Hour proceedings were disrupted as Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, wanted to raise the issue of the farm laws. Bhagwant Singh Mann, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP from Punjab, was also heard raising loud slogans demanding an immediate discussion on the farm laws. Speaker Om Birla urged Mr. Mann to return to his seat, and said that he would be forced to take strict action against members who repeatedly violated parliamentary decorum and dignity. As the Opposition MPs did not relent, he adjourned the House until 4.30 p.m. When the House resumed its proceedings, Mr. Chowdhury suggested that separate time slots be allotted for discussion on the farm laws, and the Motion of Thanks debate. Question Hour Mr. Birla asserted that the Question Hour was a matter of right for the MPs and the House should be allowed to function. But the advice went unheeded as more than 20 members, including from the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), trooped into the Well of the House to protest. The SAD leader and former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, holding a poster against the farm laws, was among the protesting MPs who were in the Well. The Speaker then adjourned the House until 5 p.m. Identical scenes were witnessed once the proceedings were resumed. Mr. Birla once again reasoned with the Opposition members to go back to their seats as he wanted to start the Zero Hour. By then, Mr. Joshi informed the House that he had held discussions with Opposition leaders. He said that “these leaders” had agreed to start a discussion on the Motion thanking the President.“Now, they have made a U-turn and that is also like an insult to the President,” Mr. Joshi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ls-disrupted-over-farm-laws/article33744839.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI/COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka’s ECT move unilateral: Japan||Two days after Sri Lanka decided to scrap a 2019 agreement with India and Japan for operating the East Coast Terminal (ECT), Japan says the decision was “unilateral and regrettable”. Japan’s Ambassador Akira Sugiyama also met with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to discuss the issue on Wednesday, after a flurry of meetings between the Indian High Commissioner to Colombo Gopal Baglay and the top leadership of Sri Lanka, including Mr. Gunawardena, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to protest the decision. The ECT project was expected to showcase India-Japan cooperation in a part of South Asia where Chinese infrastructure projects have been prominent. In Delhi, an official of the Japanese Embassy said the Japanese government was “looking into the details” of the announcement made by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa after a Cabinet meeting on Monday. “Japan, India and Sri Lanka signed the Memorandum of Cooperation for the development of ECT in May 2019,” the official told The Hindu , referring to the tripartite agreement signed by India and Japan with the former Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena’s government. “It is regrettable that the government of Sri Lanka unilaterally made a Cabinet decision and announced the development and operation of ECT as a wholly owned container terminal of Sri Lanka Ports Authority,” the official added. New Delhi and Tokyo have been in talks with the Rajapaksa government over the last few months after protests by Port union workers over allowing any foreign role or investment in the ECT project cast a shadow over progress in the agreement. During a visit to Colombo on January 6 by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, the ECT had been high on the agenda, and India had been hopeful of a firm commitment from Sri Lanka on the project. After his meeting with Mr. Jaishankar, President Gotabaya told protesting Port worker unions that India’s Adani Group would invest in the project, and Sri Lanka was not selling or leasing the national asset, that was seen as a sign the government was on board. However, during the Cabinet meeting headed by Prime Minister Mahinda on Monday, the Sri Lankan government decided that ECT would be operated as a “wholly owned container terminal of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority [SLPA]” and not, as earlier planned, a joint venture with Indian and Japanese entities. Both India and Japan were taken by surprise, given the negotiations thus far, and given that nearly 70% of the transhipment business through ECT is linked to India. In a possible bid to make amends — the Rajapaksa government has offered the West Container Terminal (WCT) of Colombo Port on a 35-year agreement to India and Japan instead, but officials have thus far been cold to the offer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sri-lankas-ect-move-unilateral-japan/article33744861.ece

Speaking at the inaugural event, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, “We have long witnessed unfortunate attempts to employ force to change the status quo along our unresolved border and India is vigilant and prepared to counter and defeat any misadventure to change and defend our people and territorial integrity at all costs. Our resolve towards this is shown by our growing defence capabilities…We plan to spend $130 bn on military modernisation in the next 7-8 years”. He urged global defence companies to set up manufacturing units. India faced threats and challenges emanating from multiple fronts and it was a victim of state-sponsored terrorism, which was now a global threat, he pointed out. Mr. Singh will hold an Indian Ocean Region (IOR) Defence Ministers’ conclave during the show, which has been restricted to three business days due to COVID-19 restrictions. “India has a vast coastline, but our interests also lie beyond our shores. It includes our people who reside and work across continents, especially in IOR. It is our bound duty to remain capable and willing to assist them in times of calamities and security challenges.” Deliveries in 8 years On the LCA contract, he said, “This contract is the biggest Make in India defence contract till date.” The contract includes 73 LCA Tejas Mk-1A fighter aircraft and 10 LCA Tejas Mk-1 trainer aircraft at a cost of Rs. 45,696 crore along with design and development of infrastructure sanctions worth Rs. 1,202 crore. “The deliveries of all 83 aircraft shall be completed in eight years from now. HAL will be delivering the first three aircraft in the third year and 16 aircraft per year for subsequent five years,” a Defence Ministry statement said. Speaking at the Air Chiefs conclave, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal (ACM) RKS Bhadauria said, “globally we are facing unprecedented levels of ‘uncertainty, volatility and interconnected threats’.” In this regard he pitched for greater regional coordination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hal-gets-contract-for-83-lcas-in-rs-48000-cr-deal/article33744825.ece

Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, walked out to freedom from the District Jail, Kakkanad, on Thursday afternoon. C. Deepu, judge of the Economic Offences Court, Ernakulam, while granting bail to Mr. Sivasankar bail in a dollar smuggling case, noted that he had “sufficient knowledge with regard to the smuggling of foreign currencies perpetrated with the help of prime accused” in the case. The court felt that “such knowledge and his culpable failure to bring the smuggling to the notice of appropriate authority despite the fact that he was a senior civil servant during relevant time shall be viewed seriously.” The court arrived at the conclusion after the “conjoint scanning of the statements” of crucial witnesses, the prime accused and the petitioner. The judge noted that the offence alleged against the petitioner was of serious nature, which required intensive probe. Considering the nature of the alleged minimal complicity of the petitioner and stage of the investigation, the judge felt that his further detention was no longer essential for the successful future investigation. Bail conditions Mr. Sivasankar was asked to execute a bond of Rs. 1 lakh with two solvent sureties each for the same amount. He was asked to appear before the investigating officer as and when required until the filing of the complaint and not to influence or intimidate witnesses or tamper with evidence in any manner. Earlier, the same court had granted him statutory bail in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sivasankar-gets-bail-in-dollar-smuggling-case/article33744815.ece
04 February 2021||New Delhi,||DMK asks PM to speak on fishermen deaths||Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP Tiruchi Siva urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to send a strong message to the Sri Lankan government on the death of four fishermen from Tamil Nadu whose bodies were found on January 23. Raising the issue in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Mr. Siva said this was not the first such incident. “We have been raising such issues in the House every now and then, and fishermen in Tamil Nadu are compelled to quit their profession because of harassment by the Sri Lankan Navy,” he said. On January 19, four fishermen from Tamil Nadu were reported missing. Four days later, on January 23, the Sri Lankan Navy claimed to have found their bodies in the Palk Strait. The Sri Lankan Navy claimed that the fishermen’s boat rammed into its vessel. ‘Brutally attacked’  Mr. Siva contended that this was not the case and, in fact, the fishermen had been brutally attacked and killed. He said it was not enough for the External Affairs Ministry to send a strong demarche to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner. He said the families of fishermen did not know whether they would return with their catch or if it was their bodies that would be sent home. “The Prime Minister should condemn, as our leader has requested, this incident. This should not happen again. I hope you will take this issue very seriously and give hope and confidence to the fishermen that nothing would happen henceforth when they go fishing,” Mr. Siva added. 245 fishermen All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader M. Thambidurai also spoke on the issue. He said, so far, 245 fishermen from Tamil Nadu had been killed. “Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Edappadi K. Palaniswami has written a letter to the Prime Minister requesting him to take necessary action against the Sri Lankan authorities. Sir, on behalf of the AIADMK party, the Tamil Nadu government and also the Tamil Nadu fishermen, I condemn the Sri Lankan Navy for doing these kinds of atrocities and killing our fishermen. This is going to affect the relationship between India and Sri Lanka,” Mr. Thambidurai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dmk-asks-pm-to-speak-on-fishermen-deaths/article33744857.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Rahul is spreading fake narratives’||After the unprecedented statement by the Ministry of External Affairs referring to outsiders (including international celebrities) commenting on the protests against contentious farm laws, the BJP on Wednesday said it was the opposition Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi who were complicit in spreading “fake narratives” and “hatching anti-India” conspiracies while abroad. Union Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted that “no propaganda can deter India’s unity! No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights! Propaganda can not decide India’s fate only ‘Progress’ can. India stands united and together to achieve progress.” Tweets with the hashtags “IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda were put out by senior Ministers like Prakash Javadekar and BJP president J.P. Nadda. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra addressed a press conference at the party headquarters in New Delhi and said the meet was titled “Rahul, Rihanna and Racket,” referring to pop idol Rihanna who tweeted about the protests by farmers’ unions. ‘Anti-India propaganda’ “He [Rahul Gandhi] goes abroad to hatch conspiracy with anti-India elements as to how to defame India and drag the country into controversies,” Mr. Patra alleged. “Be it Rihanna, an international pop singer, or former adult star Mia Khalifa or others like them who have tweeted, Rahul Gandhi meets these people for anti-India propaganda,“ Mr. Patra claimed. Mr. Gandhi on Wednesday at his own press conference had said that India’s reputation had taken a “massive hit” and its biggest strength, its soft power, had been “shattered“ by the BJP and the RSS. Mr. Patra said that while farmers had been saying that they had nothing to do with politics, Mr. Gandhi had shown his “immaturity” by trying to talk on their behalf. He defended the massive barricading done by the Delhi police to block farmers protesting at several Delhi border points from entering into the national capital, saying that the police had taken these measures to ensure that the violence which happened on January 26 was not repeated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-is-spreading-fake-narratives/article33744835.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Don’t make farm laws a prestige issue, says Azad||Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad appealed to the government not to make the ‘confrontation’ with farmers a prestige issue and called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself to make an announcement repealing the disputed farm laws. He condemned the violence at the Red Fort on January 26 during the farmers’ tractor rally. After a washout on Tuesday, the Rajya Sabha functioned smoothly on Wednesday barring a six-minute-long adjournment forced by sloganeering Aam Aadmi Party members after the Treasury benches and the Opposition came to an understanding on suspending Question Hour and Zero Hour to discuss the Motion of thanks to the President’s address. Speaking in Mr. Modi’s presence, Mr. Azad, who is the Leader of the Opposition, said that no government in the past had benefited from fighting farmers, and cited instances when even the British government had to bow to farmers’ movement. He also raised the issue of registration of cases under stringent provisions against leading journalists and his party colleague Shashi Tharoor. Earlier in the day, despite the consensus arrived at between the government and the Opposition, three AAP members continued with their protest, walking into the well of the House raising slogans. Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, quoting Rule 255 for withdrawal of members for gross disorderly conduct, had them removed from the House. Sanjay Singh, Sushil Kumar Gupta and Narain Dass Gupta were marshalled out. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva objected to how the farm Bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha in the last session. Mr. Naidu said all processes were followed and all parties were allotted time to debate the laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-make-farm-laws-a-prestige-issue-says-azad/article33744845.ece
04 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Collection of DNA samples will lead to misuse’||Allowing investigating agencies to collect DNA samples from “suspects”, as laid down in the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019, will give them “unbridled power that is easily capable of misuse and abuse” and amount to a “threat to the life, liberty, dignity and privacy of a person”, retired Supreme Court judge Justice Madan Lokur has observed in a written submission to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology. The panel, headed by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, tabled its report on Wednesday in Parliament. DNA testing is currently being done on an extremely limited scale in India, with approximately 30-40 DNA experts in 15-18 laboratories undertaking fewer than 3,000 cases a year. The standards of the laboratories are not monitored or regulated. The Bill aims to introduce the regulation of the entire process from collection to storage. The preamble to the Bill says that it aims to provide for “the regulation of use and application of Deoxyribonucleic Acid [DNA] technology for the purposes of establishing the identity of certain categories of persons, including the victims, offenders, suspects, undertrials, missing persons and unknown deceased persons”. Justice Lokur has questioned the need to collect DNA of a “suspect”. In his submission, he argued that in a blind crime or a crime involving a large number of persons (such as a riot), everybody is a suspect without any real basis. This would mean that thousands of persons could be subjected to DNA profiling on a mere suspicion. “Such an unbridled power is easily capable of misuse and abuse by targeting innocents, against whom there is not a shred of evidence. Such an unbridled police power ought not to be conferred on anybody or any agency as it would amount to a threat to the life, liberty, dignity and privacy of a person,” he stated. Many members of the committee, too, had expressed concern over including “suspects” in this list, flagging that it could lead to misuse and targeting certain categories of people. In two dissent notes, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi and CPI leader Binoy Viswam said the Bill would lead to the targeting of Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis. The committee has said while taking on board these concerns, it has gone with the majority view of retaining the preamble. Its report, however, notes that these fears are not entirely unfounded and have to be addressed by the government and by Parliament as well. At the same time, the committee observed that it does not negate the need for such legislation, especially when DNA technology was in use. “Its use in recent months has exposed a false encounter in which innocents were killed contradicting initial claims made that they were militants,” the report said. It pointed to the encounter at Shopian in Kashmir last September, where the Army had killed three men claiming to be unidentified terrorists. The DNA sample from the three dead men matched with their families, confirming it to be a fake encounter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/collection-of-dna-samples-will-lead-to-misuse/article33744859.ece

Almost all vital organs including heart, liver, two kidneys and lungs were harvested after he was declared brain-dead and his family members consented to donate the organs. The shepherd, B. Balaiah from Kodair mandal, Nagarkurnool, met with a road accident on January 31 and was rushed to Continental Hospitals where he was diagnosed to have intra-cerebral haemorrhage. Though doctors operated on him and provided optimal care in ICU, the patient’s condition continued to deteriorate. He was declared brain-dead on Wednesday morning. Family counselled Upon counselling, his son and other family members decided to donate his functioning organs to give a new lease of life to others. Doctors from the hospital harvested all possible functioning organs. With help of police, a green channel was arranged and the organs were transported to four different hospitals. Four destinations The man’s heart was transferred to Care Hospital, lungs to KIMS Hospitals, one kidney shifted to Apollo Hospitals in Jubilee Hills and another was sent to the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences at Punjagutta. The liver was transplanted in a patient at Continental Hospital, the same hospital where the shepherd was declared brain-dead, informed a press release. Future course of action Balaiah’s son B.

04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Take quick action as situation is dangerous, says Rahul||Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said India’s international reputation had taken a “massive hit” because of the way the government was treating its own people, and asserted that the country was in a “dangerous condition” and the Prime Minister should take quick action to lead it. At a press conference at the party headquarters, the Congress leader attacked the Narendra Modi government over its handling of the farmers’ agitation and the Budget, which, he claimed, not only sends a wrong signal to China but also caters to 1% of the population. He also asked why the government has made Delhi into a fortress with barricades. He said the farmers are not going to back off and ultimately, the government will have to withdraw the laws. “The reputation of India has taken a massive hit. Not only on how we are treating our farmers [but] how we treat our own people, how we treat journalists; it has taken a massive hit. Our biggest strength, you can call it soft power, has been shattered by the BJP and the RSS,” Mr. Gandhi said. Asked about international pop singer Rihanna tweeting about the farmers’ protests, the Congress leader, however, called it “our internal matter”. “The country requires the Prime Minister to take quick action. It requires that the Prime Minister put money immediately into the hands of our people and start the economy. It requires that he protects the small and medium businesses who give us jobs... it requires a clear message to China that ‘you cannot do this with us’. You cannot be sitting inside our land and expect that nothing is going to happen,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/take-quick-action-as-situation-is-dangerous-says-rahul/article33744840.ece
04 February 2021||New Delhi,||No Internet yet at Delhi borders, say protesters||The Union Home Ministry did not extend an order to suspend Internet beyond 11 p.m. on February 2 at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri — the three locations bordering Delhi where farmer groups continue to swell to protest against the three farm laws passed by Parliament last September. However, protesters at the three locations said Net remained blocked on Wednesday as well. International artist Rihanna and author Meena Harris, niece of U.S. Vice-President Kamal Harris, had through tweets criticised the Internet shutdown at the protest site. The Ministry invoked the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety Rules 2017) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 to suspend Internet in Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri from 11 p.m. on January 31 to 11 p.m. on February 2. The emergency provisions were invoked on January 26 and January 29 during the farmers’ protest. Before this, the provision was used only twice — during the anti-CAA protests on December 19 and 20, 2019. The rules framed in 2017 empower the Union Home Secretary and a State’s Home Secretary to pass directions to suspend the telecom services, including Internet in an area “due to public emergency or public safety”. A senior government official said the Net suspension order that was effective till 11 p.m. on February 2 had not been extended. “There is still no Internet at the Singhu border today. It is still suspended, despite whatever the Home Ministry is saying,” said Harinder Singh, media coordinator for the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “It’s just another attempt to defame the farmers. They know it very well that farmers at Singhu are not aware of these claims and they can’t counter these claims,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-internet-yet-at-delhi-borders-say-protesters/article33744843.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Plea seeks probe into role of RBI officials in bank scams||BJP leader and MP Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the role played by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials in various banking scams that plague the country’s economy, causing prejudice to public interest. The petition, filed by Dr. Swamy and advocate Satya Sabharwal, said the alleged involvement of RBI officials in scams involving various entities, including Kingfisher, Bank of Maharashtra, an Uttar Pradesh-based private sugar organisation, Nirav Modi, Rotomac Global, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, IL&FS, PMC Bank, Yes Bank and First Leasing Company of India, had not been investigated. The petition alleged that the RBI officials had acted in “demonstrable active connivance” in direct violation of statutes such as the Reserve Bank of India Act, Banking Regulation Act, State Bank of India Act, Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act and the Nationalised Bank (Management and Miscellaneous Provisions) Scheme, 1980. It said information procured through the Right to Information (RTI) Act revealed that “no officer of Reserve Bank of India has ever been held accountable for any dereliction of duty in case of any fraud reported by any bank. This is in sharp contrast to the number of frauds exploding in the banking sector in India aggregating to in excess of over Rs. 3 lakh crore”. This lapse has occurred despite RBI retaining the power to monitor, regulate, supervise, audit and direct the functioning of banking companies in the country. “The scheme of the Banking Regulation Act makes the Reserve Bank of India the alter ego of the bank management, more so in case of public sector banks. Yet, in none of the high-profile banking scams, the Central Bureau of Investigation investigating these scams has not even sought to examine at a cursory the role of officials of RBI,” the petition said. The RBI has failed to protect the interest of various stakeholders, the petition alleged.

04 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Truce dawns in NCP||A truce appeared to dawn in the State unit of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) riven by a disagreement over the proposal to cede the Pala Assembly seat to Jose. K. Mani of the Kerala Congress (M). NCP president Sharad Pawar, Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] general secretary Sitaram Yechury and NCP general secretary in charge of Kerala Praful Patel appeared to have convinced the opposing factions to sink their differences and remain in the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Parleys in capital NCP State president T. P. Peethambaran, incumbent Pala legislator Mani C. Kappan and Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran met them in New Delhi on Wednesday. Mr. Kappan’s vehement opposition to ceding the seat to Mr. Mani had brought matters to a head in the NCP. Mr. Saseendran felt the opposite. He reportedly argued for accommodating Mr. Mani, a proposal that had the seal of approval of the CPI(M) State leadership. Meanwhile, some Congress leaders claimed that Mr. Kappan had contemplated jumping ship. They felt that Mr. Kappan would gravitate towards the United Democratic Front (UDF) and help offset the political setback caused due to the defection of Mr. Mani to the LDF. Mr. Peethambaran appeared to stick with Mr. Kappan and left the final decision to the NCP’s national leadership. His gambit appears to have paid off for now. Party leaders presented a unified face to reporters in New Delhi. Mr. Patel will visit Kerala to meet Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other LDF leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/truce-dawns-in-ncp/article33745153.ece
04 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Keep the mind open, Amartya Sen tells Kerala||Nobel-winning economist Amartya Sen on Wednesday urged the State to keep “'the mind open” to pursue the future with success, asserting that the State’s reliance on humanity, reasoning and public discussion was its central asset which would serve it in good stead. The possibility of expansion remains very strong for Kerala, partly because the mindset that focusses on humanity as opposed to physical assets is well established in the State, Prof. Sen said, addressing online the concluding session of the Kerala Looks Ahead conclave organised by the State Planning Board. “I would say that the successful use of humanity, the concentration of human reasoning, the particular focus on public discussion whereby we learn from each other and if there is a different view and then, we criticise each other for it – these are features that have been part of the Kerala economic strategy,” he said, adding that personally he was optimistic about the State’s plans for the future. Looking ahead Kerala was a State that looked ahead long ago, he said, recalling the role of the labour movement, the anti-untouchability movement, the role of missionaries and the Communist government that came to power in 1957 in fuelling the growth trajectory of the State. There is no substitute to an inquiring mind that has, as Rabindranath Tagore said, not been blocked or free flows being choked, Prof. Sen said. “In Kerala, the free flow has not been choked and I hope it will not be choked. But in order to pursue the future with the same success, and more than in the past, it needs to keep the mind open, to ask the question again and again – are we doing the right thing?” he said. Prof. Sen also recalled his days at the Delhi School of Economics when his colleagues often countered his argument that Kerala would be “a world-beater” saying that he was blinded by political prejudice. The three-day conclave, which covered sectors critical to the State’s future development, stimulated national and international discussions among scholars and experts, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in his concluding remarks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keep-the-mind-open-amartya-sen-tells-kerala/article33745155.ece
04 February 2021||BENGALURU,||BEL makes modules for radar on Rafales||As part of the offset commitments under the Rafale deal, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has manufactured and delivered Transmit and Receive modules (T/R) for the Advanced Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar on the jet, said Thales of France on Wednesday. “In November 2020, the first RBE2 AESA radar with a front end manufactured by BEL in India was delivered by Thales to Dassault Aviation. BEL implemented a set of rigorous processes at its Bangalore facility in order to achieve this key milestone,” the statement at Aero India said. India has contracted 36 Rafale jets in fly-away condition under a€7.87 billion Inter-Governmental Agreement signed with France in September 2016. It has a 50% offset clause to be discharged by French companies in India. The T/R modules are key to the RBE2 radar’s active electronic scanning performance, enabling it to steer the radar beam with the speed of an electronic chip. Transfer of technology Initiated at the end of 2017, the transfer of technology to BEL had included validation of the company’s technical capacity to deliver prototypes, qualify the various technologies involved in the wiring process, set up a dedicated SMC wiring production line with a preproduction run, train BEL engineers in France and install test benches for microwave characterisation at the BEL facility, Thales said. The modules produced in India are then integrated with the RBE2 radar in France. “We’re delighted to see our collaboration with BEL delivering results,” said Emmanuel De Roquefeuil, vice president and Country director, Thales in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bel-makes-modules-for-radar-on-rafales/article33744823.ece
04 February 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Delayed second Oxford dose helps’||On December 30, 2020, the U.K. granted emergency use approval to the Oxford vaccine based on interim efficacy results from 131 COVID-19 cases. The U.K. regulator approved the second dose of the vaccine to be given 12 weeks after the first. Now, a preprint paper with updated efficacy results based on research led by Oxford University after a further month of data collection that includes 332 COVID-19 cases shows that delaying the second dose beyond four weeks increases the level of protection. The data in the preprint show that vaccine efficacy was high when the interval between the two doses was two months and continued to increase with a longer dose interval. Vaccine efficacy after two standard doses increased from 54.9% when the second dose was administered less than six weeks after the first dose to 82.4% when the gap between the two doses was more than 12 weeks. India began vaccinating healthcare workers on January 16 and the expert committee set up by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) recommended that the second dose be administered between four and six weeks after the first. According to the latest study, the longer interval between the first and second dose provides better protection without any compromise in the three-month period until the second dose is administered. It reports that the vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 after a single standard dose was 76% from day 22 to day 90. The antibody levels were maintained during this period with no evidence of significant waning of protection. However, the first dose did not provide protection against asymptomatic infection in the same period. But the overall cases of PCR positives reduced by 67% after the first, suggesting the potential for a substantial reduction in transmission. Participants aged 18-55 years who received the second dose more than 12 weeks after the first had antibody titres that were two-fold higher than those who received the second dose within six weeks. The researchers also found that neutralising antibody titres measured by pseudovirus were higher after a longer interval before the second dose. The researchers say “vaccination programmes aimed at vaccinating a large proportion of the population with a single dose, with a second dose given after a three-month period may be an effective strategy to reduce disease, and may be the optimal for a pandemic vaccine when supplies are limited in the short term”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delayed-second-oxford-dose-helps/article33744866.ece
04 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||HC imposes Rs. 1,000 costs each on 24 petitioners||Observing that a writ petition filed by 24 unemployed post-graduates seeking a direction to the government not to regularise contract lecturers was meritless, Telangana High Court on Wednesday imposed costs of Rs. 1,000 each on them. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy dismissed the writ petition, filed nearly five years ago, noting that it was not maintainable. The petitioners stated that the State government issued a GO MS No. 16 on February 26, 2016 proposing to regularise contract lecturers working in junior and degree colleges across the State. The petitioners’ counsel P.V. Krishnaiah contended the action of the government would adversely affect the interests of the unemployed post-graduates. “Did the government regularise the contract lecturers?” the CJ sought to know from the counsel. When he replied that the GO proposed regularisation of contract lecturers, the CJ remarked that then it had to be inferred that the petitioners approached the court in anticipation of government’s action. “You are building castles in the air,” observed the CJ Hima Kohli as the counsel could not explain how the petition was maintainable. The bench also wanted to know how many contract lecturers were working in the State. The counsel could not give precise figures. It also asked the counsel why the contract lecturers, whose proposed regularisation was being questioned, were not impleaded in the petition. Expressing dissatisfaction over the plea being filed on assumptions, the CJ said the court would not allow such roving and fishing inquiry. As the counsel, while presenting his contentions, said at one stage that he was not interested in pursuing the matter, the CJ said that court would impose costs of Rs. 10,000 each on the 24 petitioners. Eventually, the bench imposed costs of Rs. 1,000 each on the petitioners and dismissed the plea. The costs would be deposited in the account of State Legal Services Authority within two weeks, the order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-imposes-rs-1000-costs-each-on-24-petitioners/article33745463.ece

Based on an exposé aired by regional media, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and the Director General of Prisons Alok Mohan have sought details from officials concerned and promised to initiate action. An internal inquiry was ordered on Wednesday. According to the report, the inmates pay the security staff to get cigarettes, liquor, non-veg and food from outside, mobile phones and even contraband. The report alleged that inmates have to pay hefty amounts to stay in a cell that has all the facilities like a stove, water heater, fan and even a separate washroom. The city police had earlier carried out raids and confiscated mobile phones which were being operated from inside the prison for illegal activities. Though there are jammers, the exposé alleged that the prison staff deactivated them to help the inmates make calls. The Central Prison,, one of the largest in the country, has been under the scanner earlier too. Senior IPS officer D.

Addressing the gathering, Sangwan Khap president and Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan said the people of Haryana at the protest sites around Delhi had outnumbered those from Punjab participating in the agitation, which, he said, had now become the “mass movement”. Mr. Tikait, amid loud cheers, said the unions were firmly fighting for the farmers’ rights and there would be no compromise on their self esteem. He said there was no need for more farmers to march to Delhi as of now. Mr. Tikait said Haryana and Uttar Pradesh stood firmly behind Punjab to support the agitation and Mr. Rajewal was their leader. “There will be no change in the committee holding talks with the government. You don’t change horses in the middle of a battle,” said Mr. Tikait, stressing unity among the unions spearheading the agitation. Referring to the heightened security and barricading at the protest sites, Mr. Tikait said it showed that the ruler was scared. Mr. Rajewal said they had proved to the government that the farmers were right in seeking repeal of the laws, but the government didn’t want to listen to them.

The Bench, on Wednesday, was hearing petitions filed by NGO PUCL, and advocate Vishal Thakre against the implementation of the Prohibition Of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018. Senior advocate Sanjay Parekh, for PUCL, argued that more States, like Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, were passing identical laws. Mr. Thakre’s petition said “rampaging mobs are lifting off people in the middle of wedding ceremonies” buoyed by the enactment of these laws. In December last, the apex court refused to stay the two laws. “What we have here is multiple States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh enacting these laws which are absolutely horrifying. They require the prior permission to marry,” senior advocate C.U. Singh had submitted for Mr. Thakre in the December hearing. Mr. Singh had argued that the burden of proof is on the people who marry to show they are not doing so to get converted. “Those who are found guilty under these laws stare at a 10-year prison sentence. The offences are non-bailable. We are getting reports that people are being picked up in the middle of weddings on suspicion of religious conversion,” he had argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-conversion-laws-row/article33744828.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||No informal talks with farm unions: Minister||Positions have hardened after a section of farmers clashed with police on Republic Day, and police have since fortified the border protest sites with crippling security measures. Asked about the farm unions’ stance that they will not hold talks with the government until the multi-layered cement and barbed wire barricades are removed and farmers in police custody are released, Mr. Tomar said he did not want to comment on a law and order issue. “That is not my job,” he told The Hindu on the sidelines of a press conference. He suggested that the unions talk to the Police Commissioner regarding such concerns instead. Farm union leaders disagreed. “It’s not a law and order issue. The whole issue started with the three Acts and the MSP [or minimum support price for crops] issue. That is why we started our dharna. There was a programme on 26, where they have arrested many innocent people, so all these issues are connected with our main core issues,” said Darshan Pal Singh, president of the Krantikari Kisan Union. “What we demand is that harassment should be stopped, the barricades on the ways going to the dharna should be removed. Electricity, water problems, these Internet problems, these are not law and order problems. So if they want talks in a good conducive atmosphere, they should stop all these oppressive and repressive measures which are violating our basic human rights,” he added. In the early days of the protest in November and December, several farm union heads engaged in informal, backchannel conversations with multiple BJP leaders and Ministers, even before formal talks began. However, when asked whether such informal engagement with the unions was happening now, Mr. Tomar said, “No. We will inform you when formal talks will be held.” Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the government’s previous offer still stands and its doors are open for resumption of dialogue, unions say they have not received any direct outreach from the government post Republic Day. The unions have previously refused to engage with the Supreme Court-appointed committee on their demands, preferring to speak to the political executive instead. The Supreme Court panel held its third round of consultations with other farmer unions, farmer producer organisations, cooperatives and private market associations on Wednesday, and will hold two more rounds over the next two days, said committee member Anil Ghanwat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-informal-talks-with-farm-unions-minister/article33744829.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. notice to Twitter on ‘genocide’ hashtag||.It added that the accounts were blocked on the ground that they were spreading misinformation about protests and had the potential to lead to imminent violence affecting public order situation. The Centre in its notice quoted more than half a dozen Supreme Court judgments, including of Constitution benches, as to what is public order and what are the rights of authorities. The MeitY pointed out that the “prevailing situation” resulted into a “major public order issue” on Republic Day. “The statutory authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that no adverse public order situation takes place, and no cognizable offences are committed. In light of these developments and as a part of due process, and as per the settled practice, an order was passed…” the source added. Section 69A[3] provided for specific penal consequences in case of non-compliance of the directions issued under section 69A of the Act. It was “unfortunate” that though the order was received immediately, Twitter chose not to comply till nearly 3 pm on February 1. The government noted that Twitter’s assertion in its letter dated February 1 that stock phrases and exaggerations / crude emotional appeals did not constitute inflammatory speech in the light of the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, was “meritless as the content attached to the said hashtag has been found to be directly falling afoul of section 69A of the Act”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-notice-to-twitter-on-genocide-hashtag/article33744830.ece

The FIRs, registered by the police, accused them of posting instigating tweets and deliberately circulating fake news accusing the Delhi Police of the murder of a man driving a tractor during the violence on Republic Day. “This was clearly done with an intent to engineer large-scale riots and religious tension among different communities. This particularly assumes much significance as the ramifications of such riots and religious tensions would affect a sensitive state sharing international border. The accused persons have deliberately, without any authentication, fact-checking and verifying, purposefully posted fake, misleading and wrong information to instigate violence amongst the protesters, the farmer community,” the Gurugram Police FIR read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tharoor-journalists-move-sc-against-firs/article33744846.ece

We don’t want Trinamool leaders who do not have a clean image or are involved in illegal activities to join our party. Therefore, we do not want to conduct mass joinings any more.

The accused, Cheruku Rahul Goud from Abdullapurmet village, came to know about the victim through a family friend and since then, used to visit her house to attend their family functions and got her contact number, police said. Soon, he started harassing her over calls and asked her to live with him. A few days ago, he went to her house and warned to defame her in front of her husband, after which, she approached Meerpet police and lodged a complaint against him. A case under Nirbhaya Act was registered and Goud was remanded to judicial custody. He bore a grudge and hatched a plan to eliminate her. “As per the plan, three days ago, the accused purchased an axe near BN Reddy Nagar crossroads and went to her house around 6.45 p.m. on Monday, attacked her and fled,” the investigators said. She suffered bleeding injuries on her right shoulder, elbow and palm and was rushed to a private hospital.

The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in a detailed response. The response came hours after Ms. Rihanna said, “Why aren’t we talking about this [farmers protest]? The comment was followed by Swedish activist Ms. Thunberg. She said, “We stand in solidarity with the farmers protest in India.” Ms. Meena Harris commented, “It’s no coincidence that the world’s oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. “We all should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters.”  The comments were followed by U.S. lawmaker Jim Costa of California.

04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Legislature panels can call witnesses’||Committees formed by State legislatures have the power to summon witnesses and enforce their attendance through compulsory process. It is a tradition that travels back 100s of years, the Delhi Assembly submitted in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. The Assembly was justifying the summons issued by its Committee on Peace and Harmony to Facebook officials to testify in connection with the Delhi communal riots in February last year. The court is hearing a plea by senior Facebook official Ajit Mohan who alleged that the notices issued by the Committee threatened him with breach of privilege action unless he appeared before it to testify. He had asked the court to protect his right to silence. Mr. Mohan said the Committee had no power or jurisdiction to summon a private person like him. “The order ultimately being asked for [by Mr. Mohan] from this court will spell the death knell for the work of legislative committees. All committees have the power to summon as witness and enforce attendance through compulsory process. To question this hundreds of years old tradition is like creating a Republic of Facebook within the Republic of India,” Mr. Singhvi argued. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan also agreed that the kind of notice sent by the Committee was “very common to Parliament and all the State legislatures”. The Committee, he said, had “merely followed a standard form of notice”. Mr. Singhvi said, “Riots had happened in Delhi. After sometime, if the NCT of Delhi wants to look into it, it is unhealthy that Facebook does not co-operate.” But Justice Kaul asked why the Committee had specifically asked for Mr. Mohan. By issuing notice to Mr. Mohan, was he being compelled to appear under the threat of breach of privilege. It should have been, as senior advocate Harish Salve for Mr. Mohan pointed out, left to Facebook to choose its representative to be sent before the Committee. To this, Mr. Singhvi said, to his knowledge, the Committee wanted a “senior competent person” from Facebook to testify. “I have never said that apart from Mr. Ajit Mohan anyone else cannot be recognised before us,” Mr. Singhvi submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/legislature-panels-have-the-power-to-summon-witnesses-sc-told/article33745136.ece

Shircy, a judge of the Kerala High Court, just as the judge was about to enter the court premises around 9.45 a.m. on Wednesday. The police arrested Reghunathan Nair, 55, of Erumely, Kottayam, on charge of the offence. He allegedly had in his possession a letter addressed to the High Court drawing attention to the ‘apathetic’ probe into the disappearance of Jasna Maria, a second-year BCom student from Pathanamthitta in March 2018, and seeking a more thorough investigation. Habeas corpus The police said the accused was convinced that Jasna was murdered and wanted the case to be treated accordingly. There were reports that his act was instigated by the High Court’s ‘inaction’ on a habeas corpus petition related to the disappearance. The police did not confirm the report. It is not known whether he is associated with any action council seeking justice to Jasna. The police seemed to consider it an instance of a lone-wolf protest. He was charged with relevant provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and Sections 353 (whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant) and 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/man-pours-motor-oil-on-judges-vehicle-arrested/article33744822.ece

The airport flyover and the stretch on Anna Salai near the Omandurar Government Estate are some of the spots identified under the initiative. “We have planned to improve 16 junctions as part of road safety works and lighting is a very important part of it. These points have been chosen since they could use better infrastructure and we have received requests from motorists,” an official in the department said. Since lighting is usually handled by the local body, the department will install poles, bulbs, fixtures and electrify them. The monthly power bills will be borne by the Greater Chennai Corporation. A proposal has been sent to the government, seeking sanction for funds to carry out the proposals, which have been estimated to cost Rs. 38 crore. S. Balan, a resident of Alandur, who welcomed the proposal to improve lighting, said that many bus stops, including the ones at Little Mount, near Gemini flyover and Spencer’s Signal, needed better lighting. “These are all points on Anna Salai and one of the agencies responsible for the shelters or the road or the buses, needs to take steps to brighten up these locations,” he said. The Highways Department also plans to take up installation of hand rails, medians and footpaths on some stretches of the southern sector of Inner Ring Road, including the MRTS Service Road, hand rails at Villivakkam ROB, and crash barriers on G.N.T. Road and Jawaharlal Nehru Salai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/highways-dept-to-improve-lighting-at-16-junctions-in-city/article33745392.ece
04 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Nothing much in Budget for children, education: activists||The Union Budget has not provided enough for children and youngsters, according to child right activists and educators. Though the Centre had plans to introduce a National Education Policy (NEP), it has not provided sufficient funds in the Budget to implement them, they said. A study of the Budget by the Centre for Child Rights points out that the Central government professed focus on NEP, but the share of child education had fallen from 2.18% to 1.74%. The study has also found that the month-wise spending on children’s education during the pandemic had fallen. There has been month-wise underspending by the erstwhile Ministry of Human Resource Development (now the Ministry of Education), the study revealed. It is important to allocate sufficient budget for children, said Andrew Susairaj, convener, Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch. Crime on children “We have to separate it as two components – crime on children and crime against children. There has been a 200% rise in crime on children. But the child protection budget has been continuously falling. Similarly, the Sustainable Development Goals are about reducing infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate. To reduce them we need investment,” he said. The government had increased allocation for health but that was to combat the COVID-19 infection. Child nutrition “We have to look at developing infrastructure and nutrition for children, given that 70% of children are anaemic. Same goes for education. Even to deal with Pocso cases we need child-friendly infrastructure,” he added. To prevent the rise in children in conflict with law, an effective child protection system is necessary, which in turn calls for funds. Every year the revised estimates for the Budget had been falling. If it is cut this year, then next year the government is bound to reduce it further. Arun Kumar, general secretary of the All India Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation, condemned the Budget’s thrust on implementing the NEP. “The Budget speaks of many things without adequate financing. The government had slashed the budget by 6.13% for education, compared to the previous year. This would force the government to rely on market forces to implement its policies,” he said. The Bill for formation of Higher Education Commissions would put all policy initiatives in the hands of the Central government. No measures had been spelled to fill the largescale vacant teaching and non-teaching posts in the country, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nothing-much-in-budget-for-children-education-activists/article33744995.ece
04 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||File report on steps taken to prevent honour killings: HC||The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to file a status report on the steps taken to implement directions issued by it in April 2016 for establishing special cells in every district to protect couples who perform inter-faith or inter-caste marriages and consequently prevent honour killings. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy called for the report following a public interest litigation petition filed by Vidya Reddy, managing trustee of Tulir Charitable Trust. The litigant had expressed concern over the delay in establishing such cells, with a 24-hour helpline, as directed by the court. When State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan brought it to the notice of the court that a suo motu public interest litigation petition too was pending in the court on the same issue, the judges directed the Registry to club the cases. They also accepted a request to grant eight weeks to file the status report. Earlier, advocate Deepika Murali, representing the litigant, said Justice V. Ramasubramanian, now a Supreme Court judge, had issued directions to the State government on the issue, during his stint as a judge of the Madras High Court in 2016. The directions included constitution of special cells. The judge had made it clear that the district-level special cells must comprise of the Superintendent of Police, district social welfare officer and district Adi-Dravidar welfare officer. He further ordered that the cells should operate a 24-hour helpline to receive complaints of harassment to the couples and provide necessary assistance. Unlike the general practice of the police of counselling youngsters and forcing them to go with their parents, the judge had specifically directed the police to counsel parents and provide temporary shelter to the couples. The State was also ordered to make available sufficient funds at the disposal of the special cells. Despite such orders, incidents of suspected “honour” killings were being reported, the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/file-report-on-steps-taken-to-prevent-honour-killings-hc/article33744974.ece
04 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK approaches court over I-T Dept. decision to transfer files||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the DMK Charitable Trust have moved the Madras High Court challenging orders passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) to transfer their files from one Assessment Officer to another, who has been investigating the 2019 search and seizures with respect to the party’s general secretary Duraimurugan and others. Justice Anita Sumanth directed senior standing counsel Hema Muralikrishnan, A.P. Srinivas and A.N.R. Jeyaprathap to take notice on behalf of the I-T officials and obtain necessary instructions by February 18. The judge gave a short adjournment since senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the petitioner, insisted upon staying the operation of the Commissioner’s order. In his orders, the Commissioner had referred to the search operations at the residences and other premises belonging to Mr. Duraimurugan, his son Kathir Anand, who contested from the Vellore Parliamentary constituency, and others on March 30 and April 1, 2019. He pointed out that the group case was being investigated by an Assistant Commissioner in Chennai Central Circle. Coordinated probe Indicating that the Director-General of Income Tax (Investigations), Chennai, had requested the transfer of the files of the DMK and its charitable trust to the same Assistant Commissioner “in order to facilitate a coordinated investigation”, the Commissioner had granted permission for such transfer by exercising his powers under Section 127 of the Income Tax Act of 1961. Transfer orders Questioning the validity of the two transfer orders, Mr. Wilson contended that Section 127 of the Act requires the Commissioner to give a reason for ordering the transfer, but no such reason had been recorded in the orders under challenge. Claiming that the files were already being moved, he apprehended that the new assessing officer might unnecessarily reopen old assessments of the party and the trust. Stating that the political party had a cadre base of around one crore and that nearly one lakh of them were its office-bearers, the counsel said its files could not be transferred at will and clubbed with those pending against every other office-bearer. “During [the upcoming Assembly] election, they want to silence us,” Mr. Wilson contended and insisted on staying the Commissioner’s orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-approaches-court-over-i-t-dept-decision-to-transfer-files/article33744989.ece

The condition also results in anaemia and treatments often need blood transfusion. “A dog is diagnosed as thrombocytopenic when its platelet count is less than 50,000/cmm. Per day 10 to 15 cases are treated in the Madras Veterinary College (MVC) Hospital for this condition,” said S. Balasurbramanian, Director of Clinics, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS). Ticks are a major cause of concern for the animals and pet parents as they are carriers of parasites like Babesia gibsoni and Ehrlichia canis that cause blood infection. One in four dogs in the country is prone to this infection. “Signs include hemorrhages on the skin, pale mucous membranes, nosebleed, blood in vomit, passage of fresh blood from anal region, blood in urine and blood in faeces,” explained M. Chandrasekar, professor, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, Madras Veterinary College (MVC), Vepery. Some dogs will have a higher body temperature, loss of appetite and yellow mucous membrane, as in jaundice. The sickness results in multiple organ failure and death. “Sometimes dogs do not even show any symptoms and thrombocytopenia may be detected only during a routine check-up,” said Dr. Chandrasekar. It is not just ticks as mosquitoes and houseflies also carry the parasites. “Regular blood check-ups apart from tick control, deworming and vaccinations will help them assess the health status of the animal,” said S. Kavitha, professor and head, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, MVC. She said other causes of thrombocytopenia include canine parvovirus, distemper virus, autoimmune diseases, hereditary diseases, vaccination reactions and drug therapy. Diagnosis is made mainly on blood tests (platelet count and complete blood count). Serum biochemistry, urinalysis, radiography and ultrasonography help assess severity adds more to the picture. Treatment is based on the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia and ranges from use of specific drugs, antibiotics, corticosteroids and blood transfusions etc. “When the platelet counts are too low, the dog may require a platelet transfusion. In case of anaemia, a whole blood transfusion may be required. In immune mediated thrombocytopenia where the immune response is the cause, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are used,” explained P. Selvaraj, professor, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, MVC. Advanced facility Dr. Balasubramanian said the MVC had India’s most advanced veterinary transfusion medicine facilities and provides blood component therapies like packed RBC, platelets, fresh/frozen plasma, besides consultations on coagulation and bleeding disorders management. “However, the easiest way is to implement effective tick control measures and regular health and blood check-ups, which will help in the prevention of thrombocytopenia,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spurt-seen-in-tick-borne-diseases-in-dogs-and-cats/article33745396.ece
04 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GST compensation due to T.N. for FY 2020-21 at Rs. 15,475 crore||The provisional GST compensation due to Tamil Nadu for FY 2020-21 (till November) stands at Rs. 15,475 crore, according to information provided in the Rajya Sabha. Responding to a question on GST dues to States, Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister for State Finance, said in a written reply that GST compensation for financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 had already been paid to the States. However, only part GST compensation had been released to the States for the bi-monthly compensation period of April and May, 2020, due to short cess collection in the GST Compensation Fund, he said. This has happened mainly due to the economic impact of COVID-19 that has led to a higher compensation requirement. This is due to lower GST collections, as well as lower collection of GST compensation cess (which is used for providing compensation to the States), Mr. Thakur said. Pending dues The balance GST compensation for April-May 2020 and GST compensation for the full period June-November 2020 was pending for all States, he said. Responding to another question by DMK MP Tiruchi Siva on GST compensation to Tamil Nadu, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said a total of Rs. 12,073 crore compensation had been paid to the State for FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20. No State has experienced a fall in GST revenue collections with the introduction of GST. However, the GST revenue collection of all States is not at 14% compounded growth rate over the base year revenue of 2015-16, and therefore, GST compensation is payable to most States, she said. An official statement from the Finance Ministry on Wednesday said Rs. 5,229.92 crore had been released to Tamil Nadu through its special-borrowing window, to meet the resource gap due to the non-release of GST compensation, on account of inadequate balance in the Compensation Fund.  However, only part GST compensation had been released to the States for the bi-monthly compensation period of April and May, 2020||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gst-compensation-due-to-tn-for-fy-2020-21-at-rs-15475-crore/article33744972.ece

Yuvaraj, secretary of the Karnataka State unit of the party, from the primary membership of the organisation, for having taken part in an “anti-party activity”. A statement issued by Chief Minister and co-coordinator of the party Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister and coordinator of AIADMK O. Pannerselvam stated that the office-bearer was relieved of all positions in the party. Asked whether he tried to meet V.K.

In a circular, Director of School Education S. Kannappan said schools which are relatively smaller or have a large student strength can consider conducting classes on alternate days or follow a shift system to ensure adherence to physical distancing norms. “If schools are holding classes in morning and evening shifts for batches of students, the premises would have to be disinfected and sanitised before the evening shift begins,” he said. The schools have been asked to make use of extra classrooms, if available, and utilise larger spaces like auditoriums or libraries that can accommodate more students with physical distancing norms in place. All schools would be required to strictly implement the Standard Operating Procedure the State had issued in January, before schools were reopened for Classes X and XII.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/advisory-issued-ahead-of-reopening-of-schools-for-classes-ix-xi/article33745405.ece

As on January 22, a sum of Rs. 231.76 crore had been recovered from ineligible farmers across the country. Of this, around Rs. 158.57 crore was from Tamil Nadu, according to an annexure attached to the Union Minister’s reply, in response to a question by four Members of Parliament on the status of implementation and coverage of the scheme. In Tamil Nadu, the total number of ineligible farmers identified was nearly 6.97 lakh. These farmers were paid around Rs. 321.32 crore. This meant that about 50% of what was given to the ineligible farmers had been recovered. Last August, a “sharp spike” in the registration of beneficiaries was noticed by the State Agriculture Department, as there was a rise of four lakh beneficiaries in four-five months. A syndicate of operators in private computer centres in several northern districts was suspected to be behind the scam. Later, officials launched a drive to recover money from the ineligible beneficiaries. Income-tax payees are among the ineligible beneficiaries under the scheme, which envisages payment of Rs. 6,000, in three equal installments in a year, to farmers, regardless of the size of landholding. Other types of ineligible persons include professionals and pensioners, drawing a monthly pension of Rs. 10,000 or more. Across the country, about Rs. 2,327 crore was paid to around 33 lakh ineligible beneficiaries. In Tamil Nadu, the total number of beneficiaries was approximately 45.54 lakh farmers. Putting together payments under all installments since the launch of the scheme in February 2019, the farmers have received Rs. 5,141.65 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-kisan-scam-tn-accounts-for-two-thirds-of-recovered-amount/article33744975.ece

04 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||M.Tech courses: HC grants further time for govt. to respond||The Madras High Court on Wednesday granted further time for the State government and Anna University to come up with a positive response on conducting M. Tech (Biotechnology) and M. Tech (Computational Biology) courses for academic year 2020-21. Justice B. Pugalenthi directed the respective counsel to revert back by Monday. He termed as “very unfortunate” a decision taken to not offer the two courses during this academic year due to a dispute on the quantum of reservation to be followed during admissions. Trouble over quota The State government had this year insisted upon following its 69% reservation policy though the central policy of reservations not exceeding 50% was followed all along for the two centrally sponsored courses, which provide for a stipend of around Rs. 12,000 a month to every student. When it was brought to the notice of the judge that around Rs. 60 lakh was required to conduct the two courses, he wondered why the State government or the university itself could not fund the two courses in the interest of students and implement the local reservation policy. Assailing the decision to not offer the courses this year, advocate A. Saravanan, representing one of the aspirants, said as many as 45 meritorious students would be denied an opportunity to pursue higher education this year because of a dispute between two governments. He said the difference between following the Centre’s reservation policy and the State government’s policy would affect admissions to about nine seats. “Why should the other 36 students suffer because of the dispute over admission to nine seats?” he asked. He also said the dreams of 45 candidates, who had cleared their bachelor’s degree in biotechnology and also passed the Graduate Aptitude Test in Biotechnology (GAT-B), would be shattered if the two post graduate courses were not conducted by Anna University this year.

Mani, was on Wednesday involved in day-long discussions with an AIADMK team, headed by Electricity Minister P. Thangamani. Talks were held on providing internal reservation for Vanniyars within the MBC quota. Former Union Minister A.K. Moorthy and spokesperson K. Balu were among the PMK representatives at the meet, held at the Minister’s residence. Sources said the PMK representatives held two meetings with the AIADMK leadership — in the morning and evening. “We have told them whatever we wanted to say. Now the ball is in their [AIADMK’s] court,” said a PMK leader. It is believed that a number, with regard to the percentage of internal reservation within the MBC quota, had been discussed. Among those who represented the AIADMK were deputy coordinators K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam. A party leader said the discussions, held “smoothly,” constituted an “ongoing process.” “Nothing concrete has emerged so far,” he said, refusing to comment whether the talks also covered seat-sharing details. The discussions are a culmination of the PMK’s renewed protests demanding 20% exclusive reservations for Vanniyars. The Ministers and the PMK held several rounds of talks over the demands, as explained recently by PMK founder S. Ramadoss. Despite modifying his demand to “internal reservation within MBC quota” from the original demand for 20% separate reservations for Vanniyars, Dr. Ramadoss recently said the Chief Minister had not responded and that the PMK would take a “political decision” regarding continuing in the AIADMK alliance for the upcoming election. Subsequently, a few Ministers met Dr. Ramadoss on January 30 and said the issue could be discussed on February 3. The PMK’s special governing council, on January 31, decided that it would take part in discussions with the AIADMK. The PMK representative said they expected a response from the State on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-aiadmk-in-talks-over-quota-for-vanniyars/article33744983.ece

04 February 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘First preference of Muslims will be BJP’||The BJP will prove in the upcoming Assembly elections that it is the first preference of Muslims in the State, asserted the party’s State vice-president K. Annamalai in Coimbatore on Thursday. Addressing a press conference, he claimed that the BJP is the number one party for Muslim brothers in States like Telangana and Bihar. “In this election, we will prove this in Tamil Nadu,” he said, adding that the BJP-led Central government has worked towards the welfare of Muslims. Regarding the recent arrest of BJP’s State executive committee member R. Kalyanaraman in Mettupalayam for his allegedly derisive remarks on Prophet Muhammad and Islam, Mr. Annamalai said that everybody has the right to freedom of speech. “Our fear is that he should not become a soft target,” he said, describing Kalyanaraman as someone who remains “strong in his ideology.” Alleging that “fundamentalist organisations” issued death threats to Kalyanaraman, Mr. Annamalai urged the police to handle those who issued threats “with the same aggression” they used to arrest him. Regarding the criticism of Opposition parties that the Union Budget announced multiple projects for the State with an eye on the upcoming elections, Mr. Annamalai claimed that the Central government has introduced projects for the State consistently since 2014 and does not favour any political party. BJP’s State vice-president P. Kanagasabapathi, who also addressed the mediapersons, asserted that the criticisms regarding privatisation following the Union Budget are unfounded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/first-preference-of-muslims-will-be-bjp/article33745034.ece

04 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Sasikala will play big role in forming next govt.’||Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala will continue with the legal battle to retrieve the AIADMK and play a larger role in the formation of the next AIADMK government, according to Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran. Addressing journalists in Madurai on Wednesday, he said Sasikala would be given a warm reception at the Tamil Nadu border on February 7, when she returns to Chennai. He said the AMMK, “formed to retrieve AIADMK”, will take forward its task in a democratic manner. Mr. Dhinakaran contended that as per by-laws of the AIADMK, only the general secretary had the powers to convene a general body meeting or to remove anyone from the party. “On December 29, 2016, Sasikala was elected as the general secretary by the general body. Since she could not act as general secretary after being jailed, the powers automatically went to the deputy general secretary [himself]. Since the next general body meeting was not convened as per the by-laws, a case is pending before the court on the removal of Sasikala,” the R.K. Nagar MLA said. Stating that the people of Tamil Nadu were aware as to what would happen if the DMK returned to power, he said all supporters of Jayalalithaa would ensure that the AIADMK retained power. “Sasikala will have a bigger role to play in the formation of the next AIADMK government,” he said. ‘Corrupt elements’ When a journalist asked if some of “corrupt” elements in the AIADMK were blocking Sasikala’s re-entry into the party, Mr. Dhinakaran said even they knew what would happen to them if the DMK comes back to power. “Maybe some might work with some stealth understanding in favour of the DMK,” he said. When asked about those pasting posters in support of Sasikala being expelled from the AIADMK, he said there was bound to be a lot of “chemical reaction” after her release. The closure of Jayalalithaa’s recently inaugurated memorial “for maintenance”, in anticipation of Sasikala’s visit there, was laughable, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sasikala-will-play-big-role-in-forming-next-govt/article33744969.ece
04 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||In a first, onboard railway staff to get postal ballots||For the first time, the Election Commission of India has planned to give postal ballots to railway workers considering them as employees involved in essential services. In a reply to a railway official, V. Ramkumar, who had sought postal ballots to onboard railway staff, the Election Commission has said that the employees of Indian Railways have been included under the category of absentee voters on essential services and postal ballot voting facility has been extended to them. Amendment made Accordingly, the Ministry of Law and Justice has already amended the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, for making provisions for voting through postal ballots to the persons notified in terms of clause (c) of Section 60 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, including absentee voters who are employed in essential services. In his representation, Mr. Ramkumar had said that the Indian Railways was running trains round the clock and during election days – for Parliament, State Assemblies and local bodies – the onboard staff, comprising loco pilots, train guards, travelling ticket examiners and other amenity staff, could not exercise their franchise.  ‘Far away’ “While on duty, they are away from their headquarters for 24 hours to 48 hours. All essential staff members cannot get leave on election days, because of the nature of their jobs,” he said. Stating that train services could not be stopped on election days, Mr. Ramkumar said in order to achieve the government’s aim of cent per cent voting in elections, the Election Commission should come up with some measures to provide postal ballots to onboard staff. “It is happy to note that postal ballots that were being given to government employees who were involved in election-related works are being extended to railway employees too. This will help all the onboard employees cast their votes without fail,” he said.  All essential staff members cannot get leave on election days, because of the nature of their jobs V.

Political parties in the alliance, which has a host of political parties including the Congress, CPI (M), CPI and VCK, had been organising several protests over the last two years opposing various detrimental Central policies and the ‘authoritarian’ functioning of Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi. The latest protests were a three-day round-the-clock dharna demanding the Lt. Governor’s recall on January 8 and a signature campaign on Republic Day. “As even after all this, our demands have fallen on deaf ears and Ms. Bedi has failed to mend her ways, the political leaders in the alliance will go on a fast on Friday to press for her recall and a bandh on February 16,” Mr. Narayanasamy said. Mr. Narayanasamy said all leaders of the alliance had unanimously endorsed the agitation for Ms. Bedi’s recall. As a prelude to the bandh, five teams would tour rural areas on February 14 and 15 to lay before the constituents a convincing case for the demand for the recall of the Lt. Governor. The Chief Minister said he was scheduled to call on President Ram Nath Kovind on February 10 to explain the recall demand. Opposing the abrupt roll out of the amended Motor Vehicles Act that meted out harsh penalties for violations, such as Rs. 1,000 penalty on two-wheeler riders for not wearing helmets, the alliance called for suspending the implementation before public awareness was created. The alliance has also urged the Centre to unconditionally repeal the farm laws that had drawn an over two-month protest in Delhi by farmers. The leaders also demanded stringent action against BJP/RSS leaders indulging in hate speech against the Prophet. The DMK, prominent ally of the Congress, skipped the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/secular-democratic-progressive-alliance-calls-for-bandh-on-feb16/article33745010.ece
04 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Consequences of farm laws could be far reaching’||Agriculture Minister R. Kamalakannan on Wednesday said the ongoing protests against the farm laws in Delhi had at stake not just the survival of farmers but the future of food security of the nation at large. Inaugurating a workshop on local food systems hosted by the French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP), Mr. Kamalkannan said the consequences of the new laws could be far-reaching for both farmers and consumers. He noted that Puducherry had a long tradition of extending food security, which could be traced back to the French era. The mid-day meal system for pre-school and schoolchildren even pre-dated the noon meal scheme pioneered in Tamil Nadu by its former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, he said. The Minister, who is a farmer himself, stressed the importance of reviving local food traditions, which equated food with medicine and vice versa. Pointing out that a single-minded focus on increased yield by using chemicals would result in the degradation of the soil, Mr. Kamalkannan said the trade-off of organic farming of rice, for instance, was the reason for the relatively higher market prices in relation to mass-produced high-yield varieties. This aspect needs closer examination, he said. French Consul General Lise Talbot Barre said on Thursday that the year ahead could see intense collaboration between India and France across critical areas of global cooperation, ranging across environment, climate change and biodiversity. Ms. Barre noted that recently Barbara Pompili, the French Minister for Ecological Transition, had been in Delhi to launch the Indo-French Year of the Environment. The thrust of the collaboration was to strengthen Indo-French cooperation in sustainable development, increase the effectiveness of actions in favour of global environment protection and raise visibility. Also on schedule later in the year, if the COVID-19 situation permitted, were other important summits, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Glasgow and the World Congress on Nature in Marseille, the Consul General said. On the workshop, Ms. Barre said the IFP was showing the way in linking scientific research and society and coming up with solutions in the policy space for everyday issues. Increase in assistance Uma Gurumurthy, District Development Manager, NABARD, outlined some of the recent initiatives of the bank that included digitisation of 40,000 women members of about 4,000 SHGs in Karaikal, enhanced assistance for Farmer Producer Organisations and complementing newly-introduced solar drying techniques for value addition in fish trade with market linkages. Raja Venugopal, organic farmer and president of the Puducherry Pradesa Nammazhvar Eyarkal Uzhavargal Sangam, stressed the need to support farmers with small land holdings. Helene Guetat-Bernard, head of social sciences, IFP, said the workshop on local food systems was into the third edition and would hopefully be an annual fixture with public support. The IFP’s work in the domain of agro-ecology aimed at autonomy for food producers and to engender social, economic and political justice by guiding federal policies. Raphael Mathevet, head of ecology, IFP, said the institution engaged in a model of participatory research that linked field experiments with social experiences. The IFP sought to serve as a bridge between science and society, and help shape public policy in the spheres of environment and agro-ecology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consequences-of-farm-laws-could-be-far-reaching/article33745602.ece
04 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Set up expert panel to study new Act’||AIADMK leader in the Legislative Assembly and secretary (East) A. Anbalagan on Wednesday demanded the setting up of an expert committee to study the merits and de-merits of implementing the new Motor Vehicles Act. At a press conference here, he said that the act was not implemented by several States, including neighbouring Tamil Nadu. He urged the Lieutenant Governor to stop implementing the new rules till the committee gave its report. No act could be implemented forcefully on the public. The huge penalty imposed for various offences would cause inconvenience to the people. Questioning the necessity to implement helmet rule inside the town, he said no two-wheeler rider could travel more than 20 km per hour inside the town. MLA flays CM AIADMK legislator and party secretary for elections (east) Vayyapuri Manikantan questioned the stand of Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on the helmet issue. In a statement, he said the Chief Minister’s claim that he was not part of the decision to make helmets mandatory was not true. “He cleared the file and now he claims to create awareness first and then make the rules mandatory. The Lt. Governor and the Chief Minister have a secret understanding on several issues,” he also said. The Chief Minister, in several cases, was party to the decision-making but subsequently for convenience would shift the blame on the Lt. Governor, the statement said. DMK stages agitation Meanwhile, the DMK workers led by legislator and convenor of south R. Siva staged a protest in front of the traffic police station for making helmets mandatory. Mr. Siva told reporters that the penalty of Rs. 1,000 being imposed for not wearing helmet was “hefty”. Residents had already started holding agitations inside the town against making the wearing of helmets compulsory for two-wheeler riders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/set-up-expert-panel-to-study-new-motor-vehicle-act-aiadmk/article33745596.ece
04 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||16-year-old boy collapses after playing video game for hours||A 16-year-old boy collapsed and died after he reportedly played an online game continuously for several hours. Police identified the deceased as Dharshan, a resident of Annai Thersa Nagar, V. Manaveli, near Villianur. He was studying Plus Two at a private school near Villianur. Superintendent of Police Ranganathan told The Hindu that the boy collapsed at around 7 p.m. while playing the online game ‘Fire Wall’ on Monday. “As per the information given by the boy’s parents, he attended online classes in the morning. And around 3 p.m., he starting playing online games on his mobile. After he collapsed, he was first taken to a private hospital and later to JIPMER. Efforts by the doctors did not succeed in reviving him,” he said. The preliminary assessment by doctors revealed that the boy died due to brain haemorrhage, Mr. Ranganathan said, adding a case had been registered under Section 174 of the CrPc on Tuesday. He said a detailed assessment could be done only after the post-mortem report. Experts at JIPMER, however, said it was untenable to pinpoint excessive indulgence in video games as the cause of death without more detailed information on the possibility of other underlying medical conditions. JIPMER sources said the boy was brought dead to the hospital on Tuesday. An autopsy identified cerebral haemmhorage as the cause of death. Sunil Narayan, neurology professor and stroke expert at JIPMER, said given the available information, it was unlikely that indulgence in video games in isolation was the reason of death in this case. “This is not to rule out that a surge in adrenaline — unlike hormones such as endorphin or dopamine more associated with addiction — not just from playing games, but overexertion of any kind, can aggravate to a fatal level an underlying vascular malformation by spiking heart rate and blood pressure,” Dr. Narayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/16-year-old-boy-collapses-after-playing-video-game-for-hours/article33745407.ece

04 February 2021||S. Prasad,TAMIL NADU||First declaration issued to notify Kaliveli wetlands on ECR a bird sanctuary||In a major push to declare Kaliveli wetlands, the second-largest brackish water lake in south India after Pulicat lake, a bird sanctuary, the Villupuram district administration has issued the first declaration under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The decision is seen as a big win for Forest Department officials and conservationists and their efforts to protect this wetland that remains a safe haven for diverse flora and fauna. According to Abhishek Tomar, District Forest Officer, Villupuram, “The first declaration was issued by the District administration recently under Section 18 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.” The Kaliveli wetlands are ecologically important and the decision is expected to enhance conservation activities in the biodiversity hotspot, he said. “The proposal has been sent to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF). Once it is cleared, the settlement process, including the declaration of rights will be set in motion and the final notification would be issued by the government,” he said. Officials are hopeful of getting the necessary approval from the government, and a formal announcement on notifying the wetlands as a sanctuary is expected soon. Located close to Marakkanam on the East Coast Road, the Kaliveli lake, spread over an expanse of 670 sq km of catchment area, is said to be one of the major wetlands on the Coromandel Coast after the Pulicat Lake. The lake is connected to the Bay of Bengal by the Uppukalli Creek and the Edayanthittu sanctuary and is visited for nesting by migratory birds on the Central Asian flyway. The southern part of the wetland has been a reserved land since 2001. According to a 2004 assessment of the Indian Bird Conservation Network and Bird Life International, Kaliveli supports more than 20,000 birds every year. The lake has a feeding ground for long-distance migrants from the cold subarctic regions of Central Asia and Siberia, including Black-tailed Godwits, Eurasian Curlew, White Stork, Ruff and Dublin. According to Raphael Mathevet, head of the Department of Ecology at the French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP) and a scientist working on the Kalivelli wetland, “The move for declaring this important area for water birds as a sanctuary is a step in the right direction. The Forest Department will have to develop a management plan that integrates the surrounding landscape and human activities.” Challenges ahead The first challenge will be to minimise the negative impact of the creation of a checkdam downstream that may impact water levels and salinity and also of the plan to create a fishing harbour in the estuary of the lagoon system downstream from the bird sanctuary, Mr. Mathevet said. “The surface area of the bird sanctuary is around 5,000 hectares while the wetlands are much larger than that. The Forest Department must work with the local communities to improve the management of the wetlands,” he added. Conservationists have welcomed the process to notify Kaliveli wetlands as a bird sanctuary, and said that this was a step in the right direction. According to S. Vimalraj, a naturalist, “The declaration of a notification will ensure that no construction activity takes place in the surroundings.” It will also help in maintaining the natural biosphere and biodiversity of the area intact and bring jobs to local residents through eco-tourism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/move-to-declare-kaliveli-wetlands-a-sanctuary/article33744996.ece

04 February 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Woman held for cheating people at ATMs||Theni Town police have arrested a 24-year-old woman on Wednesday for allegedly cheating people under the guise of helping them in depositing their money at ATMs. Following a complaint from Nagarajan (45), Theni Superintendent of Police Sai Saran Tejaswi directed the police to register a case. According to the complainant, he works as a manager at a textile showroom in the town. He had gone to a nationalised bank on the Theni-Periakulam Road a week ago to deposit Rs. 50,000 in his shop’s current account. However, as there was a large crowd, he planned to remit the sum at the ATM machine outside the branch. A young woman, who was standing in the queue there, volunteered to remit the cash in the machine for Mr. Nagarajan. When he reportedly handed over the sum, the woman returned Rs. 500 rupee note stating that the machine did not accept it and that the balance Rs. 49,500 has been accepted. When he went to his shop and checked the mobile, he saw no SMS from the bank. On the following day, the banker too informed him that there was no remittance. Immediately, Mr. Nagarajan lodged a complaint. Preliminary inquiries and close watch of the CCTV footage revealed that the woman hailed from Kondamanaickenpatti near Andipatti. Police team identified the suspect as Manimegalai (24) wife of Rajesh. Based on her confession, the police realised that she was not living with her husband. For survival, she had been indulging in such ‘tricks' at the ATMs. A senior officer, who was investigating the case, said that the accused had managed to cheat people in a similar manner at ATMs located in Bodinayakkanur and Usilampatti in the recent past. There were a few cases registered against her. Having graduated from a college six years ago, she got married, but was separated from her husband. Her modus operandi was to approach senior citizens visiting banks/ATMs and offer to remit money in their accounts swiftly, but walked out after siphoning off the cash. Further investigation was on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/woman-graduate-held-for-cheating-people-at-atms/article33744986.ece

Senthil Raj participated in a two-wheeler rally here on Wednesday to underline the need for wearing the protective gear. As part of the 32nd Road Safety Month being followed across the State, the district administration in association with the district police organised the event urging two-wheeler riders to wear helmet so as to avoid possible fatal accidents. After flagging off the rally at MGR Park on Palayamkottai Road, Dr. Senthil Raj and Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar rode bikes from the starting point to Our Lady of Snows Basilica on Beach Road via VVD Signal, Cruz Fernandez Statue and Old Corporation Building. A large number of policemen, personnel from the transport department and volunteers participated in the rally. “Since head injury is the prime reason for accidental deaths, mostly involving bikes, two-wheeler riders should always wear the helmet compulsorily. It’s not an order. It’s an appeal to every two-wheeler rider as their family is in need of them,” Dr. Senthil Raj said. He appealed to the public that they should respect and follow road safety rules and strictly avoid rash driving and driving under the influence of alcohol. He also distributed road safety awareness pamphlets to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/awareness-rally-focuses-on-importance-of-wearing-helmet-while-riding-two-wheelers/article33745676.ece
04 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination for frontline workers to begin today||Vaccination of front line workers, other than health workers, would begin in Tiruchi district at 15 designated centres from Thursday. The Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, Puthanatham Primary Healthcare Centre (UPHC), Lalgudi Government Hospital, Musiri GH, Srirangam GH, Inamkulathur PHC, Sirugambur PHC, Thuvakudi GH, Veeramachanpatti PHC, Valanadu PHC, Subramaniyapuram PHC, Vaiyampatty PHC, T. Pet PHC, Kattuputhur PHC and Woraiyur PHC have so far been registered on the Co-Win portal as session sites for the vaccination drive. Frontline workers who have registered on the portal will soon receive notifications on their date and time of inoculation, a data entry operator at the MGMGH, said. So far, the vaccination drive covered healthcare workers across the district. But many health workers, especially paramedical staff continued to be hesitant about the vaccination. A senior nurse at the Tiruchi MGMGH said that of 200 staff nurses deputed at the Government Hospital, only 35 had taken the vaccination. ‘We tried to tell them the importance of taking the vaccine, especially since they handle patients every day but they are unsure. We cannot force them,’ she said. Some house surgeons and other staff too were yet to take it. Meanwhile, K. Vanitha, Dean, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday. ‘I waited for four weeks to take the dose as I was taking other medication. When the frontline workers, and later the public begin to take the vaccine, the healthcare workers may not be given priority. We must grab the opportunity we have been provided,’ she said.

04 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Hike in import duty raises hopes of artificial gemstone manufacturers||The hike in customs duty on imported artificial gemstones from 7.5% to 15% in this year’s budget has buoyed manufacturers in Tiruchi who are desperately looking for measures to revive the once thriving industry here. Synthetic gemstones are an eco-friendly alternative (with the same chemical compositions and crystal structures) to precious and semi-precious stones that rely on quarrying. Created by the fusion and crystallisation under high pressure of certain chemicals, artificial gems are more common not just in jewels, clothing, plastic and leather goods, but also in industrial tools and in engraving blades, thread guides for the textile industry, in optics and so on. The industry, which once employed at least three lakh people in Tiruchi – manufacturers, traders and rural workers - at its peak in the mid-1990s, now has less than a thousand players. Cheap Chinese imports that sell for as low as Re.1 to 80 paise per stone, compared to the local, handmade ones costing Rs. 5 to 6, have been a major cause of the industry’s losses. “The import duty hike has been a long-standing demand of synthetic gem manufacturers, put forward through the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) and we are happy to see that the government has taken note of our concerns,” M.R. Venugopal, president, All India Synthetic Gems Manufacturers and Dealers Association, said. “Though the revised duty will help Indian manufacturers, it will take at least two years for the initiative to bear fruit,” he added. Industry players said that the import duty hike should be accompanied by a stress on indigenous equipment, because the lockdown had made it impossible for repairs to be carried out on foreign machines. A project to manufacture automated gemstone polishing equipment locally is nearing completion at the Siemens Centre of Excellence in Manufacturing under the auspices of National Institute of Technology – Tiruchi (NITT). T. Rajasekhar, a veteran synthetic gem cutter and polisher, has been working on fabricating a machine similar to a Chinese unit that he imported from Wuzhou city in Guangxi province in 2018. “I have dismantled my Chinese machine, and am collaborating with local technicians on putting together a gadget that will do the same job at a lower cost. I am hoping to have it ready by the end of February,” said Mr. Rajasekhar, who had spent Rs. 24 lakhs on the Chinese purchase. In addition to the protective taxation, the industry also needs to be able to deal with raw material suppliers directly, said K.P. Annamalai, Secretary, All India Synthetic Gems Manufacturers and Dealers Association. “At present, the procurement process is unregulated, which allows middlemen to profiteer with low-quality raw material. We have identified a few companies in China and other countries, that can be put in direct contact with manufacturers in Tiruchi, to ensure uniform production standards,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hike-in-import-duty-raises-hopes-of-artificial-gemstone-manufacturers/article33744947.ece
04 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘A great recognition for puppetry’||Retired government school teacher and veteran puppeteer, K. Kesavasamy, added another accolade to his much-lauded career this year -- the Padma Shri Award for arts. Joining him in his moment of happiness were not just his human friends and well-wishers, but the 500-plus handmade puppets that he has stored at his residence in Karaikal. “I initially learned puppetry as an aid for teaching in the 1970s, but I got so absorbed in the art that I decided to immerse myself in it,” Mr. Kesavasamy said in a telephonic interview. “The Padma Shri is a great recognition for a folk art like puppetry, and will encourage younger artistes to keep it alive,” he said. Originally from Tirumalairayan Pattinam, 6 km from Karaikal, he was born on April 20, 1943. His childhood years were spent in abject poverty as his father passed away when he was very young. “My mother and grandmother used to collect and clean leaves from banyan trees and sell them to eateries as disposable bowls and plates. My siblings and I still feel a lot of gratitude to the banyan leaves that helped us survive,” he said. An early aptitude for academics saw him getting double promotion in his middle school (under the Franco-Tamil curriculum in Puducherry), and eventually led to a career as a government school teacher and headmaster that lasted 35 years. He began his journey in puppetry in the 1970s, first learning it from the expert S. Kanagarethinam from 1978-80 and then teachers’ workshops conducted by the Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT). Mr. Kesavasamy also underwent ‘Gurukula’ training from Kumbakonam Kalai Kovil Bommalatta Kuzhu, Kumbakonam, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. He founded his own troupe Karai Raman Creations in 1980, and has penned around 500 plays featuring his puppets, with 20 full-time puppeteers on the rolls. “There are four types of puppetry styles – glove, shadow (made of leather), string and rod. I prefer to use an amalgamation of these genres,” said Mr. Kesavasamy, who crafts his dolls with papier mache and wooden moving parts. Besides teaching the folk art through South Zone Cultural Centre, Thanjavur, in different States, he also offers free lessons to interested people, and has trained several international students. His Sapthaswaram Music Academy has been promoting the performing arts as well. He also manages a home for the aged in Karaikal. He has received many awards, both for teaching and puppetry from the governments of Puducherry, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. His work in puppetry has been documented by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-great-recognition-for-puppetry/article33744954.ece
04 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Dry waste to be collected only once in a week from March||The Tiruchi Corporation has decided to collect non-biodegradable waste only once in a week under its door-to-door solid waste collection system. The plan was intended to encourage source segregation, reuse and recycle, senior officials said. In a notification distributed to commercial establishments and residential complexes, including apartments, it announced its plan. It said the plan was drawn up in 2016 but was not enforced. According to the 2016 notification, residential complexes and commercial establishments generating over 100 kg of waste per day and occupying over 5,000 square feet of space were asked to make arrangements or tie-up with a private organisation to convert biodegradable waste into compost or bio-gas on their own. Meanwhile, they were instructed to hand over non-biodegradable waste to a recycling unit. Various workshops, awareness programmes and exhibitions were organised to provide access to these facilities. The notification said that from March 1 onwards, non-biodegradable waste would be collected by sanitary workers of the corporation only on Wednesdays. The workers would refuse the collection if it was not segregated properly. The residents’ welfare associations and commercial establishments must begin to make arrangements for processing biodegradable waste on their own too. Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian said the move would begin with apartment complexes and commercial establishments but will soon be applied for door-to-door collection at all households in the city. ‘There are many sustainable options available in the market,’ he said. Commercial establishments and residents’ associations must take photographs and create documentation of their preparedness and submit them to assistant commissioners of their zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dry-waste-to-be-collected-only-once-in-a-week-from-march/article33744960.ece
04 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Hospitality industry shows signs of gradual recovery||The hospitality industry is showing signs of slow but steady recovery in Tiruchi region after months of unprecedented crisis and uncertainty. While Tiruchi is being considered as a transit point for international travellers mainly from Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka, the city serves as a link for domestic pilgrims and business travellers. After landing in Tiruchi, European travellers visit Thanjavur, Karaikudi, Madurai and Puducherry. Tourists from Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka, who visit Tamil Nadu, invariably land in Tiruchi and go to their favourite temple towns. But there were hardly any tourist arrivals from European countries and Malaysia and Singapore since March 2020 due to the continued suspension of international flights in view of spread of COVID-19 virus. However, industry sources say that domestic travellers, pilgrims and business travellers, who had reservations over travelling in public transports and staying in hotels until September 2020 due to the COVID-19 fear, have begun to visit tourist destinations. Popular temple destinations such as Srirangam and Samayapuram receive a large number of pilgrims, although the number is still down by about 50% when compared to the pre lockdown period. It is said that pilgrims from Chennai, Coimbatore and others had been visiting Tiruchi in large numbers. There were pilgrims from Bengaluru, Hyderabad too. Similarly, business travellers too have started visiting the city. It has gradually increased the occupancy rate in hotels and lodges. According to industry sources, there are about 120 hotels in the city. Nearly one-third of them are situated in the Central Bus Stand area. The average occupancy rate, which was hovering around just 10% in September and October has gone up to 30 % to 50 %. It goes up on public holidays and auspicious days. S. A. Mubashir, joint secretary, Tiruchi Tourism Federation, said that there were signs of revival of the hospitality industry. The occupancy rate in hotels had been going up gradually. Similarly, restaurants and eateries, which were part of the hospitality industry, had got back their nearly 60% of the business. The demand for cabs too had gone up to an extent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospitality-industry-shows-signs-of-gradual-recovery/article33744956.ece
04 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Elephant handed back to temple after rehabilitation||Nearly seven months after shifting to the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at M.R. Palayam on the outskirts of the city, ‘Deivanai’ the elephant of the Tiruparankundram Sri Subramania Swamy Temple, has been handed over to the temple again. A team of officials of the temple, who visited M.R. Palayam, took control of the elephant after executing the standard formalities on Tuesday. They then transported the 14-year-old domesticated animal to Madurai. Before being sent to Madurai, forest veterinarians examined the animal and found it fit for the travel on a truck. Deivani was shifted to M.R. Palayam, after the animal trampled its mahout to death, for a comprehensive rehabilitation. The pachyderm was initially put in a separate shed and slowly began to mingle with one of the captive elephants accommodated in the centre. As recommended by the veterinarians, a proper dietary schedule was prescribed for ‘Deivanai’. Since the elephant showed dramatic recovery, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) and the temple authorities approached the Forest Department to hand over it again for involving in the temple duty. After undertaking a number of examinations and expert advice, the Forest Department officials accepted the demand. Informed sources said that the animal had been found fully fit for the temple duty and it was behaving well with mahouts and mingling with other animals in captivity. It had developed a friendship with ‘Parvathi’, the elephant of Sri Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, at an elephant rejuvenation camp at Thekkampatti last year. Hence, it had been advised to take Parvathi to the shed, where Parvathi was sheltered in Madurai. After a few days, Deivanai would be taken to Sri Subramania Swamy Temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-to-go-back-to-temple/article33744966.ece

04 February 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Tirunelveli looks to implement Biological Diversity Act 2002||Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE) along with Tamil Nadu State Biodiversity Board (TSBB) and District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) conducted a capacity building workshop here on Wednesday to highlight the importance of implementing the Biological Diversity Act 2002 in the district. The district is endowed with diverse and biologically rich wildlife habitats embedded in a matrix of production landscape largely with cultivated fields spread-out in the Tamirabharani river basin. The landscape is also inhabited by diverse communities knowledgeable in managing the diverse natural resources and biodiversity. To conserve the biodiversity and the natural resources in sustainable fashion, the workshop was organised for the benefit of 60 officials from departments of rural development, revenue, animal husbandry, fisheries, urban and rural civic bodies, agriculture, horticulture, forest etc. Inaugurating the workshop, Collector V. Vishnu said biodiversity that provides services and resources which are very essential for human beings should be utilised in a sustainable manner for future generations. The Biological Diversity Act 2002, implemented by National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) regulates the conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components for fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources and the associated knowledge.  “Biological Diversity Act 2002 provides constitutional power to elected bodies at the village-level to manage biodiversity and its habitats, biological resources and associated traditional knowledge. Hence, the capacity building programme is being organised for the benefit of government officials, more importantly, the officials having direct links with the development of rural areas,” Mr. Vishnu said. Every local body should constitute a Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) for the purpose of promoting conservation, sustainable use and documentation of biological diversity including preservation of habitats, domesticated stocks and breeds of animals and micro organisms and chronicling of knowledge relating to biological diversity, the Collector said. “Successful implementation of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 is largely dependent on the understanding of the regulations and issues related to conservation and sustainable use of natural resources by diverse stakeholders including the officials of various departments of the Government organizations at district-level to village panchayats and public and hence the workshop is being organised,” Mr. Vishnu said. Conservator of Forests, Tamil Nadu Forest Department, Tirunelveli circle N. Senthil Kumar, Expert on Biodiversity Management, V. Arivudai Nambi, Members, Tamil Nadu State Biodiversity Board, D. Narasimhan, and C.P. Rajkumar, and Project Director, District Rural Development Agency, P.

Following a representation made by residents of Masinagudi, the police and the district administration had a discussion with local residents and vehicle drivers, who wanted the ghat road to be reopened for tourist vehicles. The Nilgiris district police said that the road has been closed to descending vehicles for the last two years due to a number of serious accidents along the stretch. After the restrictions were announced, only locally registered vehicles on essential work were allowed to descend to the Sigur plateau via the Kalhatti Ghat Road.

Sasi Mohan, said that a joint inspection was conducted on the stretch by officials from the Regional Transport Office, the highways department and the police department to study the feasibility of easing restrictions along the route. “A number of works to make the road safer, such as installing crash barriers along hairpin bends 34, 35 and 36, are almost complete,” said Mr. Mohan, who added that the modalities of the relaxations are being worked out. Mr. Mohan said that the plan was to allow light motor vehicles to use the ghat road starting next week. The relaxations will apply to all cars, both from the Nilgiris and other districts. “For allowing freight vehicles, the plan is for certain kinds of freight trucks, registered in the Nilgiris to be allowed to use the road, as the drivers will be aware of the techniques to navigate the route safely,” said Mr. Mohan.

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||89 doctors have died of COVID-19 in State: IMA||J.A. Jayalal, national president of IMA, said the data was collected from the respective State/local branches of IMA. "The Tamil Nadu government should expedite the process of granting solatium to the families of private practitioners who succumbed to the infection. Financial support is just one component, as we want the government to identify and honour doctors who sacrificed their lives," he said. The IMA condemned the perceived apathy of the Union government in verifying the data given by the association, and the delay in disbursing solatium to the families of frontline workers who died. It urged the Centre to endorse the hard work and contribution of doctors in flattening the COVID-19 curve, and expedite the process of providing solatium. Dr. Jayalal cited the case of Chandrasekar, a 65-year-old doctor in Chennai, who conducted house visits during the pandemic. "He contracted COVID-19 and succumbed to the infection. He voluntarily came out and practised [medicine] during the pandemic, and it is important to recognise the sacrifices of such doctors," he said. K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association, said two government doctors had succumbed to COVID-19 in the State so far, and the family of only one of the deceased had received solatium. "The government has assured us that the solatium for the other doctor’s family is being processed. We are expecting a solatium of Rs. 25 lakh from the State government and Rs. 50 lakh in insurance from the Centre. We hope the State government’s promise of a government job to a legal heir of the two families would be fulfilled," he said. A. Ramalingam, convenor of the Federation of Government Doctors’ Association, said the State government readily granted solatium to families of other frontline workers, and should accord the same importance to health staff. A cross-section of doctors pointed out that many government doctors who contracted the infection did not receive the ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh and the one-month special pay announced by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/89-doctors-have-died-of-covid-19-in-state-ima/article33744970.ece

04 February 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||High risk surgery helps save newborn in Belagavi||Doctors of KLE Society’s Prabhakar Kore Hospital saved the life of a newborn by surgically correcting multiple disorders. A poor family from Kuganoli village brought the baby that weighed just two kilograms to the hospital with complaints of vomiting, swollen abdomen and other problems. Senior paediatric surgeon Santosh Kurbet examined the baby and his investigations revealed that it suffered from intestinal atresia (blockage). The surgeons decided to opt for a high risk surgery and counselled the parents. However, after opening the baby’s abdomen, surgeons found three major anomalies — Ileal duplication (extra growth intestine), Ileal atresia (blockage in intestine) and Malrotation of the gut (twisted intestine). Surgeons corrected the three complex birth defects in an operation that lasted over three hours. The newborn withstood anaesthesia support and the surgical procedure. The patient was stabilised by a highly specialised team of neo-natologists, specially trained nurses and respiratory therapists. The multi-disciplinary team consisted of S.M. Dhaded, Manisha R. Bhandankar, Anil Kallesh, N.S. Mahanshetti and Mahantesh V. Patil. The patient has recovered well and has been discharged from hospital. M.V. Jali, director, said that the team had high degrees of micro surgical skills, perseverance and tremendous patience for operating on a newborn weighing only two kilograms. The treatment was carried out under Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka Scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-risk-surgery-helps-save-newborn-in-belagavi/article33745054.ece

The integrated flight display of 9 BAE Hawk Mk132 trainer jets of Surya Kiran and 4 Advanced Light Helicopters was touted as unique since the two teams came together for the first time. Surya Kirans put up breathtaking high-speed manoeuvres while Sarangs made dexterous sub-sonic moves to enthral the limited audience. The people of Bengaluru, who show enthusiasm for the biennial air show, had turned up outside the Yelahanka Air Force Station to catch a glimpse of the metal birds. Close to 600 exhibitors, including 78 foreign ones, are participating in the three-day aerospace business show. According to the organisers, about 40 aircraft are participating in the air display. Unlike the earlier editions that saw participation of several aircraft manufacturers, this air show was restricted to the display of hardware in the IAF’s stable. Tejas, the indigenously built world’s lightest Light Combat Aircraft, was part of the air show along with Jaguar, C-17 Globemaster and Embraer carrying the Airborne Early Warning and Control System. Other highlights included the flight of refurbished Dakota aircraft for the first time in the air show. The aircraft was the first to land with supplies to support soldiers in Srinagar during the 1948 war. Accompanied by a Tejas, a B-1B Lancer, the multi-role long-range heavy bomber of the 28th Bomb Wing based out of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, U.S.A. flew past in the inaugural air show. The aircraft had arrived after a 26-hour flight from its base. HAL came out with an Aatmanirbhar formation flight in which Light Combat Helicopter, Light Utility Helicopter, Advanced Light Helicopter, and a host of trainers, including HTT-40 and trainer jets, took part.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aero-india-2021-takes-off-with-fewer-participants/article33745380.ece
04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘108’ ambulance staff not paid salary for two months||Over 3,000 staff members of 108 Arogya Kavacha ambulance service including 1,556 ambulance pilots (drivers) and 1,503 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) apart from call centre employees are finding it hard to make ends meet as they have not been paid salaries for the last two months. While officials from GVK-EMRI, that runs the service for the State government, said that the salaries have been delayed as the government is yet to release funds, State health officials said as per the agreement with GVK it is the responsibility of GVK to pay salaries on time. Sources said the State releases Rs. 40.6 crore every quarter to GVK. This is to cover salaries, fuel and maintenance of the ambulances. A sum of Rs. 5.6 crore is required for salaries alone. However, the State has not released funds for the last two quarters and this has led to non-payment of salaries. That apart, the Health Department had on September 19 last year issued an Order directing GVK to grant a 15% hike for all employees from 2017-2018 onwards. “The Health Department had asked the company to utilise the available funds of Rs. 13 crore to pay the arrears and increment to the employees. However, forget the arrears, we have not even got our regular salaries since December. When we ask the authorities, they say it will be paid soon and we are waiting in vain,” Arogya Kavacha Employees’ Association president Srishail Hallur said. “Although we have been working for the last 10-12 years, our salaries are in the range of Rs. 8,000-Rs. 10,000. We were pinning our hopes on increments but are disappointed that we have not got what is due to us,” he said. “With no salaries we are unable to pay house rent, school fees of our children and make ends meet,” said Poornima K , an EMT. State Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey told The Hindu on Wednesday that action would be initiated against GVK-EMRI for not paying salaries of employees. “As per the agreement, GVK cannot hold the salaries if the State has not released funds. Yes we have held up funds for the last one quarter as the company has not furnished certain documents that we had asked them to submit. We have called for a meeting on Thursday in this regard. Penal action will be initiated against the company,” he said.  Agreement with GVK-EMRI The government had entered into an agreement with GVK-EMRI in 2008 for a period of 10 years on a PPP model. On July 14, 2017, the Health Department terminated its nine-year association with the company citing irregularities and violation of tender conditions. While the department had invited tenders for a new service provider, the company approached the High Court of Karnataka challenging the termination of their service before the expiry of their 10-year contract period. The company also contended that in the fresh tenders, the conditions were such that GVK was unable to participate. The High Court ruled that the company should be allowed to participate in the tender process. Subsequently, in December 2017 the department relaxed tender conditions citing poor response to the tenders (only two bidders had participated). After this, GVK-EMRI was asked to continue providing services till January 31, 2018. Thereafter, the re-tendering process was further delayed due to Assembly elections in 2019 and the company was again asked to continue till further orders. “Although we have some three-four companies interested now, there are some legal hurdles that we are waiting to be cleared. We should be able to finalise a new service provider soon,” Mr. Pandey added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/108-ambulance-staff-not-paid-salary-for-two-months/article33745059.ece
04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. using pandemic as ‘excuse’: Siddaramaiah||The BJP government is “using” the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to explain all stalled works and dysfunctional administration, charged Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Speaking on the motion of thanks to the Governor for his address to the joint session of the legislature on Wednesday, he said: “The total compensation paid for those hit by pandemic was no more than Rs. 2,100 crore. Estimated expenditure for 2020-21 in the budget was Rs. 2,37,893 crore. We have borrowed Rs. 63,000 crore this year alone. The government has also claimed in the Governor’s address that tax collection has picked up.” He sought to know how then the pandemic could be cited as the reason to explain projects being starved of funds, non-payment of dues, and stopping of social welfare schemes such as pensions and student scholarships. He also sought to know why, amidst such crisis due to the pandemic and floods, the government had gone ahead with “anti-farmer” Ordinances, pushing them into greater misery. Mr. Siddaramaiah blamed the Centre for not releasing the State’s share in GST, cess on fuel, and income tax. Though the State contributes nearly Rs. 2.4 lakh crore a year to the Centre’s pool, the latter grants only Rs. 60,000 crore to the State. The “double engine” governments (BJP governments in State and Centre) have been working against the interest of the people by raising fuel prices, leading to rise of price of all commodities, he said. The Congress leader drew attention to the inefficiency of Energy Department officials of Karnataka and said despite surplus generation of power, the State draws electricity from the central grid. The State’s power generation stood at 30,098 MW against the demand for 10,000 MW, he said. “The BJP as Opposition often said that our government had not taken off. But this government seems to be completely off,” he said, adding that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was hemmed in by opposition from within his own party. Speaking on claims made by the government on achievements, Mr. Siddaramiah in his reply said many achievements of the Congress government led by him had been “recycled” to make tall claims. “How can this government take credit for Karnataka occupying first place in NITI Aayog’s innovation ranking? It was our government that set up an exclusive Skill Development Department and made an investment,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-using-pandemic-as-excuse-siddaramaiah/article33745072.ece
04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC refuses to quash case against Yediyurappa’s political secretary||In a setback to N.R. Santosh, political secretary to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the High Court of Karnataka has declined to quash criminal proceedings against him in a case of an attempt to kidnap N.S. Vinay, who was working as an adviser to K.S. Eshwarappa when the latter was Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council. “It is not a fit case to exercise powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the truthfulness of the statement of witnesses has to be ascertained only after the trial... this court, under Section 482 of the CrPC, cannot ascertain the truthfulness of the statement of witnesses...,” the High Court observed. Justice H.P. Sandesh passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by Mr. Santosh questioning the charge-sheet filed by the police arraying him as accused number-1 along with 11 others, and the cognisance of offences taken against him by the Sessions Court. The High Court noted that the details of call records between Mr. Santosh and one of the accused showed two calls between them a few days prior to the attempt to kidnap on May 11, 2017, in Mahalakshmi Layout police limits in Bengaluru city. It was alleged that Mr. Santosh, when he was working as a personal assistant to Mr. Yediyurappa (who was BJP State chief in 2017) had conspired to kidnap Mr. Vinay to secure a compact disc containing certain materials related to Mr. Santosh. The bid to kidnap failed as Mr. Vinay raised alarm ona public road. Also, the High Court took note of the statement given by a woman, who was a common friend for both Mr. Santosh and Mr. Vinay, to the police about the former allegedly inviting the accused persons for food to a hotel through WhatsApp and phone. She had spoken about a conspiracy between Mr. Santosh and the other accused to kidnap Mr. Vinay and assault him.    Mr. Vinay, who argued the case personally without engaging a lawyer, contended before the High Court that Mr. Yediyurappa had tried to protect Mr. Santosh, who is also the Chief Minister’s nephew. The High Court, in its order, recorded Mr. Vinay’s submission that Mr. Yediyurappa had “written a letter to the investigating officer not to take any action against Mr. Santosh”. It was alleged in the charge-sheet that at the instance of Mr.Santosh, one of the accused persons provided the vehicle used in the offence with a changed number plate. It was also said that they used Prashanth, a rowdy-sheeter, and nine others to commit the alleged crime. Interestingly, Mr. Vinay told the High Court that Prashanth had “died under mysterious circumstances” when Mr. Santosh’s name surfaced in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-refuses-to-quash-case-against-yediyurappas-political-secretary/article33745082.ece
04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||After long debate, four pvt. varsities’ Bills passed||Despite a protracted debate in the Council that saw members cutting across party lines calling for more stringent regulation on the five new private universities proposed, four of the Bills that allows them were passed without any amendment on Wednesday. Earlier in the debate, members had suggested a long list of amendments and demanded the Bills be referred to the select committee. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who piloted the Bills, said the laws ensured the private universities were already “over-regulated”, but assured the House that the suggestions given by the Council would be considered when Rules are framed. The council passed Sri Jagadguru Murugharajendra University Bill, 2020, Vidya Shilpa University Bill, 2020, Atria University Bill, 2020, and The New Horizon University Bill, 2020. The Minister said St. Joseph’s University Bill, 2020, will be tabled on Thursday due to a technical issue that needs a clearance from the Governor. JD(S) member K.T. Gowda and several other members expressed concern over the “increasing unaffordability” of education and expressed concern over private universities posing a threat to public universities. BJP member Y.A. Narayanaswamy warned that there may be a new divide between students from public and private universities, even as students from private universities corner jobs. Multiple members expressed concerns over the lack of regulation on academic activities at private universities. Maritibbe Gowda, JD(S) MLC, suggested that the government must have complete control over the seat matrix and conduct of exams and evaluation at these private universities. R.B. Timmapur and B.K. Hariprasad, Congress MLCs, argued these Bills were an attack on social justice, even as the former termed them “anti-Dalit”, as they had no provision for reservation in recruitment. Dr. Ashwath Narayan defended the creation of private universities as a move towards making more opportunities available to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio to higher education, presently at 28% in the State to at least 50%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/after-long-debate-four-pvt-varsities-bills-passed/article33745068.ece
04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BJP members ask govt. to release caste census report||Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) K.P. Nanjundi and A.H. Vishwanath put pressure on the government to immediately release the Socio-Economic Survey (popularly known as caste census) conducted by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government. “Powerful upper-caste communities carry out rallies demanding fulfilment of their demands. But some backward communities do not even know how many of them live in the State and where. I demand that the government release the report and come clean with its stand on the issue,” Mr. Nanjundi said. Mr. Vishwanath said that three governments, including the incumbent, seems to be afraid of presenting the report in the Assembly. “The last Backward Classes report that was ratified by the Assembly was the Havanur Commission report. There have been several reports since then, including the Chinnappa Reddy report, which have never been tabled. Caste census is key to understanding the State better and the report could lead to better distribution of wealth and become a guideline for the upcoming Budgets,” he said. Backward Classes Welfare Minister Kota Sreenivasa Poojary said the report was ready but yet to be submitted to the State government. He said he would discuss the issue with Jayaprakash Hegde, chairman of the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-members-ask-govt-to-release-caste-census-report/article33745069.ece
04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BEL to enter medical electronics market||Riding on the success of producing 30,000 ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL) has launched an indigenous cost-effective haemodialysis machine as part of an initiative to enter the medical electronics market. It was launched in collaboration with Renalyx, a start-up that is into renal health. “The patients on dialysis machine can be remotely monitored by doctors. This is comparable to the best dialysis machines in the world and costs 30% less than those available in the market,” BEL sources said. The experience of producing ventilators indigenously spurred the defence PSU into medical electronics, and the company started a medical electronics vertical a couple of months ago. Also, BEL has begun manufacture of MRI and X-ray machines for global brands. Over the next five years, the company intends to indigenously produce 20 medical equipment that are cost-effective. According to sources, this is expected to bring revenues close to Rs. 600 crore in the next five years. “While technology partners will be taken on board, in-house design teams will simultaneously work on the products,” sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bel-to-enter-medical-electronics-market/article33745378.ece

Yediyurappa on Wednesday told the Legislative Assembly that the government was facing financial constraints this fiscal year owing to COVID-19 and rain havoc last year and funds for more development works would be sanctioned in the coming financial year (2021-22). In a reply to Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s charges that no funds had been sanctioned to Kalyana Karnataka region this year, Mr. Yediyurappa said: “The financial situation would not have been different if you were in my place. We are not printing currency notes.” Unlike other States, the government had not reduced salaries of KSRTC and BMTC employees during lockdown and later, he said. However, a sum of Rs. 544 crore had been sanctioned this year to the Kalyana Karnataka region. The regional board has an opening balance of Rs. 308 crore. A sum of Rs. 692 crore had been spent so far, he said.

04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fee disputes: district-level committees constitued||With complaints from parents mounting about private schools not complying with the Government Order (GO) on fee for this academic year, the Department of Public Instruction has constituted 40 committees to resolve such disputes. A circular about the constitution of the various committees was issued by the Commissioner of Public Instruction on Tuesday. The Hindu had reported on parents seeking the department’s intervention to resolve their disputes with the schools. The circular states that a special counter would be opened in the office of the Block Education Officer to receive applications from parents seeking resolution. Though the government had stated that for the 2020-21 academic year, school managements could charge only 70% of the tuition fee that they charged in 2019-20 and no other fees could be charged given the financial strain faced by parents during the pandemic, many parents have been alleging that school managements have continued to force them to pay the full tuition fee. They have also alleged that schools were not willing to comply with the GO. Hearings In the circular, the Commissioner has directed the committees to dispose of the applications by scheduling hearings every Monday and issuing speaking orders the same day. If the applications are rejected, a clear reason should be communicated and registered. It is also the responsibility of the committees to ensure that issues between parents and schools are resolved within three meetings.

04 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CAG report finds lapses in power sector PSUs||The Comptroller and Auditor General of India report, tabled in the Assembly on Wednesday, has found many lapses in the functioning of power sector PSUs in Karnataka. According to it, six PSUs incurred a loss of Rs. 2,928.68 crore in the year ending 2019. The major PSUs that saw losses were Raichur Power Corporation Ltd. (Rs. 1,251.3 crore), Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (Rs. 992.06 crore), Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation Ltd. (Rs. 209.35 crore), and Gulbarga Electric Supply Company Ltd. (Rs. 472.63 crore). Five PSUs earned a profit, with the major contributors being Hubli Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (Rs. 690 crore) and Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. (Rs. 212.14 crore). Investment in power sector PSUs rose by 52.75%, from Rs. 9,495.8 crore in 2014-15 to Rs. 14,504.76 crore in 2018-19. On Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation, the report said the delay in approaching authorities such as the Railways and Forest Department caused delays in projects. For instance, the laying of a 110-kV single-circuit line from Belagavi to Ghataprabha sub-station was delayed more than 10 years because of the delay in getting clearance from the Forest Department. ESCOMs failed to carry out energy audits for all Distribution Transformer Centres (DTCs). It was done only for 60% of the metered DTCs in BESCOM and HESCOM and 43% in MESCOM. ESCOMs also incurred a huge capital expenditure of Rs. 449.81 crore and interest expense of Rs. 133,63 crore on the loans borrowed for DTC metering as on March 2019. There were 114 PSUs in the State as of March 2019.

Karjol in the council on Wednesday. He said the law is clear that contractors who bag tenders should not sublet works. However, he agreed with Congress member M. Narayanaswamy that this practice is rampant. “When a contractor sublets works, interests of two contractors have to be safeguarded with the available money, and that definitely impacts the quality of work,” he said, adding that blacklisting contractors will put an end to the practice. Leader of Opposition in the Council S.R. Patil pointed out that government agencies like Nirmiti Kendras and Land Army routinely sublet works to private contractors. “While there are hundreds of engineers in these organisations, there is no machinery and other in-house infrastructure to carry out works. Once a work is allotted to these agencies, they cut 24% and sublet it to private contractors, who has to now work in 76% of the funds for the work,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/contractors-who-sublet-works-may-be-blacklisted/article33745070.ece

04 February 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Shift by month-end govt. offices to North Karnataka region’||Raita Sena Karnataka has warned that it will launch an agitation if the government fails to implement by the month-end its earlier decision on shifting nine department offices from Bengaluru to North Karnataka. Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday State president of Raita Sena Viresh Sobaradmath Swami said that successive governments have not been honest in implementation of the recommendations of the Dr. Nanjundappa Committee on Regional Imbalance. Even the decisions taken for addressing the issue have not been implemented. “As per the recommendations of Dr. Nanjundappa Committee in 2018, the then Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, after discussion in the State Cabinet, decided to shift offices of nine important departments to North Karnataka, particularly Belagavi. However, till date none of these departments has been shifted,” he said. Bengaluru Chalo Mr. Swami said that the delay in shifting the government offices made the general public to look at elected representatives from North Karnataka with suspicion. “If the offices are not shifted by the month-end, then the Raita Sena will launch a Bengaluru Chalo in association with various other organisations,” he warned. Kalasa Banduri Mr. Swami said that although the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal (MWDT) has allocated Karnataka’s share of Mahadayi river water, the State government seems to be apathetic towards getting clearances required for taking up works required for utilisation of the allocated share.

04 February 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Autorickshaw drivers stage protest seeking fuel subsidy||Seeking fulfilment of various demands, including subsidised fuel and setting up of an autorickshaw drivers welfare corporation, autorickshaw drives and owners staged a protest in Hubballi on Wednesday. Coming together under the aegis of Hubballi Autorickshaw Owners and Drivers Association, the protestors gathered in front of the statue of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna at Brindavan Circle and condemned in strong terms the hike in fuel prices. Addressing the protestors, president of the association Shekharayya Mathapathi said that continued increase in fuel prices had made the life of autorickshaw owners and drivers miserable. While auto fares were fixed, fuel prices increased on a regular basis, bringing down income for autorickshaw drivers. The fuel price hike has affected the poor autorickshaw drivers to a great deal and the Union government should immediately take steps to check price hike, he said. “If the government can’t check prices, it should at least take steps to provide fuel for autorickshaws at subsidised rate,” he demanded. The protestors raised slogans against the fuel price hike and burnt rising fuel prices in an effigy to register their protest. Subsequently, the protestors submitted a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Hubballi Tahsildar. In the memorandum, they have demanded subsided fuel, setting up of autorickshaw drivers welfare corporation, free education to wards of autorickshaw drivers, health insurance, accident cover for drivers and pension of Rs. 10,000 per month to drivers aged over 60.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/autorickshaw-drivers-stage-protest-seeking-fuel-subsidy/article33745049.ece

Addressing presspersons in Dharwad on Wednesday, KPCC media analyst P.H. Neeralakeri said that around 50 members of the 14 families who were affected by the tragic accident will participate in a mass prayer and peaceful protest. As many as 12 persons were killed in the road accident. Mr. Neeralakeri said that the family members are participating in a peaceful protest as they did not want other families to suffer because of the dreaded narrow road stretch. They will be submitting a memorandum to the officials of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), he said. Mr. Neeralakeri said that despite repeated pleas and complaints, the NHAI officials and elected representatives from the region have failed to take steps for widening the road stretch which has taken several lives so far. He said that the road has been laid unscientifically and there is no ambulance, crane and even emergency staff. He said that families of road accident victims are being made to pay for availing crane services. He said that a two-month deadline has been given for stopping toll collection on the bypass road and if it is not stopped, then an agitation will be launched to get it stopped. Mr. Neeralakeri said that despite the State having three Union Ministers, including Pralhad Joshi, who represented Dharwad, the problem has not been resolved. Even a meeting which was supposed to take place on January 27 on the road widening issue has not taken place so far, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/homage-to-bypass-accident-victims-protest-on-saturday/article33745047.ece

KRS State vice-president S.H. Linge Gowda, addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi on Tuesday, said that the party will contest in the municipal and panchayat elections across the State. The party will invite potential independent candidates to contest on its symbol (Whistle).

The need of the hour is to build and strengthen a clean and corruption-free political party, Mr. Linge Gowda said and added that the BJP, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) leaders are mired in corruption; and anti-social elements are being elected as representatives with the support of these political parties.

Hanumanthappa, Chairman, Karnataka State Commission for Safaikaramcharis, said governments should stand by the farming community by ensuring fair prices to produce. “Farmers are going through a difficult time. On the one hand, prices of farm inputs are skyrocketing and, on the other, prices of produce are continuously falling leaving farmers in distress. Natural calamities have worsened their crisis. Many are leaving agriculture and migrating to cities in search of jobs. The governments should come up with progressive measures to ensure fair prices for their crops,” Mr. Hanumanthappa said. He was addressing a gathering after flagging off the Suggi Huggi folk festival on the Zilla Panchayat premises in Ballari on Sunday. “It is because of the farmers that we are leading a decent life. The country cannot be sound financially, if farmers are in a crisis. The government should come forward to help the crisis-ridden farmers. ZP officers should prioritise agriculture and rural economy by chalking out programmes,” he said. Choranur Kotrappa, secretary,Veerashaiva Vidyavardhak Sangh and former Deputy Director of Kannada and Culture, described how folk culture and art flourished in the district since the time of the Vijayanagar kings. “Belagallu Veeranna and Manjamma Jogati are living examples of folk culture in the district.

04 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mixed response to e-mulakat in prisons||The e-mulakat facility wherein prison inmates are allowed to speak with visitors through video call has generated good response in prisons in Mangaluru, Bengaluru and Mysuru, while it is yet to catch up in prisons in Kalaburagi, Shivamogga, Belagavi and Vijayapura districts. Karnataka Prisons and Correctional Services Department introduced e-mulakat in prisons across the State on December 2, 2020. This facility is among other services available through the e-prisons project adopted by the department in nine Central Prisons, 21 district prisons, 27 sub jails, the open air jail in Koramangala [Bengaluru] and the special sub jail in KGF. In a letter to Chief Secretaries, Home Secretaries and Director-Generals of Prisons across the country in March 2020, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Punya Salila Srivastava, expressed the need for prisons, among others, to encourage the use of e-mulakat for arranging meetings between visitors and prison inmates to avoid direct physical interaction. Under the facility, visitors enter the National Prisons Information Portal (eprisons.nic.in) and submit details such as their name, address, Aadhaar number and mobile number in the “Visitor details” section. Details of the person they want to meet are also entered in the “To Meet” section. A visitor should submit these a day before he wants to speak to his relative/friend in prison. The prison official concerned, who will then look into the request, will allot a 30-minute slot after which an SMS goes to the visitor’s mobile phone number. At the scheduled time, the Prisons Department makes a video call to the visitor and the inmate concerned is allowed to speak for about 10 minutes. An inmate is allowed to speak to a visitor once a week. In the Mangaluru District Prison, the facility has so far been used 104 times. It has been used 18 times in the Udupi District Prison. Director-General of Police (Prisons) Alok Mohan said that e-mulakat is a new facility and it will take time for visitors to make full use of it. “The knowledge of this technology-driven initiative is not uniform. In some areas, there are issues regarding access to this facility,” Mr. Mohan told The Hindu . e-mulakat is being facilitated through a secure platform provided by National Informatics Centre and visitors will get used to this facility, he said. Apart from making inmates aware of this facility, the Prisons officials are helping visitors to address technical glitches and facilitate conversation, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mixed-response-to-e-mulakat-in-prisons/article33745515.ece

The police gave the names of the arrested persons as Elma Praschita Barretto (25) of Amtady village, Satish (28) and Charan (29), both from Narikombu village. The police said that the 72-year-old Benedict Carlo was staying along with her daughter-in-law in their house in Ammunje village of Bantwal taluk.

04 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Budget: Emphasis on ongoing rail works in Mysuru division||The fund allocation for the Mysuru Railway division in the Union Budget 2021-22 indicates that the focus is on critical ongoing projects while nominal amounts have been earmarked for new railway lines or the sanctioned works which are yet to commence. The Shivamogga-Shikaripur-Ranebennur line gets a whopping Rs. 100 crore while the track doubling work on the Arsikere-Tumakuru section – which is partially in the Mysuru Railway Division - has received Rs. 46.75 crore. The latter is critical and part of the track doubling work connecting Hubballi and Bengaluru and has been described as “critical project’’. But the Mysuru (Belagola) to Kushalnagar new line project spanning 87 km gets a nominal allocation though the local MP Pratap Simha is batting for it. Though he is supportive of the railway line till Kushalnagar there is widespread opposition to it on the grounds that such linear infrastructure projects will bisect wildlife habitat and escalate human-animal conflict which is already high in the region. In addition the activists opposed to the project have pointed to the environmental damage in the region which is already ecologically fragile. There are also concerns that approval for the Mysuru-Kushalnagar railway line will set a precedent as there is a demand for a new track linking Madikeri with north Kerala from a section of the stakeholders in that State. Though the preliminary works pertaining to the location survey and final line survey were taken up, the railways also realised the negative rate of returns accruing from the project while land is also yet to be acquired by the State government and handed over to the railways. The estimated cost of Mysuru-Kushalnagar railway line (87.2 km) is Rs. 1854.62 crore and will require 247.85 hectares of dryland and 275.15 hectares of wetland and the rate of returns was pegged at minus 4.92 per cent. The Chief Public Relations Officer of South Western Railway said the land has to be provided by the State government free of cost and it is only then that the project can move forward. Similarly, Hassan (Alur) – Belur works has received a nominal allocation as is the norm for projects that have already received administrative nod and is included in the railways book of approved works (Pink Book). The Birur-Shivamogga line (60 km) has received a nominal amount indicating that the work is bound to be sluggish till other hurdles including land acquisition issues are cleared. Likewise, the Bengaluru (Hejjala)-Chamarajanagar line which will pass though Malavalli and Kollegal, has received nominal allocation underlining the uncertainty over the project. The Kadur-Chikkamagaluru-Sakleshspur railway line work has received Rs. 1 crore while Shivamogga-Harihar line has a nominal allocation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/budget-emphasis-on-ongoing-rail-works-in-mysuru-division/article33745211.ece
04 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysureans can propose innovation in UGD, win handsome prizes||The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has thrown up another contest to the people of Mysuru as a part of Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge-2021. After conducting a competition for designing the uniform for Safaimitras, it has now organised a contest for innovation in the maintenance of Mysuru’s underground drainage (UGD) system. The first prize carries a cash reward of Rs. 20,000 while the second and third prize winners can take home cash awards of Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 5,000 respectively. Mysuru is among 242 cities in the country that have taken up the “Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge-2021”. The Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs launched the challenge themed “Manhole to Machine-hole transformation” to encourage more number of cities and towns to adopt mechanised cleaning of sewers and septic tanks, and motivate smaller cities to replicate. As the MCC is working on winning the challenge, the contest is part of the efforts being made by it to strengthen its case for the title that carries a huge incentive from the Centre. For the innovation contest, the MCC has, however, put certain conditions. The proposals should not be exhaustive. They should come up with low-cost and faster solutions with justification and the remedies should considerably improve the efficiency in the cleaning and maintenance of UGD systems. The innovation should prevent entry into the manhole or the septic tank. Besides having an advance warning system, it should give an alert in case of a blockage for the workers to carry out preventive maintenance. Interested persons and teams can submit their proposals/ technical papers along to mysoreugd@gmail.com before February 15. A team can have not more than four members. Call 8748803431/9036869654 for more details. Selected candidates or teams are supposed to present their papers on February 19 at Vani Vilas meeting hall in Yadavagiri. The first three innovative proposals would be considered as the winners. MCC falls in the category of the population of 3-10 lakh. The first prize in this category under Safaimitra challenge is Rs. 10 crore while the second and third prizes are Rs. 5 crore and Rs. 2.5 crore respectively. The MCC is engaging the public in the initiative and encouraging them to participate. It had announced the contest of designing uniforms recently. Six persons had submitted their designs. The best design was selected by a committee headed by MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde. It bagged the cash prize of Rs. 10,000. Mysuru was the only city in the State that took part and submitted its design to the Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysureans-can-propose-innovation-in-ugd-win-handsome-prizes/article33745205.ece
04 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Naganahalli, a ‘critical project’||The proposed greenfield railway terminal at Naganahalli on the outskirts of Mysuru has been listed among the ‘critical’ projects by the Railway Board and is slated for completion by 2024. The Naganahalli terminal has been included in the list of Priority Traffic Facilities Works and the budgetary allocation for the financial year 2021-22 has been pegged at Rs. 19.99 crore. The terminal has been approved in a bid to decongest the existing railway station at Mysuru based on the projected growth of rail traffic to the city. The existing station is landlocked with no scope for expansion and hence the authorities settled for Naganahalli which is 8.55 km away on the Mysuru-Bengaluru section. The cost of the project has been pegged at Rs. 789 crore though an engineering and traffic survey conducted by a private agency from Hyderabad estimated the final cost to be around Rs. 1,008 crore. The scope of the work entails constructing 4 platforms in the first phase and 2 additional platforms in the second phase, laying 4 pit lines and 8 stabling lines while the land requirement is around 380 acres of which 165 acres is required for completing the first phase. The length of the platforms will be 750 metres while the stabling lines will be 725 metres and pit lines will be 620 metres long. The plan is to retain the existing yard at Naganahalli while the terminal building work will be constructed behind it. The completion of the first phase entails an expenditure of Rs. 494.79 crore. The existing station at Mysuru handles nearly 50 pairs of trains including the non-daily services. Consequent to the completion of the track doubling work and electrification of the Mysuru-Bengaluru section, more train services are expected to the city in future. But the existing station has capacity constraints to accommodate more trains and hence the new terminal was justified. But like most projects, this is again subject to land acquisition by the State government and transferring it to the railway authorities. Incidentally, the railway authorities’ letter to the Additional Chief Secretary, Infrastructure Development Department, Government of Karnataka, exactly two years ago, has not elicited any response. The letter highlighted the imperatives of the completion of the project to pave way for introduction of additional train services connecting Mysuru with rest of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/naganahalli-a-critical-project/article33745209.ece
04 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||VKET writes to President on denial of pension||VeKare Ex-Servicemen Trust (VKET), a voluntary organisation engaged in welfare of ex-servicemen and their dependants, has sought to draw the attention of President Ram Nath Kovind to the denial of central civil family pension to an 85-year-old widow of a World War II veteran. In a letter dated February 2 to the President, VKET President M.N. Subramani said Kaveriamma alias Rani Aiyappa, widow of Naib Subedar Ballachanda N. Aiyappa, has been denied herpension by the erstwhile Central Excise and Customs, now known as Central Tax/GST, since the demise of her husband in August, 2000. Though Ms. Kaveriamma has a “pet name” Rani Aiyappa, the Principal Commissioner of Central Tax, Bengaluru, in a letter, has said that the documents available with the department show Ms. Rani Aiyappa as the wife of late Mr. Aiyappa, hence the pension papers had been submitted in the name of Ms. Rani Aiyappa. That Ms .Rani Aiyappa and Ms. Kaveriamma refer to the same personhad also been confirmed by B. A. Ganapathi, her son, who recently retired as Office Superintendent of Central Excise and Customs, Bengaluru, Mr. Subramani said. However, the senior officials of Pay Accounts Office (PAO), CBIC, Bengaluru, has been insisting that Ms. Kaveriamma produce an additional Aadhaar and PAN card in her pet name “Rani Aiyappa” recorded by the late B.N. Aiyappa at the time of his re-employment in Central Excise and Customs, Mr. Subramani said.  “The demand for second Aadhaar and PAN cards in the pet name of Kaveriamma i.e. in the name of Rani Aiyappa, by senior Accounts Officer of PAO is highly illogical and contrary to the policy regarding obtaining Aadhaar and PAN cards”, VKET said in the letter to the President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vket-writes-to-president-on-denial-of-pension/article33745212.ece
04 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Study on functioning of Children’s Homes||A study on the functioning and structure of Children’s Homes under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, will soon be taken up by the Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEIP), University of Mysore. The study, the first of its kind, will be carried out across 10 States in the country. The study, which has been funded by the Bureau of Police Research and Development coming under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, comes at a time when the operational framework, efficiency and management of Children’s Homes, run by both Government and NGOs, across the country have drawn flak. Associate Professor, CSSEIP, D.C. Nanjunda, who is the Director of the project, said the study will critically examine their working style, focussing on the type of institutional services, education, rehabilitation policy they provided and also institutional infrastructure and vocational training provided. Associate Professor, Department of Journalism, Jain University, Bengaluru, Bhargavi Hemmige, who is a co-investigator of the project, said the study will cover Children’s Homes in different parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Jharkand, Orissa, Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra, Manipur, Assam and Madhya Pradesh. The study is expected to generate geography and culture-specific data to assist the policy makers in identifying how institutional delivery can be mobilised to create an environment where child rights and child development can be ensured under the broader spectrum of “inclusive children”, said Dr. Nanjunda. Assistant Professor, CSSEIP, P.T. Dinesha, and Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), Mysuru, Shivakumara Swami, are also co-investigators of the project. Child Rights activist P.P. Baburaj, who is also a former member of the Juvenile Justice Board, said it was a welcome initiative as an elaborate study of the Children’s Homes was the need of the hour, particularly after the enactment of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/study-on-functioning-of-childrens-homes/article33745203.ece

ATF and CPAA convenor Vasanthkumar Mysoremath has said that the Budget has missed an opportunity to mobilise funds for investment in the health sector, particularly non-communicable diseases (NCD). The government could have mobilised a sizable revenue by increasing the tax and making each beedi at least 10 paise more expensive and a cigarette one rupee dearer.

04 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Kumaraswamy talks tough against GTD||Lashing out at former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said the JD(S) will not accept its party MLA representing Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency if he tries to return to the party after making futile efforts to join other parties. “Let him do politics wherever he wants. He goes to Congress in the morning, JD(S) in the afternoon and BJP at night. He is going around trying to please all the leaders. We know that he will return to us when things do not work out with others,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said before making it clear that the doors of the JD(S) will be closed on Mr. Gowda if he returned. However, Mr. Kumaraswamy also sought to make it clear that he did not make any statement on expelling Mr. Gowda from the party. He attributed reports to the effect appearing in a section of the media to lack of proper information. In this context, he said he was also aware that any action by the party against him will made use to generate sympathy for himself. “I need not expel anybody. People and the party workers will decide. Party workers will take action against people indulging in anti-party activities whenever the time comes,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said. He said no decision had been taken by the party on Mr. Gowda yet, but the party is closely observing the developments. He questioned Mr. Gowda’s commitment by referring to his participation in a procession along with Congress leaders from K.R. Nagar, who had contested against their party MLA S.R. Mahesh, during an event in the town recently for a co-operative bank function. “Nobody can fool us. We have information on what is going on,” he said. When asked if Mr. Gowda’s departure from the party was a loss to JD(S), Mr. Kumaraswamy referred to the 2008 Assembly elections when Mr. Gowda had contested as BJP candidate from Hunsur and lost. But, in 2013 and 2018, Mr. Kumaraswamy said Mr. Gowda had contested from JD(S) and had won. “It was all due to the efforts of our party workers,” he said. He lashed out at Mr. Gowda for claiming that former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda’s words do not prevail in the party and that his children dictate their father on party affairs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kumaraswamy-talks-tough-against-gtd/article33745066.ece

04 February 2021||Special Correspondent,KARNATAKA||Varsity proposes to offer courses in Beary art forms||Mangalore University has proposed to introduce certificate and diploma courses on Beary art forms from the 2021-22. Beary is an ethnic Muslim community, concentrated largely in coastal Karnataka, with its own distinct traditions and language. The university issued a notification on January 28 constituting a committee for drafting the curriculum and regulations to introduce the courses. The committee is headed by Udaya Barkuru, Dean, Faculty of Arts. Rahim Uchil, chairman, Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy, said that on September 16, 2020, the academy had written to the university requesting it to introduce the courses covering Beary art forms like Duff, Burda, Oppane, Kolkali and Mehendi. If courses are introduced on Beary art forms they would help to sustain the art forms, he said. The committee constituted by the university comprises organisers of Beary programmes Bashir Baikampady and Ahmed Bava Moideen, teachers Abdul Razak Ananthady, Haidarali, language expert S.B. Darimi, writers K.M. Siddique Montugoli and Mariyam Ismail, Duff teacher Noor Mohammad, Oppane and Kolkali artist Rahis, artisteZulfikar Ahmad, member co-ordinator Aboobakkar Siddique and the like, Mr. Uchil said. According to the academy, about 20 lakh people all over the world speak Beary. Last year, the academy introduced an independent script and numerals in Beary. The language has 13 vowels, 33 consonants and nine numerals. The academy has also named 12 months in Beary, for instance Surumada (January), Cheremada (February), Malemada (July), and Kademada (December). Months have been named mostly based on climatic conditions and normal activities on at the time. For example, as May will be very hot, it has been named Chudumada and April has been named Nalmada as this particular month will have many activities, Mr. Uchil said. He said the academy has taken up a proposal of introducing Beary as the third optional language in schools from Class VI. It is hopeful that the government will allow it. Presently, it has been planned to use Kannada script and Arabic numerals in the proposed textbooks. But the academy will also introduce Beary script and numerals to students then. As per a preliminary survey, 3,750 students in Dakshina Kannada have evinced to opt for Beary as the third optional language.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/varsity-proposes-to-offer-courses-in-beary-art-forms/article33745525.ece

On Wednesday, protesters met Forest Department officials and submitted a memorandum to drop the plan and not disturb the forest. A member of Clean Up Turahaalli said, “People are against the tree park project. Turahalli forest should remain a forest, but officials gave their reason for backing the project. During the interaction, a senior official of the forest department said our memorandum will be forwarded to higher-ups in the department and to the Forest Minister.” Another protester said, “If the State government really wants to create lung space, many parks can be developed in the Banashanakari sixth stage BDA layout, which is located close to the forest. Converting Turahalli forest into a tree park is not a good decision.” Meanwhile, officials of the Forest Department are claiming that no work related to the proposed tree park is being taken up inside the forest. An official said, “A detailed project report is yet to be prepared. Some of the works related to clearing weeds, compound walls and others are being taken up.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citizens-drop-plan-for-tree-park-in-turahalli-forest/article33745384.ece

The latest burst occurred near the Kelamangalam bridge on Tuesday night. A. Sheeja, project manager, Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT), said repair work had commenced and they hoped to restore the water supply by Friday. The pipeline burst damaged a portion of the road, which forced the authorities to regulate traffic. The water also entered a few shops in the area. The damaged portion was restored for one-way traffic by Wednesday noon. Bus service restored Officials of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation said the bus service through the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road had been restored after suspending it for several hours. The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) with Central assistance under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) in 2017. 50 times already However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 50 times, majority of them at Thakazhy and Kelamangalam, in the past three-and-a-half years, disrupting the water supply to residents in Alappuzha municipality and eight nearby grama panchayats along with damaging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road. Pipeline to be replaced A high-level meeting convened by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 had decided to replace the defective pipeline in three months. Although the KWA prepared a tentative schedule for starting the pipe-relaying work on March 18, 2020, the work failed to take off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the plan, 1,524 m of the defective pipeline will have to be replaced. This includes 1,084 m of faulty pipeline at Thakazhy and another 440 m at Kelamangalam. Officials with the UIDSSMT said they now hoped to begin the work soon. KRFB nod awaited “The pipes needed for the work have already been brought to the work site. The Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road needs to be dug up for the pipeline work. Several months ago we submitted an estimate to the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB), the owner of the road, for restoring it after completing the work. However, the KRFB is yet to give its nod to the estimate. Although the Public Works Department has already given its nod through a government order, we are awaiting the permission from the KRFB to start the work,” said an official. Officials said that the defective 1,000-mm high-density polyethylene pipe on the stretch would be replaced with 900-mm mild steel pipe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pipe-bursts-in-alappuzha-again/article33745164.ece

04 February 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Adverse weather affects crops in Anchunadu valley||Unexpected rain and mist from the first week of December have caused considerable loss to crops in Anchunadu valley. Farmers say almost all crops, especially those in the tender period of growth, have been affected. This is the second sowing season and the unfavourable weather has taken a toll on bean, garlic, cabbage, beetroot, and potato cultivation. Chandran Valiyaveettil, a farmer at Guhanathapuram in Kanthalloor, says the weather experienced during the period was similar to the one they had faced in 1981. “We did not have the feel of the sun as it disappeared for nearly a month. There were only mist and rain. The entire bean crop has decayed and other crops are stunted. Many farmers have abandoned the crops as they are not market-worthy,” he says. Selvam, a farmer at Kanthallur, says with the climate slowly changing, the bean crop started drying up. Farmers cultivated garlic in more areas due to the high prices last season. The crop was in the tender period of growth and decayed. “We did not get time to replace seeds as it was a long spell of unfavourable weather,” he says. Sugar-cane cultivation in Marayur is also badly hit. “For a long period we did not engage in jaggery production. Now, the sugar cane harvested does not yield juice. The production has declined to nearly half of the normal level now,” Krishnakumar, a farmer, says. Marayur Agriculture Officer Angel C. Roy says the bean crop has been badly affected. Bean varieties need 45 days of growth and the entire crop of the season has been affected. She says the region experienced extreme weather from the first week of December. Though mist is quite usual, rain hit the region, a rain-shadow area, and a large-scale pest and fungal attack followed. Officials are now visiting farms to survey the impact. Though there are three cropping seasons in Anchunadu, in most of the areas only two crops are cultivated due to lack of water. The first and the main crop in August-September was lost due to the pandemic outbreak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/adverse-weather-affects-crops-in-anchunadu-valley/article33745160.ece

The EZ, according to a draft notification published by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, will cover an area of 118.59 sq km, of which 99.5 sq km is outside the sanctuary that includes 8.89 sq km of the Thirunelly reserve forest in North Wayanad and 17.67 sq km of the vested forest of the Chedelayath range of the South Wayanad forest division. The remaining 19.09 sq km constitutes the revenue villages that fall within the sanctuary. These include Thirunelly and Thrishilery Pulpally, Irulam, Kidanganad, and Noolpuzha villages. As many as 29 enclosures inside the sanctuary also fall within the EZ. The sanctuary, spread over an area of 344.53 sq km in the Wayanad wildlife division comprising two discontinuous units, is a component of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (5,520 sq km) and is a vital component of the Elephant Reserve No. 7 of South India. It is the only sanctuary of Kerala where sighting of four-horned antelope has been reported. Presence of Egyptian vulture, Himalayan griffon, and Cinereous vultures is also reported in the sanctuary and two species of vultures, red-headed and white-backed vultures, once common in Kerala, are now restricted to the Wayanad plateau. Tiger habitat The Nagarhole-Bandipur-Mudumalai-Wayanad forest complex is also one of the most important tiger habitats in the country. Recent estimation, using camera traps, has indicated the presence of 79 tigers in the sanctuary. The forests of the wildlife division form the major catchments for the tributaries of the Kabani river system, which is the lifeline of the eastern portion of the Wayanad plateau and the adjoining plains of Karnataka. The Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary has about 45 species of mammals, 227 species of birds, 50 species of reptiles, 35 species of amphibians, 80 species of fish, and 206 species of butterflies.

Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, was an example for the unholy nexus between the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the State. Addressing a public meeting here on Wednesday Mr. Chennithala said Mr. Sivasankar was released on bail as the Customs did not oppose the bail, which he attributed to the ‘nexus.’ Earlier, addressing mediapersons as a part of the Aishwarya Kerala Yatra led by him, Mr. Chennithala said the CPI(M) and the BJP had adopted a similar stance on the Sabarimala issue. They had decided not to raise the topic in the upcoming Assembly election campaign as the CPI(M) was hand in glove with the BJP. “Is the State government willing to ask the Supreme Court to expedite the review petition regarding the Sabarimala issue,” Mr. Chennithala asked Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Union government would enact a law to protect Ayyappa devotees’ rights and beliefs,” Mr. Chennithala said. “Will the State leaders of the BJP take an initiative in this regard,” he asked. Medical college If the United Democratic Front came to power, the government would enact laws to protect Ayyappa devotees’ rights, he said. Though five years had passed after acquiring land for setting up a medical college in the public sector in Wayanad, the government was yet to realise it. Once in power, the UDF would implement the project, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chennithala-sees-cpim-bjp-nexus/article33745186.ece

The Taliparamba and Sreekandapuram police registered suo motu cases on Tuesday. According to the police, the cases have been registered after it was found that the organisers of the yatra had not followed the protocol and the people who assembled in large numbers failed to maintain physical distancing, wear masks or use sanitisers. The cases have been filed under the Epidemic Control Act. While a case was registered against the organisers and about 400 people by the Taliparamba police, the Sreekandapuram police registered a case against the organisers and 100 United Democratic Front supporters. Visuals of Mr. Chennithala being carried on shoulders by party workers and huge crowds of the yatra had gone viral on social media raising concerns about a fresh spike in coronavirus cases. Politically motivated Mr. Chennithala termed the cases “politically motivated.” He told reporters that the Left Democratic Front government had registered the cases after witnessing the massive participation of the people in the march. “Even if cases are registered, we will continue with the yatra,” Mr. Chennithala said. All India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar said in Kochi that the cases were politically motivated. The Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country are attending rallies at various places in the country. The guidelines should be applicable to all and not to one party, he said. 22-day yatra The 22-day yatra began on January 31 from Kumbala in Kasaragod district and will culminate in Thiruvananthapuram on February 22.

04 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kerala can emerge as global green business hub: Mahindra||Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra has said that Kerala harboured the potential to emerge as a global hub for green business and a haven for sustainable enterprises, with its commitment to environment, emphasis on human development and clean mobility initiatives. He called on the State “to think big” in this regard. There is a tectonic shift in businesses towards sustainability over profitability. Even consumers demand that. “Consumer capitalism” was a fact and consumers supported businesses that were sustainable, he said, while addressing the special industries session at Kerala Looks Ahead, an international conference being organised by the State Planning Board, on Wednesday. He underlined Kerala’s emphasis on human development, the speed with which it acted in initiating electric mobility and the State’s emphasis on preserving its environment. Those were features that held great promise as the State went ahead, he said. Ratan Tata, the chairman of Tata Trusts, said Kerala had followed an industrial policy without hurting its environment and that it should continue its policies without hurting the environment. Biomedical research Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon Limited, said Kerala should look ahead with confidence, combining its human resource and skilled manpower with emerging areas in biomedical research. She said the Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram cancer research facilities could emerge as leading centres and Kerala could attain a premium position in the area. She also commended Kerala’s position as an Ayurveda destination and its start-up atmosphere. Kris Gopalakrishnan, chairman of Axilor Ventures, said Kerala could emerge as a 21st century model for development. Consumption-led capital had failed. It had resulted in widening inequality, but Kerala could, by way of leveraging technology and promoting micro, small and medium enterprises, create wealth and achieve equitable distribution. Export council M.A. Yusuff Ali, chairman of the LuLu Group, called for the creation of an export promotion council to encourage and broaden the export base of the State. B. Ravi Pillai, chairman of RP Group, called for a campaign to spread the fame of Kerala’s tourism assets such as its beaches. Azad Moopen, chairman of Aster DM Healthcare, said Kerala was set to be the destination for investments in the country. He also called for an NRK (Non-Resident Keralite) smart city, complete with a university to cater to the needs of expatriates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-can-emerge-as-green-business-hub/article33745098.ece

The board officials have informed the representatives of the Association of Small-Scale Industrial Units to start implementing the measures and ensure compliance within two weeks. The regional office of the board will soon carry out an inspection of all the industrial units in Edayar. Teams from the regional office and the board’s surveillance centre will be part of the drive. The inspection is being held based on the follow-up action being initiated on the cases pending before the National Green Tribunal on the pollution of the Periyar river. The board had also found that many units were lacking in the enforcement of the rules after the major fire that broke out in units manufacturing paint in the Edayar industrial area on the night of January 16. Senior board officials said that the advance notice has been issued to the industrial units ahead of the inspection to clear the pending works in complying with the provisions under the Environment (Protection) Act and Air and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts. A preliminary assessment held after the fire incident had revealed that certain units were functioning without obtaining the valid consent from the board. A few units were found to be lacking in facilities that would check pollution. The industrial units have to produce consent certificates issued by the board, maintain registers and logbooks to prove that the operation is legal and satisfying the provisions under the various environmental laws. The managements of units that had received notices from the board explaining will have to fulfil the directions before the start of the inspection. A report will be filed before the NGT on the erring industrial units based on the inferences gathered from the visits by officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-asks-edayar-industrial-units-to-comply-with-green-laws/article33745495.ece
04 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||‘Church must support resistance movements’||There is a need for Christians to close ranks with the protesting farmers who are fighting for justice, says Father Y.T. Vinayaraj, theologian, writer and chief editor of the Malankara Sabha Tharaka , the organ of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church headquartered in Thiruvalla. “The Christian faith is essentially anti-imperialist and the Church is duty-bound to join forces with people’s resistance movements,” says Dr. Vinayaraj, who took to Facebook the other day to make a fervent appeal for support to the farmers. ‘Offer resistance’ According to him, the Centre is colluding with neo-liberal capitalist forces to divest the farmers and other ordinary people of their rightful share of resources. “This government relies on religious nationalism to gain political legitimacy and deals with an iron hand democratic protests seeking justice. We have had so many instances of this: the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University, the anti-CAA [Citizenship (Amendment) Act] protests, the justice for Rohit Vemula movement and now the farmers’ agitation. It is time subaltern and democratic forces came together to offer resistance,” Dr. Vinayaraj, who also teaches at the Mar Thoma seminary, told The Hindu over phone. He feels let down by the leaders of a section of the Catholic Church who he thinks “are only trying to push their vested interests by joining hands with the undemocratic forces”. “What are they trying to strike a deal for? Mere representation in minority forums or for some personal gains? When asked if they discussed the farmers’ protest during their meeting with the Prime Minister, one bishop said they had not discussed any political issue. But isn’t solidarity with the suffering and the deprived classes, the Dalits, at the heart of Christianity? It is a fake religiosity without that,” argues Dr. Vinayaraj, who wants the Church to be a reformist force. Images of the exodus of migrants, the protesting farmers, imprisonment of human rights activists, persecution of women, Dalits and sexual minorities and a government that was increasingly becoming authoritarian were all invoked by the editorial of the Mar Thoma Church organ in its December 2020 issue, asking what these signs portended for the Church.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/church-must-support-resistance-movements/article33745487.ece
04 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Busting of illegal telephone exchanges throws up concerns||The two alleged illegal telephone exchanges, which were busted by the Kochi City police recently, throws light on a potential ploy that brings twin benefits to those behind it — undue financial gain by skipping the regulated telecom environment and communication avoiding lawful interceptions if ulterior motives are involved. The phenomenon of illegal telephone exchanges was perceived to have lost its lure once Internet-based voice and video calls drastically brought down the cost of international calls, which originally led to such unlawful operations. “There does not seem to be any immediate financial benefit for operating illegal telephone exchanges unless they are being utilised for running an off-the-radar call centre. Even terror elements may prefer encrypted calls over instant messengers like Telegram over unencrypted calls through illegal exchanges that could be tapped,” said ADGP Manoj Abraham, nodal officer of Kerala Cyberdome. Technical experts associated with a public sector telecom major said the illegal telecom operations adopting the Internet-based Session Initiation Protocol Trunk Service, whereby as many as 10,000 numbers could be connected over a single optical fibre cable, deprived both the government and the service provider of their rightful revenues. “The technology is such that it could be manipulated by using an extension number abroad, effectively reducing an international call as an intercom, thus making it a win-win proposition both for agents who arrange it for a fee and the beneficiary who can literally make an international call for free,” said a technical officer. The police action was based on a petition by the Telecom Enforcement and Resource Monitoring (TERM) Cell of the Department of Telecom, which reports such malpractices.“We are keeping a tab and will report to the police as and when we come across more such practices,” said officials associated with the TERM Cell. “Unlike the legal calls where the identity of callers are revealed, these illegally routed calls mask them, making them a potential internal security threat,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). Nandakishore Harikumar, who runs a cybersecurity start-up and is associated with the Cyberdome, said illegal telephone exchanges could be a disguise for shady call centres operating outside the regulated environment while it could also be a ruse for call spoofing by fraudsters. “It could be also used for unauthorised virtual conference to skip the costlier conference apps,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/busting-of-illegal-telephone-exchanges-throws-up-concerns/article33745496.ece

ERCMPU chairman John Theruvath said on Wednesday that milk procurement in the region was to the tune of 3.60 lakh litres per day while sales stood around 3.30 lakh litres. Around 30,000 litres of milk were being processed for value-added products, he said. The Ernakulam region comprises 933 Anand Pattern primary societies, to which 46,000 dairy farmers are affiliated. After lockdown The increase in milk procurement is a good sign after the fall in production during the COVID-19 lockdown. The Ernakulam region had seen daily procurement fall to around 2.7 lakh litres during the lockdown. The Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union, the largest of the three regional unions, was the first in the State to achieve self-sufficiency.

Mr. Anwar said the process of finalising the candidates would start in a week. On the allegations that the Congress was playing the communal card by raking up the Sabarimala women’s entry issue ahead of the elections, Mr. Anwar said the party had tried to take every community along with it for long. Mr. Anwar said the ideologies of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were on similar lines. “The State unit of the party should consider joining hands with the Congress,” he said.

The patient was put on a ventilator as the tumour was blocking her respiratory passage completely. She was airlifted to Kochi with the ventilator support. Her evaluation showed a huge tumour of thyroid fully occupying the neck and had grossly shifted the respiratory passage or trachea. Usually, thyroid and other neck tumours are removed by keyhole procedures. But for this patient, as her tumour was too large, it was decided to open the neck and mid part of the chest (sternum), according to Dr. R. Padmakumar, who led the surgery.

At present the State has regional laboratories in Kannur, Thrissur and Ernakulam apart from the main facility at the Police Headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram. The Rs. 50-lakh lab in Kollam was opened as part of the government decision to set up forensic labs in all 14 revenue districts. The objective of opening the labs is to ensure a more efficient investigation process along with an effective trial using scientific methods. Three divisions In the initial phase, there will be three divisions, including Physics, Biology and Chemistry, while a cyber forensic division will be started in the lab shortly. The lab in Thiruvananthapuram has 11 divisions that also includes Ballistics, Serology, DNA, Documents, Documents-Civil, Explosives and Polygraph. Till now the district was dependent on Thiruvananthapuram for forensic expertise and very often the department had to wait for weeks for the results. As the district lab becomes functional, results will be available in days, expediting the whole process of investigation. Key role “Scientific evidence collection is crucial in crime investigation and forensic experts who examine scenes of crime play a key role in that,” said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who inaugurated the lab through videoconferencing. Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma presided. She said the government had been taking steps to upgrade the infrastructure of the department in a bid to modernise the system. “It is a matter of pride that we could complete the lab in Kollam, the first in the State, in a time-bound manner,” she said.

Sources said INKEL had signed a contract with the NHAI for taking up the Rs. 1853.42-crore project after a Hyderabad-based construction firm failed to provide bank guarantee. The development comes in the wake of reports that the Ministry might rope in Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) for the six-laning of the 28.4-km Kozhikode bypass from Vengalam to Idimuzhikkal. Previously, it had also toyed with the idea of bringing in L&T for executing the project. Krishna Mohan Construction Private Limited, the Hyderabad company, which secured the contract had failed to secure a bank guarantee of Rs. 85.50 crore. According to the contract, the construction of the six-lane bypass should have started in August 2018 and completed in April 2020. Work on six-laning the 40.80-km Azhiyur-Vengalam section of National Highway 66 in Kozhikode district will begin when the State government hands over the land acquired for the Rs. 1,838-crore project. Sources said AEL had already won the multi-crore six-laning of the 40.80-km Azhiyur-Vengalam section last month. The project, granted under the Hybrid Annuity Mode, is part of the Centre’s Bharatmala Pariyojna. The contract will be signed within a month. At the same time, work on the 2.10-km stretch between Moorad bridge and Palolipalam has already begun. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had laid the foundation stone for the Kozhikode-Palolipalam-Moorad bridge six-lane project crore in October.

They argued that the dismantling of 15-year-old vehicles, which were recently fitted with costly GPS devices on a government directive, was hardly a possible option for operators, and that they would be compelled to launch an indefinite strike seeking revision of the proposal. Shaju Almana, a functionary of Lorry Owners Federation, said workers would soon hold a token strike across the State against the move. “If the government still remains unconvinced, we will be launching an indefinite strike with the cooperation of lorry operators from other States,” he added. Mr. Almana claimed that the new proposal, if implemented, would adversely impact around 50% of goods vehicles. “Owners of such vehicles will never be able to purchase new ones, as suggested by the government, and they will be compelled to quit the field in the absence of other alternatives,” he said. A few lorry operators from Kozhikode district alleged that the new proposal was meant to support large-scale vehicle manufacturers. According to them, the Central and State governments were little concerned about the plight of poor entrepreneurs in the inter-State lorry service sector, which was badly hit by the hike in prices of fuel and mechanical components. Members of Lorry Owners Federation claimed that automobile dealers in the State were charging heavy repairing fee after the introduction of BS IV and BS VI variants, citing “suspicious” shortage of mechanical parts for old vehicles. The increase in vehicles tax and insurance premium is another challenge which has shaken several small investors, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lorry-owners-condemn-vehicle-scrappage-policy/article33745093.ece

04 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Snakepedia, another app to know the reptile up close||After SARPA, Snake Lens, and SnakeHub, another web application is being launched to introduce the reptile with the help of pictures, infographics, and podcasts. ‘Snakepedia’ also has analysis on first aid and treatment and details on prevalent myths and superstitions in Kerala. The Android-based app also has an online helpline menu for identification of snakes. However, its features, except podcast and online ID helpline, are available offline. It is completely free. Naveenlal Payyeri and P.S. Jinesh, who are part of Team Snakepedia, said there was a system of bringing snakes to the hospital along with the patient. If snakes are identified, it will be useful for the doctor during treatment. “There are WhatsApp groups for helping doctors to identify snakes, which work with the help of researchers. When we analyse the pictures of snakes that have come so far in them, a vast majority of snakes killed are non-venomous. Snakepedia will help the common man find a useful way to identify snakes,” they claimed. The mobile application has been developed by a team of scientists, nature lovers, and doctors. Of the over 300 species found in India, around 100 are from Kerala belonging to 12 different families. “More than 700 pictures of these are included with up to 20 photographs of various colour morphs for some snakes. These photographs are taken by more than 130 people inside and outside Kerala,” Mr. Naveenlal and Dr. Jinesh said. Users can find out the snakes in Kerala by searching keywords or first alphabets of their common name in English or Malayalam or the scientific names in the search feature. Information on each species can be found on the description pages with the help of pictures and infographics. One can also listen to English-Malayalam podcasts here. The feature titled ‘Dangerous’ contains details about only venomous snakes that may pose a threat to human health, and ‘Harmless’ has information about those that are not dangerous. Many venomous snakes have similar looking non-venomous mimics. Snakes that look similar to each other are grouped in the ‘Lookalike’ feature. It also has ID tips to differentiate non-venomous from venomous snakes using characteristic differentiating features with the help of easily understandable infographics. The other features are ID tips, ask expert, first aid, list of 158 hospitals that have anti-snake venom, treatment, Info, myths and hoaxes, rescuers, check list, habitat, and podcast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/snakepedia-another-app-to-know-the-reptile-up-close/article33745106.ece
04 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Renovated fish landing centre set to open||After many years of wait and technical glitches, the development work of the Vellayil fish landing centre is finally nearing completion. The renovated area with improved facilities for the safe anchoring of boats and the auctioning of daily catch will be commissioned within a couple of weeks. It was in 2012 that the development proposal of the fish landing centre was given sanction. The expected time of completion then was in 2017. The project implementation got delayed due to several factors including the delay in the allocation of funds and retendering procedures. The technical issues related to the re-construction of breakwaters also interrupted the project. Fisheries Department officials said the renovated fish landing centre would have facilities such as safe wharf, auction hall, loading area, parking space, administrative block, improved electrification, hygienic drain, and compound wall. About Rs. 75 crore has been so far spent for the improvement of the area, they said. According to the officials, the congestion at the Puthiyappa harbour would be reduced to a great extent with the opening of the Vellayil fish landing centre. The improved facilities for boat operations would naturally increase the daily catch and the revenue of fishers, they said. The leaders of various fishermen organisations said the full-fledged functioning of the Vellayil harbour would fetch its direct benefits to thousands of fishermen from the Kozhikode urban area. Those who heavily depended on the Beypore and Puthiyappa harbours would be able to operate from Vellayil and it would be very convenient for fishers from Kamburam, Thoppayil, and Puthiyakadavu areas, they said. Meanwhile, some of them alleged that the harbour department had failed to complete the construction of the breakwaters as suggested by the experts in the project area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/renovated-fish-landing-centre-set-to-open/article33745110.ece

Sudhakaran’s reference to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s family background in his address at a political meet in Kannur on Tuesday is likely to trigger a fresh debate on the use of indecorous language in political rhetoric in the run-up to the forthcoming Assembly election in the State. Mr. Sudhakaran’s refrain in the controversial part of his public speech during the reception accorded to the Aishwarya Kerala Yatra led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala was that the Chief Minister hailed from a family of toddy tapper. The speech has already drawn sharp reactions on social media which viewed it as a casteist slander. Mr. Sudhakaran said the Chief Minister, who hailed from “the family of a toddy tapper” and had risen to be a leader and “apostle” of the party of the working class will be recorded in history as the first Chief Minister in the State to hire a helicopter for his travel. Workers of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) should consider whether this is an honour or disgrace for them, he said in his speech. Mr. Sudhakaran’s controversial speech was delivered amid the controversy over CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan’s statement on Congress leaders’ visit to the residence of IUML supremo Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal the other day. The UDF has accused Mr. Vijayaghavan of an attempt to communalise the Congress leaders’ visit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sudhakarans-remark-on-pinarayi-kicks-up-row/article33745095.ece

The association claimed that a number of fake complaints misleading courts and law enforcement agencies were recently noticed, and they should be actioned to protect lawful business. It also demanded that the State government come up with legislation to ensure uninterrupted functioning of quarries without bringing down the permitted operational area. Also, there should be a mechanism to hear quarry operators to prevent illegal protests, it said. Owners of various small-scale quarry units said that they would be compelled to launch a State-wide indefinite strike, if the government reduced the operational area of quarry projects based on fake complaints. They added that the recently hiked fee for quarry projects would only pave the way for a steep rise in prices of quarry products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/law-sought-for-smooth-running-of-quarries/article33745109.ece

04 February 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Muthalamada farmers’ dreams turn sour||The mango farmers of Muthalamada have been badly affected by the untimely showers of December and continual attack by a puzzling variety of thrips. The farmers have got hardly one-fourth of the yield when the Muthalamada mango season peaked by the beginning of February. Muthalamada mangoes enjoy a special place across the country, especially in the north, as they are the first mangoes to hit the market in January-February. Till mid-March, Muthalamada mangoes usually fetch good price in the market; but not this year. The farmers said the untimely showers of December had destroyed the flowers to a large extent. Attack by a new variety of thrips has virtually shattered the dreams of the farmers by ravaging the flowers. “The untimely rains caused the flowers to drop, and the thrip attack has been beyond the control of the farmers. We got hardly 20% of the yield that we ought to get by this time,” said Hafees J.M., mango trader and exporter from Muthalamada. He said that apart from the heavy crop loss, mango sale and export too had dipped considerably in the post-COVID-19 scenario. “Mango export rate has gone up. But the sale has fallen for obvious reasons. Flight movement is minimal in the pandemic time,” said Mr. Hafees. Biggest woe Mango farmers of Muthalamada are still clueless about the thrips, locally called Elappen, in spite of their presence for the last three years. The farmers have tried different pesticides, but none has been found effective. “Thrips have become the biggest enemy of Muthalamada farmers in recent memory. For three years consecutively, they (thrips) have given us our biggest woes,” said M. Sachindran, a farmer who owns about 10 acres of mango orchards. He has been cultivating mango trees at Muthalamada for about three decades. The entire area spread over 4,500 hectares witnessed a crop shift from groundnut to mango over four decades ago. Most orchards of Muthalamada have flowered now. The third batch of flowers will have their crops by March-April when the mango season across the country peaks. By April, the demand for Muthalamada mangoes will be less as mangoes from other parts of the country pour into the markets.  Main market “We should have got a decent yield by now. But getting a yield by March-end or April will not help us,” said Mr. Sachindran. Delhi remains the main market for Muthalamada mangoes, followed by Ahmedabad and Mumbai. About 90% of the 20,000 tonne mangoes from Muthalamada reach those markets every year. But this year, hardly one-fourth is expected to reach those markets. Muthalamada has all the major mango varieties such as Alphonso, Banganapalli, Sindhooram, Totapuri or Kilimooku or Kilichundan, Kalapadi, Mallika, Naduselai, Neelam, Rumani, Malgoa, and Gudadath. But Alphonso continues to be the leader, bringing two to three times the price of other varieties. Banganapalli, Sindhooram, and Totapuri are the key varieties covering two thirds of the total crops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rain-thrips-cause-havoc-on-mango-farms/article33745099.ece

Nadda on Wednesday said multiple investigations by Central agencies into various aspects of the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case would sweep up more Left Democratic Front (LDF) Ministers in their wake. The heat was getting to them. “The Speaker is also involved in the scam,” he said. The crime had the patronage of the office of the highest executive in the State. The LDF’s saga of corruption has disgusted the people. “The involvement of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office in the case has embarrassed Keralites the world over,” he said. The government had crossed a line by attacking constitutional bodies. The CPI(M) had savaged the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India for questioning the constitutionality of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The Kerala Public Service Commission has become a recruiting agency for CPI(M) members. The government had made three lakh back-door appointments, dashing the hopes of the educated youth, he said. Corruption cases Congress leaders too faced a slew of corruption cases. The Palarivattom flyover was emblematic of the previous Oommen Chandy government’s graft. “We know about the sex scandal that dogs the Congress leadership. The party has invited the same Mr. Chandy to lead it into the election fray,” he said. When pressed about BJP vice president Sobha Surendran’s purported dissatisfaction with the party’s State leadership, Mr. Nadda said: “We are going to heal wherever sentiments are hurt as in a big family,” he said. Mr. Nadda dismissed the Congress theory that the BJP had struck a tacit understanding with the CPI(M). “We don’t believe in such underhand dealings,” he said. Mr. Nadda will address a public rally in Thrissur on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probes-will-net-more-ministers-nadda/article33745179.ece

The facility will be coming up in the 97-acre land taken on lease by the TCS on the Technocity campus. The modern development facility will host engineering, product development and IT services in manufacturing, aerospace and defence domains. The project will focus on the latest technologies like Robotics, AI, Machine learning, data analytics, blockchain and IoT. TCS also plans to set up an incubation centre for technology startups. K.Mohammed Y Safirulla, Additional Secretary, Electronics and Information Technology Department, told The Hindu that the decision is a boost to the IT sector in the State during the COVID-19 period. “It was envisaged initially as a training centre for TCS. But for various reasons, it could not take off. They then evinced interest in setting up a development centre. As the challenge and the need now is job creation, we agreed on an MoU, which the Cabinet has now approved. Another positive here is that the TCS is going to focus on the latest technologies. In the first phase, which is expected to be completed within 28 months, 5,000 jobs will be generated, and when the project is completed, 20,000 jobs will be generated. Direct investment of Rs. 1,200 to 1,500 crore can also be expected,” said Mr.Safirulla. He said that 7 acres out of the 97 acres will be used for setting up a facility for Tata Elxsi, the hardware arm of the group. Sustainable campus The campus will be developed as a sustainable one, with efficient energy, water, clean air and waste management concepts integrated. TCS currently employs about 15,000 people in their development centres in Kerala and is the largest employer in the field of IT in Kerala. Active presence of a reputed company like the TCS in Technocity, working in advanced areas of defence and aerospace, is expected to attract many small and big companies in these sectors to Kerala. With the opening up of defence and aerospace industry to the private sector, large investments in these sectors are expected in future, said Mr.Safirulla||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tcs-to-set-up-hub-in-technocity/article33745636.ece

Compared to the paltry allocation provided in the 2020-2021 Budget for doubling, Rs. 490 crore has been allotted this year, including the highest provision of Rs. 275 crore for the 86.56-km corridor from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Kanyakumari.

The commission of member K. Nazeer said that only if an establishment was registered would the precise details of those working there be available. Employees who are not registered should not work there. In case of violations, legal action, including prosecution, should be resorted to. The Labour Secretary and the Labour Commissioner should issue orders to this effect, the commission said. The commission was acting on a complaint about children being made to work in a food joint in Pothencode. The District Labour Officer (Enforcement), in a report, said that during an inspection it was found that the chapatti joint employed five people, and that migrant workers who worked there had returned home in the wake of COVID-19. Two children who were seen there were not found to be working. As child labour had not been proven, the commission refrained from taking any special steps. However, as the number of employees and other details had not been registered with labour officers, the District Labour Officer should proceed with legal action, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ensure-that-no-child-is-made-to-work-panel/article33745634.ece

Ramesh Kumar has said the success of democracy will be a reality only when people begin to elect the honest and righteous leaders to steer them. Addressing a press conference in Tirupati on Wednesday, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said that compared to the previous years, the current elections to the local bodies proved that more and more people were coming forward to be in the contest. “I am just following the spirit of the Constitution to instil confidence in the people and to allay all fears and apprehensions among them over conduct of the elections. Every person should feel secure to contest in the elections and should not be cowed down by disruptive forces,” he said. The official observed that some forces were trying to mislead the public with arguments that elections to local bodies would vitiate atmosphere in villages. “In fact, though tensions might prevail in the villages during the elections, but all would surely unite in no time as and when the process is over. Use of coercion to get unanimous elections is against democracy,” Mr. Ramesh Kumar said. ‘App helpful’ The SEC said that the e-Watch app was aimed at effectively rectifying the anomalies and checking disruptive forces in the elections. “The officials concerned would be fully answerable to the complaints,” he said. Mr. Ramesh Kumar said that the entire election process would be completely guided by the COVID-19 protocol. He said that at a time when there was a dilemma over conducting the elections due to the pandemic, the medical and health administration could phenomenally bring down the cases and created a ‘very safe atmosphere’ for the elections. “As I am retiring on March 31, I got an assurance from officials of all departments that elections will be conducted in a peaceful manner.

Speaking to the media at Tirupati, the CWC member alleged that the NDA government had taken to political vendetta in allocation of funds to the States going to assembly elections. “People have already started realizing the true face of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which made tall promises in the 2019 elections, including the Special Category Status and fulfilment of the bifurcation promises, but dumped them after coming to the power. The prime reason for the Centre ignoring the State is the failure of the MPs of both YSR Congress Party and Telugu Desam Party,” Dr. Mohan said. “Between 2004 and 2014, the UPA government had sanctioned as many as seven national highways from Tirupati connecting to Maharashtra, Kerala and northern States with an outlay of Rs. 70,000 crores, covering 3,500 kms. The backward regions of Chittoor and Nellore districts were given Mannavaram BHEL project, Dugarajupatnam port, Tirupati international airport, International Cricket stadium and special funds for the SVIMS hospital. The Institute for Pregnant women and Children’s Hospital had come with 300-bed capacity in Tirupati. The Srikalahasti-Nadikudi railway line and Guduru-Katpadi double line and gauge conversion projects were mooted during the UPA rule,” Dr. Mohan said. The former MP deplored that the NDA government had shelved almost all the premier projects of the UPA in Tirupati region, including the 7,008 double bedroom houses scheme worth Rs. 292 crore to women from the BPL category, and the Heritage Circuit conneting 17 historical temples in Chittoor and Nellore districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/union-govt-has-sidelined-states-interests-chinta/article33745541.ece

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Rambabu said the app was aimed at benefiting the TDP. “The app has been designed and developed in the TDP office,” he alleged. Referring to the arrest of TDP State president and MLA K. Atchannaidu, the YSRCP leader said the government was not involved in it. There was evidence that Mr. Atchannaidu had threatened a contestant against filing his nomination papers, and the police did their duty, he said. ‘TDP daydreaming’ Criticising Mr. Atchannaidu for warning the police of action soon after the TDP comes to power, Mr. Rambabu said the TDP leaders were daydreaming of such a prospect, not realising the fact that the people were going to reject them for ever. Referring to State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar’s visit to Gollalagunta in East Godavari district, where the husband of a sarpanch candidate died under suspicious conditions, Mr. Rambabu said the role of the SEC was to oversee the smooth conduct of elections and not to make visits to the families of TDP-backed contestants. “Investigation has to be carried out by the police and not the SEC,” he said. Dig at TDP Stating that the government had no reason to attack either TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu or his leaders as they had become “politically irrelevant,” Mr. Rambabu criticised TDP leader Pattabhi Ram for not filing an official complaint on the attack on his car and instead choosing to cast aspersions on the YSRCP.

Mr. Appireddy said it was appalling that the SEC was not maintaining transparency and accountability that were basic facets of democracy. Days before the elections were to be held in 2020, the State government had designed an app - Nighaa, and it was also approved by the SEC. Similarly, the Centre had designed C-Vigil in 2019. “We do not understand the rationale behind the SEC launching a new app now,” said Mr. Reddy. ‘e-Nethra’ The YSRCP, meanwhile, launched its own app - ‘e-Nethra’ - to keep a tab on the irregularities during the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-questions-rationale-behind-sec-launching-new-mobile-app/article33745562.ece

He also defended the decision to return the money given by P.

Since the elections were being held in four phases, the revenue and police personnel should identify sensitive and most sensitive villages. District Collector A.S. Dinesh Kumar said that polling would start at 6.30 a.m. The polling personnel should keep everything in place, including the ballot paper, ink and all other arrangements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/official-calls-for-peaceful-conduct-of-elections/article33745560.ece

04 February 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kurnool villagers demand road, decide to boycott polls||The voters of Pudur and Padidempadu in Kurnool district have decided to boycott the panchayat elections scheduled to be held in the second phase on February 13, as part of their protest against the lack of proper road connectivity to their villages and the political apathy towards solving the issue. Even as the nomination process began on Tuesday, none filed the papers from these villages after the residents campaigned against participating in the elections. Endless ordeal According to Kodepogu Mahesh, a resident, a common black-top approach road in a stretch of 5.4 km for the two villages in Kodumur Assembly constituency was sanctioned some seven years ago is yet to be completed and it is a challenge to reach the hospital in the nearest city. “As many as 10 persons have died as ambulances could not reach the villages in time. It has become a herculean task for the pregnant woman to travel on the extremely bumpy road in an auto-rickshaw,” Mr. Mahesh said. The villagers allege that successive governments and the MLAs who represented Kodumur constituency —TDP’s M. Mani Gandhi (former) and YSRCP’s Jaradoddi Sudhakar (incumbent)—have done nothing not in this regard. “The road was sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs. 5 crore. The contractor stopped the work midway in 2018 saying that another Rs. 2 crore was needed to complete the project. Since then, there has been no words from either from the officials or the people’s representatives,” said K. Raju, a B.Tech student. “The TDP and YSRCP governments have been boasting of their achievements. Many households in the two villages do not toilets. Given the situation, what is the meaning of elections and casting votes?” he asked. Some residents said that political parties were doing the rounds of the villages to woo them to fight the panchayat elections and offering to foot the poll expenses. “ We have decided not to cast vote even as some people file nomination papers,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kurnool-villagers-demand-road-decide-to-boycott-polls/article33745568.ece

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had sanctioned many infrastructure projects to West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, where elections are due in April-May, but meted out a step-motherly treatment to Andhra Pradesh, which was struggling to overcome bifurcation blues, said Nellore District Congress Committee president Ch.

In Ongole, City Congress president Dasari Nagalakshmi led the party activists in burning the Union Budget copies. She maintained that Andhra Pradesh could expect justice only when the Congress returned to power at the Centre and also in the State. ‘Wrong policies’ Petrol and diesel prices had gone out of reach of the common people due to the “wrong policies” of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-activists-burn-copies-of-union-budget/article33745544.ece

Speaking to The Hindu , Kanaka Durga temple Executive Officer (EO) M.V. Suresh Babu said that the Devasthanam management has decided to reconstruct the Sivalayam in view of its present condition. “The temple needs to be rebuilt. The government has cleared the proposal in this regard. Also, necessary funds would be released for rebuilding the temple,” he said. The stone sculpture works will be taken up downhill of Indrakeeladri. Later, the temple walls will be dismantled stone by stone to pave way for the reconstruction. “We are planning to complete the works before Karthika Masam, which is an auspicious month, in the coming Telugu new year,” he said. The EO said that the same architectural style would be retained in the reconstruction of the Sivalayam. A sum of Rs. 7 crore would be released by the government in this regard. Also, Rs. 2 crore would be spent on extension works for the Sivalayam, he added. The Devasthanam had taken up repair works on the Sivalayam four years ago. The roof of the Sivalayam would leak whenever it rained. The temple priests used to perform daily rituals standing in rainwater that stagnated in the sanctum santorum. Darshan of the deity at Sivalayam was temporarily suspended for the devotees then. New facilities planned The Devasthanam authorities are also planning to construct a potu (temple kitchen) at an estimated cost of Rs. 5.6 crore and an Anna Prasadam complex at Rs. 19.7 crore.

Mr. Veerraju alleged that the village secretaries were not issuing the no-due certificate to the contestants in a deliberate move aimed at favouring the ruling party. He further alleged that false cases were being booked against those filing nominations to intimidate them, which reflected the government’s fear of defeat in the elections. Mr. Veerraju said the situation prevailing in the State was taken to the notice of Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy. “The YSRCP government is getting funds from the Centre on a large scale. But, like his predecessor, Y.S.

04 February 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Power purchase report sought from Discoms||The A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has asked the Discoms to submit within a week a detailed report justifying power purchases made from exchanges in December and the first fortnight of January, including the details of dispatches from approved sources vis-à-vis their declared capacities, and savings achieved in the overall power purchase costs. In a letter to the Discoms, APERC chairman C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy observed that the landed per-unit cost of energy has been increasing and was ranging from Rs. 3.27 to Rs. 4.07 except on two days between December 17 and January 15. Also, the quantum of purchases were huge (from 30 MU to 40 MU per day constituting about 15 to 20% of the daily energy requirement). He said that the maximum per-unit variable cost of the last dispatched thermal power plant as indicated in the approved merit order dispatch table for FY 2020-21 was Rs. 3.98. Many thermal units of AP-Genco, whose per-unit variable costs were in the range of Rs. 3.24 to Rs. 3.86, are being kept under reserve shutdown for longer periods on the premise that the costs in the exchanges are lesser than that of the power available from the thermal plants and that the procurement from exchanges would lead to the reduction of overall power purchase costs. However, it was found that the per-unit rates of energy from the exchanges during the said period were more than the per-unit variable costs of many of the approved thermal stations. The APERC, therefore, called for a comprehensive report on procurement of power from the exchanges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/power-purchase-report-sought-from-discoms/article33745566.ece

Narasimha Rao has requested the Ministry of Home Affairs to seek a detailed action taken report from the Andhra Pradesh government on the recent attacks on temples in the State. Raising the issue during Zero Hour on Wednesday, Mr. Rao said the State saw more than 140 instances of attacks on Hindu temples involving demolition and desecration of idols and crimes of other nature in the last 19 months, but the State government had not shown any seriousness in arresting the culprits. The latest incident of ‘severing’ of the 400-year-old idol of Lord Sri Ram at the Ramateertham temple in Vizianagaram district had deeply hurt the sentiments of Hindus all over the State and beyond, Mr. Rao said. “The attacks have intensified in the last six months as the criminals have become emboldened by the lack of prompt action against those responsible for the previous incidents,” he said. Major incidents such as torching of ancient chariots at the Bitragunta and Antarvedi temples and disfigurement of silver lions at the Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada had not been probed in a timely manner, he alleged. Mr. Rao said it was only after a massive outrage that the State government started making “half-hearted attempts” to investigate the cases by setting up a Special Investigation Team. Instead of apprehending the real culprits, the police had been arresting political workers for making comments in the social media posts criticising such incidents, he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mp-takes-andhra-temple-attacks-to-rs/article33744820.ece

Sudhakar. In the writ petition, he sought directions to the SEC to use either the ‘C-Vigil’ app developed by the Election Commission of India or the ‘Nighaa’ app developed by the State government, and not the ‘e-Watch’ app developed by a private firm and brought out by the SEC on its own allegedly in violation of the cyber security policies of the Central and State governments.

04 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Phase II of vaccination for frontline workers takes off||The COVID-19 vaccination programme for frontline workers, under Phase-II, began here on Wednesday. As per the initial plan, it was supposed to commence from February 6, but keeping the upcoming panchayat elections in mind, the district administration has started the Phase II from Wednesday. In the Phase-II, the focus is on GVMC sanitation staff, sanitation staff in hospitals, police, revenue and panchayat raj department. As per District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar, one lakh frontline workers from across the district have been identified for Phase II. Speaking to The Hindu , District Immunisation Officer Jeevan Rani said that the first phase in which health workers were listed are almost coming to a close and that is why we have started the second phase and it will run parallel to the first phase. Sufficient stocks In Phase I, about 37,000 health workers were listed and close to 25,000 have already taken the jab. Coming to the vaccine stock, the district has received 1.14 lakh vaccines, and it is sufficient to cover both Phase-I and Phase-II. Of the total, 23,000 are Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech and around 91,000 are Covishield, developed by Serum Institute of India. “We have sufficient stock, which is kept in freezers at the central storing facility at the District Immunisation Department, and from here they are dispatched to the session sites, where we have installed ice-lined refrigerators,” said Dr. Jeevan Rani. Dr. Sudhakar also said that the session sites have also gone up to 200 from 43 and they will be increased, based on the requirement. Challenge Though the first phase has gone by smoothly, officials feel that Phase-II and Phase-III, will be a challenging task. In the first phase, the total number to be immunised was around 37,000. But in the second phase, it will be close to one lakh and in the third phase, it is going to be around eight lakh. The third phase will cover people above 50 years of age with co-morbidities as well as senior citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/phase-ii-of-vaccination-for-frontline-workers-takes-off/article33745708.ece

A voice recording purporting to be that of Kanna Babu allegedly threatening a sarpanch candidate surfaced on Wednesday, similar to the one that surfaced from Srikakulam district on Tuesday in which TDP veteran Kinjarapu Atchannnaidu was allegedly heard threatening a YSRCP-backed candidate. Police said they have registered a case against the MLA under Section 506 of the IPC and some sections of the Panchayat Raj Act-1995. Police said a man named L. Santosh lodged a complaint stating that his uncle, who is contesting against a YSRCP-backed candidate in Lalamkoduru panchayat in Rambilli mandal, was allegedly threatened by the MLA to withdraw his nomination. A senior police officer said that based on the complaint and audio clip submitted by the complainant, cases have been booked and further action will be taken after verifying the veracity of the audio clip. Meanwhile, leaders and activists from the Jana Sena Party urged the police to take strong action against the MLA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mla-kanna-babu-booked-for-threatening-rival/article33745705.ece
04 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Plan to privatise ports opposed||A protest was organised by trade unions, owing allegiance to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), at the Visakhapatnam Port Trust here on Wednesday demanding withdrawal of the proposal to privatise major ports in the country and against the proposed privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). United Port and Dock Employees Union secretary B. Jagan told the gathering that the NDA government seemed to be in a great hurry to implement new economic policies. “Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to raise Rs. 1.75 lakh crore through the sale of Public Sector Undertakings and to sell one of the major ports, which was earning high profits, to private entities. A proposal was also made to raise Rs. 2,000 crore through the sale of the assets of major ports,” Mr. Jagan alleged. He alleged that the Centre was planning to divest 79% stake in the Life Insurance Corporation apart from trying to hand over Air India, BSNL, steel plants, BPCL, SCI Container Corporation, HICL, SAIL, Railways and 10 airports to corporate firms. Mr. Jagan said that the BJP-led NDA was planning to introduce the Major Ports Bill in the ensuing Budget session, ignoring the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Standing Committee in 2019. If the Bill was approved by Parliament, it would pave the way for handing over the major ports to corporates, he alleged. The Bill would also enable the major ports to park their surplus funds and pension funds in Indian and foreign private corporate banks apart from selling their lands at throwaway prices. The trust boards of the major ports have to function under the directions of the Central government as per Sub-Section 1 and 2 of Section 50, he said. The IPA Chairman had assured the port federations of discussing the issue with them and assured them there was no cause for worry, when they met him on December 5, 2019. But the Finance Minister had announced in the Budget that one of the major ports would be privatised during the present fiscal. He alleged that the implementation of four Labour Codes would turn the workers into ‘slaves’ and called for opposing them till they were withdrawn. Union leaders B. Lakshman Rao, J. Satyanarayana, Trinadha Rao and Yella Rao were among those who participated. At a separate protest organised by the CITU, copies of the Labour codes brought out by the NDA government were burnt on Wednesday. CITU president R.K.S.V. Kumar and general secretary M. Jaggu Naidu were among those who participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plan-to-privatise-major-ports-opposed/article33745696.ece
04 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Early screening is key’||Progress in cancer biology and immunology has enabled prevention of virus-induced cancers like vaccination against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) to prevent cervical, genital and oropharyngeal cancers and against the Hepatitis B virus to prevent liver cirrhosis and subsequent liver cancer, said Dr. G. Raghunadha Rao, consultant medical oncologist at KIMS ICON Hospital.  Dr. Raghunadha Rao underlined the role of every citizen in achieving the goal of a cancer-free world. The fact that many cancers are preventable, several can be screened for, especially in cancer family syndromes, and most are easy to treat, when detected early should be understood by every and they should spread the message. The easiest approach would be to take every girl for HPV vaccination, adult women for breast and cervical cancer screening, all tobacco users for oral cancer screening and cessation clinic, maintaining an ideal weight, and evolving a sustainable exercise plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/awareness-is-key-to-preventing-cancers/article33745548.ece

04 February 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Political parties exploiting Ramateertham incident||The political atmosphere in the districts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam, which were known to be peaceful for decades, has hotted up of late, thanks to fight between the YSR Congress Party and Opposition, including the Telugu Desam Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party., to gain an upper hand. The opposition is trying to get maximum mileage out of the Ramateertham incident, where the idol of Lord Rama was allegedly desecrated. Senior leaders of the Opposition parties, including former Home Minister and former TDP State president Kimidi Kalavenkata Rao and BJP State unit president Somu Veerraju were arrested when they tried to stage protests. There was a direct showdown between the workers of YSRCP and TDP on January 2, during the visit of former chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Rajya Sabha MP K. Vijaya Sai Reddy. The BJP organised protests at Ramateertham twice, putting the police on tenterhooks. As part of damage control mechanism, the State government ensured installation of a new Lord Rama idol carved by TTD architecture wing at Balalayam in Ramateertham last week. Panchayat polls Now the TDP and YSRCP are trying to win maximum number of panchayats in the local body elections. Although the YSRCP won all nine Assembly constituencies in Vizianagaram district in the last general elections, it lost Tekkali and Itchapuram Assembly seats and Srikakulam Parliament seat in Srikakulam, thanks to the concerted efforts of Mr. Atchannaidu. YSRCP leader Duvvada Srinivas, who unsuccessfully contested the Srikakulam Parliament seat, is striving hard to win maximum number of seats, including Nimmada panchayat, a native village of Mr. Atchannaidu. However, it is a not a cake walk since Nimmada has been a bastion of the TDP for the last 40 years. YSRCP’s attempt to gain ground in Nimmada turned into a prestige issue for TDP also, leading to clashes and arrest of Mr. Atchannaidu. Police officers anticipate more violence during Panchayat elections since TDP is keen on strengthening its network in rural areas. The YSRCP which is banking on positive vote does not want the TDP to win. Both the parties are at loggerheads in Vizianagaram also.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/parties-trying-to-get-mileage-out-of-ramateertham-incident/article33745571.ece

04 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Farm loan waivers had impacted State’s revenues’||The XV Finance Commission has expressed concern over the farm loan waivers announced by States like Telangana, that had an impact on their finances. “An increasingly important factor, and a worrying one, that has begun to impact the finances of States are the farm loan waivers that have been announced by various States since 2014,” the XV Commission said in its report. The Commission recalled that the RBI’s study of State budgets highlighting the debt waiver schemes of Telangana and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh announced in 2014 had significant implications amounting to Rs. 17,000 crore (3.4 per cent of GSDP) and Rs. 24,000 crore (4.6 per cent of GSDP) respectively. Falling prices Farm loan waivers are often justified on the grounds of falling prices of agricultural commodities and recurring droughts. However, the policy of giving period farm loan waivers and subsidies carries the risk of building a wider deleterious impact on the credit culture of States by incentivising wilful default and demoralising the conscientious borrowers who regularly service their loans, besides increasing the reluctance of banks in lending to farmers. The Commission said, according to information, 13 States gave no farm loan waivers while seven States including Telangana and Tamil Nadu gave details of waivers aggregating about Rs. 79,000 crore from 2014-15 to 2019-20. However, this data could not be relied on to gauge the actual quantum of farm loan waivers for a number of reasons.  States didn’t respond Firstly, some of the States did not respond. Second, the data was self-reported and could not be independently verified. The treatment of interest subvention varied across the States. “Finally, there was very little congruence between the budgeted amounts and actual spends,” the Commission said in its report. The Commission, which reported its observations on States’ finances, however, appeared positive about the State’s fiscal management. It said in the case of 17 general States, except Telangana, ten showed an increase/worsening of the revenue deficit. Fiscal deficit too increased in 11 of these 17 general States, except in Telangana. Increase in the revenue deficit could be due to decrease in own revenue, decrease in Union transfers and/or increase in revenue expenditure, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farm-loan-waivers-had-impacted-states-revenues/article33745476.ece
04 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Separate sewage from storm water to protect Hussainsagar’||The joint committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to inspect the Hussainsagar, in its recommendations, mentioned that sewage and storm water need to be separated in order to protect the lake. The treated sewage should be used for other purposes rather than being let into the lake, the report by the four-member committee, constituted following a petition by lake activist Lubna Sarwath, said. The committee has members drawn from National Institute of Hydrology, IIT-Hyderabad, Regional office of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The committee punctured the government’s claims of effectively protecting the lake’s water through STPs and bio-remediation measures. Bio-remediation was conducted only in the lake between March and August last year, while the sources of pollution remain the same, the report said. Despite the additional Interception & Diversion structures built on Kukatpally nala, about 30 to 40% untreated sewage, probably combined with industrial seepage, enters the Hussainsagar through overflow, the committee observed. Further, though the sewage has been diverted from Balkapur nala, Banjara nala and Yousufguda nala, during peak sewage flow and also when mixed with storm water flows during monsoons, the untreated water overflows the barrier of marginal height and enters the lake. During the committee’s visit, it was observed that due to dysfunctional STP, the stream of sewage from Balkapur nala has been diverted to Golnaka drain, which traverses to the Amberpet STP. Surplus water from Hussainsagar too confluences with the Golnaka drain from where 80 million litres of water per day is released to the Amberpet STP. The remaining untreated sewage reaches Musi river, polluting it. Despite the officials’ claims about treating 30 MLD of water from Picket nala, the committee, during physical inspection, observed partial mixing of untreated sewage with treated water from STP. The panel further indicted HMDA for not carrying out repairs to the surplus weir of lake after monsoons as promised earlier, and for not installing flow measurement devices to measure the sewage flows into nalas, the lake and the Musi. The city has storm water flowing along with the sewage, which is diverted to STP, due to which fresh flows of storm water are reduced into the river. Separating storm water from sewage will not only reduce the load on STP but also bring down pollution of water bodies, the report noted. Instead, constructing more I&D structures to divert sewage flows will end up increasing the pollution in the Musi, it said. The panel has recommended a detailed study to measure and estimate sewage and storm water flows into the Hussainsagar and into the Musi. As temporary measures, suitable bio-remediation of the nalas may be carried out after the barrier structure, and the number of high jet fountains may be increased from the existing seven to improve the dissolved oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/separate-sewage-from-storm-water-to-save-lake-ngt-panel/article33745470.ece
04 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Tomar’s replies misleading: Uttam||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP, N. Uttam Kumar Reddy charged Union Agriculture Minister Narender Singh Tomar of giving false replies to his questions on farm laws and said the Centre did not conduct any studies on how these laws would improve the income of small farmers and lead to doubling of their income. Referring to the answers given by the Union Minister on three questions raised by the MPs in Lok Sabha, Mr. Reddy said the new central laws were never discussed with anyone, including the farmer unions. Mr. Reddy levelled these charges at a press conference along with Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy and Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy in New Delhi on Wednesday. He said the the Government of India brought in Model APMC Act, 2017 and Model Contract Farming Act, 2018. The UPA government brought in the Model APMC Act and accordingly more than 20 States have brought reforms in the agricultural sector. The proposals were always about implementation of Model Acts by States, and never about overriding States through the Acts of the Centre, he said. In fact, in February 2020, the Centre also announced financial disincentives to States which do not implement the APMC reforms. So, where was the urgent need to bring the Acts during pandemic lockdown, he asked. The claims of the BJP that the laws were endorsed by several committees or in official meetings is false as these laws were never discussed and endorsed in the last 15 to 20 years, he said. Mr. Reddy claimed that the Centre wants to remove regulatory oversight by the State governments so as to benefit big agri-business players. “In the name of reforms, the Central Acts create an unregulated space for companies and traders where none of the State government regulations apply,” he said. The TPCC chief also alleged that TRS has entered into a secret pact with BJP and that is why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is silent on the new farms and the ongoing agitation by farmers for the last 70 days. He described Mr. Rao’s behaviour as highly insulting towards farmers. He said while Modi government is harassing farmers, Mr. Rao is exploting them in Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tomars-replies-misleading-uttam/article33745480.ece
04 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Call to invest in a sustainable ocean management system||“We know more about the surface of Mars than the depths of the ocean or complete knowledge about the ecosystem when it plays such a vital role in providing oxygen to sustain life through plankton, weather, climate change and the likes. Nations have to invest in a sustainable ocean management system not just through observation but also through more through data and information and demonstrate the value chain,” said executive secretary, Inter-governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and assistant DG of UNESCO Vladimir Ryabinin on Wednesday. Delivering the 23rd Foundation Day lecture for Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) on ‘UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Ocean Decade)’ virtually, he said the global community must wake up to the reality of excessive sea level rise in the coastal regions every year and the fact that the carbon absorption capacity has been decreasing correspondingly from cent per cent to 28% and now 22%. “This is known to scientists but not to governments,” he remarked. Sustainable ocean management is vital because it has a direct impact on weather, climate change and the food chain system. Knowledge gaps There are vast knowledge gaps about marine life in the depths of the Indian Ocean. In fact, during the massive international search for the missing Malaysian airliner, scientists went with equipment to scan the ocean depths to about 4,000 metres but realised it was much more at 6,000 metres which threw up several challenges. Satellite imagery could help make precise estimates of the ocean depths and topography too, he said.  ‘Ocean Decade’ UNESCO has declared 2021-2030 as ‘Ocean Decade’ with focus on sustainable development models for clean, healthy, safe, productive and engaging oceans by developing multi-hazard warning systems, acting on pollution, deep sea mining and so on. Oceans can be tapped for development of new medicines and can also be the source of energy like wind, tidal and thermal energy. Rare opportunity “It will provide a ‘once in a lifetime’ opportunity to create a new foundation, across the science-policy interface, strengthen management of oceans and coasts for the benefit of humanity through international scientific research and innovative technologies,” he said. Earlier, MoES secretary M. Rajeevan lauded INCOIS services in providing the best possible ocean advisories for society, scientific community and administrators like tsunami warnings, storm surge alerts, fisheries information, tides movement etc., directly benefiting seven lakh coastal communities. INCOIS Director T. Srinivasa Kumar said the institute was gearing up for enhancing the observation, operational and research capabilities with introduction of high resolution sensors, unified forecasting systems and new tools to understand the oceanic systems. Senior scientist B. V. Satyanarayana proposed a vote of thanks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/call-to-invest-in-a-sustainable-ocean-management-system/article33745475.ece
04 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Mixed opinions on Budget||The MCR-HRD Institute organised a panel discussion on Union Budget-2021 for trainee civil servants. ‘GDP growth’ Former professor, Department of Economics & Finance, ASCI, Mubeen Rafat said that the intent of the budget was to achieve GDP growth through increase in infrastructure investments. “The budget has not addressed the needs of the MSME sector or the migrant labour issues,” she said. Former professor of economics at the University of Hyderabad Dr. J. Manohar Rao welcomed the impressive outlays on infrastructure saying that this would boost private sector investments and thereby, create more jobs in the economy. However, the projected ‘V’ shaped recovery of economy appears to be more exaggerated. Chartered accountants Ganesh Balakrishnan, Shravankumar Nemani and Mohd. Irshad Ahmed welcomed the disinvestment in PSUs and said the government targeted a revenue collection of more than 5% in both GST and Income Tax through stringent recovery mechanism assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis tools. Professor at Dr. MCR HRD Institute Dr. Amir Ullah Khan, who moderated the panel discussion, said that a robust intervention on part of the government, through Union Budget 2021, would help rebuild the economy and assure health, education and employment to the vast numbers impacted by COVID. Director General of the Institute Harpreet Singh called upon the trainee civil servants to fully understand not only the various expenditure heads, but also the revenue mobilisation that will bring in the money required to fund the outlays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mixed-opinions-on-budget/article33745468.ece

04 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Organ donation up after a slump||After five months of sharp decline in organ donations, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers have increased from December. Sharp dip in lockdown Throughout 2019, around 25 to 50 organs and tissues were donated per month. The numbers were the same in January and February 2020 until the first COVID case in the State was detected on March 1. The cases of infections gradually increased and lockdown was announced on March 22. While only three organs were harvested in April, the number fell to zero in May, went up to 13 in June and then went down to zero again in July. The maximum donations of organs are by people who meet with road accidents, leading to critical health complications and brain death. Since vehicular movement was restricted during the lockdown, leading to a drop in road accidents, admissions at hospitals too were low and therefore, organ donations dipped between April and August. The donations started to pick up again from September. In December, 49 organs were donated while in January this year, the number stood at 41. Changing attitudes In-charge of Jeevandan, the State government’s cadaver transplantation programme, G. Swarnalatha said though people’s attitude towards organ donation has changed, there is still some hesitancy. “People should overcome myths and inhibitions about the donation,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/organ-donation-picks-up-after-a-slump/article33745465.ece

The Commission, in its observations on the State’s performance, said the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, a flagship programme of the Telangana government taken up at an estimated Rs. 80,000 crore, was aimed at serving over 18 lakh acres of farmland.  Power bill However, lift irrigation invariably notches up a massive electricity bill, bringing to question, the financial viability of the project in the absence of a guaranteed revenue stream. “The huge investments made in irrigation have not yet resulted in commensurate returns in terms of crop yield improvements,” the commission pointed out stressing the need for efforts to generate adequate revenue to cover at least operations and maintenance cost of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/panel-suggests-user-charges-on-kaleshwaram-project/article33745477.ece

04 February 2021||JAIPUR,||No Cabinet expansion in Rajasthan, says Cong.||The ruling Congress in Rajasthan on Wednesday refuted speculation about the State Cabinet expansion and reshuffle as well as political appointments to the boards, corporations and commissions. With the budget session of the State Assembly beginning on February 10, new appointments and restructuring are not likely to take place before next month. AICC general secretary in-charge of the State Ajay Maken, who was on a two-day visit to Jaipur, told reporters here that the Congress workers would be appointed to the posts at the district and block levels within the party structure later this month. The senior party leaders have been asked to prepare the panel of names for appointment of District Congress Committee presidents. Mr. Maken, who addressed a meeting of the newly formed Pradesh Congress Committee executive here, said about 25,000 party workers would be accommodated in the district and block level committees, with preference to be given to Dalits, backward classes, minorities and women. A disciplinary committee of the PCC will also be constituted shortly. The Congress faces the challenge of maintaining balance among different factions in the political appointments, as the loyalists from the camps of both Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Deputy CM Sachin Pilot expect to be accommodated in the Cabinet and other bodies. Mr. Gehlot is said to be having reservations about certain leaders proposed to be inducted into various bodies. Bid to strengthen party Mr. Maken said the ruling party would perform well in the Assembly by-elections in Rajsamand, Vallabhnagar, Sahara and Sujangarh. He said the party structure would be strengthened in the State by involving the district-level functionaries in the government’s decision making process. “The Congress functionaries will accompany the Ministers in charge of districts during their visits and assist the latter in taking decisions on development schemes and projects,” he said. PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, vice-presidents Ramlal Jat, Govind Meghwal and Harimohan Sharma, and general secretary G.R.

Mr. Trimukhe, DCP, Zone IX, has filed the complaint pursuant to the sanction granted by the Home Department as he is aggrieved by the defamatory attacks on him while he was discharging his official functions. The complaint said, “The defamatory attacks have been made with a singular view of assassinating his official character and thereby maliciously and deliberately causing undue humiliation of the Mumbai Police Department.” It added, “Mr. Goswami has made grossly false, malicious and defamatory statements/averments, which have been telecast on his channel ‘Republic Bharat’ and thereby published on YouTube on August 7, 2020. The same purports to be a panel discussion pertaining to the phone records of Ms. Rhea Chakraborty, in connection to the death of Mr. Sushant Singh Rajput. However, far from being a discussion conscribed by journalistic ethos, the defamatory telecast has Mr. Goswami breaking into a tirade of defamatory statements against Mr. Trimukhe. He is convinced that the same was done with an intention to not just drag his name through the mud, but also to cast aspersions on the conduct of the Mumbai Police as a whole in the context of the investigation into the death of Mr. Rajput.”  Mr. Trimukhe has urged the court to take cognisance of the offence and issue a warrant against the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dcp-files-criminal-complaint-against-arnab-wife/article33745149.ece

On Wednesday, the global icon was repeatedly mentioned in several speeches in front of a crowd where the majority didn’t know who she was but lauded her for her support and for bringing the protest onto the international stage. The speaker said the singer supported the protest on social media following which many international social activists and personalities also spoke up in favour of the farmers. Owing to Internet suspension around Delhi’s borders, most protesters are unaware of what the nation’s take is on the agitation. If there is some important information to share, we do it through announcements on the stage, said Charanjeet Singh, a volunteer. “Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest”, Rihanna had tweeted on Tuesday. Dalbir Singh from Moga said he doesn’t know who Rihanna is. “I haven’t heard of this name. Who knows about big English artists in our villages? but if she is talking about us then it’s great because any help for our struggle is welcome,” he said. Coordination problem Stage management committee member Arshdeep Singh Atwal, 22, from Jalandhar, said they have WhatsApp groups for duty roster and coordinating with hundreds of volunteers, but the system has collapsed because the Internet was suspended. “We have resorted to making calls to coordinate, but it’s not as efficient,” he said. He added that lawyers who are collecting data on arrested and “missing” persons are also facing trouble coordinating among themselves, and sending lists to other lawyers. “We need to send out information on missing persons on WhatsApp groups and we haven’t been able to do so,” he said. Jay Sandhu, 30, from Amritsar, who runs a tea-pakoras langar said he hasn’t been able to contact his family members in Canada and London. “I can connect with those who are in Amritsar but not those abroad. I can’t send them pictures of what we are doing here and how we are doing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/protesters-at-singhu-border-welcome-global-lens-on-stir/article33745135.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmer’ voices amplified at ‘citizens’ march’||The voices of farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders were amplified in Lutyens’ Delhi on Wednesday at a ‘citizens’ march’ called to support the farmer’s demands. Several left-wing student groups called for the march from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar and asked people of Delhi, who were in support of the farmers’ demands, to join in. The Delhi police did not allow the protesters to leave Mandi House where they had gathered and barricaded both sides of Barakhamba Road to ensure that the march did not proceed further. The police said that they had denied permission for the march as Mandi House-Jantar Mantar stretch “was not a place to hold dharna /demonstration/protest as promulgation under Section 144 CrPC is already in force in the area”. The march soon turned into a public meeting and protesters raised slogans “against the way in which the government was trying to suppress the voice of the farmers as well as how activists arrested during the CAA-NRC-NPR protests were silenced by slapping the UAPA on them”. Karam and Navjot, two of those present at the protest site, said that they had returned recently from Canada and were supporting the farmers’ movement. They said that they had started a YouTube channel to show the “truth” about the farmers’ protest as several media organisations were allegedly painting them in a bad light. “Earlier, nobody looked at my turban and called me a terrorist. Now, the government is trying to portray us in such a light that people come to us and call us terrorists. We have been subject to this profiling very often over the past few days,” said Navjot. Sucheta De from AICCTU, speaking at the protest site, said that all democratic voices of the country must learn from the spirit of the farmers’ movement and her sentiments were echoed by Kawalpreet Kaur from AISA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmers-voices-amplified-at-citizens-march/article33745142.ece

He walks all night providing tea to volunteers. He carries a rather big flask filled with tea and disposable glasses and walks around 15 km in about 20 hours. He sleeps three hours a day and at times, rests for just an hour during the day. This is his routine on most days barring a few, Mr. Singh said. Mr. Singh’s wife left 12-13 days after they had come, but he stayed on and has planned to stay till the “battle is won”. “Back at home, I used to sleep 12 hours a day, but I don’t know what has happened to me here. God has given me energy,” he said. An event in his life three years ago, pushed him into people’s service, he believes. “I suffered an electric shock. I was attached to the wire for nearly 10 minutes but God saved me. The after-effects have stayed, but I survived. After that I started serving people more seriously,” he said. Mr. Singh was seen shivering while walking.

Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh also directed the telecom service providers (TSPs), including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone, to ensure strict compliance with the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preferences Regulations (TCCCPR) 2018 issued by TRAI. The court’s direction came while disposing of a plea by One97 Communications Ltd, which runs Paytm, claiming that millions of its customers have been defrauded by the phishing activities over the mobile networks and the failure of the telecom companies to prevent the same has “caused financial and reputational loss”. “We expect respondent 2 [TRAI] to strictly implement the regulations and in case of any violation, action would be initiated in accordance with the regulations,” the High Court said. Customers defrauded Paytm had, in its plea, alleged that telecom operators are not blocking those who are defrauding its customers by “phishing” activities over various mobile networks. Paytm had contended that the telecom majors are violating their obligations under the TCCCPR 2018, to curb problem of unsolicited commercial communications Paytm claimed that under the regulations, the telecom companies are required to verify purported telemarketers seeking registration (called registered telemarketers or RTMs) with them before granting access to their customer data and also take action immediately against all fraudulent RTMs. It contended that the telcos “failure” to undertake proper verification prior to such registration enables fraudulent telemarketers to carry out phishing activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ensure-strict-implementation-of-trai-regulations-hc/article33745130.ece
04 February 2021||New Delhi,||Road occupied by farmers at Tikri border cut off from residential lanes||The main road towards Haryana’s Bahadurgarh, which has been occupied by agitating farmers at the Tikri border, has now been cut off from all nearby residential lanes with police-manned barricades even as security arrangements leading to it are being fortified further. While access to the protest site was regulated earlier too, attempts to this end were limited to the periphery of the site and not a bustling market right in the middle of it to ensure that only one person can enter or exit the main market area at a time. Though razor mesh wire fencing is limited to a small patch of land behind the immediate protest site, large metallic frames resting on heavy trucks have been procured to prevent vehicular movement towards the national capital. “They have blocked our entry into any lane connected to the protest site. Police have asked us not to go to the market in groups,” said Harmeet Sandhu from Punjab’s Moga. More earthmoving machines are now stationed next to police riot control vehicles at a little distance from where agitating farmers have erected a stage on the main road and concrete slabs have been installed in the middle of the local market to control access to it under the eyes of police personnel. Residents complained they have to walk over a kilometre through a dirt road around the restrictions to be able to reach Rohtak Road, where the police have stepped up deployment since January 26, and more DTC buses and concrete barriers have been installed to block access towards Delhi near the Tikri border metro station. “There is much more police presence in the area after what happened on January 26,” said a local resident requesting anonymity. “Policemen have been stationed at the entrances of all the lanes where barricades cannot be put or won’t fit,” he also said. Not just entry to the vicinity of the protest site, local residents are, they complained, not allowed to exit the area except from one point – a dirty road ostensibly serving as a parking lot for small goods and passenger carriers behind a slum on the main road. “Things were already inconvenient for us since the farmers came but they have gotten more inconvenient since what happened on Republic Day. Elderly residents cannot walk as much as needed to go to the main road and vehicles from outside will cause a jam if they enter the bylanes,” said Hari Shankar Sharma, a local shopkeeper who stays on rent in the area with his family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/road-occupied-by-farmers-at-tikri-border-cut-off-from-residential-lanes/article33745138.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nine firms bid for railway station redevelopment||Adani Railways Transport, GMR Highways, Arabian Construction Company, Kalpataru Power Transmission and Omaxe, are among the nine global and domestic firms who have shown interest in redeveloping the New Delhi Railway Station, the Railways said on Wednesday. These firms, along with BIF IV India Infrastructure Holding (DIFC), ISQ Asia Infrastructure Investments, Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holdings, and Elpis Ventures Pvt. Ltd., participated in the RFQ bids opened on Wednesday by the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA). These companies will now undergo technical evaluation and in the next stage, RLDA will float the Request for Proposal (RFP) for participants who get qualified in the technical process, the Railways said. The redevelopment of New Delhi Railway Station is expected to incur a capital expenditure of around $680 million and will be developed on a Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT) model. “The redevelopment of the New Delhi Railway Station has attracted interest from various national and international stakeholders. The project will be instrumental in augmenting the local economy, generating employment opportunities and boosting the tourism potential of Delhi-NCR,” Ved Parkash Dudeja, Vice Chairman, RLDA, said in a statement. The project offers multiple revenue streams to the developer and is slated to be completed in around four years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nine-firms-bid-for-railway-station-redevelopment/article33745139.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Legal dept. of DPCC files complaint with NHRC||The Delhi Congress on Wednesday said its Legal and Human Rights Department has filed a complaint before the National Human Rights Commission against the Delhi, U.P. and Haryana governments, and the Delhi Police Commissioner for cutting off water, power, medical and toilet services to the farmers protesting at Delhi borders. The delegation of Legal the Human Rights Department of the DPCC met NHRC officials and apprised them of the plight of the farmers at the Delhi borders. It appealed to the commission to immediately constitute a team to visit the borders and assess the poor condition of the farmers. The team also requested the Commission to issue necessary directions to the Delhi, Haryana and U.P. governments and Delhi Police to give the farmers acccess to basic facilities. “It is inhuman to deny basic facilities to the farmers, who have been protesting since November 23 2020,” Sunil Kumar, who heads the legal team, said. Padyatra The Delhi Congress also said it will be launching a ‘Pol Khol’ padayatra to expose the misdeeds and corruption of the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) governments in Delhi on February 4 as part of its campaign for the forthcoming byelection to the corporation seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/legal-dept-of-dpcc-files-complaint-with-nhrc/article33745133.ece

04 February 2021||Pune,||Kolse-Patil says AMU student leader’s remarks a ‘mistake’||While admitting that Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader Sharjeel Usmani should not have generalised against the Hindu community in his speech made on the occasion of the second edition of the Elgaar Parishad in January, retired Bombay High Court judge B.G. Kolse-Patil, one of the organisers of the event, accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of attempting to defame the event by filing a case against Mr. Usmani. “While his speech was fine, he ought to have used the words ‘Manuwadi’ or ‘Brahmanwadi’ that would have conveyed the kind of patriarchal and casteist mentality we are fighting against instead of generalising the entire Hindu community. That was a mistake. If anybody’s sentiments have been hurt, then I apologise,” said Mr. Kolse-Patil. At the same time, he lashed out against the BJP for demanding action against the AMU student leader. ‘Needless issue’ “The BJP is needlessly making an issue out of this with the sole aim to defame the Elgaar Parishad like they had done the first time around,” he said. The Swargate police had filed an FIR against Mr. Usmani on Tuesday based on a complaint by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha leader Pradeep Gawade. After a number of hiccups, permission was finally given for the conclave to be held on January 30 at the city’s Ganesh Kala Krida Mandir. The event saw the attendance of writer-activist Arundhati Roy and former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, among others. Mr. Kolse-Patil had co-organised the Elgaar Parishad held on December 31, 2017, in Pune’s Shaniwar Wada. More than 250 progressive social outfits, including several left-leaning and Ambedkarite groups across Maharashtra, as well as people like Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh chief Prakash Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Umar Khalid, among others, had participated in the event.

A sudden outflow of hot air from the furnace injured the workers, the company said. District Collector Vivek Bhimanwar said the injured were admitted to two nearby hospitals. Of the 38 injured, eight workers have been shifted to a hospital in Nagpur for specialised treatment. The district administration said the furnace was shut down on Tuesday evening for annual maintenance. “On Tuesday morning, when 50 workers were removing fly ash from the furnace, some of them came in contact with hot air and coal particles,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/38-workers-injured-in-steel-plant-accident-in-wardha/article33745145.ece
04 February 2021||Yangon,||Suu Kyi charged, remanded for 2 weeks||Myanmar’s ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi was formally charged on Wednesday, two days after she was detained in a military coup, as calls for civil disobedience to oppose the putsch gathered pace. The Southeast Asian nation was plunged back into direct military rule when soldiers arrested key civilian leaders in a series of dawn raids on Monday, ending the Army’s brief flirtation with democracy. Ms. Suu Kyi, who has not been seen in public since, won a huge landslide with her National League for Democracy (NLD) last November but the military — whose favoured parties received a drubbing — declared the polls fraudulent. On Wednesday, the NLD’s press officer said the 75-year-old Ms. Suu Kyi was formally charged with an offence under Myanmar’s import and export law, with a court signing off on remand for two weeks. The unusual charge stemmed from a search of her house following her arrest in which walkie-talkies were discovered, according to a leaked police charging document seen by reporters. A similarly unorthodox charge under the country’s disaster management law against President Win Myint revolved around him allegedly breaching anti-coronavirus measures by meeting voters on the campaign trail. With soldiers and armoured cars back on the streets of major cities, the takeover has not been met by any large street protests. But signs of public anger and plans to resist have begun to flicker. The new government has already issued a warning telling people not to say or post anything that might “encourage riots or an unstable situation”. On Wednesday, the NLD announced the military had committed “unlawful acts” in the coup’s aftermath, raiding their party offices across the country and seizing documents and computers. International censure The actions have been met with a growing chorus of international condemnation. On Tuesday, the State Department formally designated the takeover as a coup, meaning the U.S. cannot assist the Myanmar government. Any impact will be mainly symbolic, as almost all assistance goes to non-government entities and Myanmar’s military was already under U.S. sanctions over its brutal campaign against the Rohingya minority. The Group of Seven largest developed economies condemned the coup on Wednesday and said the election result must be respected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/suu-kyi-charged-remanded-for-2-weeks/article33744803.ece
04 February 2021||Washington,||Joe Biden’s Homeland Security chief confirmed||Joe Biden's immigration reform push received a boost on Tuesday when the Senate confirmed his pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, as the U.S. President seeks to roll back Donald Trump’s hardline policies. Cuban-born Alejandro Mayorkas, confirmed on a modestly bipartisan vote, becomes the first Latino and the first immigrant to head up DHS. His approval gives the expansive agency its first permanent leadership in nearly two years, and came ahead of Mr. Biden’s signing of three executive orders aimed at streamlining immigration, including an effort to reunite children separated from their parents at the border with Mexico. They are a follow-up to the executive orders that Mr. Biden signed on his first day in office as he takes aim at U.S. immigration policy after four years of Mr. Trump’s ‘America First’ approach. ‘Eliminating bad policy’ “I’m not making new law, I’m eliminating bad policy,” Mr. Biden said as he signed the orders. The latest measures do not address the status of some 11 million undocumented immigrants living in legal limbo, which hinges on whether Mr. Biden can persuade enough congressional Republicans to back a Bill offering them a path to citizenship. The new action by the Democratic President is aimed at streamlining the U.S. immigration process, officials said, with Mr. Biden to order a review of all the legal obstacles to immigration and integration put in place under Mr. Trump. “The review will likely lead to dramatic changes in policies,” according to a senior government official, who said the goal is “to restore faith in our legal immigration system, and promote integration of Americans”. “President Trump was so focused on the (Mexico border) wall that he did nothing to address the root cause of why people are coming to our southern border,” the official said. “It was a limited, wasteful and naive strategy, and it failed.”  “We are going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families...,” Mr. Biden said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/joe-bidens-homeland-security-chief-confirmed/article33744798.ece
04 February 2021||Yangon,||Medics lead sprouting civil disobedience calls||Calls for a civil disobedience campaign in Myanmar gathered pace on Wednesday as the United States formally declared the military’s takeover a coup and vowed further penalties for the Generals behind the putsch.  Doctors and medical staff at multiple hospitals across the country announced that they were donning red ribbons and walking away from all non-emergency work to protest against the coup. “Our main goal is to accept only the government we elected,” Aung San Min, head of a 100-bed hospital in Gangaw district, said. Some medical teams posted pictures on social media wearing red ribbons — the colours of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy — and raising a three-finger salute, a protest gesture used by democracy activists in Thailand. “My protest starts today by not going to the hospital... I have no desire to work under the military dictatorship,” said Nor Nor Wint Wah, a doctor in Mandalay. Activists were announcing their campaigns on a Facebook group called “Civil Disobedience Movement” which by Wednesday afternoon had more than 1,50,000 followers within 24 hours of its launch. The clatter of pots and pans — and the honking of car horns — also rang out across Yangon on Tuesday evening after calls for protest went out on social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/medics-lead-sprouting-civil-disobedience-calls/article33744802.ece
04 February 2021||London,||British-Iranian academic says he fled Iran while out on bail||A British-Iranian academic said on Wednesday that he fled Iran across a mountain border after being sentenced to nine years in jail for collaborating with a hostile government. Kameel Ahmady, a social anthropologist studying female genital mutilation and child marriage in Iran, told the BBC and The Guardian newspaper that he escaped while on bail after being sentenced, as he feared he would not see his young son again. “I just simply left. I packed my bag with shaving kit, a few books of mine and a laptop and I think pyjamas... and warm clothes,” he said. After being detained for suspected links with foreign intelligence services, he spent three months in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where he said he was subjected to “so-called white torture, a psychological pressure they put on you”. He was then released on bail and later sentenced in December last year and fined €600,000 for receiving “illegitimate funds” and working on projects with “subversive institutions", Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported. British media reported that he escaped while on bail pending his appeal. He described the journey as “very cold, very long, very dark and very scary".||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-iranian-academic-says-he-fled-iran-while-on-bail/article33744799.ece
04 February 2021||Wuhan,||WHO team visits Wuhan lab at centre of speculation||World Health Organization investigators on Wednesday visited a research centre in the Chinese city of Wuhan that has been the subject of speculation about the origins of the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, with one member saying they had intended to meet key staff and press them on critical issues. The WHO team’s visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology was a highlight of their mission to gather data and search for clues as to where the virus originated and how it spread. “We’re looking forward to meeting with all the key people here and asking all the important questions that need to be asked,” zoologist and team member Peter Daszak said, according to footage run by Japanese broadcaster TBS. Reporters followed the team to the high security facility, but as with past visits, there was little direct access to team members, who have given scant details of their discussions and visits thus far. The team left after around three hours without speaking to waiting journalists. At a daily briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the experts also held talks Wednesday with experts from Huazhong Agricultural University. “It should be noted that virus traceability is a complex scientific issue, and we need to provide sufficient space for experts to conduct scientific research,” Mr. Wang said. “China will continue to cooperate with WHO in an open, transparent and responsible manner, and make its contribution to better prevent future risks and protect the lives and health of people in all countries."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-team-visits-wuhan-lab-at-centre-of-speculation/article33744807.ece

U.S. President Joe Biden has voiced support for returning to the accord, from which Donald Trump exited, but has insisted that Tehran first resume full compliance and consider expanding the deal beyond the nuclear issue. Iran’s regional arch rival, Saudi Arabia, has also called for a role in any future talks on the agreement. “No clause of the JCPOA will change. Know this. And no one will be added to the JCPOA,” Mr. Rouhani said at a televised Cabinet meeting, using the deal’s official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “This is the agreement. If they want it, everyone come into compliance. If they don’t, they can go live their lives,” he said. Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA and imposed crippling sanctions on Iran in 2018, maintaining a policy of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic republic. Iran a year later responded by gradually suspending its compliance with most of its key nuclear commitments in the deal, under which it was promised economic relief for limits on its nuclear programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/irans-rouhani-rules-out-changes-to-nuclear-deal/article33744801.ece
04 February 2021||Washington,||U.S. extends New START nuclear treaty with Russia||U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on Wednesday extended the New START nuclear treaty with Russia by five years, saying it hoped to prevent an arms race despite rising tensions with Moscow. One day before the treaty was set to expire, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was extending New START by the maximum allowed time of five years. “President Biden pledged to keep the American people safe from nuclear threats by restoring U.S. leadership on arms control and nonproliferation,” Mr. Blinken said in a statement. “The United States is committed to effective arms control that enhances stability, transparency and predictability while reducing the risks of costly, dangerous arms races.” Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on legislation extending the accord on Friday, meaning that the treaty — signed by then-President Barack Obama in 2010 — will run until February 5, 2026. The last remaining arms reduction pact between the former Cold War rivals, New START caps to 1,550 the number of nuclear warheads that can be deployed by Moscow and Washington. China’s arsenal Former President Donald Trump’s administration tore up previous agreements with Moscow and unsuccessfully sought to expand New START to cover China.

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Weighing in on the Biden presidency||Dispelling very real concerns that existed about disruption of the Inauguration ceremony, Joseph R. Biden Jr was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20. Memories of the unprecedented events a fortnight earlier, when unruly mobs ran amuck in the Capitol building, seemed to haunt not only those present at the ceremony but also the world at large; Washington had been turned into a fortress for the event. Ultimately, democracy triumphed. Celebration of democracy In his Inaugural Address, President Biden struck the right note, delivering a message of unity and hope, while not ignoring the enormous challenges the nation faced. His declaration that the nation was celebrating the triumph of a cause — the cause of democracy was most timely. Among Mr. Biden’s strengths are that he detests bigotry, and abhors identity politics. He tends to be idealistic, and is deeply committed to democratic values. He is a multilateralist, unlike his predecessor, Donald Trump.  As the ultimate Beltway insider, he knows better than most, that opposition to many of his ideas and views exist just beyond the horizon. Also, that in seeking to restore the prestige of America’s democracy and revive its economy, he would face many obstacles. He has, however, chosen to gamble on the throw of the dice by issuing a spate of Executive Orders, almost immediately intended to give expression to his initiatives, and also by announcing a series of initial measures which are, as likely as not, to provoke a great deal of opposition. Among these are his proposed $1.9 trillion relief plan to stem the novel coronavirus pandemic, his proposed expansive unemployment benefits package, and raising of the minimum wage, etc.  Policy reset and China The new President would very soon come to realise that the global environment today is very different from the one that he knew as Vice-President. A return to erstwhile Obama-era policies may, hence, prove inadequate. The world has moved on and several policies will need a reset. The changed scenario, notwithstanding, under President Biden, one can expect the U.S. to rescind the ‘militarisation’ of foreign policy reverting to erstwhile traditional diplomacy. Opportunities for a fresh look at many contentious foreign policy issues could well open up as a result, incorporating elements of both competition and cooperation.  The acid test of this would be on how to deal with China. Rising China is not merely the single most serious challenge the U.S. faces at present, but it poses a diplomatic, economic and technological threat to U.S. pre-eminence. Persisting with old-time remedies such as devising an inclusive security architecture in Asia to check an expanding China threat in East Asia could prove counterproductive. Few countries in Asia are willing to line up against neighbouring China. This would, thereafter, beg the question as to whether the U.S. should persist with confrontation or attempt conciliation. If the latter, it would require the U.S. to soft-pedal its present antagonistic posture towards China. This could well have global implications.  Next, would be on how best to deal with Russia. The depth of antagonism between the two countries, the U.S. and Russia, remains unchanged, aggravated further by the growing strategic congruence between Russia and China. Initial reactions seem to point to U.S. relations with Russia continuing to remain cold, but as Russia flexes its muscles in Eurasia, the U.S. will need to come up with new policy directives, rather than surrender the initiative to the former.  Ties with Europe, West Asia President Biden faces an uphill task when it comes to repairing America’s ties with Europe. The days when Europe and the U..S were tied literally to the same policy cart are over, and Europe is no longer likely to give in to U.S. diktats. Germany is possibly emerging as Europe’s new centre of gravity, dictating Europe’s relations with countries such as China and Russia. Germany, while being highly critical of Russia’s human rights record, including the most recent incident of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, is not hesitating to go ahead with Nord Stream 2, the Russia-led gas pipeline project, despite the U.S.’s objections. The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, again despite the U.S.’s objections, is another indication of Europe’s new independent thinking. European leaders seem more inclined to heed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s warning to global leaders — at the virtual World Economic Forum at Davos, in late January — against ‘starting a new Cold War’, than listen to the U.S.’s Biden.  Problems abound for the new U.S. Administration in West Asia as well. With the civil wars in Syria and Yemen not having ended, the U.S.’s efforts to find a political settlement here will prove difficult. How to deal with a Saudi Arabia that is on a Biden ‘watch-list’, adds to the complexity of dealing with West Asia. The ‘Abraham Accords’, forged during the dying days of the Trump Administration, have further complicated the situation for the incoming Biden government. Dwarfing this would be finding ways and means to deal with the Iran problem, including Iran’s capacity and potential for nuclear mischief. Return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal framework, may not be a realistic option in the wake of the ‘Abraham Accords’, which have imparted a new dynamic and given a sharper edge to the existing Israel-Iran divide.  The outlook for India India’s pious hope is that the Biden Administration will prove even more favourable to it than the preceding Republican Administration. This may, however, turn out to be like the proverbial curate’s egg — good in parts. Mr. Biden as Vice-President was well known to some of us, as having played a critical role as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in pushing through the iconic U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement, and also as a firm proponent of the India-U.S. strategic partnership. Hence, under a Biden Administration, defence and security cooperation between India and the U.S. are likely to be further stepped up. Regional security cooperation is also likely to be further enhanced, at least till such time as U.S.-China relations improve.  However, a Biden Administration will be far less supportive of India on several issues. India must brace itself to heed concerns being expressed about issues such as Kashmir, the so-called travails of the Muslim minority in India, treatment of non-governmental organisations and the like. This may take place behind closed doors, so as not to embarrass the Indian government, but Biden’s commitment to human rights is, by far, much stronger than that of many recent U.S. Presidents. He can be expected to satisfy his traditional constituency even at the risk of upsetting partners such as India.  What may, however, be far more disconcerting for India, if one were to analyse the statements and views of U.S. Secretary of State Antony John Blinken and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is that while the emphasis on a free and open Indo-Pacific region will continue, countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are likely to have a far more critical role to play than India in achieving security in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. could also be less forthcoming in its open support to India and in its ongoing confrontation with China in Eastern Ladakh.  The Afghan plan Unsatisfactory again from an Indian standpoint are the implications of Mr. Biden’s Afghanistan policy. From positions taken by Mr. Sullivan, it would appear that while some rethinking from the positions taken by the Trump Administration is possible, there is little room for India in the latest plans on the table. Mr. Biden is an ardent advocate of ending the war in Afghanistan — dating back to his years as Vice-President — and he is likely to implement this with vigour, not excluding a deal with the Taliban, the possible exit of elected President Ashraf Ghani, and giving Pakistan an even bigger role in acting as the mid-wife of any new arrangement. Not only would this mean that India’s efforts of the past two decades to restore democracy in Afghanistan would come unstuck, but Pakistan would also gain a degree of legitimacy that had been denied to it by the Trump Administration, encouraging it to act with still greater impunity in carrying out terror strikes on India.  From a restricted standpoint, if India were to balance the positive with the negative, and compare the incoming Biden Administration with the previous Trump Administration, the balance sheet could be marginally negative.

He stirs the easy fit between mainstream secular parties and their hold over Muslim voters. In terms of the popularity index in India, he comes close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) triumvirate of Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath. Recently, the AIMIM’s electoral gains in Bihar and Mr. Owaisi’s visits to poll-bound West Bengal (2021) and Uttar Pradesh (in 2022) have revived the debate around his exact intention, emerging Muslim voting patterns and their implications for the BJP and its rivals. Mr. Owaisi’s national avatar is a conjunction of the political dynamics that were induced by the Sachar Committee report and the Batla House encounter case, wherein while political Hindutva was on the decline, the interplay of the backwardness of Muslims and their insecurities exposed the failures of secular mainstream parties in catering to the community’s aspirations. This created a secular paradox, where, comforted with the decline of the BJP and the electoral ascendency of the Congress and other regional parties, many Muslim outfits and leaders blamed secular parties for failing Muslims. Thus began a new, although cluttered, phase of the community’s experiments with Muslim parties and a growing clamour for more representation. The Peace Party of India and the Rashtriya Ulama Council in U.P., the AIUDF in Assam, and the popular resonance of the Pasmanda movement led by Ali Anwar Ansari in Bihar, and, since 2012, that of the AIMIM in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bihar, U.P., and now in West Bengal, point to the churn within the Muslim community. Here, it is important to note that initially, the AIMIM had its limitations. Firstly, it was just a city-based party. Secondly, until the 2004 Andhra Pradesh Assembly poll, the party’s electoral tally had plateaued at a maximum of just four seats. Thirdly, whenever the party tried to venture outside Hyderabad — like in the 1989 and 1994 Assembly elections, where it contested 35 and 20 seats respectively and forfeited its deposit on 28 and 15 seats — it fared poorly. Thus, Mr. Owaisi had the ardent task of strengthening the party’s foothold in its home turf before venturing outside. Hence, he chose the safe path of aligning with the UPA and defended the Congress in 2008 in the wake of the confidence vote sought by the Manmohan Singh-government after the Left Front withdrew support over the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal. National ambitions By 2009, two factors were helping Mr. Owaisi. His parliamentary interventions established him as an eloquent spokesperson for the Muslim question at the national level, and the delimitation exercise making more Assembly constituencies in Hyderabad, like Malakpet and Nampally (previously Asifnagar AC), Muslim-dominated seats, raised the electoral tally of the AIMIM, thereby empowering Mr. Owaisi at the regional level. This fuelled his national ambitions. By 2012, the party had set its eyes on two neighbouring States — Maharashtra and Karnataka — and particularly regions that were part of the Hyderabad State during the Nizam’s rule and had significant Muslim populations. A significant breakthrough for the party’s national ambitions came in October 2012, when the AIMIM won 11 of the 25 seats it contested in the Nanded municipal polls in eastern Maharashtra. Now, Mr. Owaisi followed the template of the secular paradox theory — accusing the Congress of favouring Hindu communal forces and acting against the interests of the Muslims, he withdrew support from the Congress government in Andhra Pradesh and at the Centre. A closer look at Mr. Owaisi’s political moves reveals his calculations. In his quest to find an alternative to the BJP and political Hindutva in future, he is working towards the creation of a national third front, a non-Congress, non-BJP alliance, wherein AIMIM would be an indispensable part, acting as a magnetic pull for minority votes away from traditional claimants like the Congress and other parties. For instance, in 2018, Mr. Owaisi supported the JD(S) over the Congress in Karnataka; in Maharashtra in 2014 and 2019, he targeted the Congress and the NCP more than the BJP. The same template was repeated in 2015 and 2020 in Bihar and in 2017 in Uttar Pradesh. Now, in West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee are the prime targets, and predictably, the Samajwadi Party, the BSP and the Congress would be in Mr. Owaisi’s line of fire in the run-up to the 2022 U.P. Assembly election. Political psychology No wonder, parties that are at the receiving end of Mr. Owaisi’s politics label him as being hand-in-glove with the BJP. However, the underlying reason for Mr. Owaisi’s attack on mainstream secular parties is a necessary evil he must embrace. The seats AIMIM aims to win in every State happen to be minority-dominated constituencies mostly controlled by these parties. Wresting those seats leaves Mr. Owaisi with no other option but to train his guns at them rather than the BJP. However, navigating the Muslim electorates’ maze is also contingent on the community’s political psychology. Let’s take three states: Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. In Uttar Pradesh alone, in the Meerut-Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur region, one finds castes like Muley Jats, Tyagi Muslims, and Gujjar Muslims, besides the Sheikhs, Sayyids, Quraishis and others; in Rohilkhand region, the Turks, Pathans, Saifis, Ansaris, etc., maintain their caste identifications; in Braj, particularly in Aligarh town, the upper-caste Pathans, who have lost their political clout, are present in pockets; further, in the Poorvanchal region, both south and north of the Ghaghra river, the OBC Ansari Muslims constitute a majority but lack political representation. In Bihar, the OBC Ansari Muslims are politicised and dominate the  Bhojpuri- and Mithila-speaking districts; in the Seemanchal region, where the AIMIM recently made electoral gains, the rivalry among the upper-caste Surjapuris and OBC Kulhaiya and Shershahvadi Muslims is well-known. Further, in parts of north-Bengal like Coochbehar, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, the Nashya Shaikh Muslims, who are also found in Dhubri, Kokrajhar and Goalpara districts of lower Assam, have a significant presence; similarly, in districts like Dinajpur and north Malda, the Muslim universe mirrors the composition of Seemanchal Bihar, ie., the Surjapuris and Shershahvadis; in south Bengal, while a majority of Muslims identify themselves as Sheikhs, they fall in the OBC category and are divided along sectarian and religious lines of being either the followers of Furfura Sharif or of the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind. In this context, the Muslim psychology is about accentuating these internal differences when the fear of an aggressive Hindutva discourse is not the prime factor affecting their minds. However, when elections are polarised and the fear of the BJP’s imminent victory is paramount, Muslims close ranks and vote for mainstream secular parties. Hence, it can be expected that in the 2021 West Bengal election or the 2022 Uttar Pradesh election, the aggressive Hindutva push and the prospect of a BJP victory may ensure that Muslims would reject Mr. Owaisi and consolidate behind the traditional claimants. In the meantime, the AIMIM chief would keep analysts guessing.

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||No to vaccine nationalism, yes to global cooperation||Since the worldwide inoculation process is going strong, vaccine diplomacy has become a hot topic. As this pandemic has spared no country and everyone needs access to vaccines, how is vaccine production and distribution being managed? While the leading and advanced countries have been mindlessly selfish in amassing approved vaccines, it is the Global South countries, India and China, which have provided a ray of hope to most countries. Advance purchase contracts In their quest for ensuring vaccine security, a report by The New York Times , based on the data on vaccine contracts compiled by Duke University (https://nyti.ms/3pKYm69), shows that the advance purchase contracts made by some advanced countries for potential vaccines would vaccinate their population many times: the European Union, two times, the United States and the United Kingdom, four times, and Canada, six times. And, 82% of Pfizer’s production in 2021 and 78% of Moderna’s have already been advance purchased by rich countries. The expectation that an early vaccination will bring back normalcy and a required push to economic growth fuelled many advanced countries to engage in vaccine battles. The arguments of public good and global cooperation have gone out of the window now.  While advanced countries have turned their back on the need of poor countries to access COVID-19 vaccines, India has displayed empathy to their needs. India has taken a position that a significant percentage of the approved doses will be permitted for exports. While its exports to neighbouring counties will be under grant mode, initial shipment of vaccines to least developed countries will be free of cost. And, shipments of vaccines from India have already started reaching different parts of the developing world. Brazil has received 2 million doses of vaccine from India (as of January 23). While India is in its first phase of vaccination to cover health-care workers, exports from India are helping other countries also in initiating phase one of their vaccination programme — a gesture well-appreciated globally. In a democracy, one can expect the backlash of sending vaccines abroad without vaccinating its population. Nevertheless, India’s approach only reinforces the need of having coordinated global efforts in bringing COVID-19 under control. This response manifests India’s unstinted commitment to global development and has consolidated its name as the world’s pharmacy. Although China has also been enthusiastic in promising vaccines and their delivery, the lukewarm response by countries such as Nepal has slowed down the ambition of China. The release of efficacy data in Brazil raises concerns about the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine. Keep track of SDGs The attitude of India towards vaccinating the populations in the poorer countries has generated discussion in the richer countries about the necessity for more proactive measures to roll out vaccines to the developing nations. The reversal of progress on many Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs (https://sdgs.un.org/goals), such as SDG 3 (“Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) could affect the health of the world population, and global growth itself. Even before COVID-19, projections have shown that 6% of the global population would be in extreme poverty, which has gone up by 71 million, thereby causing enormous challenges to SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”). According to estimates by the International Monetary Fund, over 50% of emerging markets and developing economies that were converging toward advanced economies per capita income over the last decade are expected to diverge over the 2020-22 period. COVAX as a pathway The COVAX project is a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, an ambitious programme based on funding from high and middle-income countries. Although the funding was not enough for the project, U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to join the project has now raised expectations significantly. However, since high and middle-income countries are buying up large amounts of the vaccine directly from suppliers, the promise by COVAX to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 (https://bit.ly/3cAGSp8) seems to face new challenges. COVAX is a unique case of global cooperation and a strategic shift to enhance global development outcomes. Furthermore, since most of the vaccines are purchased from the global south for developing nations, the COVAX project can draw new pathways for global development. Most of these vaccines are cost-effective and affordable to the global south. For instance, Covishield, the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India costs only $3 per dose; Covaxin is priced at $4.2. A recent study by The Lancet based on Covaxin’s Phase 1 data (https://bit.ly/3ty8wtc) shows tolerable safety outcomes like any other vaccine. The intranasal version of Covaxin, which has been approved for phase I could further facilitate vaccinating the global population. The lower price of the vaccines is what has attracted many commercial buyers globally, including emerging economies such Brazil and South Africa. The ability to produce large volumes of vaccine at an affordable cost underlines India’s importance to developing countries when it comes to drug access. The development of vaccines is a classic story of global cooperation between the North and the South. Unfortunately, the increasing nationalist tendencies of the democratic World during the pandemic have challenged the positive narrative on global cooperation.

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Towards sustainable growth||The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us many lessons. It made us realise that we are a part of nature and emphasised the urgent need to protect the ecological functions of the biosphere we live in. It has unequivocally highlighted how vital the health of the planet is for our individual and collective well-being as well as the growth of our economies. The pandemic has resulted in huge economic losses. Globally, the GDP is expected to contract 2.4% to 8% in 2020. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that the global cost of dealing with the pandemic could be from $8.1 trillion to $15.8 trillion. Preventing such pandemics will cost only a fraction of this amount, estimated at $22.2 billion to $30.7 billion a year, and this is without factoring in the human suffering. We have to recognise that there would not be an economy without the natural environment. Global studies documenting human ecological footprint, the decline in wildlife populations, and the conversion rates of natural ecosystems for other uses, place India among countries experiencing the highest rates of negative change. This increases our vulnerability towards catastrophes, including pandemics. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between human density, richness of biodiversity, and the emergence of zoonotic pathogens of wild origin, which renders India particularly vulnerable. With high human densities — among the highest diversity of mammals in the world — and a saturated interface between humans and wildlife, India is considered to be among the hotspots for zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The WEF’s Global Risks report for 2021 states that environmental risks continue to threaten the global economy. The top five risks are extreme weather, climate action failure, human environmental damage, infectious diseases and biodiversity loss. In terms of impact, infectious diseases top the list, followed by climate action failure. The top two risk response blind spots are climate action failure and biodiversity loss. Our models of development and our notions about them have to change. Destruction of environment should no longer be justified in the name of development. Like all pandemics, COVID-19’s emergence has been entirely driven by unchecked activities in the name of development. Rampant destruction of natural habitats, especially due to mining and infrastructure development, continued expansion and intensification of agriculture and animal husbandry as well as unrestrained consumption have disrupted nature, increased contact between wildlife, livestock, pathogens and people, setting the stage for the pandemic to take hold of our lives. Pandemic risk can be significantly lowered by reducing human activities that drive the loss of biodiversity as it will help prevent the spillover of new diseases. A study by Swiss Re Institute published in 2020 introduces a new biodiversity and ecosystem services index. It found that globally, 20% of countries, including India, have fragile ecosystems. It also states that 55% of the global GDP depends on high-functioning biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is evident that policymakers should factor biodiversity and ecosystems into their economic decision-making. This will accelerate the transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to sustainable, equitable, inclusive and just development models. The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review , commissioned by HM Treasury and released on February 2, 2021, highlights the grave risks faced by the world because of the failure of economics to take into account the rapid degradation of nature. The review stresses the need to find new measures for growth and development to avoid a catastrophic breakdown. The world’s governments need to come up with a form of national accounting that is different from the GDP model, and the new system has to account for the depletion of nature and natural resources. New models The evidence is overwhelming. All budgets need to reduce investments, including subsidies, in activities that will further degrade our natural habitats. By orders of magnitude, we should enhance investment in research in sustainability science. A National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-Being has been approved by the Prime Minister’s Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council. The overarching objectives are to restore and enhance biodiversity, strengthen its sustainable use, generate thousands of green jobs and encourage the Indian public to appreciate the natural and associated cultural treasures that we have collectively inherited. This initiative has the potential to enable India to play a global leadership role in linking conservation with tangible human well-being outcomes.

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Smart walls’ for Indian borders||United States President Joe Biden stopped the construction of the much-publicised “border wall” between the U.S. and Mexico as part of a series of executive actions, in a development that was long-awaited. It was confirmed, however, that an alternative has been offered — a ‘smart’ wall that replaces the physical and armed patrolling with advanced surveillance tech is the proposed future of border security now. The ‘smart wall’ technology could solve border security issues without the need for a physical barrier. The wall would use sensors, radars, and surveillance technology to detect and track border break-ins, and technology capable of performing the most difficult tasks dedicated to border security. Not a new concept The concept is not new and the novelty of it cannot be directly associated with Mr. Biden. Interestingly, the U.S.-Mexico border wall proposed by Donald Trump envisaged this concept. A technology firm was sought to be hired by the Trump administration, and it was indicated that artificial intelligence shall be used at a novel scale to complement the steel barrier (border wall) project of Mr. Trump. It was stated that hundreds of mobile surveillance towers would be deployed, and along with them, the complete system of a virtual wall would consist of a radar satellite, computer-equipped border-control vehicles, control sensors and underground sensors. Along with surveillance towers and cameras, thermal imaging would be used, which would help in the detection of objects. The system would even be capable of distinguishing between animals, humans, and vehicles, and then sending updates to handheld mobile devices of the U.S. patrol agents. A question that now arises is whether such a project can be undertaken to secure Indian borders. India has been struggling with the problem of terrorists and smugglers infiltrating into the country and efforts are ongoing to secure our borders and curb cross-border infiltration. Therefore, it is proposed that it is high time we start envisaging the use of technology to help India secure its borders. Other benefits A critical factor that must be considered to enable the usage of such a system along Indian borders is that the terrain in the region is rugged, and, furthermore, not even clearly defined. Hence, erecting fences, walls or any physical structures is extremely difficult. A “smart” wall, however, makes use of systems that would be designed in such a way that they can operate even in rugged areas. Imperatively, in the U.S., various other benefits, such as cost-effectiveness, less damage to the environment, fewer land seizures, and speedier deployment are being noted that give the “smart wall” concept an edge over traditional physical borders. Notably, such a system, even if not feasible for our long boundaries, may still be deployed to enhance critical security establishments of the country and complement the already-existing physical fencing and walls. The attack on the Pathankot Air Force base highlighted that often, it may become difficult to secure establishments due to their vast size. Further, it is imperative for Indian armed forces to be well-equipped and simultaneously have the latest technological advantage over its enemies. Experts must explore this idea to effectively counter the problem of cross-border infiltration. Is it unfathomable to deploy a security system that clubs technology with traditional set-ups due to terrain and other problematic factors? This is a question for Digital India to answer.

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Urban visions||With a clear focus on expansion of Metro Rail and bus services through Central funding, Budget 2021 has recognised a core component of urbanisation. Comfortable, safe and affordable commuting has well-recognised multiplier effects for the economy and more generally for public health, although COVID-19 has had the perverse effect of driving people away to the safety of personal car and two-wheeler bubbles. There is little doubt that when the pandemic is under control, more people will return to clean and green mass mobility. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of Central funding of Rs. 1,957 crore, Rs. 63,246 crore and Rs. 14,788 crore for the Kochi, Chennai and Bengaluru Metro projects, respectively, gives these big cities greater certainty that they can meet targets. Less certain, however, is the impact of the proposed Rs. 18,000 crore plan to augment public bus transport using a PPP model that will enable private sector players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses. India’s ratio of buses to population is a low 1.2 per 1,000 people, compared to 8.6 in Thailand and 6.5 in South Africa, although some States like Karnataka are well ahead of the national average, as per NITI Aayog data. Licensed private urban bus services remain a politically sensitive topic in many States, where State monopolies coexist with unregulated paratransit, and it will take a major effort to convince them that a bus renaissance is a good post-pandemic recovery strategy. The amended Motor Vehicles Act has provisions for the Centre to take the lead here. The challenge of urbanisation goes beyond standalone interventions such as Metro and bus system grants. State governments, which retain effective control over urban development rather than city administrations, have failed to operationalise the umbrella authorities to regulate transport. Common mobility cards that would help citizens use bus, train and feeder networks seamlessly were largely in pilot project mode even before the pandemic. There is valid criticism that the existing paradigm is one of “exclusionary urbanisation”, which makes Metro and bus services expensive for the majority, particularly for those forced to live in the suburbs due to housing costs, and sometimes making the per kilometre cost of using a two-wheeler more attractive. Moreover, Census 2011 showed that the number of Census Towns, which are urban for census purposes but not named urban local bodies, grew tremendously over a decade. They lack access to funding, infrastructure and capacity to meet the needs of large populations even now. Enhanced ambition, therefore, requires the Centre to work with State governments to integrate key areas with its transport vision, such as affordable inner-city housing, including rental projects, access to civic services and health care, and enhanced sustainability, greenery and walkability. All these are covered by Central budgetary schemes for cities. Only integration can bring about inclusive urbanisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/urban-visions/article33744777.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||All to play for||A rivalry going back to 1932 will get a fresh chapter as India and England gear up to play the first Test at Chennai’s M.A. Chidambaram Stadium from Friday. The first game of a four-match series would eventually pave the way for the frenzied thrills of five Twenty20Is and three ODIs in a long tour that will conclude on March 28. Besides the angst caused by essential COVID-19 protocols, the bio-bubble and the need to play the first contest behind closed doors, there is a lot at stake for the teams. Australia’s postponement of its tour to South Africa, pitch-forked New Zealand to the World Test Championship final at Lord’s in June. India and England will now tussle for a berth in the summit-clash. India has to secure this series and win a minimum of two Tests and for England, Joe Root’s men have to triumph in three matches. Fresh from its stunning 2-1 Test series triumph in Australia, and bolstered with the return of regular skipper Virat Kohli and key players such as R. Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma and Hardik Pandya, India holds the edge. That a second-string outfit under the unflappable Ajinkya Rahane, upset the more fancied Aussies at Brisbane will hold the Indians in good stead especially in their backyard replete with the tales of spin and other turns. History might suggest home dominance, but India would remember that over the last four decades, some of its strong outfits emerged second-best to the visitors from the Old Blighty. In the 1984-85 and 2012-13 seasons, England stunned India. For many of those at Chennai’s ground, Chepauk in 1985, the memory still rankles: seamer Neil Foster’s match-haul of 11 wickets and double tons by Mike Gatting and Graeme Fowler that ambushed Sunil Gavaskar’s men. India’s present coach Ravi Shastri featured in that match. Cut to the present, Root’s troops would step in with the extra confidence gleaned from the 2-0 verdict in the two Tests against Sri Lanka at Galle. The captain himself was in prime form — Root struck a 228 and 186 — and the bowling arsenal has the pace troika of James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Jofra Archer while Ben Stokes lends the x-factor. Yet, it is India that would step out with a halo in the city on the Coromandel Coast. A strong batting unit and a Bumrah-headlined attack with Ashwin’s guiles could test England’s resolve. The last time the rivals clashed in Chennai (2016), Karun Nair’s triple ton and Ravindra Jadeja’s bowling exploits humbled the visitors. This time around, India would seek fresh heroes while the cricket caravan moves from Chennai to Ahmedabad and Pune.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/all-to-play-for/article33744778.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Lessons of the hijacking (From an editorial)||If any doubts had existed anywhere about Pakistan’s active complicity in the hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane and in the acts of sabotage and subversion witnessed now and again in Kashmir, Pakistan itself has cleared them. The government-controlled Pakistan Radio’s approbation of the hijacking, Islamabad granting asylum to the two air pirates and its allowing the plane to be blown up — and all this in flagrant violation of the U.N. General Assembly’s resolution, to which it had pledged unqualified support, condemning plane hijackings and calling on all governments not to encourage such crimes and to return the snatched plane and cargo to the owner-country — should convince even the most naïve among Pakistan’s apologists of what that country is upto and what one can expect from it in future. Now that all the wraps are off, it is upto the Indian authorities to take steps to prevent any further acts of air piracy and sabotage.It is obvious that both the Central and State Governments have so far not been vigilant enough. The loyalty of one of the hijackers, Qureshi, was obviously suspect for some time and yet nothing seems to have been done to checkmate him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/lessons-of-the-hijacking-from-an-editorial/article33744788.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Interest on PF contributions of over Rs. 2.5 lakh must in I-T filing’||Employees making contributions of more than Rs. 2.5 lakh a year into their Provident Fund (PF) accounts, will have to include the interest on the investments exceeding Rs. 2.5 lakh in their annual income starting 2021-22 and file tax returns accordingly, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chief P.C. Mody told The Hindu.  The Union Budget has proposed tax on interest income on PF contributions exceeding Rs. 2.5 lakh a year. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that some people were investing as much as Rs. 1 crore each month into PF and suggested it was unfair that they get tax concessions. “The interest portion is calculable on a year-to-year basis... so that is taxable on your calculations in that particular year,” Mr. Mody said. “If I am contributing into the GPF [General Provident Fund for government employees], I know how much interest I have received that year. That should be brought to tax in that very year. That is very simple, it’s just like bank interest,” he said. “So, at the time of filing tax returns, you have to factor in the interest which you are receiving on that. It is for both the government employee and private sector employees,” he added. Analysts said the change throws up uncertainties. “It will result in implementation difficulties given the design of Employees’ PF,” said Amit Gopal, principal, Mercer Consulting. “PF being an interest-bearing product with annual compounding, tracking interest across years that is attributable to only employee contributions will be a challenge,” Mr. Gopal added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/interest-on-pf-contributions-of-over-rs-25-lakh-must-in-i-t-filing/article33744760.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Small tax disputes account for substantial pendency’||The government’s focus in Budget 2021-22 is to make tax compliance easy and simple so as to boost voluntary compliance even while cracking down on tax evaders, said Central Board of Direct Taxes Chairperson P.C. Mody . Excerpts:  You have assumed a significantly higher tax buoyancy from corporate income tax. Could you give us a sense of the target-setting exercise? The current year’s projections are very realistic, so are the projections for next year. But the pandemic made this an exceptional year, so a revision was required and was made. Based on that, next year’s projection has been made. One has also to factor in the ease of compliance that has been brought about, the certainty of the tax culture. You are getting better tax administration and processes, with information you have entered in your own portal to enable you to file your returns properly and conveniently. All of this together should create an environment that the tax liability gets discharged by each individual, corporate and entity, in a correct and proper manner. The synergy in exchange of information between different arms (of the government) is part of this exercise. On the one hand, you are trying to create an atmosphere for voluntary compliance, and on the other, you are not sparing the persons trying to game the system. Together, this should bring in the buoyancy. Could the decision to limit reopening of tax assessments to 3 years from 6 pose a challenge to the department? No. It has to be seen from two perspectives. First, trying to give some certainty to the taxpayer so he should not have the lurking fear of when his tax matters may get resolved. Yes, it does bring a challenge of completing things at our end much earlier, but with the help of technology, that is possible. I have kept the option that if the evasion is of Rs. 50 lakh and above, I can review it up to 10 years, but again with a filter — with the approval of the highest person in the field and proper application of mind. Whenever I have the occasion to revisit a taxpayer’s case, I give him the reasons upfront, take his reply and in the event of a non-satisfactory reply, only then will I go for this. It’s clearly defined. How will the dispute resolution committees for small taxpayers work? How much do such disputes account for in the overall pending disputes? It will be a dispersed set up, as you can’t expect taxpayers to be moving to and fro. But it would be again a faceless mechanism. Faceless is the new normal. Out of my current pendency, a substantial portion of the tax disputes are in this category. Really speaking, they didn’t have an alternate mechanism except for the appellate process. The whole idea is to make the process of compliance for the taxpayer as easy and simple as possible so as to promote voluntary compliance. How many cases have been resolved through the larger tax dispute resolution scheme, Vivad Se Vishwas? It’s been a great success. I have so far received almost 1.18 lakh forms, resolving 1.32 lakh disputes with a quantum of nearly Rs. 95,000 crore. This entire month is still left. [Those] who have not yet made a decision, can still go for this. This is almost one-fourth of the total 5 lakh such cases. Citizens aged 75 years or older don’t have to file tax returns in some cases. How will this work? A senior citizen normally has pension income, and out of that if he has been able to save something, he will put it in a financial instrument like a fixed deposit. Both attract TDS. So once TDS has been done, there is no need for a paper return. The caveat is, it has to be from the same bank. If there are deposits in multiple banks, then you will have to do the calculation because banks don’t have that infrastructure.  The whole idea is to make the process of compliance easy and simple||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/small-tax-disputes-account-for-substantial-pendency/article33744765.ece
04 February 2021||MUMBAI,||‘India’s weak fiscal position to remain a key credit challenge’||The Union Budget’s focus on higher capital expenditure, financial sector reforms and asset sales would help to stimulate growth and supply broad-based credit support, but India’s weak fiscal position would remain a key credit challenge compared with its rating peers, Moody’s Investors Service said. The budget projects a narrowing of the central government’s fiscal deficit to 6.8% of GDP in fiscal 2022 from an estimated 9.5% in fiscal 2021. “We previously expected a smaller central government deficit target of about 5.5% of GDP for fiscal 2022 down from around 7.5% of GDP in fiscal 2021,” Moody’s said on Wednesday. “However, compared with previous budgets, the gap between our forecasts and the government’s largely reflects increased transparency on subsidy spending and more credible overall assumptions,” it added. The ratings agency said the widening of the deficit in fiscal 2021 was driven almost entirely by expenditure to support Indian households and the economy from the pandemic shock. “Given India’s very high debt burden...this gradual pace of consolidation will prevent any material strengthening in the government’s fiscal position over the medium term, unless nominal GDP growth were to pick up sustainably to historically very high rates,” the credit ratings agency added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/indias-weak-fiscal-position-to-remain-a-key-credit-challenge/article33744763.ece

04 February 2021||Chennai,||‘We have to play really well to beat England’||Big things come in small packages. Ajinkya Rahane is rather diminutive but packs a hefty cricketing punch. Whether slicing open an attack with rapier-like strokes — cutting, pulling, or drilling the ball through the gaps with a surgeon’s precision — or leading the Indian team with tactical nous and steely resilience, Rahane does it all and more. After heroically captaining India in the last three Tests Down Under for a remarkable 2-1 Test series triumph following the disastrous 36 all out in the first Test, Rahane is settling in his role as the vice-captain. “Virat is the captain. My job as vice-captain is to visualise the flow of the game and offer suggestions to Virat whenever he asks me,” he said modestly during an interactive chat with the media on Wednesday. Not complacent The first Test against England looms on Friday at Chepauk and Rahane said the Indian team was not complacent after the high of Australia. “Australia was awesome and I remember the celebrations that went into the night at Brisbane. But we have to live in the present and England is a very good side. We have to play really well to beat them,” he said. The 32-year-old Rahane has 4,471 runs in 69 Tests at 42.58 and most of his contributions have come when his team needed him to score. Always flexible for the team’s cause, Rahane is making the adjustments needed to bat No. 5 again, with Kohli returning to the side. “It should not be difficult, it is a mental switch,” he said. In a team-game you have to play different roles and at different slots and Rahane is someone who believes in togetherness. “It is not about individuals. You have to play together as a team.” He said the Indian players could stay for long periods in the bubble because “We enjoy each other’s company.” More so on a pitch that offers turn. Asked about the surface for the first Test, Rahane replied, “There will be spin. We will play to our strengths.” England won the recent series against Sri Lanka 2-0 but its batsmen struggled against the left-arm spin of Lasith Embuldenia, who picked up 15 wickets in the two Tests. Under the circumstances, would India play left-arm spinning all-rounder Axar Patel as a like-for-like replacement for Ravindra Jadeja in the first Test? The vice-captain kept his cards close to his chest, not revealing the team composition. The indications are that Washington Sundar will play here in a three-pronged spin attack after his match-winning all-round display in the pulsating decider at the Gabba. Rahane revealed that the mercurial Hardik Pandya was batting and bowling in the nets. Playing as much with his head as his willow, Rahane is up for the English challenge. He’s a big guy in a small package.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-have-to-play-really-well-to-beat-england/article33744880.ece

04 February 2021||CHATTOGRAM,||Shadman and Warrican shine||Opener Shadman Islam struck a patient half-century and left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican claimed three wickets for 48 as Bangladesh and the West Indies shared the honours on the opening day of the first Test on Wednesday. The hosts ended the day on 242 for five, with Shadman leading the way with 59 off 154 balls — and several others chipping in with useful knocks. Mushfiqur Rahim (38), Mominul Haque (26) and Najmul Hossain (25) all got modest starts after Bangladesh opted to bat first, but could not march on. The visiting bowlers managed to strike whenever a partnership started to flourish, keeping Bangladesh in check. Kemar Roach made the breakthrough when he bowled opener Tamim Iqbal. Warrican claimed the first of his three wickets by setting a trap for Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque, who obliged by lofting a catch to John Campbell at midwicket. It ended Mominul’s promising 53-run third-wicket stand with Shadman, who followed his captain shortly after, falling to the same bowler.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shadman-and-warrican-shine/article33744871.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Despite fund-cut, Ministry happy with budget||Ignoring the budget allocation for the current financial year citing the pandemic, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju chose to compare the figures for 2021-22 with those of 2019-20 and sounded pleased despite the truncated allocation and assured that “there was no dearth of funds for the athletes”. The latest Union Budget held no reason for joy as the Ministry’s allocation was slashed from Rs. 2826.92 crore to Rs. 2,596.14 crore — a decrease of over 8%. However, Sports Secretary Ravi Mittal went to the extent of saying, “We are very happy with the budget.” Rijiju spoke at a hurriedly organised media conference on the sidelines of the inauguration of the FIT India office at Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. This interaction was in line with the Government’s directive to all Ministries to brief the media before Feb. 14 about the available funds for the next financial year. Leaving no opportunity to strike an optimistic note, the Sports Ministry conveniently left out the “ongoing COVID year” and chose to highlight the higher percentage of gains as reflected in the two-year period. Shocking was the assertions made in the briefing pertaining to the “increase” in funding for the Khelo India scheme. The Games could not be held last year due to the pandemic. The figures for Khelo India clearly show a massive cut in funds — from Rs. 890.42 crore last year to Rs. 657.71 this year. But what was highlighted in Wednesday’s briefing was, the allocation which was Rs. 500 crore in 2019-20, at present stood at Rs. 657.71. Even the funds meant for Sports Authority of India provided the Ministry a reason to project a higher percentage of increase. Indeed, the funds provided saw an increase from Rs. 500 crore last year to Rs. 660.41 crore this year. But the Ministry chose to go by the 2019-20 figures of Rs. 450 crore and projected a higher percentage of raise this year. However, the Ministry could not make similar projections in the funds meant for National Sports Federations. The allocation, constant for two previous years at Rs. 245 crore, has been raised to Rs. 280 crore. No doubt, the Ministry can always seek additional funds citing valid reasons during the financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/despite-fund-cut-ministry-happy-with-budget/article33744932.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai City engineers come-from-behind win||For the second time inside four days, there was heartbreak for Kerala Blasters. The men from Kochi went down 2-1 to Mumbai City at the GMC Stadium, Bambolim (Goa), on Wednesday night. There may well have been a sense of deja vu for them; in the previous match, they had gone 2-0 ahead before losing 3-2 to ATK Mohun Bagan. They remain on 15 points and third from the bottom, while Mumbai is sitting pretty on top of the ISL table with 33 points, six ahead of ATK. After Vincente Gomez’s goal put Blasters in front in the first half, Bipin Singh and Adam Le Fondre, from the penalty spot, scored for Mumbai. Dramatic start The game started dramatically, with Blasters winning a corner kick in the opening minute. Before long though, the action moved to the other end of the field, with Mumbai putting considerable pressure on the Blasters defence. Hugo Boumous and Le Fondre combined beautifully to create chances for Mumbai. A superb corner-kick from Sahal Abdul Samad enabled Gomez to come up with a perfect header to beat Mumbai’s hard-working custodian Amrinder Singh for once. That goal separated the teams till the end of the first half that produced some delightful end-to-end football. But just 20 seconds into the second half, Mumbai equalised. Bipin Singh did well to score off a deflection from Costa Nhamoinesu, who had come in the way of Cy Goddard’s attempt. Twentyone minutes later, Mumbai went ahead, as Le Fondre converted the penalty awarded for the charge on him by Costa.   The result: Kerala Blasters 1 (Vincente Gomez 27) lost to Mumbai City 2 (Bipin Singh 46, Adam Le Fondre 67-pen).   Thursday’s match: NEUFC vs FC Goa, 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-city-engineers-come-from-behind-win/article33744935.ece

04 February 2021||Chennai,||First-innings runs very important, says Trott||England batting consultant Jonathan Trott said on Wednesday that big first-innings totals were vital if touring sides wanted to succeed in India, adding that deep batting line-ups helped in this regard. Lucky to have Stokes “It is always a luxury if you can [have a long batting line-up],” Trott said. “But you have got to make sure you have the right options with the ball as well. You are trying to find that balance all the time. Someone like Ben Stokes adds that balance and we are very lucky to have him.  “It is key for all the lower-order batters to make sure they have a good gameplan and chip in and hold up an end. Working with those guys is always enjoyable for me as a batting coach. It is important to make sure they are ready to perform when called upon,” he added. On the lessons learnt from England’s previous Test series in India in 2016, which the touring side lost 4-0, Trott said, “There were some flat wickets. So the first-innings runs are very important. You have to try and be a little bit ahead of the game at the start of the second innings. “Playing catch-up against India, who are so good in their home conditions, is always tough. You have to make sure you start the game well, whether it is with bat or ball. And you have got to be clinical with all the chances you get on the field,” added the former England batsman.  Pope added to squad Meanwhile, the 23-year-old Ollie Pope, who has recovered fully from a shoulder injury that kept him out of the Sri Lanka series, has been added to the England squad. Pope has been training with the English team for the last two days at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium. His fitness was also assessed then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tough-playing-catch-up-in-india-says-trott/article33744882.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vishnu looking to end extended off-season||The tennis world is buzzing with activity, with the fans excited about the Australian Open starting next Monday. However, Olympian Vishnu Vardhan is having ‘an extended off-season’, albeit training very hard on the court and in the gym, as he has been unable to find suitable events to get back into the circuit. “I was planning to compete in a Challenger in South Africa, but the main person in Mumbai fell ill and shut the consulate,” said Vishnu, from his home in Hyderabad. Of course, Vishnu is excited about the tournaments to be held at home, which will serve as good preparation before he steps out for bigger events. “I haven’t played a match for nearly a year,” said Vishnu, stressing the need to get match sharp. Till he gets back on the circuit, Vishnu is looking forward to watching the Indian players and the stars in Melbourne on television.  Vishnu has high hopes on Sumit Nagal, with whom he had a tough ‘physical fight’ on the tennis court when they last played against each other a few years ago. “Sumit has done extraordinary well at the US Open. At the French Open, he had a tricky opponent. He can do well in Melbourne, as the high bounce would suit his forehand. The heat will be an advantage, as Sumit often reduces a tennis match into a physical battle,” said Vishnu. Equally delighted about his erstwhile partner Divij Sharan consolidating his position in the Grand Slams with regular appearances, Vishnu said that Divij had really worked very hard over the years to strengthen his game, and compete very well irrespective of the many partners. “That is one thing I want to learn from Divij. I play with one or two partners. “He has focused on his game and done well despite not having a regular partner. He can do so much better with a good partner,” said Vishnu. Even though he has great respect for Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, Vishnu picked Dominic Thiem as “hard to beat”. He was quick to pick Serena Williams among women, but equally quick to say that the women’s event had become very unpredictable with so many good players.

04 February 2021||MELBOURNE,||No on-court line judges at Australian Open||Players wanting to stare down or glare at a line judge at the Australian Open after a close or contentious call will have difficulty doing so this year, as there won’t be any. In a Grand Slam first, there will be no on-court line judges on any of the tournament courts in an effort to reduce the number of staff on-site during the pandemic. Only players, chair umpires and ball kids will be on the court. Tennis Australia announced on Wednesday the introduction of live electronic line calls, saying movement-activated and pre-recorded voices will be used for the terms “Out”, “Foot Fault” and “Fault” in matches. Live electronic line calling is delivered through remote tracking cameras around the court, automatically sending the audio line calls in real time. “The Australian Open will be the first Grand Slam tournament to introduce live electronic line calling on all courts,” Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley said. The new system should mean fewer challenges of line calls by players, and less time spent reviewing replays on the big stadium screens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-on-court-line-judges-at-australian-open/article33744922.ece

04 February 2021||New Delhi,||Vaughan slams Australia for pulling out of SA tour||Former England skipper Michael Vaughan, on Wednesday, questioned Australia’s decision to postpone its tour of South Africa and expressed doubts if it would have done the same with a powerful cricket nation like India. Cricket Australia announced its decision to postpone the trip to South Africa, citing “unacceptable health and safety risk” in that country because of a fresh COVID-19 outbreak. Vaughan said it was not a good precedent set by Australia. “The Aussies pulling out of the tour of SA is a huge worry for the game... Would they have pulled out of a tour to India is the question ??!!,” Vaughan wrote on his twitter handle. The former captain said the three big cricketing nations — India, England and Australia — should instead help the cricket boards, which are feeling the heat of the pandemic. “It’s so important in these times that the big 3 do everything they can to help out those without the financial clout,” his tweet read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vaughan-slams-australia-for-pulling-out-of-sa-tour/article33744875.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Power of yoga||The Bhagavad Gita brings the realisation of the highest truth within the grasp of each and every individual who is keen to seek it. At every stage of His teaching, Krishna narrows the gap between philosophy and practicality to enable every seeker participate in this quest, said Srimati Sunanda in a discourse. The power of yoga is the fundamental factor in the sphere of spiritual advancement and it pertains to inner life. Krishna shows how this power can be accessed and harnessed with continuous effort and one-pointed determination. All depends on how one learns to guard oneself from the pulls of the body mind intellect to remain with the thoughts of the Truth of Brahman in one’s inner self. This is the state of realisation. It is not attained by mere study and mastery of the Vedas. A course in the Vedas and the Upanishads may make one a Vedic scholar. He may be adept to discuss and debate on the theory of the self or Brahman with much felicity and even hold audiences spell bound. But whether he has realised the truth as an inner experience is the question and he alone can answer it. It is gauged only by each one’s honest self testimony. Rabindranath Tagore’s observation that the world is full of sound scholars but it is rare to find sound men draws attention to the difference between knowledge acquisition and knowledge assimilation. So, when realised souls such as the seers in the Upanishads speak of their awareness of the imperishable Brahman, and state with conviction “I know the Supreme Brahman of effulgence beyond the darkness,” the words ring with the very vision and experience of the Eternal Truth. The imperishable quality of Brahman is to be realised as a truth and not as an utterance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/power-of-yoga/article33744867.ece

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||20 years of Gautham Menon: An interview with the filmmaker on his movies, romance and everything in between||Gautham Vasudev Menon is a pop-culture phenomenon. He grins when I suggest it, like how he grinned a few weeks ago when I told him his début film Minnale, which released on February 2, 2001, was turning 20 — as does his journey in cinema. His tastefully-decorated office in Alwarpet (the same house that was featured in the Av arum Naanum, Avalum Naanum segment of Amazon Prime’s Putham Pudhu Kaalai ) pops with his now-familiar aesthetic in every corner — from the many bookshelves teeming with film literature to a sketched silhouette portrait framed on the wall simply titled ‘Dad’. Apart from a few cursory glances at his email every half hour, I have his undivided attention. “That is because I am always waiting to see if I get a mail from [AR] Rahman sir. It could be anything; the link to a song, ideas for a future project, or what he thinks of my albums with other composers,” he explains. A history of romance You sense that he is itching to work with the Mozart of Madras again. It is not that Gautham has been anything less than busy over the past 12 months. In fact, a case could be made for him being the country’s most productive filmmaker during the pandemic: a slew of music videos and a couple of anthologies hit OTT platforms. “Filmmakers have had such a huge role to play during the pandemic. Entertainment has helped people take their minds off their worries, and I am glad to have been part of it,” he says, adding that he quite enjoyed all the creative challenges that have come his way lately, such as Vaanmagal , his most recent work for the Netflix anthology Paava Kadhaigal . Is Gautham pleased with his evolution as a filmmaker over the years? “The guy who made Vaanmagal is definitely better than the guy who made Minnale in terms of growth, technique, and understanding the medium. But the guy who made Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa is the best. The chemistry I shared with the team and cast during the making, the thought process inhabiting me then... I haven’t been in that space since. Which is why I want to make the sequel.” But back to him being an integral part of Tamil pop-culture as we know it today, why does brand GVM and his history with romance attract so much interest? Could it be because most of his protagonists derive their traits from his own personality? “My wife also keeps telling me that I am the problem. She tells me that when I work with people, I put so much of myself out there that when I later move on from them they can’t handle it and come after me adversely. I have actually spent a lot of time thinking about this: do I really give away too much?”  Gautham may have gone through a rickety phase since his last genuine commercial success — Yennai Arindhaal in 2015. “First of all, there are no regrets. I am built like that. I have generally understood that this is how the industry works. I look up to very few people in films, and even their careers have gone through lean phases,” he says. But if the “business of cinema” could ultimately affect even an accomplished filmmaker like Gautham, what does that say about the industry being a welcoming space for aspirants? “The difference is that I talk about my problems, but nobody else does. There are definitely lessons to be learnt here for newcomers: make yourself safe, work with producers who won’t cite you liable for the film’s box-office numbers or hold you responsible with a contract. That is how you get sucked into the vicious cycle,” he says, adding with a grin, “The world of cinema is absolutely a fantastic place to be in if you have great content and know how to communicate, but it is important to be wary.” Keeping up with the times The general perception around GVM is that he is still waiting for a financial crunch to be resolved. When will he breathe a sigh of relief and move on? “That time is now. I am genuinely in a very happy space at the moment. People are calling me, and new doors and windows are opening every other day. A meeting with Anwar Rasheed and Fahadh [Faasil] for Trance has led to me becoming an actor! I have the liberty now to write a script and then cast an actor, not the other way round.” He adds, “Also, I am not at all insecure about my work and accept everything happening around me. I only ask for strong shoulders to lean on. I have learnt that from people like Rahman sir.” There is someone else he calls his biggest mentor in the industry; the reason he became a filmmaker in the first place. “Speaking to Mani (Ratnam) sir has helped me deal with the rough patches. The biggest lesson I learnt from him was to not read reviews. I remember him telling me, ‘Gautham, you’ve made a film with all your heart. The numbers matter to the people, not to you. So why let it even reach you in the first place?’,” he says. ” Minnaleat 20 Considering the interview is to celebrate 20 years of his début, I ask him if a film like Minnale, as quintessentially charming as it is, could be made today. Would the ‘woke’ gene in him prevent him from writing a character who essentially masquerades as someone else to woo a lady? “Yes, he does stalk her initially, but he never crosses the line at any point. Even at the end of ‘Vaseegara’, there is a point when he could get physical with her, but he chooses not to,” he says. “Having said that, I think the criticism around films today for not being woke takes it a bit too far. Trying to be politically correct sometimes hampers the creative process. Vetri Maaran, in fact, is someone who is actually very conscious of these things, and I keep admiring him for it. My point is, it is a film and that is all it is always. Watch out for a scene in Navarasa ; I make a little dig at this,” he smiles.  Quick takes: You had years of your own romantic experiences to draw from when you made Minnale in 2001. But the concept of love and relationships on-screen have since evolved with time. Where do you find inspiration to write a romance today? Of course I talk to people around me to get ideas, but there are a lot of experiences I’ve had, before and after my marriage, conversations with my wife, that are still very relevant today. In fact, so much of Jyotika’s character from Kaakha Kaakha is derived from Preethi. She’s going to hate me for saying this (laughs). My family immediately spotted it when they watched the film. Even the genesis of VTV came from watching two people who lived upstairs and in my house. As I write the story, I also put a lot of myself into these characters and take it forward; you’ll notice that in Navarasa too. Should aspiring filmmakers assist an established director, before taking the plunge on their own? Being an AD helped me a lot personally, particularly in losing my inhibitions. I learnt that from Rajiv (Menon) sir. He’s such a classy guy, but incredibly vociferous on set. I still remember the shooting of Vennilave… from Minsara Kanavu. Imagine Rajiv was actually telling Prabudeva, who’d choreographed the song, how to dance and do certain steps. An often-heard complaint I get, even today, is that I don’t talk much. Even my wife is very surprised to see my interviews. That’s because I’ve understood it’s important to put yourself out and be vocal to get things done. I finally quit Rajiv sir’s team because of the confidence I’d gotten from him to move on! Then I worked with G.B. Vijay (who’d directed Kalaignan with Kamal Haasan) who taught me a lot about the technique and physicality of camera work. From coordinating with the actors to costume design, I was doing everything. But the turning point was when I wrote the concept for a friend’s music video. On the day of the shoot, a situation arose where I had to step in suddenly and take initiative, but it was like clockwork. If I’d still had that inferiority complex of yore, I’d have just stood by. Theory is important, yes (one book Gautham highly recommends is Joseph V. Mascelli’s The Five C’s of Cinematography), but unless you work on a film, handle the production aspects and take it to upto release, deal with actors, their tantrums, and so on, you don’t understand the whole picture. How important is it to watch films from all over, and learn from them? Very. In fact, I always watch a film more than once. The first time, I watch it as an audience, and the second time, as a filmmaker. Recently, I was blown away by Pieces of a Woman (on Netflix) and kept thinking about how they cracked that incredible opening shot. Last week, I watched Guru (by Mani Ratnam) again to study it. Not only do other films inspire you, but it also tells you what not to do sometimes. Since Tamil cinema is driven by stars, it also teaches me how a certain actor looks at himself or herself, and how to get into that pattern. It helps that we are all film buffs in my family; my mom has been binging The Crown of late all the time. (laughs) Do you work on multiple scripts simultaneously — and if so — would you recommend it? I wouldn’t recommend it, but I do so, and I love doing it. I try to capitalise on my thoughts and what frame of mind I’m in, and write accordingly. For instance, I was in London for a meeting and found some time. So I went to a coffee shop and soon, I had 80 pages of Kamal & Kadambari. But the meeting didn’t go great, so I kept K & K aside, and started writing something else more dark and intense. I’m able to switch between scripts and the emotions portrayed in them quite easily. How do you pick composers for films, and will you turn music director anytime soon? I actually have a lot of tunes ready. But I have access to people like A.R. Rahman, Harris, Darbuka Siva, Karthik, and I also want to work with Anirudh and some new guys on the block... so it stops me from doing it myself. How I choose a composer for a particular project, happens completely on a whim, just like how the titles of my films waft through the air and come to me.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/20-years-of-gautham-menon-an-interview-with-the-filmmaker-on-his-movies-romance-and-everything-in-between/article33745347.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Writing on the w a l l||“When I painted my first wall without any permission, I waited for the day when it would make it to the news. When my work started getting featured on the news, I decided I wanted to sell my paintings... Tomorrow, the doors open for my solo exhibition and I have nothing more to strike off now,” writes Mumbai-based anonymous artist Tyler in a rather emotional Instagram post addressed to his 67.9K followers on January 13. Tyler’s first solo exhibit in India, currently on display at Method, Bandra and Kala Ghoda, is perhaps a sign that graffiti and street art, largely considered “anti-art”, has found a place in the mainstream. The exhibit literally brings street art into a white cube space shining light on the fact that as much as it is a statement, it is also nothing less than ‘high’ or ‘fine’ art. Public art destination About a year ago, Chennai’s Kannagi Nagar (Off Mahabalipuram Road), one of the largest resettlements in India housing those who have been rehabilitated from river beds and slums, saw a dramatic transformation as 16 artists etched murals on multiple walls, in a bid to make it a public art destination. The art sought to bring the community together. In locations across India, public art welcomed a similiar response as more art destinations cropped up, courtsey St+art India, a non-profit collective that collaborates with governing authorities to drag art out of galleries and into a public space. This kind of accessibility and reach that public art provides is what still intrigues budding artists and collectives, despite the risks involved. Celebrated Kochi-based anonymous artist, Guess Who, who is dubbed as ‘India’s own Banksy’ asks, “Isn’t that the beauty of it? It demystifies the aura around art and makes it approachable for everyone.” However, there is a running risk of the work being tampered with. How do artists respond to that? “I would prefer to see the tampering as a response to the artwork or maybe as part of the conversation the art is trying to provide,” Guess Who adds. The artist began commenting on events, political or otherwise, on walls in Fort Kochi, Bengaluru, Chennai and other parts of the country, as early as 2012. By the artist’s own admission, the kind of work they do “technically falls under street art”. In graffiti, however, self expression takes precedence; in fact it is a form of narcissism, opines Chennai-based graffiti writer, A-Kill. “Graffiti is ultimately a call out to the public saying that I exist,” says A-Kill who believes that the art form asserts a certain sense of individuality while street art relies heavily on a narrative. In the country, however, the inception point of this form of art is difficult to trace. At varied points, around the turn of the 20th Century, is when street culture in India started emerging. But, the starting point of it all is believed to be simple, unassuming wall art mostly used for commercial purposes. Veteran banner artist and art critic V Jeevananthan from Coimbatore remembers seeing his first wall art around 1967 as a child: The wall held lettering and motifs that etched out campaign promises by political parties contesting for elections at the time. “That is the first time I saw a colourful graffiti,” says the artist who recently collaborated with St+art India Foundation to paint a mural in Coimbatore on human/animal conflict. “Wall paintings used to be done widely for commercial and political purposes before that. It was an employment opportunity for many who went around hunting for large walls to paint on, after agreeing upon a contract with the owner. Street art in its true sense, however, is a new trend especially in Coimbatore, perhaps only four years old,” he adds. Rooted in the political  Political writing on public walls seem to be the starting point for street art in Kerala as well. Guess Who adds, “You wouldn’t call it graffiti but their distinctive styles of hand painted letters have a lot of characteristics that are similar to graffiti culture. Unfortunately, there isn’t much of an individual artistic expression.” The artist says that though there are individuals and collectives like Trespassers who paint public walls, there are too few takers for urban art in the State. “The size of it is too negligible for it to be called a collective movement,” says the artist. However, it seems like Chennai has a different story to tell. The graffiti culture in the metropolis started picking up around 2014, and was a movement that rose in parallel to the hip hop and b-boying scene. A-Kill who is also part of T3K Collective says, “In Chennai, cinema and politics play a vital role in the societal fabric. For instance, if you go out and paint a wall, people automatically assume that they are political ads or something related to cinema.” But street art is neither. Seven years on, the works are more original, and are actively used to beautify the city, says A-Kill, who had recently finished a mural (65 feet by 903 feet) on the facade of Chennai’s Indira Nagar MRTS, in a bid to create awareness about HIV/AIDS. “That is what graffiti is moving towards,” he says, adding that a lot of commissioned works for cafes, restaurants and private walls that his crew receives, is testament to the same. Even in events, live graffiti is being commissioned for an “experience”, where people can see artists paint live, almost as though it is a performance. “Now, many young artists are interested in learning the basics; from tagging (signing one’s name) to throwing up (a more elaborate version of the tag with multiple colours and styles) and even piecing (their masterpiece in a legal spot). Whenever they see us paint, they stop to ask us about the work,” says A-Kill, whose crew tries to claim a wall wherever they travel to. Commercial or otherwise, street art is a response to the world around and will continue to be so. Concludes Guess Who, “Like every individual who responds to the realities around them, artists too respond, react and question the world they live in, through their art.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/writing-on-the-w-a-l-l/article33745352.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Couple goals||Who are Abhi and Siddhu and why is this on-screen couple the subject of much online discussion? If you have been watching Tamil web-series Vallamai Tharayo , billed as India’s first daily digital series, on YouTube every evening, you would know why. Starring Shali Nivekas, VJ Parvathy, Kaushick and Vivek Rajagopal among others, Vallamai Tharayo recently crossed borders: its dubbed version hit Telugu screens via Eenadu TV, where it is being telecast as part of its prime time programming. This assumes significance because it is probably the first time a ‘made for YouTube’ programme is being telecast on TV. “It is an endorsement of a digital product by TV media. We wanted the edginess of a digital series without missing the core of television,” says B Srinivasan of the Vikatan Group, which made the series with Motion Content Group, in association with YouTube. To ensure a perfect marriage of the two platforms, they roped in V Thiruselvam, who helmed the successful TV soap Kolangal , to work on the screenplay while Chidambaraman Manivannan, who has experience with web series Emergency , was chosen as director. The heart of the series deals with patriarchy; Vallamai Tharayo revolves around how well-meaning parents inadvertently end up pushing their daughter into an imbalanced marriage, and how she fumbles her way through. “Youngsters have related with the characters,” says Chidambaram, “Recently, when we went out to a restaurant, a lady walked up to us and accosted Kaushick (who plays Siddharth) and chided him for troubling Abhi. She had started seeing these artistes as characters. That meant so much to us.” One of the reasons for that, according to him, is the casting. “Before we started out, we roped in many known faces from YouTube,” he reveals, “We were particular not to cast people who were popular due to their TV appearances as we wanted the look and feel to be that of a web-series.” The core storyline of Vallamai Tharayo was conceived by Srinivasan’s wife Radhika, after being inspired by Chup , a collection of interviews by Deepa Narayanan that speaks about how patriarchy has seeped into the Indian woman. “We are now also in talks with Malayalam channels for a similar move like the Telugu one, and also with Hindi producers and channels to remake this in Hindi,” adds Srinivasan, who has also produced November Story for Disney+Hotstar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/couple-goals/article33745365.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Coffee? Where have you bean?||It was a time before micro-lots, cold brews and nitro coffee. A time when all you needed to open a café was a cold coffee recipe, dial-up connection and a sofa. Two decades later, much to the delight of its regulars, Coffee? is reopening in a very different Chennai from where it was born in 1999. For award-winning cinematographer, Nirav Shah, who started the café with his brothers Bhavesh and Pratik, before moving to Mumbai, it is the best kind of homecoming. “The people who hung out at Coffee? were really the core of the place, and already, so many of the familiar faces are back,” says Nirav, adding with a chuckle, “all looking much older, and with less hair!” Even before the café officially opened, before the furniture arrived, the brothers’ friends and fans of Coffee? began to gather, perching on any available tables and stools, filling the space with peals of laughter, between test shots of espresso. Bhavesh holds up a carefully preserved article from The Hindu , in 2008, commemorating when Coffee? closed, crediting it for igniting the city’s café culture. After this little café opened on a quiet, tree-fringed lane off Greenways Road, it quickly became popular for its vibe as well as its popcorn, paneer fingers and cheese toast. At the new location, at Whistle on Pycrofts Garden Road, the vibe is similar, though the styling is deliberately different. Minimalist interiors highlight their crown jewel, an Italian Sanremo Opera 2.0 coffee machine (which comes with an eye watering price tag) and the high energy backdrop that is Whistle’s bright futsal turf. Passion project  “We started in ‘99, with a Krups home coffee machine. At that time it was cutting edge,” laughs Bhavesh, “It was all very random.” When Nirav’s career took him to Mumbai, Pratik and Bhavesh stayed behind the counter, keeping the café running. “I don’t think we ever saw it as a business. And I don’t think we ever made money off it,” shrugs Nirav. This time too, it’s a passion project, but with a lot more frills. Nirav adds, “I still think we can make a difference to the scene. And now, we have the burden of experience on our heads… I don’t know if that’s a good thing!” As he speaks, barista Tabish Tareen sets up a glass syphon on the table to brew an Amrut whisky barrel-aged coffee. Customers can pick between the Chemex, V60, Aeropress and Kalita as well. In the tradition of third wave coffee shops, there is focus on bean terroir. They also pay tribute to the past with the 1999 menu’s greatest hits: cold coffee, vanilla espressos and frappés. (Their cold coffee went on to feature at Sathyam theatre.) The food is deliberately old school. Old favourites have been revived, but engineered and plated with the benefit of 20 years of experience. The cheese toast is fiery with sliced green chillies, and lush with bechamel. The paneer fingers are now panko crusted. And the affogato has the benefit of a rich, deeply flavoured espresso to set off the creaminess of vanilla. Mona’s aloo toast, named after Bhavesh’s wife, who shared her recipe when they first began, is reassuringly the same, if plated more stylishly. There are also more items as well — after all Chennai has come a long way since the 2000s, and the restaurant business now is more competitive than ever before, demanding imaginative food, high quality coffee and — of course — Instagram-worthy plating. Hence the chicken katsu sandwiches, churros with Belgian dark chocolate and Buddha bowls, as well as trendy blue pea tea, nitro brews and hazelnut coffee shooters. “When I look back at our old menus and think about the coffee we served, I wonder, how did we get away with that,” smiles Bhavesh. “It’s like films,” counters Nirav. “When you watch the old ones now, you say ‘what were they thinking’. But for that time, it worked.” And, like Mona’s aloo toast, Coffee? is being welcomed back because it reminds the city of home-style hangouts and simpler times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/coffee-where-have-you-bean/article33745366.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Break from usual||Eleven films in 10 years is not exactly a healthy average for an actor playing the male lead in Tamil films. But Arulnithi is not your average actor. Whilst the average Tamil film hero takes on two or three projects simultaneously, Arulnithi paces his films. “In this day and age, every film you do is important because even if one doesn’t work out, then the next project can become a question mark,” Arulnithi says, over phone. “After Mouna Guru (2011) earned me recognition, I made the conscious choice to only do quality films. A hit or a flop is not in our hands but the attempt has to be something novel. Because I know that audiences do not come to theatres to watch my films for my face... they come expecting to watch a good story.” His 12th film, Kalathil Santhippom , in which he co-stars with Jiiva, Manjima Mohan and Priya Bhavani Shankar, is scheduled for release on February 5. This is a break from the usual for an actor who has set something of a pattern for doing thrillers more than most; at least five of his previous 11 films are in the thriller genre. In that regard, Kalathil Santhippom , which fits the mould of a ‘masala’ film, is an aberration. “It is a film you can watch with the family. It is the complete package — drama, humour, romance, friendship. Kalathil Santhippom is a story about friendship between two men (Jiiva and himself).” Comfortable genre However, he is not about to give up on thrillers altogether. “It is my strong zone, but I need to attempt something different.This way, my work will be exposed to a wider section of the audience because ‘family-oriented films tend to have better reach,” he adds. In Kalathil Santhippom , the protagonists are kabaddi players; Arulnithi says the film’s director, N Rajasekar, roped in his friends who are local kabaddi players to help get a grasp of the sport. “For two days, we were taught the basics by kabaddi players from Karaikudi. We then filmed the kabaddi scenes in the movie for nearly seven days on a set and used real players,” he says. Like he promises, the actor will be seen in an investigative-thriller immediately following Kalathil Santhippom ; titled Diary , the film directed by Innasi Pandian, a former associate of Ajay Gnanamuthu (who directed Arulnithi’s Demonte Colony ), has the actor play a cop; the film is awaiting release. “There is also another film directed by Vijay of YouTube channel ‘Eruma Saani’ fame. I play a college student in it,” Arulnithi adds.  Starry affair It is his first time sharing screen space with a male contemporary in Kalathil Santhippom , but Arulnithi appreciates the fact that his co-star, Jiiva, has already explored multi-starrer subjects — still a rarity in Tamil cinema — to varying degrees of success. “[Multi-starrers] are healthy for Tamil cinema, but the subject has to be equally good to convince multiple heroes to be part of the same subject,” Arulnithi says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/break-from-usual/article33745337.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A whisker away||The highly elusive fishing cat, a lesser-known feline species, is facing several threats due to its depleting habitat. Listed as ‘vulnerable’ on International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, the species has a high probability of becoming endangered unless circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve. Fishing cats have a patchy distribution along the Eastern Ghats. They abound in estuarine floodplains, tidal mangrove forests and also inland freshwater habitats. Apart from Sundarbans in West Bengal and Bangladesh, fishing cats inhabit the Chilika lagoon and surrounding wetlands in Odisha, Coringa and Krishna mangroves in Andhra Pradesh. “Our team also reported the presence of the species for the first time in a completely inland freshwater riverine habitat in Srikakulam a couple of years ago. The conservation threats to fishing cats in the Eastern Ghats are mainly habitat loss [wetland degradation and conversion for aquaculture and other commercial projects], sand mining along river banks, agricultural intensification resulting in loss of riverine buffer and conflict with humans in certain areas resulting in targeted hunting and retaliatory killings,” says Murthy Kantimahanti, a part of Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance and founder of Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society, India. The Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance is a team of conservationists, researchers and enthusiasts across the world working to achieve a single dream — a world with functioning floodplains and coastal ecosystems that ensure survival of the fishing cat and all species with which it shares a home. With its regional group of conservationists and researchers, it has initiated an understanding of the bio-geographical distribution of the fishing cat in the unprotected and human-dominated landscapes of the northeastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh. The project will use techniques like ecological niche modelling, camera trapping, signs and tracks survey, interviews with locals and documentation of historical records. “We know nothing about their population dynamics, and very little about their ecology and habits in the wild. Therefore, it’s very difficult to say the impact without such data. Although fishing cats are predominantly associated with wetlands, these highly elusive cats are adaptable to live even in human dominated landscapes and relatively drier habitats,” Murthy adds. Another major component is promoting awareness among people living near fishing cat habitats. “The goal is to ensure healthy populations of fishing cats living in close harmony with humans in these areas,” says Murthy. The Alliance will kick-start a worldwide month-long campaign in February to raise awareness and garner support across the globe. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums and Fishing Cat Species Survival Plan in conjunction with the Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance will be sharing their expertise via cartoons, videos and other material.  Know your feline The fishing cat is confident and content in water, they tap the surface to lure prey, plug their ears when they dive, and emerge from the water with dry skin due to a double coat.   Some compare the vocalisations of the fishing cat to a quack, a bark, even a chuckle and a gurgle.    In Cambodia, where images of fishing cats are found carved in the walls of ancient structures, they are known as Kla Trey, ‘Tiger fish’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-whisker-away/article33745359.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Chryslers and some New York jazz||On Sunday afternoon, a string of vintage cars stood proud in Mamallapuram’s Radisson Blu Resort Temple Bay — not in the parking lot, but inside a sprawling lobby, by a sun-baked swimming pool and on grassy tree-lined lawns. It was a closed event, and these restored, glittering machines of the past were the guests of honour. A sky blue Chevrolet 1955 Bel Air with sleek white wings stood in sunny contrast under blooming pink bougainvilleas. An Elvis impersonator mixed cocktails nearby as the real deal crooned ‘Let me be your teddy bear’ over the sound system, completing the time travel effect. Indoors, an Audrey Hepburn lookalike strutted past a sleek grey Chrysler New Yorker, a car whose counterpart had enjoyed a brief moment of fame in the classic Breakfast At Tiffany’s . A few steps ahead, a red Alfa Romeo 1961 stands, enjoying a stage all to itself in front of a winding staircase, and flanked by a board detailing the car’s role in Fred Zinnemann’s 1973 film The Day Of The Jackal — a thriller, which recreated an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle. The exhibition featured 25 cars owned by enthusiasts from across India, each with a connection to a Hollywood film of the era. This is not the first time that the Historical Cars Association of India (HCAI) has shown off its impressive classic car collection. However, it is the first event that the association has held outside Chennai, and Ranjit Pratap, HCA president, hopes to take the association to Hyderabad and other cities in South India soon. “We started early last year, and wanted to go out to various metros in South India, and do shows with [car enthusiast] clubs that cannot afford to do shows by themselves. This concept is only to instigate these clubs to do their shows. We will give them the financial support,” says Pratap. The association held its maiden show in September 2020, in Chennai. The show in Mamallapuram is their second show so far, and featured other recogniseable models like the Volkswagen camper van, the Beetle and the sleek, quintessential Jaguar E Type — famous not only for its presence in films like Harold and Maude , but also for being owned by celebrities like Steve McQueen. Also drawing crowds were lesser-known, but sizeable beasts like the Studebaker Champion Bullnose, and a gleaming bottle-green Jaguar Mark IV. As the beer poured, the sun shined and waves crashed, Ella Fitzgerald did an encore of her classic ‘Dancing cheek to cheek’, and for a moment the cars looked like they were back in their glory days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/chryslers-and-some-new-york-jazz/article33745362.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||World of music||Tanvi Shah is known for the international flavour she brings to her tracks. Every time a music composer calls her, it is probably to bring in the ‘world music’ vibe to a number. When composer Girishh Gopalakrishnan called her one day during the pandemic-induced lockdown, the request was something similar, but it had to do with a Tamil classic number. For Carvaan Lounge Tamil, a concept by Amazon Prime Music and Saregama, which re-imagines hit retro Tamil numbers, Tanvi and Girishh have taken on a 1965 track, ‘Unnai Kaanadha Kannum’ from Idhaya Kamalam , sung by P Susheela and composed by KV Mahadevan. “I was very scared because it was a Susheela amma classic. The minute you think remix, you think EDM and club music. But composer Girishh has an eclectic musical sensibility. He understood my strengths as a singer and has combined that with the aesthetics of the Tamil classic,” says Tanvi, adding, “We kept it soft and gave it an old-school Latin feel. Even the harmonies were tuned that way.” Tanvi, whose recent work can be heard in the Yuvan Shankar Raja composition ‘Scream of Darkness’ song from the Vishal-starrer Chakra , is very much an accidental singer. In the early 2000s, AR Rahman heard a CD of hers and gave her an opportunity to sing in Yuva . She subsequently teamed up with him for Sillunu Oru Kaadhal and Sivaji , but her biggest claim to fame is undoubtedly ‘Jai Ho’ in Slumdog Millionaire that fetched her international popularity. The song, which she co-wrote with AR Rahman, won her a Grammy, and life has not been the same since. “If I wear that crown and walk around, that would be the beginning of my end. I always keep asking, ‘Now what?’ and push myself more. As a singer, I have learnt and grown, and take every day as it comes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/world-of-music/article33745343.ece

04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A whisker away||The highly elusive fishing cat, a lesser-known feline species, is facing several threats due to its depleting habitat. Listed as ‘vulnerable’ on International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, the species has a high probability of becoming endangered unless circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve. Fishing cats have a patchy distribution along the Eastern Ghats. They abound in estuarine floodplains, tidal mangrove forests and also inland freshwater habitats. Apart from Sundarbans in West Bengal and Bangladesh, fishing cats inhabit the Chilika lagoon and surrounding wetlands in Odisha, Coringa and Krishna mangroves in Andhra Pradesh. “Our team also reported the presence of the species for the first time in a completely inland freshwater riverine habitat in Srikakulam a couple of years ago. The conservation threats to fishing cats in the Eastern Ghats are mainly habitat loss [wetland degradation and conversion for aquaculture and other commercial projects], sand mining along river banks, agricultural intensification resulting in loss of riverine buffer and conflict with humans in certain areas, resulting in targeted hunting and retaliatory killings,” says Murthy Kantimahanti, a part of Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance and founder of Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society, India. The Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance is a team of conservationists, researchers and enthusiasts across the world working to achieve a single dream — a world with functioning floodplains and coastal ecosystems that ensure survival of the fishing cat and all species with which it shares a home. With its regional group of conservationists and researchers, it has initiated an understanding of the bio-geographical distribution of the fishing cat in the unprotected and human-dominated landscapes of the northeastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh. The project will use techniques like ecological niche modelling, camera trapping, signs and tracks survey, interviews with locals and documentation of historical records. “We know nothing about their population dynamics, and very little about their ecology and habits in the wild. Therefore, it’s very difficult to say the impact without such data. Although fishing cats are predominantly associated with wetlands, these highly elusive cats are adaptable to live even in human-dominated landscapes and relatively drier habitats,” Murthy adds. Another major component is promoting awareness among people living near fishing cat habitats. “The goal is to ensure healthy populations of fishing cats living in close harmony with humans in these areas,” says Murthy. The alliance will kick-start a worldwide month-long campaign in February to raise awareness and garner support across the globe. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums and Fishing Cat Species Survival Plan in conjunction with the Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance will be sharing their expertise via cartoons, videos and other material.  Know your feline The fishing cat is confident and content in water, they tap the surface to lure prey, plug their ears when they dive, and emerge from the water with dry skin due to a double coat.   Some compare the vocalisations of the fishing cat to a quack, a bark, even a chuckle and a gurgle.    In Cambodia, where images of fishing cats are found carved in the walls of ancient structures, they are known as Kla Trey, ‘Tiger fish’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-whisker-away/article33745114.ece
04 February 2021||February 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Coffee? Where have you bean?||It was a time before micro-lots, cold brews and nitro coffee. A time when all you needed to open a café was a cold coffee recipe, dial-up connection and a sofa. Two decades later, much to the delight of its regulars, Coffee? is reopening in a very different Chennai from where it was born in 1999. For award-winning cinematographer, Nirav Shah, who started the café with his brothers Bhavesh and Pratik, before moving to Mumbai, it is the best kind of homecoming. “The people who hung out at Coffee? were really the core of the place, and already, so many of the familiar faces are back,” says Nirav, adding with a chuckle, “all looking much older, and with less hair!” Even before the café officially opened, before the furniture arrived, the brothers’ friends and fans of Coffee? began to gather, perching on any available tables and stools, filling the space with peals of laughter, between test shots of espresso. Bhavesh holds up a carefully preserved article from The Hindu , in 2008, commemorating when Coffee? closed, crediting it for igniting the city’s café culture. After this little café opened on a quiet, tree-fringed lane off Greenways Road, it quickly became popular for its vibe as well as its popcorn, paneer fingers and cheese toast. At the new location, at Whistle on Pycrofts Garden Road, the vibe is similar, though the styling is deliberately different. Minimalist interiors highlight their crown jewel, an Italian Sanremo Opera 2.0 coffee machine (which comes with an eye watering price tag) and the high energy backdrop that is Whistle’s bright futsal turf. Passion project  “We started in ‘99, with a Krups home coffee machine. At that time it was cutting edge,” laughs Bhavesh, “It was all very random.” When Nirav’s career took him to Mumbai, Pratik and Bhavesh stayed behind the counter, keeping the café running. “I don’t think we ever saw it as a business. And I don’t think we ever made money off it,” shrugs Nirav. This time too, it’s a passion project, but with a lot more frills. Nirav adds, “I still think we can make a difference to the scene. And now, we have the burden of experience on our heads… I don’t know if that’s a good thing!” As he speaks, barista Tabish Tareen sets up a glass syphon on the table to brew an Amrut whisky barrel-aged coffee. Customers can pick options among the Chemex, V60, Aeropress and Kalita as well. In the tradition of third wave coffee shops, there is focus on bean terroir. They also pay tribute to the past with the 1999 menu’s greatest hits: cold coffee, vanilla espressos, and frappés. (Their cold coffee went on to feature at Sathyam theatre.) The food is deliberately old school. Old favourites have been revived, but engineered and plated with the benefit of 20 years of experience. The cheese toast is fiery with sliced green chillies, and lush with bechamel. The paneer fingers are now panko crusted. And the affogato has the benefit of a rich, deeply flavoured espresso to set off the creaminess of vanilla. Mona’s aloo toast, named after Bhavesh’s wife, who shared her recipe when they first began, is reassuringly the same, if plated more stylishly. There are also more items as well — after all Chennai has come a long way since the 2000s, and the restaurant business now is more competitive than ever before, demanding imaginative food, high quality coffee and — of course — Instagram-worthy plating. Hence the chicken katsu sandwiches, churros with Belgian dark chocolate and Buddha bowls, as well as trendy blue pea tea, nitro brews and hazelnut coffee shooters. “When I look back at our old menus and think about the coffee we served, I wonder, how did we get away with that,” smiles Bhavesh. “It’s like films,” counters Nirav. “When you watch the old ones now, you say ‘what were they thinking’. But for that time, it worked.” And, like Mona’s aloo toast, Coffee? is being welcomed back because it reminds the city of home-style hangouts and simpler times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/coffee-where-have-you-bean/article33745118.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||More than 9,000 mobile phone users under police scanner||Delhi Police is compiling details of over 9,000 mobile numbers that are registered outside of the city but were active in the heart of the Capital on Republic Day when violence broke out in several areas, said a senior officer on Wednesday. The officer said that the SIT formed to investigate the violence that erupted at the Red Fort had identified 9,000 numbers that were registered in Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh but were active in Red Fort and ITO area on January 26. Data analysis In a similar pattern, details of protesters who indulged in violence will be obtained by analysing dump data of mobile calls at other locations in the city. “The details of these numbers will be matched with their locations at the protest site to find out if the number belongs to a protester who was present at Tikri, Ghazipur or Singhu borders,” he said. The officer added that after getting confirmation and details of the mobile user via the customer acquisition form (CAF), they will be issuing notices and asking the mobile users to join the ongoing investigation. The police said that till Wednesday they have obtained footage of the violence rom around 4,000 CCTVs and mobile phones. A team has been formed to analyse the footage and get photos of protesters with the help of software. They are also using facial recognition software to identify the people. 700 emails “We have received 700 emails regarding the violence. They contain photos and videos. On WhatsApp, we have got around 1,300 videos and 50 audio clips. We are sorting through the videos in which policemen were attacked by protesters and identifying the accused. We are also getting CCTV footage from PWD and other government agencies,” said a police officer. The officer said they have identified around 200 vehicles, including tractors, cars and two-wheelers, that forcibly entered the Red Fort premises on Republic Day. They have asked for details about vehicles owners from the transport departments of U.P., Haryana and Punjab, to serve notices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-to-ascertain-location-of-over-9000-phone-users/article33745433.ece
04 February 2021||Chandigarh,||Cong. to move no-trust motion against Lal govt.||The Haryana Congress Legislature Party on Wednesday decided to move a no-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government in the next Assembly session on the Centre’s farm laws issue. The CLP also decided to move a resolution in the Assembly to reject all the three laws. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said they would also press for a Bill to amend the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act so that farmers can get guaranteed minimum support price. “The Bill to be presented by us would also ensure that if anyone buys crops less than the MSP, legal action can be taken on it,” said Mr. Hooda, who presided over the meeting. He said all the MLAs had reiterated their commitment to support the farmers’ movement. Mr. Hooda said the movement is completely non-political and the organisations are receiving support from all sections of society. ‘Resume facilities’ “The Congress stands firmly with the demands of the farmers and their peaceful agitation. It is the democratic right of the farmers to agitate for their demands. Shutting down Internet, electricity, water supply and sanitation facilities to harass them is inhuman. The government should resume all facilities immediately,” said Mr. Hooda. ‘Convene special session’ He said the Congress has been time and again demanding the Governor to convene a special session. “We have repeatedly sought time to meet the Governor. We will wait till 11 a.m. tomorrow [February 4], and if an appointment is not given then all the MLAs will march peacefully towards the Raj Bhavan from the MLA hostel.” Mr. Hooda said the State government had lost the confidence of the public. “The no-confidence motion will let people know who stands with the government and who with the people,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-to-move-no-trust-motion-against-lal-govt/article33745127.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Police summon activists over tweets||The Cyber Preventation Awareness Detection (CyPAD) unit of Delhi Police on Wednesday served notice to activist Yogita Bhayana for alleged fake tweets she posted during the Republic Day violence in the Capital. Responding to the development, Ms. Bhayana accused the Delhi police of “suppressing” her voice, and said her only “crime” was that she had been supporting the farmers protesting against the three Central agricultural laws. The notice has been sent to Ms. Bhayana asking her to appear before the police in a case registered under the Indian Penal Code sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), and 505(1)(b) (circulating statement, rumour that may induce somebody to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity). “This is to inform you that investigation of the above said case is being carried out. During investigation, it was found that the two allegedly fake posts were uploaded from your Twitter account,” the notice says. Source and reason “You are requested to inform the source and reason for uploading the posts. You are also requested to inform the date, time of place where you will be available for the investigation. Please inform the said details within two days from the receipt of this notice,” it stated. Another notice has been served to Lucknow-based political analyst Choudhary Rohit Singh Yadav and has been asked to appear before the Delhi police within two days. In his post, Mr. Yadav had shared an old photograph showing a Sikh man with injuries on his back. “When I realised that the photo I shared was old, I immediately deleted it on January 27. But I received a police notice today regarding the deleted tweet,” Mr. Yadav said. Ms. Bhayana, in another tweet, said, “I feel Delhi Police is misgoverned and doing exactly opposite of what we expect from them. I am with farmers and I know I am fighting for truth.” On January 30, the Delhi police had filed a case against Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, The Caravan magazine and others for allegedly misleading public regarding the death of a protester at ITO during a tractor parade on January 26 which had turned violent. He was killed after his tractor overturned.  When I realised that the photo I shared was old, I immediately deleted it on January 27.

04 February 2021||New Delhi,||Front-line workers to get jab on a trial basis from today||A total of 7,365 beneficiaries took the COVID-19 vaccination in the city on Wednesday. However, 17 Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) were reported, according to the Delhi government. The number of people vaccinated was only 40.2% of the daily target of 18,300, which is the lowest percentage till now. Also, front-line workers, including police personnel and teachers, will be vaccinated on a pilot basis on Thursday following the Central government’s directions, according to officials. “Tomorrow [Thursday] front-line workers will be vaccinated on a pilot basis. Their vaccination drive will start from Saturday. About 3.4 lakh front-line workers have been registered till now,” an official working with the Chief Minister’s office said. Delhi uses both vaccines for COVID-19, Covaxin and Covishield. Of the 17 AEFI, 14 were from using Covishield and three were from Covaxin. The number of days of vaccination has been increased to six a week from four till last week. The number of vaccination sites were increased to 106 from 81. Each site has a target of 100 healthcare workers. The government started the vaccination drive by inoculating about 2.4 lakh healthcare workers whose names have been registered with them. 150 new cases Delhi witnessed 150 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 6,35,481, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Wednesday. Also, six more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 10,864. A total of 56,658 tests were done in the past 24 hours. Of the total cases, 6,23,409 people have recovered and there are 1,208 active cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/front-line-workers-to-get-jab-on-a-trial-basis-from-today/article33745445.ece
04 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||‘Police trying to malign farmers’||The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) alleged on Wednesday that the Delhi police and the Central government were trying to malign the image of farmers by blocking the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. “All through the protest, farmers allowed the ambulances and emergency vehicles to pass through the protest site. However, in the last couple of days, the Delhi police has put multiple barricades, concrete slabs, and razor wires to completely block the expressway. It has created a problem for the people in a medical emergency,” said Dharmendra Malik, Media in-charge of BKU. “BKU took a call and opened the route under the flyover through the tents and trolleys of farmers,” Mr. Malik said. On any given day, it becomes difficult to even walk through these trolleys as they are parked very haphazardly. “We are trying to instil discipline as any lapse could be used to create a public opinion against us. The ambulances could pass through Kaushambi in Ghaziabad and then enter Delhi via Anand Vihar,” he said. On the decrease in numbers of farmers in front of the stage on Wednesday, Mr. Malik said many farmers had been asked to go home and prepare for the “chakka jam” scheduled for February 6. “It would be like our usual protests where we stop traffic for a few hours to get ourselves heard. The BKU is not looking for any confrontation with the government as many are trying to project,” he said.  Panchayat in Manglaur Meanwhile, at a panchayat in Manglaur town of Haridwar district of Uttarakhand, Naresh Tikait, BKU president, appealed to the farmers to join in large numbers for the “chakka jam” on February 6. Held at the famous Gur Mandi of the town, the panchayat saw a massive response. “This movement would be written in golden letters in the history of our country. We should remain vigilant that no action of ours brings bad name to the farming community,” he urged.  ‘Farmers are united’ Mr. Tikait said farmers of the country had united against the dictatorial attitude of the government. “Over the last few months, they have realised that the battle could only be fought if they remain united. Farmers are losing interest in agriculture but the government is not listening.” He clarified that no individual “neither Rakesh nor I have the right to take a unilateral decision. The decisions would continue to be made by the coordination committee.” He regretted that the jam proposed on February 6 would bring discomfort to the general public. “But we have been left with no other option to make ourselves heard. That is why we have planned it for three hours only.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/police-trying-to-malign-farmers/article33745123.ece
04 February 2021||New Delhi,||AAP govt. issues list of 115 held in R-Day case||The Delhi government on Wednesday released a list of 115 people who are in different jails in the city after being arrested by the police in connection with the January 26 violence. “Many people have contacted the Delhi government in the past few days that people from their houses, who had left to take part in the farmers’ agitation in Delhi, have not come back, they do not have any contact with them and are missing,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a video statement. “Our government has made a list of people in different jails in Delhi, arrested in connection with the farmers’ agitation. We are going to release a list,” Mr. Kejriwal said. The Delhi police is under the ambit of the Central government and not the AAP-ruled Delhi government. He said that the list will have the name, father’s name, address, age and date of arrest of these 115 people and it will be helpful for people trying to find their family members. “If we continue to receive reports even after issuing this list, as the Chief Minister of the State, I have assured the farmers’ unions that I will try my best to trace the missing persons and connect them with their families. If required, I will also talk to the L-G and the Centre in this regard. I assure you fully that I will try my best to trace the missing protesters and connect them to their families,” the Chief Minister added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-govt-issues-list-of-115-held-in-r-day-case/article33745431.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||4 cases lodged for sharing, uploading ‘fake posts’||The Cyber Prevention Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) unit of Delhi Police has registered four cases against several social media accounts in connection with sharing and uploading fake posts during the Republic Day violence, officers said on Wednesday. According to the police, Om Prakash Dhetarwal (29), a resident of Churu district in Rajasthan, has been arrested for allegedly posting an old video along with fake news of resignation of 200 police personnel. Another person has been apprehended from Bharatpur in Rajasthan for posting similar fake news. Police have sent requests for the removal of offensive and unlawful posts, they said. Several others indulging in such activities have been identified and efforts are under way to arrest them. Notices to join investigation have been issued to four persons. Further action against them will be taken on the basis of their deposition, the police said. Generating resentment Police said they have noticed some social media behaviours in the last few days. Fake news about police firing against the protesters is circulating. “The old images and videos of law and order action that are unrelated to the current situation in Delhi are being peddled to generate resentment against the administration,” Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. Public safety measures such as barricading and preventive steps such as restrictions on 4G Internet are being projected as preparation for large-scale crackdown, police said. Bogus claims and conjectures, causing disrepute and doubts about bonafide legal processes, such as post-mortem report generated by a medical board is also being created, they said. The malicious social media propaganda undertaken by the vested interests is primarily aimed at regaining support after the public backlash caused due to the unprovoked violence perpetrated by the protesters during the tractor rally at ITO, Red Fort and other places throughout the national capital, in which more than 500 police personnel got injured, Mr. Biswal said. Bot accounts It is further observed that several social media accounts are without any account bio-data, which is the behaviour generally observed in bot accounts, he said. In many posts, the attached media file is also observed to be edited and manipulated and the same is being pushed in the guise of news reports along with inciteful and alarming hashtags, police said. As part of the investigation, the accounts or handles that have posted these fake, offensive, provocative content have been escalated to the OTT platforms for getting their basic subscriber information and also for their removal, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/4-cases-lodged-for-sharing-uploading-fake-posts/article33745439.ece
04 February 2021||Bhopal,||‘Missing’ girl’s skeletal remains recovered from M.P. graveyard||The skeletal remains of a 15-year-old girl who was reported missing by her parents in 2011 have been recovered from a grave in Madhya Pradesh’s Sehore district. Akila (name changed), the daughter of a farmer in Manakheda village of the district, allegedly took her own life under duress, said Sehore Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sameer Yadav. “Our preliminary investigations suggest that the teenage girl had disappeared twice from her home in 2011. However, none of the family members came forward to lodge a missing complaint. On both occasions, the girl was traced from Bhopal,” said Mr. Yadav. The police said Akila’s mother questioned her after she was brought home the second time. The girl reportedly told her that a relative named Shamim, who lives in their village, and Ismail, from Moondla village in the same district, had sexually abused her. Extreme step Mr. Yadav said instead of consoling her daughter, Akila’s mother rebuked her, and she took the extreme step. After she was found dead, Akila’s parents summoned Shamim and Ismail home, placed the blame on them for their daughter’s death and asked them to help with disposing of her body. Akila’s father and her alleged abusers buried the body in a graveyard in Mandla Khurd village. The father then lodged a complaint about her going missing in the Mandi police station, the police said. “The family hid the truth for a decade,” said Mr. Yadav.  Renewed scrutiny The mystery surrounding Akila’s disappearance came under renewed scrutiny when the Sehore district police recently decided to open old cases as part of the State government’s campaign to find missing girls. In the past decade, theories of her assumed kidnapping and illicit relationships swirled around the tiny village before an anonymous tip-off pointed investigators towards putting focus on her family. The Sehore administration said on Monday that several skeletal remains have been recovered while excavating the graveyard in Mandla Khurd village. Further investigations, documentary checks, physical verifications and forensic examinations are under way, the police said.  Those in distress can dial +91 9630899002 or +91 7389366696 for assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/missing-girls-skeletal-remains-recovered-from-mp-graveyard/article33745122.ece
04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||NGT: build warehouses on platforms for cement bags||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Northern Railway to construct warehouses on platforms for the handling of cement bags in a bid to curb air pollution resulting from loading and unloading of cement. A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the Northern Railways to furnish its action plan to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and take requisite steps. “The CPCB and Delhi Pollution Control Committee may further monitor compliance of environmental norms in exercise of their statutory powers, following due process of law,” the Bench said. Fine imposition The tribunal also dismissed a plea of the Northern Railways which sought setting aside a previous order of the DPCC imposing a fine of Rs. 71.62 lakh for failing to curb pollution. “The amount of compensation may be spent for the restoration of the environment in coordination with the Northern Railways,” the Bench said. The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Anubhav Kumar alleging air pollution in and around Rani Bagh, Shakurbasti railway station, Raja Park and surrounding areas as a result of unscientific loading and unloading of cement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ngt-build-warehouses-on-platforms-for-cement-bags/article33745435.ece

Cash reward of Rs. 50,000 each was also announced for Buta Singh, Sukhdev Singh, Jajbir Singh and Iqbal Singh for allegedly instigating the protesters, the police said. Flag hoisting The reward of Rs. 1 lakh was announced on Sidhu, Jugraj Singh, Gurjot Singh and Gurjant Singh who allegedly hoisted flags at the Red Fort or were involved in the act, according to the police. They were identified through CCTV and video clips, the police said. Meanwhile, the SIT (Crime Branch) arrested Dharmendra Singh Harman on Wednesday. His role in connection with hoisting of a flag at Red Fort is being ascertained, the police said. Thousands of protesting farmers had clashed with the police during the tractor parade called by farmer unions on January 26 to highlight their demand for repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws. Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort and entered the monument. On Tuesday, the police had released the pictures of at least 20 suspects allegedly involved in the violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cash-reward-announced-for-information-on-deep-sidhu-three-others/article33745437.ece
04 February 2021||New Delhi,||BJP not distributing dry ration in schools: AAP||AAP on Wednesday alleged that the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation has not released dry rations provided by the Delhi government in corporation-run schools for the last several months. The party claimed that the BJP has a “corrupt nexus” with industrialists and they were diverting the dry ration. “The Delhi government is providing this dry ration from its own budget. The North Corporation has not provided dry ration to the children of the schools under their purview for the last eight months. It is utterly shameful,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said. ‘Rampant corruption’ He alleged that the BJP has been in power in the corporations for the last 15 years and during these years, they have indulged in “rampant corruption” across sectors. “AAP demands that the BJP should immediately release dry ration for children. We are giving the BJP four days to release it and if they do not, then we will launch a massive protest,” he added. ‘Back-door deal’ AAP also alleged that the Congress has made a “back-door deal” with the BJP to not raise the issue of farmers’ protests separately and aggressively inside Parliament. “AAP MPs were thrown out of Parliament and the Congress saw everything but did not speak a single word in favour of the farmers. This clearly shows that there is a back-door deal between the BJP and the Congress regarding the farmer issue,” AAP leader Sanjay Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/civic-body-not-giving-dry-ration-in-schools-aap/article33745441.ece

04 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Keep tabs on clearance conditions for projects: NGT||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Union Environment Ministry to take urgent steps in revamping the monitoring mechanism for compliance of conditions mentioned in the environmental clearances granted to projects and industries. A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to ensure proper constitution of District Environment Impact Assessment Authority in States. “Apart from other measures, the MoEF needs to take urgent measures to revamp the monitoring mechanism in a time-bound manner in the interest of safety and health of the citizens and protection of the environment so as to ensure monitoring of compliance of environmental clearances conditions of at least “red” category industries, not less than once in a quarter,” the Bench said. The green panel also directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State pollution control boards to take measures in conducting monitoring of environmental clearances conditions at their level, once every quarter, for all “red” category industries. The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Sandeep Mittal, seeking stricter mechanisms to ensure compliance of conditions mentioned in environmental clearances granted for projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/keep-tabs-on-clearance-conditions-for-projects-ngt/article33745446.ece

04 February 2021||Guwahati,||Assam-Mizoram border school damaged in blasts||A school on the restive Assam-Mizoram border was damaged in two bomb blasts triggered by unidentified miscreants on Wednesday afternoon. The incident happened almost seven months after another school was blown up amid a violent border row. Pabindra Kumar Nath, SP of southern Assam’s Hailakandi district, said the blasts had damaged the Muliwala Lower Primary School on the Assam side of the border. The school is about 12 km from the nearest police station at Ramnathpur. “The situation is tense but under control. We have increased security,” said Mr. Nath, who inspected the school with Deputy Commissioner Megh Nidhi Dahal. On July 10, miscreants allegedly from Mizoram had blown up the Upper Painom Lower Primary School in the adjoining Cachar district of Assam. It was the second border area school to have been bombed in more than a fortnight. The decades-old dispute had flared up on October 17 when miscreants set some 20 shops and houses ablaze and 50 people were injured in attacks and counter-attacks. Assam-based organisations retaliated by imposing an economic blockade against Mizoram. The blockade was lifted on October 22 but the situation deteriorated again on October 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-mizoram-border-school-damaged-in-blasts/article33745128.ece
