08 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||7 killed after ‘glacial burst’ in Uttarakhand||Seven persons were killed and over 125 reported missing after a “glacial burst” on Nanda Devi triggered an avalanche and caused flash floods in Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on Sunday. The number of missing persons could rise as details were still being ascertained, Uttarakhand Chief Minister T.S. Rawat said at a press conference in Dehradun in the evening. Videos of gushing waters and rising dust went viral on social media as flood warnings were issued in downstream Uttar Pradesh for what was described as a “glacial burst” by the Centre’s National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba. Cause under study Mr. Rawat, on his part, was more circumspect about the cause of the flooding in the eco-sensitive Himalayan region, where environmentalists have warned against the construction of dams for decades. “Experts will tell us about the cause behind the disaster,” the Chief Minister told reporters. At least 15 persons had been rescued till Sunday evening, Uttarakhand Director-General of Police Ashok Kumar said in a tweet. “Rescue operations are going on,” he stated. Mr. Kumar said seven bodies had been recovered so far and around 100 people were still missing. The missing persons include two policemen and five villagers, he said. He said work on the 900 m-long Tapovan tunnel of the NTPC had to be halted due to a rise in water level. “We were able to dig 150 m of the tunnel but after a rise in water level we had to halt the work. Most missing persons were working at the two projects; they came from across India. We expect to get a clear picture on their identities by Monday morning,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu . He added that a timely warning to residents living downstream to evacuate had saved many lives. While the Rishiganga hydel project had an installed capacity of 13.2 megawatts (MW), the 520 MW NTPC Tapovan-Vishnugad project on the Dhauliganga was much larger. Both sites have been virtually washed away, an eyewitness told this newspaper. Earlier in the day, Mr. Rawat said people along riverbanks were being evacuated. Dams in Shrinagar and Rishikesh were emptied out, Mr. Rawat said as the raging waters made their way downstream. By late afternoon, the flow of the Alaknanda, of which the Dhauliganga is a tributary, had stabilised. Apart from the local police and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), four columns of the Army were also deployed for rescue operations as some 35 people are believed to be still trapped inside the Tapovan project tunnel. There is no danger of downstream flooding and the rise in water level has been contained, as per information given by the Central Water Commission, the NCMC statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/7-killed-after-glacial-burst-in-uttarakhand/article33777839.ece
08 February 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata stays away from Modi’s project inauguration event||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday inaugurated a number of projects relating to the Ministry of Petroleum at Haldia in the State’s Purba Medinipur district, which included an LPG import terminal, and the 348 km-long Dobhi-Durgapur natural gas pipeline. Even as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee gave the government event a miss, her party MP Dibyendu Adhikari was present. Mr. Adhikari, Lok Sabha MP from Tamluk in the district, is the brother of Suvendu Adhikari, who recently defected from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The development triggered speculation over whether Mr. Dibyendu Adhikari was defecting to the BJP, too. Speaking at the event, Mr. Modi said that a gas-based economy was the need of the hour and the Centre was working to develop West Bengal as a major trading and industrial centre. “The 348-km Dobhi-Durgapur pipeline will directly benefit not only West Bengal but also 10 districts of Bihar and Jharkhand. The construction work provided 11 lakh man-days’ employment to locals. This will also provide clean piped LPG to kitchens, and enable clean CNG vehicles. Sindri and Durgapur fertilizer factories will get continuous gas supply,” the PM said. The Prime Minister pointed out that the Ujjawala Scheme had resulted in much higher coverage and demand for LPG in the region. “In the last six years, LPG coverage in West Bengal jumped from 41% to 99%. Ninety lakh free LPG connections were given to women in West Bengal, which includes more than 36 lakh women belonging to the SC/ST category,” he said. Emphasising that steps have been taken to modernise Kolkata’s Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust (earlier the Kolkata Port Trust), Mr. Modi called for the strengthening of the Haldia Dock Complex’s capacity, and its connectivity with neighbouring countries. He also laid the foundation stone of the second catalytic-isodewaxing unit of Haldia Refinery, and dedicated to the nation the four-lane ROB (road overbridge)-cum-flyover at Ranichak, Haldia, on National Highway 41. The Trinamool Congress leadership accused the BJP government of politicising the government event as the speech of the Prime Minister at a political rally held before the event was telecast during it on a giant projector. TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the party would not respond to the allegations made by the Prime Minister at the BJP rally at Haldia on Sunday because of the natural disaster in Uttarakhand that had claimed many lives. The TMC would respond to the allegations on Monday, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mamata-stays-away-from-modis-project-inauguration-event/article33778021.ece
08 February 2021||Kolkata,||Modi kicks off poll campaign in Bengal||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday kicked off the BJP’s poll campaign in West Bengal, invoking football analogy as he launched a scathing attack on the Trinamool Congress State government, accusing it of committing many “fouls”. “Bengal is a State that loves football. In the language of football, I want to say that the Trinamool Congress government has committed many fouls. There has been the foul of misgovernance, the foul of political violence and the foul of looting the money of the people. People are ready and will soon show them the Ram card,” Mr. Modi said, addressing a public rally in Haldia in the State’s Purba Medinipur district. The PM also alleged “a match-fixing between the Left and the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal”. “Any vote for Left and Congress will mean that we will fall into the trap of this match-fixing,” he said. Referring to the leaders defecting from the Trinamool Congress to the BJP, Mr. Modi said that those who want to do away with the “ Bua-bhatija (aunt-nephew)” government had said “Ram-Ram” (goodbye) to them [the TMC] and joined us [the BJP] saying Jai Shri Ram”. During his 40-minute speech, the Prime Minister targeted the Trinamool Congress government on various fronts, accusing it of denying the benefits of the PM Kisan and Ayushman Bharat schemes to the people of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modi-kicks-off-poll-campaign-in-bengal/article33777845.ece
08 February 2021||Pune,||Uddhav jettisoned his father’s principles for power: Shah||Launching a broadside against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday accused his estranged saffron ally of sacrificing late Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s principles for power. Rebuking Mr. Thackeray’s tripartite ‘Maha Vikas Aghadi’ government (comprising the Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress), Mr. Shah mocked it as “a three-wheeled autorickshaw” trundling aimlessly in three different directions. He said the BJP had made no ‘closed door’ promises to the Sena of offering the latter the Chief Minister’s post following the 2019 Assembly election. “Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena have jettisoned all of Balasaheb’s principles by forming an unnatural alliance with the Congress and the NCP in Maharashtra…They [the Sena] keep saying we have broken promises that we had allegedly given behind closed doors. I would like to emphatically say I have never indulged in ‘closed-door’ politics. I believe in transparency and making all promises on a public forum,” he said in Sindhudurg in the Konkan. Mr. Shah was inaugurating a medical college set-up by former Chief Minister and BJP MP Narayan Rane — a bitter critic and arch-adversary of the Chief Minister. “During the 2019 Assembly poll campaign, Uddhav Thackeray had sought votes with Narendra Modi’s larger photo on the Sena’s banner. Both the BJP and the Sena had campaigned to re-electing Devendra Fadnavis…At that time, the Sena did not complain. I repeat, there was no such promise [of the Chief Minister’s post] given to the Sena,” Mr. Shah said, adding that the people of Maharashtra would never forgive Mr. Thackeray for his sly politics of power. Mr. Shah said the Sena had betrayed a ‘pure’ electoral mandate handed by the people of Maharashtra to forge an opportunistic alliance with the ideologically opposed NCP. “The BJP could have swept the 2019 polls had it contested on its own strength and employed the Sena’s stab-in-the-back tactics…the Sena would then have been finished in the State.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uddhav-jettisoned-his-fathers-principles-for-power-shah/article33778288.ece

In a brief video message after he was set free, the 32-year-old comedian said, “I don't want to comment [on the case against him] now. But I have full faith in the judiciary and I am hopeful of getting justice.” Arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, Mr. Faruqui was in the jail since January 1. Interim bail On Friday, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail after the Madhya Pradesh High Court rejected his bail plea on January 28. The apex court also stayed the production warrant issued against Mr. Faruqui by a court in Prayagraj in connection with an FIR lodged there. However, he was released only after a Chief Judicial Magistrate in Indore rang up the jail authorities and asked them to check the Supreme Court’s website for the bail order. Media persons had gathered outside the Indore Central Jail after getting the news of his release, but according to some eyewitnesses, Mr. Faruqui walked out quietly to avoid a backlash in the wake of the accusations made against him. Mr. Faruqui and four others were arrested following a complaint by Eklavya Singh Gaur, the son of a BJP legislator, that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year’s Day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/have-full-faith-in-judiciary-says-faruqui-after-release/article33778052.ece

The focus of his speech in poll-bound Assam’s Dhekiajuli, a tea-growing area, was on the tea plantation workers, a major chunk of voters that the Bharatiya Janata Party had weaned away from the Congress ahead of the 2016 Assembly election. “I want to tell you about a conspiracy hatched to defame the country. The conspirators have not even spared Indian tea. They are saying the image of Indian tea has to be defamed worldwide, systematically,” Mr. Modi said.

08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Huge turnout of women farmers at mahapanchayats||A huge turnout of women farmers on Sunday marked the mahapanchayats or gatherings against the farm laws in Haryana’s Jat belt, and among the Meo Muslims of the Mewat region in Rajasthan. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, addressing the gathering in Haryana, said that the agitation was a mass movement and would not fail. The two massive rallies, held simultaneously, were addressed by prominent farmer leaders spearheading the agitation, including BKU (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal and BKU general-secretary Yudhvir Singh, apart from Mr. Tikait. Representatives of khaps, religious leaders, and political leaders were present. Speaking at Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri, Mr. Tikait said the ongoing agitation was a movement for the farmers’ freedom and did not belong to a particular caste or community. “It is a mass movement. It will not fail,” he asserted. Mr. Tikait said the khaps had fought against the Mughals and the British, and that they were still relevant and must stayed united. “They tried to divide Punjab and Haryana. They might try to create differences among khaps as well,” he said. Mr. Tikait said the present regime was pro-businessmen and they were in the “business of hunger”. “They will increase the price of food as hunger rises. But food cannot be kept locked inside a vault,” he said. Mr. Pal said 500 farmer unions had come together to fight against the farm laws. Mr. Rajewal said a movement reached its logical conclusion when the energy of the youth and the experience of the elderly came together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/huge-turnout-of-women-farmers-at-mahapanchayats/article33777841.ece

Shylaja called them for talks. The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) said in a statement here on Sunday that they had decided to defer the strike after receiving formal intimation for talks on February 10 from the office of the Health Minister.

Doctors are boycotting all academic activities, including teaching, internal examinations and official meetings. They are also boycotting pay ward admissions and special duties. If no positive outcome comes of the talks on February 10, the KGMCTA would go ahead with its decision to launch an indefinite strike from the very next day. The medical college faculty has been on strike since January 29, protesting against the government’s refusal to implement the pay revision of doctors, which has been delayed by over five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/doctors-defer-plan-for-indefinite-stir/article33778180.ece

However, the court barred the Minister from interacting with the media till the above date. Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu delivered the verdict after hearing the arguments on a house motion petition filed by Mr. Reddy on Saturday evening against the SEC order to the Director General of Police to restrict the Minister’s movements. A main point in the Minister’s petition was that he needed to leave his residence on Sunday morning to receive President Ram Nath Kovind at the Renigunta airport. Appearing for the Minister, senior advocate C.V. Mohan Reddy said the impugned action was beyond the jurisdiction of the SEC and in violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Senior lawyer B. Adinarayana Rao told the court that the SEC’s order was necessitated by the Minister’s exhortation to election authorities to defy the orders of SEC, which adversely affects the conduct of elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-rejects-sec-order-restraining-minister/article33777757.ece

08 February 2021||CHENNAI,||6 properties of Sudhakaran, Ilavarasi confiscated||The Chennai district administration on Sunday announced the confiscation of six properties owned by V.N. Sudhakaran and J. Ilavarasi, both relatives of V.K. Sasikala, a former aide of the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The properties were confiscated pursuant to a February 2017 Supreme Court order upholding the conviction of the two, along with Ms. Sasikala, in a disproportionate assets case in which Jayalalithaa was the prime accused. Incidentally, the action came a day ahead of Ms. Sasikala’s arrival in Chennai from Bengaluru. The properties are located in Wallace Garden and Alwarpet. According to sources, Chennai Collector R. Seethalakshmi would lead a team of officials that would visit Wallace Garden on Monday to kick-start the maintenance of the properties by the government. The government would take a decision on the line agency responsible for the maintenance of the properties shortly. Revenue officials said this was perhaps the first time that a property was being confiscated in connection with a corruption case in the State. “We did not have a precedent. So, we had to take a decision based on discussions with the Advocate General. The properties may be handed over to a government agency for maintenance,” an official told The Hindu.  A press release from the Chennai Collectorate said one of the properties on Wallace Garden First Street, covering six grounds and 1,087 sq ft with an undivided share of land measuring 581 sq ft, was acquired on April 28, 1994. Three more properties on the same road, which were also registered on the same day, were on the list of confiscated properties. Additional buildings constructed on Wallace Garden First Street have also been confiscated. A two-storeyed house at Sriram Nagar on TTK Road in Alwarpet, measuring 4,300 sq ft of built-up area in two grounds and 1,237 sq ft of land, has also been confiscated. Officials said the market value of the six properties was estimated at Rs. 25 crore. The guideline value of one sq ft of land on Wallace Garden First Street is Rs. 6,030. The classification of the properties by the Registration Department is commercial class I type II, signifying a high real estate value. Some of the buildings have reportedly been rented out to a hospital. The rent would be collected by a government agency, in the light of the announcement on confiscation, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/6-properties-of-sudhakaran-ilavarasi-confiscated/article33777948.ece

08 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala saw more home deaths in 2020||Even when the Kerala government has sought solace in the apparent reduction in all-cause mortality in the State in 2020 as an affirmation of the excellent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care provided during the pandemic, the civil registrations data does not tell the full story. Analysis of the State’s birth and death registrations for 2020 shows that except in two districts, there is an unusual increase in the proportion of the people who died at home during 2020, both in urban and rural areas. The data throws open the question of whether COVID-19 led to the denial of medical care to the elderly and terminally ill in the pandemic year. The attention of the public health system had veered towards COVID-19 care all through 2020 and it’s probably the other side of the story that is being revealed. “It is true that the fear of COVID-19 kept people from visiting hospitals even when they were sick. Also, government medical colleges, general hospitals, and district hospitals in all districts were converted to exclusive COVID hospitals,” a public health expert says. Many doctors have highlighted how the follow-up treatment of many with chronic kidney diseases and cancer was compromised during the pandemic. “It is possible that because of the COVID situation, a lot of chronically ill patients were not given adequate medical attention. We should introspect on whether preoccupation with COVID and our failure to create alternative systems of care have led to this increase in home deaths,” he says. In the U.S. and Europe, nearly half of the COVID-19 casualties were in care homes. But in Kerala, there were few such deaths. Given the high health-seeking behaviour in the State, if the proportion of those who died outside hospitals is higher in 2020, it indicates that the deaths occurred at home probably due to delay in decision-making. The fear of family members contracting COVID-19 from hospitals too could have influenced their decision to not move the elderly to hospitals. “We need more transparency in data management. Everything surrounding COVID has assumed political overtones, and this has prevented an honest appraisal,” says V. Ramankutty, a public health specialist. Former Director General of Police Jacob Punnoose said on Facebook that it might be too early to draw conclusions on the 2020 mortality figures. “Lockdown and containment zone regulations would have affected prompt reporting of deaths,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-saw-more-home-deaths-in-2020/article33777773.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Experts point to climate change impact||A deluge that resulted from a glacial melt on Nanda Devi flooded the Rishiganga river in Uttarakhand and washed away at least two hydroelectric power projects — the13.2 MW Rishiganga hydroelectric power project and the Tapovan project on the Dhauliganga river, a tributary of the Alakananda. There were also concerns that the excess water would further travel downstream to the river Alaknanda and threaten villages as well as hydro projects on the river. However the India Meteorological Department has said that no rains are forecast. Officials of the Central Water Commission meanwhile said the flooding from the glacial burst has been contained. Environmental experts have attributed the Nanda Devi glacial melt to global warming. Glacier retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to decrease the stability of mountain slopes and increase the number and area of glacier lakes, according to the latest assessment reports of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There is also high confidence that the number and area of glacier lakes will continue to increase in most regions in the coming decades, and new lakes will develop closer to steep and potentially unstable mountain walls where lake outbursts can be more easily triggered. Farooq Azam, Assistant Professor, Glaciology and Hydrology division, IIT Indore, said such a glacial burst was an “extremely rare event”. “Satellite and Google Earth images do not show a glacial lake near the region, but there’s a possibility that there may be a water pocket in the region. Water pockets are lakes inside the glaciers, which may have erupted leading to this event. We need further analysis, weather reports and data to confirm if this indeed was the case,” he said. Climate change has driven erratic weather patterns like increased snowfall and rainfall, warmer winters has led to the melting of a lot of snow. The thermal profile of ice, say experts, was increasing. Earlier the temperature of ice ranged from -6 to -20 degree Celsius, it is now -2 making it more susceptible to melting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-point-to-climate-change-impact/article33777776.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Disinvestment will be squeaky clean’||The government will adopt a ‘squeaky clean process’ for the privatisation of public sector enterprises as per the new policy unveiled in the Budget, said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, the top Finance Ministry official entrusted with steering the disinvestment process. “For the first time after 2004, you will have a set of privatisations starting with Air India and BPCL as the large ones… We are very clear this has to be squeaky clean process so that no one can question its credibility,” Mr. Pandey told The Hindu on the execution plan for the disinvestment policy that envisages the government exiting a large chunk of the 439 central public sector enterprises (PSEs) in the country. “We want it to be absolutely squeaky clean and for that, even I won’t know the names of the bidders. We won’t even fix the reserve value till the time financial bids are locked. If someone gets some information on the reserve price somehow, it would make it an unfair advantage for that bidder,” said Mr. Pandey, who is the Secretary for the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). Some of the strategic sales of public sector enterprises, sold in the early 2000s during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee administration, had faced post-deal scrutiny from investigative agencies and auditors for several years. In September last year, a special CBI court had asked the agency to file criminal cases against former Union minister Arun Shourie and former Disinvestment Secretary over the sale of a luxury public sector hotel in 2002. “We are saying let’s do it in such a manner so that any entity that looks at it says that there cannot be a better process in the world than this. When we are inviting global investors, they won’t come if they feel there’s something wishy-washy here,” Mr. Pandey said. Top bids “We want wholehearted bids, with whoever is willing to pay more winning. Our focus is maximisation and we are not keeping too many entry barriers, including technical criteria, as it creates a problem if you say only a particular industry player can come. That will restrict value and allow existing groups to dominate. That’s not how it works anymore as companies with capital can hire professional experts and CEOs,” he pointed out. “Capitalism is full of upsets and such upsets should occur here too,” he underlined. The new disinvestment policy goes further than the past case-by-case approach, and straightaway allows the sale or closure of nearly 151 PSUs (83 holding companies and 68 subsidiaries) in non-strategic sectors, he said. It also covers banks and insurers for the first time, with two public sector banks and one general insurer proposed to be sold in 2021-22. “Some of them will be closed if nobody’s interested in them. If they can’t fend for themselves, then I think they might as well close. Certainly, the government is not supporting them anymore,” he said, citing the decision to close Scooters India after no one evinced interest in buying it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disinvestment-will-be-squeaky-clean/article33777793.ece
08 February 2021||Guwahati,||Will protect image of Indian tea, says Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said some forces abroad were conspiring to tarnish the image of Indian tea. The focus of his speech in poll-bound Assam’s Dhekiajuli, a tea-growing area, was on the tea plantation workers, a major chunk of voters that the Bharatiya Janata Party had weaned away from the Congress ahead of the 2016 Assembly election. “I want to tell you about a conspiracy hatched to defame the country. The conspirators have not even spared Indian tea. They are saying the image of Indian tea has to be defamed worldwide, systematically,” Mr. Modi said. He was addressing a crowd of largely tea plantation workers after remotely inaugurating and laying the foundation stones of a medical college each in eastern Assam’s Biswanath and Charaideo and Assam Mala, an expansive road project. “The evidence that we have suggests the forces are seated abroad, ready to launch an attack on India’s tea-based identity,” the Prime Minister said. He added the tea plantation workers and every individual who drank tea would seek an explanation from the political parties for maintaining silence on it. “But I want to tell the conspirators that the country won’t allow you to succeed, however much you try. The tea workers will win this battle. Those who are conspiring to launch an attack on Indian tea are not strong enough to confront the strength of our tea workers,” Mr. Modi said, without naming the forces. The Prime Minister underlined the steps being taken by the BJP-led Assam government to improve the lives of the tea workers. He referred to the Cha Bagichhar Dhan Puraskar Mela (cash award fair for tea workers organised on Saturday) during which the State government transferred Rs. 3,000 each to the bank accounts of 7.47 lakh tea plantation workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-protect-image-of-indian-tea-says-modi/article33777800.ece
08 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Job scheme quota goes up for Kerala||With a notable surge in demand for jobs in the post-pandemic scenario, Kerala’s allocation of jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for the financial year 2021-22 has been enhanced to 10 crore person days from the 8 crore person days last year. An empowered committee of the Ministry of Rural Development took the decision early this week. This is the first time that 10 crore person days of work has been approved for the State. According to MGNREGS State mission officials, there has been a sharp rise in the job cards issued as well as the person days of work awarded this year in the State, owing to the post-COVID-19 economic situation. 2.2 lakh new job cards “We issued around 2.2 lakh new job cards this year, which is quite unusual. It shows that there is a huge demand for jobs in the rural regions. This could be fuelled by job losses in several sectors as well as the return of Non-Resident Keralites without much savings from their previous jobs. For the first time, we will probably be crossing 10 crore person days of jobs provided in the State in a year, by March. The previous highest was after the floods of 2018-19, when we hit 9.75 crore person days,” said an official of the MGNREGS State Mission. Meanwhile, the State government has increased ex gratia payment for deaths or permanent disability of employees caused during MGNREGS works, from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 75,000. The payment has to be paid within five days of the accident. The government has also eased the procedure for claiming medical aid in case of accidents. “Till now, there has been a lack of clarity as to at which level the aid should be cleared and who should carry out the checks. Due to this, applications for treatment aid has been piling up in some places. Now, almost everything can be cleared at the panchayat level, with a certificate from a government medical officer,” said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/job-scheme-quota-goes-up-for-kerala/article33778209.ece
08 February 2021||Bengaluru,||At massive rally, Kurubas seek ST tag||In a show of strength to demand Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, members of the Kuruba community, including three Ministers in Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s Cabinet, carried out a massive rally in the city on Sunday. Thousands of people from various districts took part in the rally held at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre ground, off Tumakuru Road. The rally, which was led by Niranjanandapuri Swami of Kaginele Gurupeetha, Eshwarananda Swami, and other seers, saw participation by political leaders cutting across party lines. Ministers K.S. Eshwarappa, N. Nagaraju (MTB), and R. Shankar, former Ministers A.H. Vishwanath, H.M. Revanna, and Bandeppa Kashempur, and Kurubara ST Horata Samiti president K. Virupakashappa were among those present. Leaders of the community urged the State government to recommend to the Centre inclusion of the Kuruba community in the ST list. Sri Niranjanandapuri Swami said the rally had received overwhelming response from the community and the fight would continue till the governments meet the demand. Prior to the rally, religious leaders had led a padayatra from Kaginele to Bengaluru to mobilise support. The 340-km padayatra started on January 15 and culminated on February 4 at Freedom Park in the city. In his address, Mr. Vishwanath said the community meets all the parameters to be considered as a Scheduled Tribe and there was no need of an anthropological study for considering the community as ST. He urged the State government to immediately make the recommendation to the Centre. Ex-CM gives it a miss Without taking his name, Mr. Vishwanath took a dig at the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah — a prominent leader of the community — for not taking part in the rally. He said it was unfortunate that the former Chief Minister did not take part in the event despite taking all support from the community. Mr. Siddaramaiah had distanced himself from Kuruba stir seeking ST stag alleging that the RSS and the Sangh Parivar had a hidden agenda to divide the community. He, however, has maintained that he is not opposing the community’s demand. Mr. Virupakshappasaid lack of political will was the reason for the delay in Kurubas in the State getting the ST tag.  On behalf of the government, Revenue Minister R. Ashok received a memorandum from the organisers. Traffic congestion As thousands of people thronged the ground by travelling by buses and other vehicles, traffic was thrown out of gear on Tumakuru Road. People going from the city towards Nelamangala and those coming from Nelamangala side towards the city faced congestion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/at-massive-rally-kurubas-seek-st-tag/article33777763.ece
08 February 2021||Dehradun,||New lease of life for workers rescued from the tunnel||Covered in mud, several men were safely pulled out one after the other from a slush-covered tunnel by Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel in the Tapovan area on Sunday. In a video shared by the force, the rescuers can be seen raising slogans of ‘ Dum lagakey haisha ’ while retrieving a couple of men through the vertical and narrow snout of the tunnel with the help of a rope line. Euphoric leap Those present at the spot motivated the men in action with ‘ Bahut badhiya ’ and ‘ Shabaash ’, ‘ Jo bole so nihaal ’ and ‘ Jai ho ’ slogans. A worker rescued from the tunnel was seen taking a euphoric leap as the ITBP personnel patted his back in recognition of the grit and endurance displayed by him. “ Apna bhai aa gaya [our brother is back],” said a local, who works in the project area, as another official summed up the mood saying “ Nayi zindagi mili [those rescued got a new life]”. Multiple teams, with personnel wearing protective gear and helmets, were rushed to the Tapovan power project site from their 1st battalion base in Joshimath and the ITBP mountaineering and skiing institute, located nearby in Auli, for search and rescue work. Armed with mountain rescue gear, ropes, pulleys and carabiniers, the ITBP men were seen taking out the workers and putting them on stretchers that they brought along with them. ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said in Delhi that his personnel stationed at the Joshimath base heard a “large bang and screams of people” shortly after 10.45 a.m. when the tragedy is stated to have struck the two dam sites near the Raini village in Chamoli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-lease-of-life-for-workers-rescued-from-the-tunnel/article33777827.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Tapovan hydel project entirely washed away||Venudhar Nayak, Commanding Officer of the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) who led the rescue operation at the tunnel of the NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project, where 12 workers were rescued after a seven-hour operation on Sunday, said the project was completely washed away, and the few houses that remain undamaged on the site were covered in slush up to 20 feet deep. Over hundred persons are missing after the flash flood, caused by the splintering of a glacier, washed away two hydel power projects — the Rishiganga small hydro project and the National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan project on the banks of the Dhauliganga river in north Uttarakhand. Mr. Nayak, whose team of 250 personnel were the first to reach the Tapovan project, said it took them seven hours to unblock the tunnel where 12 persons were struck. “At least eight persons were able to escape after the flood occurred and before the tunnel was blocked. We reached here at 11.30 a.m. and by 6.30 p.m., we were able to rescue all the 12 persons,” Mr. Nayak told The Hindu over the phone from the accident site. He said the team was now rushing to another tunnel, four kilometres away where 50 people are said to be trapped. Mr. Nayak’s unit is posted 15 km from Tapovan. He said as the ITBP was a mountain force, they had all the equipment to carry out the rescue work. Explaining the ground conditions, he said the two tunnels, where workers were still stuck, are part of the dam structure and used to dispose waste water from the power plant. “When the gush of water came, around 20 people were working in one tunnel and 50-60 workers in the second tunnel. Eight workers managed to escape from the first tunnel and remaining 12 were rescued by the ITBP team. 12 people could escape from the second tunnel and around 50 are still trapped, here the Army is working and we are on way to help them,” he said. Mr. Nayak said that of the 12 rescued, three were critical and had been rushed to the ITBP’s hospital nearby. He said the night could prove to be challenging but they were geared to work through the night. “We have dragon lights to help us navigate and we also have powerful lights connected to gensets. Phone and electricity connection is working fine. We are glad that we could save lives,” he said. Mr. Nayak said the Rishiganga power project uphill that was the first one to be hit due to “glacial burst” was completely washed away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tapovan-hydel-project-entirely-washed-away/article33777780.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||I was against power projects on Ganga, says Uma Bharti||BJP leader Uma Bharti on Sunday said the Uttarakhand flood tragedy triggered by a glacier burst was a matter of concern as well as a warning, and added that as a Minister she had spoken against having any power project on the Ganga and its major tributaries. Ms. Bharti was the Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation during the first term of the Modi government. Massive crisis In a series of tweets in Hindi, she said the glacier breaking off had damaged a power project, triggering the massive crisis. This tragedy that had happened in Rishiganga in the Himalayas was a matter of concern as well as a warning, she said. “When I was a Minister, my Ministry, in its affidavit about the dams in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas, had requested that it is a very sensitive region, and, therefore, power projects should not be built on the Ganges and its main tributaries,” the BJP leader said. She said the electricity shortfall caused by that decision could have been met by the national greed. Ms. Bharti said she was in Uttarkashi on Saturday and was now in Haridwar. Largescale devastation A part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off at Joshimath in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on Sunday, leading to a massive flood in the Dhauliganga river and causing large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas. Over 150 labourers working at a power project in Tapovan-Reni are feared dead, an Indo Tibetan Border Police spokesperson said, quoting the project-in charge. Three bodies were recovered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-was-against-power-projects-on-ganga-says-uma-bharti/article33777783.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Afghanistan gets Covishield doses||Afghanistan received a large consignment of COVID-19 vaccines from India on Sunday. A special Indian aircraft carrying 500,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine from Mumbai reached Kabul, where officials of Afghanistan’s Health Ministry took charge of the consignment. The India-made vaccine is the first to reach Afghanistan as the country battles the pandemic. “Made in India vaccines reach Afghanistan. (We) stand with our friends, always,” External Affairs MinisterS. Jaishankar said in a social media message. The vaccine, made by the Serum Institute of India, has already been supplied to Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in South Asia. Ghulam Dastagir Nazari, head of the immunisation programme at the Health Ministry in Kabul, said the vaccines will be kept in storage till the country receives emergency approval from the World Health Organization (WHO). “The [WHO] certification is under way and hopefully, it will be done in a week and we will start the vaccination process in all 34 provinces,” Mr. Nazari said, according to news agency Reuters. India has already carried out capacity building workshops with Afghan health workers. “This will profoundly strengthen our efforts to tackle the spread of COVID-19. I express my deepest gratitude to our Indian allies for this timely, vital, initiative, exemplifying unique bond,” said Tahir Qadiry, Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy of Afghanistan in India after Kabul received the Indian shots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afghanistan-gets-covishield-doses/article33777791.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Selling family silver is a lazy allegation, says Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday rejected the Opposition’s charge of “selling family assets” through the Budget stress on privatisation, terming it a “lazy allegation”. All the previous governments have done disinvestment in the past, and the Narendra Modi regime has formulated a clear policy on which companies to be divested and the strategic sectors that not to be touched rather than doing one company sell-off at a time, she said in an address to businesses here. The Budget proposals to divest stakes, which includes the sale of two public sector banks and a general insurer, have been panned by the Opposition. “It is not what the Opposition says about selling family silver, it’s not at all,” she said addressing a meeting of business people here. “Family silver should be strengthened, it should be our takat (strength)... because you’ve spread it so thinly, there are many of them (PSUs) who are not able to survive and the few who can perform do not get the due attention. Our aim is to prime them through this policy. You need them, you need them to scale up so that they meet the aspirations of growing India,” she said. Ms. Sitharaman said despite reforms of the past, “socialist baggage” hindered businesses, and many State-run companies have been lacking professional expertise to grow. For many years, taxpayer money has been spent on recapitalising inefficient State-run companies and it is the government’s intent to ensure that the available resources are spent in the best possible manner, which can be done only by reducing the number of such enterprises, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/selling-family-silver-is-a-lazy-allegation-says-sitharaman/article33777798.ece

The country’s premier horticulture fair, which is being held both in physical and virtual formats for the first time, will showcase cutting edge technologies, crop varieties, pest and disease management practices and processing methods among others. The fair, which is being held under the theme ‘For start-up and stand-up India’ aims to increase farmers’ incomes by turning horticulture into a business enterprise especially in the wake of the recent trend of educated youth taking to farming. Limited entry While the entry of visitors has been restricted to 30,000 for five days, 8,000 farmers are expected to visit the NHF on the first day. The fair will have around 140 stalls related to horticultural crops, seeds and technologies. Farmers, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders will have to register on the NHF 2021 website https:// nhf2021.iihr.res. The salient activities of the fair will be an exhibition of stalls from public and private sectors, It will also showcase live demonstrations of improved varieties and technologies, and farmers-entrepreneurs-scientists’ interactions. It will also have sale of seeds, planting material and products from ICAR-IIHR and other public and private firms for the benefit of end users. Kailash Choudhry, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, will inaugurate the event virtually.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/five-day-national-horticulture-fair-begins-in-bengaluru-today/article33777905.ece
08 February 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Need to be alert to coronavirus mutations’||COVID-19 cases are declining along with incidence of hospitalisation and deaths in most places across the country. Yet, scientists have cautioned people not to let their guard down but continue to follow safety measures of wearing face masks, and maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing. “All indications are that the number of cases are becoming less and less, even if factoring the rapid antigen testing which has just about 50-60% accuracy. Importantly, the number of patients in hospitals are less and the number of deaths too has come down as is being indicated by sero-surveillance surveys. But, we need to be alert for any further mutations which could lead to more viral loads and infections,” says CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology Director Rakesh Mishra. This is because the evolution of the virus is such that “it wants to spread and hence, will keep creating variants without perhaps bothering the hosts yet could cause strong infectivity.” The present situation comes as a huge relief to everyone but it does not mean “we are safe as a nasty one could emerge as can be observed in the UK and other variants. Similarly, an independent variant could emerge from here and spread quickly,” he explains. The saving grace is that symptoms of the newer variants are similar even if the spread is faster. While there could be multiple factors leading to the reduction in the infection rate across the country despite fears of elections, festivals and agitations leading to a surge, the “good news”, according to Dr. Mishra, is that the new strains noticed have not led to any re-infections and are not bypassing the acquired immunity levels. Scientists the world over are poring through the genetic analysis of the different virus strains to understand the disease better as the long term effects on the brain, heart and other organs is not yet known. But, amid all these, the vaccination process initiated is vital, he asserted. “Even a few months of protection due to the vaccination may turn the tables, otherwise there is a chance for the virus to resurrect. Take it when your time comes,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/need-to-be-on-alert-for-coronavirus-mutations/article33778153.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Glacier collapse brings back memory of 2013 flash floods||Originating from Vasudhara Tal, perhaps the largest glacial lake in Uttarakhand, the Dhauliganga flows in a meandering course, which takes it through the Nanda Devi National Park. Known for its spectacularly beautiful route and whitewater rafting, the river turned into a deathly torrent on Sunday after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off and collapsed into it. The Dhauliganga, which merges with the Alaknanda, is one of the several tributaries of the Ganga, as the river flows down from the Himalayas and snakes its way through the plains. The tributaries intersect, flow into one another or meander away passing through several towns in five States. In Uttarakhand, the Ganga and its tributaries pass through important tourist places such as Rishikesh, Haridwar, Rudraprayag and Karnaprayag. Sunday’s collapse of the glacier led to rippling flash floods in the Dhauliganga and the Rishiganga and also impacted the Alaknanda. This also brought the spotlight on the 2013 flash floods in the hill States that wiped out settlements and killed over 5,000 people. Dhauliganga is joined by Rishiganga river at Raini, where the disaster at the power project dam took place. The river takes a V-turn and continues to flow in the opposite direction, toward north, as the Dhauliganga for another 30-odd km, through Tapovan, until it is joined by the Alaknanda at Vishnuprayag near Joshimath. There it loses its identity and the Alaknanda flows southwest — through Chamoli, Maithana, Nandaprayag, Karnaprayag until it meets the Mandakini river, coming from the north at Rudraprayag. After subsuming Mandakini, the Alaknanda carries on past Srinagar, before joining the Ganga at Devprayag near Kedarnath. Alaknanda then disappears and the mighty Ganga carries on its journey, first flowing south then west through important pilgrimage centres such as Rishikesh and finally descending into the Indo-Gangetic plains at Haridwar. Still on a southern course, the Ganga goes past Bijnor when it loops back on an easterly course toward Kanpur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/glacier-collapse-brings-back-memory-of-2013-flash-floods/article33777778.ece
08 February 2021||Madurai,||India has transgressed LAC more often than China: Singh||India has transgressed more times than China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), but the government does not announce it, Union Minister of State for State Transport and Highways V. K. Singh said on Sunday. Speaking to the media in Madurai, the former Army chief said the border with China had never been demarcated. China had transgressed many times over the years with its own perception of the LAC. “Similarly, none of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it,” Gen. Singh (retd.) said. “Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” he added. Over a period of time, China has been attempting to expand its area by taking advantage of its perception of the LAC. Its troops would make camp stay, strengthen it and after negotiation, it would go back partially. “But, the present government has ensured that this does not happen,” he added. Stating that China had transgressed in Eastern Ladakh in 2020, Mr. Singh said India had warned it with equal measures. “Today, China is under pressure, since we are sitting at places (along the border), where it does not like,” he said. China has realised that it was not easy any more to hit back at India. The Minister said India has hit Beijing economically by banning its apps and boycotting its goods. “All these affect them,” he added. Stating that things are very well under control in the border, Mr. Singh said, “The Chinese do understand that if something goes wrong, India is in a position to hit back.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-transgressed-lac-more-often-than-china-singh/article33777787.ece

About 32% of those who reached out were students. The Kiran helpline (1800-599-0019) of the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) of the Ministry was launched on September 7 by SJE Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot. From September 16, 2020 to January 15, the helpline received 13,550 new calls, of which 70.5% were from males and 29.5% from females, the report said. A total of 1,618 follow-up calls were fielded by the mental health professionals of the helpline, it said. The majority of callers (75.5%) were in the age group of 15 to 40 years, while 18.1% were older, in the 41 to 60 age group, it said. Categorising the callers, the report said, 65.9% had “milder nature of distress”, while 26.5% were “moderately distressed” and 7.6% were “severely distressed”. The report said 32.3% of the callers were students, 15.2% were self-employed, 27.1% were employed, 23.3% were unemployed, 1.4% were home-makers and 0.7% did not reveal the information.

Speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, a clinical psychologist of the DEPwD working on the helpline said most of the calls had been from “young adults”. Students were facing anxiety and depression due to the uncertainty about their future and lack of interaction with peers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychologist said. Another psychologist working at regional centre of the DEPwD fielding calls from Haryana, said students were the largest group of callers. The psychologist added that women from rural areas had reached out to the helpline with complaints of anxiety and disturbances within families. The 24/7 helpline offers early screening, psychological first-aid, psychological support, distress management, mental well-being, psychological crisis management services and referrals to mental health experts and is operated by 81 front-line professionals, apart from volunteer psychiatrists, clinical and rehabilitation psychologists, the Ministry report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/men-access-mental-health-helpline-more/article33777789.ece
08 February 2021||BENGALURU,||Ukraine looking at defence purchases from India||Ukraine is looking to procure some military hardware from India in addition to efforts to deepen its presence in the Indian defence market, said Yuriv Husyev, General Director of Ukroboronprom, the umbrella corporation of Ukrainian state defence companies. The two sides will discuss a range of proposals to take forward bilateral cooperation at the Bilateral Working Group meeting between the two defence Ministries in April. The Ukrainian delegation for this would be led by their Deputy Defence Minister. “Yes, we had some discussions about cooperation in Navy and Air Force. I guess we have a lot of work to do… We have some ideas and will discuss these ideas in Ukraine in Ministry of Defence and armed forces of Ukraine,” Mr. Husyev said, speaking to The Hindu at the Aero India on Ukraine’s interest in acquiring military equipment from India. Ukraine has signed four agreements worth $70 million which includes sale of new weapons as well as maintenance and upgrades of existing ones in service with the Indian armed forces, he stated. Some members of the Ukrainian delegation will remain in India for a few days to carry out further discussions on the four agreements.

08 February 2021||Kozhikode,||Kerala BJP wants law against ‘love jihad’||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran has said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will bring in a legislation against ‘love jihad’ similar to what was done in Uttar Pradesh if the coalition comes to power in Kerala. He told the media on Sunday that all the Devaswom boards in the State would be dissolved if the coalition came to power. Mr. Surendran demanded that both the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) clarify their stand on the ‘love jihad’ issue. He accused them of maintaining silence even after Christian congregations raised apprehensions over it. Mr. Surendran alleged that a section of minorities were being discriminated against while implementing policies designed for them. Even though the heads of Christian churches had highlighted this during their interaction with the Prime Minister, the leading political fronts in the State had not clarified their stand, Mr. Surendran said. He alleged that temples were facing destruction because political parties were trying to control the Devaswom boards. The BJP would try to free temples from political interference. “We will hand over the temples to devotees,” Mr. Surendran said. He dared political parties which claimed to stand for the devotees to declare in their poll manifesto that the boards would be liberated from political interference. Fooling people The BJP leader alleged that both the LDF and the UDF were trying to fool the people in the name of Sabarimala in view of the upcoming Assembly elections. Both of them changed their stand on their issue following the devotees’ protests. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had positioned himself against the devotees. None of the Congress leaders had sought protection of customs and no cases were registered against them, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-bjp-wants-law-against-love-jihad/article33777760.ece
08 February 2021||ALAPPUZHA,||Coconut climber wins Kerala govt. award||Forty years ago, K. Sasi chose to become a coconut plucker. He loved his job and never turned back. Now 60, Mr. Sasi is on cloud nine after bagging the ‘Thozhilali Sreshta’ award of the State government last week. “I am a coconut tree climber and never expected to win an award. It is a great gesture on the part of the government to recognise people like me,” says Mr. Sasi, a resident of Mampuzhakari in Kuttanad. Instituted by the Department of Labour and Skills, he won the accolade comprising a cash prize of Rs. 1 lakh and citation. Mr. Sasi started climbing coconut trees at the age of 20 with a machete tucked to his back and using two small loops of rope — one around his feet gripping the front of the tree and the other he carries to hold on to the trunk. The sexagenarian still practices the traditional method of coconut plucking and scales the dizzy heights of the trees with relative ease, which helped him win the laurel. “I am always happy that I chose coconut plucking as my career. It helped me build a house and educate my two children. The award is a cherry on the cake,” he says. According to him, a lot has changed in the past 40 years with regard to wages and harvesting of coconuts. “When I embarked on a career in coconut plucking, I would get 20 paise a tree. Nowadays I receive Rs. 50 a tree. Introduction of coconut tree climbing machines was a game-changer. Traditional climbers and methods will soon become a thing of the past,” he says. Mr. Sasi climbs around 30 trees daily and fetches Rs. 1,500. He says that despite the good pay, the educated younger generation, including his own children, is not keen on considering it a career. “An award like this will help change the perspective of society towards jobs like tree climbing and attract youngsters to the profession,” he adds. 15 in award glory In a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country, a total of 15 labourers from the private sector were given the ‘Thozhilali Sreshta’ award by the government based on their skills. The winners were selected from various sectors, including security guard, headload worker, construction worker, toddy tapper, housemaid, salesman/woman and so on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coconut-climber-wins-kerala-govt-award/article33777771.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Dhauliganga’s water level breaches records’||The water level of Dhauliganga river at Joshimath flowed at a perilously high level, breaching all records, Central Water Commission officials said after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district leading to massive floods. The glacial burst triggered an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations and trapped more than 100 labourers who are feared dead. The intensity of the river’s flow in a short span of time was such that it engulfed whatever came in its way. This was a grim reminder of the Kedarnath deluge of 2013, which led to widespread devastation in the ecologically fragile Himalayan region. “At 11 a.m., the water level recorded at Joshimath was 1,388 m,” Saumitra Haldar, Chairman, Central Water Commission, said. During the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods, the highest flood level (HFL) at Joshimath was 1,385.54 m, he added. However, by 6 p.m. on February 7, the water level of the river had reached the normal levels recorded a day before, said Rajesh Kumar, the superintendent engineer (Upper and Middle Ganga division) of the Central Water Commission. He said water levels have started receding. At Joshimath, which bore the fury of floods, the water level recorded at 1 p.m. on February 6 was 1,372.58m. At 6 p.m. on February 7, hours after the disaster, the water level was 1,375m. In Nandprayag, at the lower stretches of the river, the water level at 6 p.m. was 840.40m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhauligangas-water-level-breaches-records/article33777829.ece
08 February 2021||Kannur,||MP sees regularisation bid in Kerala Bank||K. Sudhakaran, Congress MP, has alleged a move by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to regularise its supporters who are working on daily wages in Kerala Bank. He told mediapersons on Sunday that the proposed recruitment would fill 1,000-odd vacancies. “We will protest strongly if the government does not go back on the move,” he said. ‘Cheating the jobless’ “The Left Democratic Front (LDF) is cheating the unemployed. The government is planning recruitments like this at a time when millions are out of work. This will be the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) campaign weapon this election,” Mr. Sudhakaran said. On the Sabarimala controversy, the MP said that religion and faith were paramount in the country. The Congress leader said he firmly believed that there was nothing wrong in his reference to the family background of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Two days later, Mr. Vijayan admitted that he was proud of it. He said the only question was why the Chief Minister was late in responding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mp-sees-regularisation-bid-in-kerala-bank/article33778207.ece

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||7 killed after ‘glacial burst’ in Uttarakhand||Earlier in the day, Mr. Rawat said people along riverbanks were being evacuated. Dams in Shrinagar and Rishikesh were emptied out, Mr. Rawat said as the raging waters made their way downstream. By late afternoon, the flow of the Alaknanda, of which the Dhauliganga is a tributary, had stabilised. Apart from the local police and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), four columns of the Army were also deployed for rescue operations as some 35 people are believed to be still trapped inside the Tapovan project tunnel. There is no danger of downstream flooding and the rise in water level has been contained, as per information given by the Central Water Commission, the NCMC statement said. “There is also no threat to neighbouring villages. At the same time, the concerned agencies of the Centre and the State were asked to keep a strict vigil on the situation, and a team from DRDO, who monitor avalanches, is being flown in for surveillance and reconnaissance,” it added. One motorable road and four suspension bridges connecting around eight villages in the area with the district headquarters have also been washed away by the avalanche. Mr. Rawat said the authorities had not been able to assess the damage caused yet as the administration was busy with rescue operations. He announced compensation of Rs. 4 lakh each to the families of those who perished in the disaster. A tweet from PM Modi’s official handle announced that a sum of Rs. 2 lakh would be given from the PM’s Relief Fund to the families of the dead and Rs. 50,000 each to the families of the injured for the avalanche caused by the “glacial breach”. Mr. Modi, who was in Assam and Bengal, spoke to the Uttarakhand CM twice. “Deeply worried about the glacier burst near Joshimath, Uttarakhand, that caused destruction in the region. Praying for well being and safety of people. Am confident that rescue and relief operations on ground are progressing well,” President Ram Nath Kovind said in a tweet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/7-killed-after-glacial-burst-in-uttarakhand/article33777753.ece
08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Huge turnout of women at mahapanchayats||“It is a mass movement. It will not fail,” he asserted. Mr. Tikait said the khaps had fought against the Mughals and the British, and that they were still relevant and must stayed united. “They tried to divide Punjab and Haryana. They might try to create differences among khaps as well,” he said. Mr. Tikait said the present regime was pro-businessmen and they were in the “business of hunger”. “They will increase the price of food as hunger rises. But food cannot be kept locked inside a vault,” he said. Mr. Pal said 500 farmer unions had come together to fight against the farm laws. Mr. Rajewal said a movement reached its logical conclusion when the energy of the youth and the experience of the elderly came together. Farmer leader Raju Maan said the massive turnout at the mahapanchayat proved that not only the farmers but their children were also awakened, and they would not stop till the government bowed to their demands. At Rajasthan’s Bharatpur, Maulana Arshad of the Meel Kheda madrasa, presiding over the rally, said the Mewat region’s people would fight to protect agriculture, which was the mainstay of their livelihood. BKU leaders Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Yudhvir Singh affirmed that farmers were willing to talk to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre if the latter had “genuine intentions”. Mr. Tikait’s son Gaurav Tikait, his close aide Ghulam Mohammad Jola, and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Ravan, also addressed the mahapanchayat. Mr. Jola said the farmers’ agitation had strengthened the bonds among different communities, which were earlier disturbed after the Muzaffarnagar violence of 2013. Three Congress MLAs from Haryana — Aftab Ahmed (Nuh), Mamman Khan (Ferozepur Jhirka) and Mohammad Ilyas (Punahana) — attended the mahapanchayat in a show of solidarity with the farmers’ demands. Mr. Ahmed said his party would continue to support the farmers until the controversial legislation was withdrawn. Haryana Kisan Sabha vice-president Inderjit Singh was also present. Earlier, a 50-year-old farmer from Haryana’s Jind was found hanging from a tree on Sunday morning. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bahadurgarh, Pawan Kumar said the farmer had left behind a note demanding the repeal of the three laws.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Modi kicks off poll campaign in Bengal||The PM also alleged, “a match-fixing between the Left and the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal”.  “Any vote for Left and Congress will mean that we will fall into the trap of this match-fixing,” he said.  Referring to the leaders defecting from the Trinamool Congress to the BJP, Mr. Modi said that those who want to do away with the “ Bua-bhatija (aunt-nephew)” government had said “Ram-Ram” (goodbye) to them [the TMC] and joined us [the BJP] saying Jai Shri Ram”. ‘PM Kisan denied’ During his 40-minute speech, the Prime Minister targeted the Trinamool Congress government on various fronts, accusing it of denying the benefits of the PM Kisan and Ayushman Bharat schemes to the people of the State. “I feel a lot of pain that even in the distressing times of corona, lakhs of farmers of the State have been deprived of the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Not a single farmer got the benefit because the State government here refused to join the scheme. Now that the farmers here have decided to teach the Trinamool Congress government a lesson, the State government with little intent has sent a letter saying that they want to join the scheme,” he said. The Prime Minister promised that after the BJP government was formed in the State, the implementation of the PM Kisan scheme would be approved and all the pending benefits that could not reach the farmers would be paid to them. About 70 lakh famers have not received seveninstalments adding up to Rs. 14,000 under the PM Kisan scheme over two-and-a-half years, according to the BJP. The Trinamool Congress government has started the Krishak Bandhu scheme in which Rs. 5,000 is paid annually to farmers in the State. ‘Defaming nation’ Mr. Modi also made a direct attack on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. “In Bengal, if people ask Didi about their rights, she gets angry. Even if someone raises the slogan ‘ Bharat Mata ki Jai ’, she gets upset. But she remains silent when there is a conspiracy to defame the country,” he said, making an oblique reference to the developments on January 23, when Ms. Banerjee was upset by the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans raised at Victoria Memorial. Mr. Modi said that those behind the “international conspiracy” to defame the country had become so desperate that they were targeting tea and Yoga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-kicks-off-poll-campaign-in-bengal/article33777774.ece

The Minister emphasised that the Centre had taken steps in the past in the interest of the poor and vulnerable rural population. Taking on the criticism by the Congress on the lowering of the MGNREGA expenditure in the Budget for 2021-22, the Minister said this government had been increasing expenditure unlike them who would cut at the Revised Estimate stage. Giving an example, he said that against the Budget Estimate of Rs. 60,000 crore in 2019-20, the spending was raised to Rs. 71,001.81 crore under the MGNREGA head as there was an increase in demand. In the current fiscal, it had been raised massively from Rs. 61,500 crore to Rs. 1,11,500 crore to create additional jobs in the rural areas for those who had lost employment due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, he told PTI. “During the lockdown, most of the workers had gone home. So, it was more important to provide jobs in rural areas. With unlocking taking place, workers are returning back to their work. So the requirements may not be that huge. However, we may increase if there is demand,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-may-hike-nrega-spend-if-need-arises/article33777794.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao to fight against the proposed privatisation of Vizag Steel Plant, stating that this could not be seen as an isolated incident. “There are several public sector units like BHEL and BDL in and around Hyderabad. If TRS and Mr. KCR do not raise their voice now, the same problem may hit Telangana next,” warned Mr. Raghavulu, while speaking to reporters here on Sunday after the district committee meeting. He said that the CPI (M) would extend it support to the ongoing agitation for protection of the Vizag Steel Plant in AP. Referring to the ongoing agitation by farmers at New Delhi for the past 73 days, Mr. Raghavulu alleged that the government has been treating farmers as people from enemy country. “Erecting barricades and fencing, digging trenches and hitting nails was nothing but treating farmers as enemies. This was not right on the part of the Union government. It can repeal the present Acts as demanded by the farmers and can make new laws by convincing farmers and other stake holders,” he said adding that farmers have repeatedly clarified their objections issue-wise including that of MSP. On the budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Mr. Raghavulu said that injustice was meted out to both the Telugu states and there were no allocations for either Polavaram or Kaleshwaram. He said that the Union government has failed to fulfil the promises made during the division of united Andhra Pradesh. The CPI (M) leader said that more allocations were made to states going for elections. Earlier in the day, Mr. Raghavulu participated at the party workers’ meeting and urged them to fight against the misrule of BJP at the Centre alleging that it has been using religion to get popular support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kcr-should-raise-his-voice-against-vizag-steel-plant-privatisation-move/article33778300.ece

The hydro power plants in the affected area are mostly under-construction or fall in the small hydro project category, which are of up to 25 MW. These small hydro projects are mainly state-owned. An official, on condition of anonymity, told PTI, “The local authorities have shut two power plants, Tehri and Koteshwar, as a precautionary measure in view of the disaster.

08 February 2021||Hyderabad,||Irked over succession talk, KCR pulls up ministers, MLAs||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday spewed fire at TRS leaders for raising the talk that he was to step down and pave way for his son and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao to take over the mantle. Mr. Rao talked tough to ministers and MLAs at the executive meeting of the party, as he went to the extent of saying that he would not spare anyone of them if they continued to make ‘mindless’ comments. They would be suspended from the party. He said he would remain Chief Minister for 10 more years as he was completely fit. Seeking to know why they indulged in such loose talk, Mr. Rao asked them to check their utterances as it was harmful otherwise. He promised to take them into confidence if at all he wanted to quit State politics and enter the national arena. He was more interested in serving the State and the party. It was not as easy to lead a party as “singing a song” or “running a pan shop”. Sources said Mr. Rao used strong words expressing his resentment at the leaders suggesting that the change of guard was imminent. “Do you want me to quit?” he asked. He later summoned ministers Eatala Rajender, E. Dayakar Rao and T. Srinivas Yadav and Deputy Speaker T. Padma Rao to his chambers in TRS office after the meeting to pull them up for airing their views. Mr. Rao informed the executive that he wanted to withdraw from politics like Mahatma Gandhi after Telangana got Statehood, but was compelled to take the seat of Chief Minister due to apprehensions that the State might go into disarray if he was not at the helm. He was never interested in being targeted by all and sundry. Membership drive On organisational matters, he announced the launch of TRS membership drive with a target of 50,000 members per Assembly constituency from February 12. The constitution of party committees from village to State level will commence from March 1. District in-charges of party will be appointed for the purpose. Expressing dismay at the high-handedness of TRS MLAs in some districts, he asked them to give a dignified place to party leaders at lower levels as they were all part of the team. The victory of MLAs in the next elections was dependent on the contribution of second and lower rung leaders. He assured tickets to sitting MLAs in the next elections unless they fared badly and failed to mend their behaviour. If it came to picking up alternative candidates, he would consult leaders in constituencies before changing MLAs. Mr. Rao said he would allot quotas to MLAs to sanction double bedroom houses. The government proposed sanction of Rs. 10,000 crore for the development of SCs and STs. He would tour districts to hand over pattas for podu lands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/irked-over-succession-talk-kcr-pulls-up-ministers-mlas/article33777823.ece

08 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I waived crop loans as a farmer: CM||AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday rejected DMK president M.K. Stalin’s contention that the AIADMK government was only implementing schemes that he had suggested. “Mr. Stalin has been claiming that I waived outstanding crop loans [from cooperative institutions] only after he suggested it. I am a farmer. I waived the outstanding crop loans only because I intended to remove all challenges facing farmers,” Mr. Palaniswami said during his election campaign at various places in Tiruvallur district. According to him, Mr. Stalin had been mentioning the things that he [Mr. Palaniswami] has been implementing. The AIADMK is in a position to implement the scheme while the DMK can only keep talking but never implement them, he said. While parties had made various promises in their election manifestos, it was only the AIADMK that had waived outstanding crop loans, even without mentioning it in its manifesto, Mr. Palaniswami said. The government had waived the loans after looking into the hardships faced by farmers. “Not all farmers who have taken loans from cooperative banks are from the AIADMK. They are all farmers,” he said, countering a related charge made by Mr. Stalin. There was no discrimination of farmers on political lines. He said that during the DMK regime, the police had opened fire on farmers who were demanding a reduction in power tariff by a paise for every unit. “Farmers will not forget the incident. It was our Amma [Jayalalithaa] who awarded compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to families of those killed in the incident,” he said. The government was chalking out a plan for a scheme under which it would procure produce from farmers directly and export them, he said. Helpline to be launched Criticising Mr. Stalin for receiving petitions in a box during campaigns, he said the government would launch a mobile phone-based grievance redressal system within a week, through the 1,100 helpline. “Gone are the days when you have to submit your complaint in a box. Everyone has a mobile phone these days. Just one photo is enough. It will come come directly to the Chief Minister,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami also accused the DMK of not being genuinely interested in the release of the seven life convicts in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The Chief Minister reiterated his charge that the DMK was promoting dynastic politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-waived-crop-loans-as-a-farmer-cm/article33777965.ece

08 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T. Nagar’s Smart City makeover still remains a work in progress||The makeover under the Smart City Project is still a work in progress in T. Nagar as parking problems, unauthorised hawking and the presence of garbage and debris continue to plague the pedestrian plaza. The multi-level car park has not been inaugurated yet and several rounds of inspections have been undertaken. Even on Saturday, officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation inspected the facility and equipment to ensure it was in working order. They said they wanted to be completely sure there would be no hitches after it was launched. During night, at least 25 people use the plaza to sleep. While older citizens complain of poor maintenance, youngsters believe things will be sorted out over time. A traffic police stand, which was uprooted from Venkatnarayana Road, has remained unattended for several months. Though swanky lamp posts have been installed, some do not function, rued a 77-year-old resident of the locality. Across several stretches of the newly laid footpath, construction debris and junk have begun to pile up. On Pinjala Subramaniam Street, huge wooden crates have been stored. On Sivagnanam Street, debris of roads dug for the work under the Smart Cities Project lines an entire stretch. Along the junction of G.N. Chetty Road and Theagaraya Road, vehicles that have been seized by the police have been dumped. I. Selvabavaani, of Saidapet, who walks on the plaza with her friend Poornima Nandakumar, of T. Nagar, at least thrice a week, said: “There are homeless people. Unless we solve the problem of homelessness, we cannot complain.” The plaza was well-maintained, an official said. “It is cleaned by two agencies. The idea is that when the first walker comes, the plaza should be clean. We have introduced three toilets. More are on the anvil along the Usman Road stretch,” he added. According to officials from the Smart City Project, a dedicated space for parking police vehicles is under consideration. An official said apart from cleaning the debris from the footpath, thermoplasting of the damaged roads would also be taken up shortly. Across the entire stretch of Usman Road, Venkatnarayana Road and Theagaraya Road, vending and non-vending zones would be provided. “A person doing business in the non-vending zone will be removed,” an official said. The Smart City Project also included improvements to Madley Road and Ranganathan Street, where novel makeovers were being planned, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/t-nagars-smart-city-makeover-still-remains-a-work-in-progress/article33777984.ece

In the last five years, 392 juveniles were involved in different crimes in the North Zone, which has a total of 31 police stations. Though there are 19 police boys clubs functioning in the zone to prevent youngsters from falling into the wrong hands, the police felt that a lot of improvement was needed. “Now we have started 18 more police boys and girls clubs and 10 more are in the pipeline. As of now, we keep them engaged in the evening hours through literary and sports activities. But we felt that they need a role model to look up to, identify their talents and help them focus on their goal,” said V. Balakrishnan, Joint Commissioner of Police, North Zone. For this purpose, 18 staff from the Police Department have come forward as volunteers. “They are policemen and women qualified in computer science, English and other specialisations. They will spend a few hours each day in the clubs and help the children identify their skills,” he added. Based on this, new programmes would be launched. “If a boy or girl is keen on photography, we will start photography classes. If they wish to appear for UPSC exams, we will give them coaching. We will help them achieve greater heights in their area of interest,” added Mr. Balakrishnan. He said once the children were on track, they could never be lured by criminals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-personnel-to-turn-mentors-for-boys-and-girls-clubs/article33777989.ece
08 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TNRERA directs builder to compensate and refund 12 home buyers||The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA), Chennai, has directed a developer to pay compensation of Rs. 50,000 each to 12 homebuyers and refund the amounts already paid for the non-delivery of flats. In separate petitions, the homebuyers said they had booked flats at ‘Brindhavanam’, a residential project in Kundrathur developed by M/s Sri Lakshmi Builders Pvt. Ltd., and paid an advance and other amounts as per the construction agreements entered into with the builder. According to the petitioners, the agreements were signed between August 15, 2012 and September 25, 2013, and the deadlines for the delivery of the flats fell between January 14, 2014, and February 25, 2015. The home buyers sought compensation and other forms of relief. In its response, the developer alleged that the delay was due to a failure on the part of the home buyers to make further payments as and when they were sought, and that the home buyers were liable to pay interest for the delayed payments. With these contentions, the developer sought the dismissal of the petitions. The TNRERA noted that the homebuyers had paid 85%-100% of the construction cost, and that the terms of the construction agreements were overwhelmingly one-sided in favour of the builder. “There is not even a single clause giving the homebuyers the right to claim compensation or damages for delay on the part of the builder,” it noted. Pointing out that one clause provided for the payment of interest at 24% per annum by the homebuyers for delayed payments, the Authority said that as per a Supreme Court verdict, the builder cannot seek to bind the buyer with one-sided contractual terms. It noted that the homebuyers were eligible for a refund of the amounts paid with interest of 10.05% per annum, and entitled to a sum of Rs. 20,000 each towards litigation expenses. The TNRERA also ruled that the developer was entitled to interest of 10.05% per annum on the delayed payments, and could adjust the amount from the compensation to be paid out to the homebuyers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/builder-directed-to-refund-12-home-buyers/article33777990.ece

For those from Classes 10 and 12, campuses threw open their gates in January, after nearly 10 months of closure due to COVID-19. School Education Director S. Kannappan said schools had been asked to continue implementing the standard operating procedure (SOP) for COVID-19 safety, issued ahead of their reopening in January. “Additionally, we have directed schools that do not have enough teachers or classrooms to accommodate students in smaller batches to explore the option of having classes on alternate days or in a shift system. Schools are permitted to work six days a week,” he said.

08 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Avadi Corporation likely to reclaim its landfill by year-end||Avadi is inching closer towards its goal of becoming a zero-waste locality. The Corporation has processed nearly 70% of the garbage heaped in the Sekkadu dump yard through bio-mining and expects to reclaim the landfill by the year-end. The Corporation has also introduced concepts such as raising poultry in its micro composting centres as part of the process of composting wet waste. The civic body is implementing a bio-mining process, wherein garbage is segregated and dry waste is separated for recycling, at its 7.7 acre site, located 10 km from Avadi. About 70% of the 64,000 cubic metres of garbage accumulated over the past two decades had been processed so far using machinery, officials said. The reclaimed landfill may be used as a resource recovery centre for segregation and disposal of e-waste or for developing a Miyawaki forest, officials noted. On average, Avadi generates 90.7 tonnes of garbage daily and the Corporation managed to collect nearly 90% of the waste from the doorsteps of residents. Of the nearly 45 tonnes of biodegradable waste generated daily, about 35 tonnes is processed at the 16 micro composting centres being operated across the Corporation and converted to 4 tonnes of manure daily. Officials said while this was mostly being distributed free of cost to farmers, it was also being sold at Rs. 3 per kg to residents and distributed to sanitation workers as well. Similarly, sanitation workers were allowed to segregate dry waste and sell recyclable materials, and non-saleable materials were sent to various places like cement factories in Ariyalur and Ambattur. Chicken being raised In a micro composting centre at Arundathipuram, officials adopted a novel concept wherein country chicken are being raised for the past few months. “We now have about 70 country chicken that are used in the composting process of wet waste. They help reduce wet waste and also clean up worms that may infest the compost,” said M. Abdul Jaffer, a sanitary inspector. There were plans to divert them to other centres and initiate sale of eggs once it developed into a poultry farm in six months, he added. To create awareness about the quality of the manure produced and to encourage roof gardens, the Corporation has set up terrace gardens at its office buildings and provides about 50 kg vegetables, including brinjal and tomato, every week, officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/avadi-corpn-may-reclaim-landfill-by-year-end/article33777987.ece

08 February 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||When a proposal for sub-quota was rejected||Ahead of the Assembly election, the PMK is negotiating hard with the ruling AIADMK for exclusive reservation for Vanniyars in government jobs and higher education. Against this backdrop, it will be interesting to note that in 2011, a move to recommend a 12% sub-quota for the Most Backward Community was shot down by members of the State Backward Classes Commission. The exclusive sub-quota was mooted by Justice M.S. Janarthanam (retd.), then Chairman of the State Backward Classes Commission. The episode has been vividly recalled by retired IAS officer M. Rajendran, then the State’s Commissioner of Backward Classes and member-secretary of the Commission, in his memoir, S eyale sirantha sol . It happened in 2011, immediately after the Jayalalithaa government assumed office. The members of the Commission included former Vice-Chancellors of the University of Madras, S.P. Thyagarajan and R. Thandavan [then a professor], professor D. Sundaram, professor V.M. Muthukumar and former MLAs K.R. Muruganandam and V. Elumalai. The recommendation was sought to be made just 10 days before the Commission’s tenure was due to end, Mr. Rajendran says. “Justice Janarthanam told us that even though former Chairmen of the Commission faced opposition from other members, it was the Chairman’s recommendations that the government ultimately accepted. But I told him that as member-secretary, I would not allow that to happen. If there is a law and order issue, the Chief Minister will only question me. Then I expressed my dissent and signed against the recommendation; other members also did the same,” he says. He recalls that the meeting was called at short notice at the Commission’s office in Chennai, but it had to be shifted to a meeting hall at a nearby hotel. “Four members travelled with me in my car and I explained to them the recommendation... I also told Justice Janarthanam that the move was not necessary, as the Commission had just 10 days left,” he writes. However, Mr. Janarthanam reiterated his stand, saying it could be submitted to the Chief Minister the next day. Mr. Rajendran advised against it on the ground that a similar order for sub-quota, issued by the Andhra Pradesh government, had been struck down by the Supreme Court. The Chairman said he had gone into all details and requested Prof. Sundaram to sign his draft report. The latter, too, said it was not necessary. “When I told the Chairman that the recommendation would turn the State upside down, he said it could be proposed as a sub-quota,” Mr. Rajendran says. Professor Muthukumar too was unhappy. Prof. Thyagarajan also supported Mr. Rajendran’s argument.  Following this, all members signed in dissent. “I called the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s secretary and explained the situation. Then I informed the Chairman that his appointment with the Chief Minister had been cancelled.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/when-a-proposal-for-sub-quota-was-rejected/article33777968.ece

On Sunday, many cycling enthusiasts and commuters promptly arrived at Egmore Metro station with smart bikes and took a ride. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), before COVID-19, a lot of commuters would pick up cycles from stations and travel but this changed after service resumed following the lockdown. “Initially, patronage took a hit. We had only 10,000 people and we did not have takers for cycles. But this is changing now and we do see some commuters using cycles and Smart Bikes from our stations. Right now, the patronage is growing and we touch about 55,000 a day in the weekdays and as this grows further, we will certainly see more people using smart bikes and cycles. We want to promote clean energy and are happy when commuters show interest with in non-motorised modes of transportation,” an official said. CMRL officials are also planning to let commuters carry cycles in trains like they used to before the pandemic. “It was quite popular and people are very keen on using it again. We are considering restoring this option soon,” another official said. There are 200 smart bikes in 20 Metro stations, apart from the ones in residential and commercial spots. The system is popular in stations, including Anna Nagar East, Shenoy Nagar, Thirumangalam, Nehru Park, Kilpauk and Koyambedu. D.V. Manohar, chairman of Smart Bike Mobility, said providing a non-motorised option to travel for last mile connectivity was extremely important. “Since we are providing high-quality next generation smart bikes, commuters have to put less effort to pedal. We sanitise the vehicles everyday. We want to bring down the pressure on public transport,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/smart-bikes-take-off-again-post-lockdown/article33777975.ece

The Kasimedu fishing harbour sends around 500 tonnes of dry fish to Thoothukudi, from where it is sent to Sri Lanka. Nanjil Ravi of Akhila Indhiya Meenavar Sangam said there were at least 10 traders, who depended on the dry fish trade with the island nation. “The ban on dry fish imports from India was supposed to be only for 100 days and it began in November. The time limit is over now, which is why we are asking that the ban be lifted,” he said. Many types of Dry fish, including maasi karuvaadu, made from Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna, thenna koni and nethili , are processed and sent from Kasimedu. “About 150 containers of dry fish at the Thoothukudi harbour are waiting to be sent to Sri Lanka. The government is asking us to take up deep sea fishing but if we do not have the market for our catch, what is the use? Fishermen have stopped going on deep sea trips since we already have a lot of unsold dry fish,” a trader said. He also said Sri Lanka had been buying dry fish from other countries. “Usually, the dry fish sent from here is repacked and sent to other countries. Even that has stopped now,” he added. Officials in the Fisheries Department said it was an internal policy decision of the Sri Lankan government. “It was supposed to protect their economy that has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Union Commerce Department has taken this up with the Sri Lankan government. We have requested them to lift the ban,” he said.

Nagar can look forward to better parking facilities, said officials working on the Smart City Project. After the lockdown was lifted, the pedestrian plaza has started receiving vehicular traffic. Although parking slots have been provided during festive occasions, the crowd spills over to the neighbouring streets, causing difficulties to residents. “Soon, we will be introducing clamping with the help of police to curb haphazard parking. Vendors will help police in clamping and towing,” an official said. On whether the rules will apply to residential areas around the plaza, the official said in any advanced city every spot is either a parking, no parking or stand only zone. “If we did not have attendants or white lines, no one will know where to park. Henceforth, any vehicle in violation will get clamped. It is in the interest of the vendor to ensure parking is proper as they too will not get paid. Enforcement is part of the whole game. Residential or not, wherever there are parking zones, the rules will apply,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/parking-regulations-to-be-tightened-in-t-nagar/article33777981.ece

Sasikala from using the AIADMK flag in her vehicle and also restricted the number of vehicles following her from Bengaluru to Chennai to five. The Krishnagiri police on Sunday issued notice to K.S. Arivazhagan, AMMK district secretary, making it clear that no vehicle including that of Ms. Sasikala shall use the AIADMK party flag. Only five vehicles would be allowed to follow her car and others would be stopped. Bursting crackers, playing of music, erection of arches/banners/etc. would not be permitted. The instructions were issued in view of the prevailing law and order situation and also COVID-19 safety measures and any violation would attract legal action as per law, the police said in the notice. A special team has been formed to intercept her when she crosses the Tamil Nadu border and insist on the removal of the party flag from Ms. Sasikala’s vehicle. Senior Ministers had complained to the DGP about the misuse of the flag by her a week ago upon her release from a Bengaluru prison. “Using the ruling party flag might create confusion and lead to a law and order problem. Huge police deployment has been planned along the route from the State border with Karnataka till Chennai to prevent any untoward incident en route,” a police officer said. DGP J.K. Tripathy reviewed the arrangements with senior police officers, including Special DGP (Law & Order) Rajesh Das, Commissioner of Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, IGP/Chief of Intelligence Eswaramoorthy and others. In Chennai, sources said no permission had been sought for any rally or meeting by AMMK cadre or Ms. Sasikala’s supporters. Police sources did not rule out the possibility of Ms. Sasikala attempting to visit the AIADMK headquarters to pay tributes to Jayalalithaa’s statue. Banners, flags and other temporary structures along the route would be removed, they said. Ms. Sasikala is likely to leave the resort near Nandi Hills after 9 a.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-police-restrain-sasikala-from-using-aiadmk-flag/article33777947.ece

We have named it as Passiflora shervarayensis because we found it in the Servarayan Hills and presented it at the International Conference on Innovative and Emerging Trends in Botany in 2019, held at Alagappa University, Karaikudi,” said S. Abdul Kader, Assistant Professor of Botany, Presidency College, who is the leader of the team that found the plant. The other members of the team are S. Sunil Kumar, Siddha Central Research Institute, Arumbakkam, M. Senthil Kumar, Department of Botany, Vivekanandha College for Arts and Sciences for Women (Autonomous) Erode and a research student S.A. Wasim Akram. “We first found it in a coffee estate in Yercaud and again in Servararayan hills during our subsequent visits. We checked the existing literature on plant species and herbarium collections and could not find any description of the new species,” Mr Abdul Kader said. He said the genus Passiflora L. belonging to Passifloraceae family contains about 550 species and are distributed mostly in the Americas. “Only about 20 species occur in India, China, Southeast Asia, Australia and in the islands of Oceania. Of the 20 species, only two of them are native to India. Now we have found one more native species,” he explained. Asked how did he come to the conclusion that it was a new native species, Mr Kader said of the 13 species so far documented in Tamil Nadu 12 were exotic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-climber-plant-found/article33777998.ece

08 February 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. steps up tax collection drive||With less then two months to go for the financial year end, the Coimbatore Corporation has stepped up tax collection drive. As of January 31, the Corporation had collected 69% of its property tax demand for the current financial year. It had collected Rs. 117 crore of Rs. 170 crore. To increase tax collection for both the current year’s demand and arrears, the Corporation was taking several steps, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said and added that he had asked every bill collector to show at least Rs. 1.50 crore collection a day in the coming days. There would be special drives and without harassing assessees as well. Sources familiar with the special drives said the Corporation had opened special collection centres at a few places across the five zones where assessees who were yet to pay tax could pay. Those centres would remain open on all days until the financial year end and the Corporation by way of public announcement had alerted residents to the news of the opening of such centres. Likewise, the Corporation was also conducting special weekend camps. Revenue wing officials in-charge of the zone concerned would decide on the location, alert the assessees about the camp and ensure collection, the sources said and added that the location of the weekend camps depended on tax collection percentage from that locality. Poorer the collection more the camps, they pointed out. In a few places, the Corporation had also deployed laptop, printer and internet connection for property owners to pay tax either by cash or cheque. The Corporation staff manning the mobile collection centre would immediately credit the cash paid and issue receipt. If it was cheque, the Corporation would issue receipt after realisation. The sources said in wards that were at the bottom of the tax collection table in a zone, the officials mobilised all bill collectors in the zone for door-to-door collection. After collecting the tax, they would make a mark on either the door or nearby to alert the next team so that a resident who had paid was not disturbed again. In a few cases, the Corporation had also sent reminder notices to high tax assessees, the sources added. The aim was to have at least 80% of the tax collected by February second or third week, said a senior official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-steps-up-tax-collection-drive/article33778006.ece

Ramakrishnan. He told presspersons here on Sunday that during the pandemic it was not only the workers - local and migrant - but also the MSMEs that were hit hard. The death of an MSME unit owner here, who reportedly took his life because of the hardships he faced due to the pandemic, reflects the problems faced by the units. The Central and State governments extended several incentives to large corporate companies. But they had not supported the MSMEs. The governments should take responsibility for the deaths of MSMEs unit owners such as the one who died here last month. Instead of meeting the MSME unit owners during the elections, the governments should waive the loans taken by these units, allocate adequate funds, and extend the moratorium period for repayment of loans. Only then would the MSMEs be able to protect the jobs of thousands of workers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/governments-have-failed-to-support-msmes/article33778009.ece

08 February 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Forest Dept. plans rescue centre to house crocodiles||The Forest Department has planned to set up a Crocodile Rescue Centre in Chidambaram to address the issue of crocodiles making foray into human dwellings on the banks of the Old Kollidam river and to ensure rehabilitation of the reptiles in the facility before they are released safely. The move is spurred by frequent incursions of crocodiles into human habitations, particularly in Chidambaram. Frequent incidents of crocodiles straying into human settlements have sent a chill down the spine of people in many villages, including Sivayam, Perampattu, Keezhkundalapadi and Nandimangalam, on the banks of the Kollidam. Forest Department sources said that about 10 incidents of crocodile attacks were reported in the last few years. Two died in the last two years while a few others were incapacitated in these attacks. According to District Forest Officer Abhishek Tomar, “While proper attacks are rare, small incidents are reported once in three months. We are currently working on the proposal modelled on the lines of the Crocodile Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Sathanur in Tiruvannamalai district and it will be sent to the Forest Department headquarters for approval.” He added: “The proposed facility likely to be set up in an expanse of five hectares will comprise ponds and enclosures for the reptiles and round-the-clock medical care. The Department will also be requesting trained manpower and equipment for the facility.” Home to reptiles Forest Department sources said that the Old Kollidam that flows through Chidambaram town and Anaikarai near the district border is home to a large number of crocodiles. During monsoon when the river is in spate, the reptiles are displaced by the gushing water. As a result, the department receives frequent calls from the locals on crocodiles entering the localities. Frequent warnings Though the Forest Department has been issuing frequent directives to those living on the banks of the river to exercise caution and follow precautionary measures, people are yet to realise the gravity of the situation. Dumping of poultry and meat waste and bathing on the banks lure the reptiles into human habitations. On information, the department staff capture the reptiles and release them into the Vakkramari tank, located about 10 km from Chidambaram. The tank that supplies drinking water to Chidambaram town is maintained by the municipality. The move is resorted not only to keep the reptiles away from human habitations but also to safeguard the tank. Though the tank has a large number of crocodiles, there have been no instances of attack on humans. But the reptiles still manage to enter human habitations due to numerous channels connecting the tank. According to K. Raman, a herpetologist and founder of Indigenous Biodiversity Foundation (IBF), a non-governmental organisation, “Bamboo groves abutting the banks of the Kollidam river are the favoured basking and nesting sites of the crocodiles. However, increased human activity along the banks, including washing and bathing and dumping of waste, has become rampant raising the possibility of conflicts.” The establishment of a rescue centre has been a long pending demand for the locals and officials hope that the facility would offer a permanent solution to the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-plans-rescue-centre-to-house-crocodiles/article33778334.ece

08 February 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Cancellation of gram sabha meeting delays establishment of tribal school in STR buffer zone||The establishment of a government tribal residential school at Vilankombai is delayed further as the mandatory resolution necessary for starting the school has not been passed due to the cancellation of gram sabha meeting. The tribal settlements --Vilankombai with 38 families and Kembanur with 10 families -- are located inside the buffer zone of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve in T.N. Palayam Range. The villages can be reached only after passing through the six-km forest area from Vinobanagar. The hamlets have no regular schools. A special training centre run under the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) at Vilankombai meets the education needs of children from Classes I to VIII. Since students have to trek 10 km through dense forest to reach the nearest school in Kongarpalayam, most of them discontinue studies and take up menial jobs. The long demand of the villagers for a school in the hamlet finally saw light on September 11, 2020, when School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan announced the establishment of a school at Vilankombai. The Forest Department had demarcated 50 cents of forest land for setting up the school. However, a resolution needs to be passed in the gram sabha meeting in the Kongarpalayam Panchayat in T.N. Palayam Panchayat Union for starting the school. But due to cancellation of the meeting, setting up of the school is being delayed. Officials from the District Education Office had last week identified 34 children at Vilankombai and 10 children at Kembanur for admission to a primary school. They had also issued no-objection certificate for starting the school. The Forest Department had requested District Collector C. Kathiravan to conduct a special gram sabha meeting to pass a resolution to begin the construction of the school.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cancellation-of-gram-sabha-meeting-delays-establishment-of-tribal-school-in-str-buffer-zone/article33778124.ece

The judge observed that this should be done to enable private prosecution witnesses and independent witnesses to depose without any fear or influence of the local persons. The court was hearing a petition filed in 2014 by R. Senthilnathan of Tirunelveli. He sought a direction to be reinstated in the Police Department. He, along with another policeman, were alleged to have been responsible for the death of a fellow policeman in 2006 and were subjected to an inquiry. However, they were held guilty only on the charge that they failed to inform their superior officer about the death. In the sessions case, the accused were acquitted since the private prosecution witnesses turned hostile. The sessions case ended in acquittal. Justice Teekaa Raman said had the head of the department, the SP or the Commissioner taken out an application before the court for transfer of the sessions case to the neighbouring district, the result of the case could have been different.  The petition filed by the policeman was dismissed as devoid of merits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trial-involving-police-must-be-transferred-to-nearby-districts/article33777967.ece
08 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Complete bridge across channel’||Bringing relief to members of a Scheduled Caste in Pottalpatti, Madurai district, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed the district administration to complete a bridge across Thathankulam kanmoi channel. The members of a backward community had opposed the project that would connect a public pathway to a bus stop. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi observed that a public work should not be affected by individual views of a section of society, which were based on personal views touching upon community or caste. A benefit could not be denied on the sole ground that it was being opposed by persons belonging to some other community. The project had been contemplated and conceded to facilitate the needs of the general public and holding it up in view of the objections raised along communal lines could never be accepted, they said. Though a work order was issued as early as September 2019, it was yet to take off in view of the frivolous objections raised along communal lines. The proposal should be given effect within a period of four months, the judges said. Further, the judges made it clear that in case of any hindrance to the project, police could be used. The court was hearing the petition filed by M. Muthupandi of Madurai district who sought a direction to the authorities concerned to commence and complete the construction of the bridge across Thathankulam kanmoi channel. The petitioner said that the Scheduled Caste people were denied the basic right of access as no action was initiated by the authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complete-bridge-across-channel/article33778109.ece
08 February 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Efforts on to retrieve Katchatheevu’||Though the Centre is making sincere efforts to retrieve Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka, the issue is, as of now, frozen, according to Union Minister of State for Transport and Highways V.K. Singh. Speaking to media here on Sunday, Gen. Singh said nothing more had happened after whatever was negotiated by the two neighbouring nations during the ceding of Katchatheevu by India to Sri Lanka in 1974. “It is neither going to Sri Lanka, nor are we not saying that we are going to forcibly take it. We are not disturbing the agreement at all,” he said. Let the issue take its own time, he said, stating that certain things happening between two nations would take a lot of time. India was making sincere efforts to take back the island, the former Army General said, adding that India would have to wait for the Sri Lankan government to respond. “Though the present Sri Lankan government might appear not so friendly, at the moment it is quite friendly [with India]. It is to our benefit,” Gen. Singh added. When asked about the recent alleged attack on Tamil fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy, the Minister said things had changed a lot in the recent years. “Earlier, the Sri Lankan government would not release the boats of Indian fishermen seized by its navy. But now, most of the boats have been released,” he said. It was agreed that the Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries would meet once in six months to resolve the issues between the two nations. However, the problem was in the use of bottom trawling by some Indian fishermen, which would finish off marine life. The Indian government had so far spent Rs. 6,000 crore towards providing incentives to encourage fishermen to go for deep sea fishing, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-making-efforts-to-retrieve-katchatheevu/article33777959.ece
08 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Mixopathy will affect Ayurveda system of medicine the most’||The Madurai branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Dental Association (IDA) organised a two-wheeler rally against the Centre’s notification on ‘mixopathy’ approving postgraduate Ayurveda graduates to perform surgeries based on modern scientific medicine. K. Senthil, president of Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association, flagged off the rally. Around 50 doctors participated in the rally that started from IMA office in Madurai and reached Thuvarankurichi in Tiruchi district. District IMA president Raveendran, president-elect V.N. Alagavenkatesan and other office bearers of IMA and IDA were present. Dr. Senthil said the Central Council for Indian Medicine had issued this notification as a measure to address the issue of doctor shortage. Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems were usually not evidence-based, he said. The announcement of ‘mixopathy’ would affect Ayurveda medicinal system the most, said Dr. Senthil. “This announcement shows that the government does not have faith in Indian medicine,” he added. This announcement of ‘mixopathy’ would affect the public and the quality of medical treatment offered to them, he said. “To address the issue of doctor shortage, the Central government can consult the State governments to introduce additional medical seats in the States,” he added. Dr. Alagavenkatesan said they were against Ayurveda doctors performing surgeries in hospitals following allopathy medicine and using allopathy drugs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mixopathy-will-affect-ayurveda-system-of-medicine-the-most/article33778094.ece
08 February 2021||PALANI,TAMIL NADU||Temple elephant leaves for camp||Kasturi, the 55-year-old elephant of Sri Dhandayuthapani Swami Temple here, left for the 48-day rejuvenation camp to be held at Thekkampatti, near Mettupalayam, here on Sunday. Every year, the Tamil Nadu government had been conducting a rejuvenation camp for the elephants belonging to various temples and mutts at Vanabadra Kaliamman Temple. Mahouts accompany them. The elephant was made to board a truck here. According to the HR & CE officials here, ‘Kasturi’ was attending the camp for the 14th time. It left for the camp after special pujas were performed in the presence of officials and devotees from the temple town. Animal Husbandry and Forest Department officials said that the objective of the annual camp was to screen the elephants and if any ailment was found, they would be treated by experts during the camp.  Madurai The elephants of Sundararaja Perumal Temple at Alagarkoil and Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple left the city on Sunday for the 48-day rejuvenation camp at Thekkampatti near Mettupalayam. The annual rejuvenation camp for temple and mutt elephants from across the State will be held from Monday. Sundaravalli Thayar, the 15-year-old elephant of Sundararaja Perumal Temple, left for the camp in the small hours of Sunday. A mahout and an assistant, who tested negative for COVID-19, were sent with the elephant, say temple officials. Parvathi, the 24-year-old elephant of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, also left for the camp with a mahout and an assistant mahout after they tested negative for COVID-19. An official from the Animal Husbandry department said basic medical tests were performed for the elephants to check whether they were medically fit for the journey. The elephant of Subramaniaswamy Temple at Tirupparankundram - Deivanai - which had trampled its mahout to death last year, returned from Rehabilitation Centre at M.R. Palayam in Tiruchi after a period of nearly eight months. M. Ramasamy, Deputy Commissioner (in charge) of the temple, said they were expecting orders for transporting the elephant to the camp at Thekkampatti. Tiruchi Four temple elephants belonging to different shrines in Tiruchi were given a send-off on Sunday for the 48-day rejuvenation camp at Thekkampatti near Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district. The camp for the jumbos is to begin on Monday. ‘Andal’ and ‘Lakshmi’ from Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, ‘Akila’ from Sri Jambukeswarar Akilandeswari Temple, Tiruvanaikoil, and ‘Lakshmi’ from Rockfort Sri Thayumanaswamy Temple were sent by separate lorries from Srirangam here in the morning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temple-elephant-leaves-for-rejuvenation-camp/article33778113.ece
08 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Work for recapturing power in U.T., AINRC leader tells partymen||Former Chief Minister and AINRC founder-president N. Rangasamy on Sunday pitched for unity in the ranks as he called upon functionaries and cadres to work towards ousting the Congress and recapturing power in the Union Territory. Addressing the 11th founding day anniversary of the AINRC, which he formed after breaking away from the Congress, Mr. Rangasamy said the AINRC would be the choice of the people who were looking for a regime change after five years of disillusionment with the Congress-DMK government. Noting the significance of the party anniversary as it coincided with the Assembly election, Mr. Rangasamy said, “Some forces within and from outside would look to foment discord. But we must firmly take a vow to unite and forget all differences and face the elections to remove this dismal government.” Pitching for Statehood for Puducherry, he stated that this was one of the founding goals of the AINRC. “All political parties should close ranks and unite behind the cause for Statehood.” He also called for boycotting the Assembly election till the Centre conceded to the demand for Statehood. Mr. Rangasamy, who reserved a major part of his speech to attack the Congress, said the performance of the government had been dismal. “The government has neither brought in any new scheme nor carried forward the welfare measures introduced when the AINRC was in power,” he said. The youth were also let down as there was no job growth. “The government was not able to attract any industrial venture while some existing ones have exited Puducherry,” he said. “Instead of focusing on the welfare of the people, the members of this dispensation are more intent on staging agitations and protest fasts blaming the Lt. Governor for not being able to deliver programmes to the people,” he said. The AINRC was formed and came to power (in 2011) with the support of the people of Puducherry. “The people have faith that we will work for their welfare,” he said. Mr. Rangasamy also paid tribute to AINRC leader N.R. Balan, who died of COVID-19 last year and hailed his contribution to the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-for-recapturing-power-in-ut-ainrc-leader-tells-partymen/article33778331.ece

08 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||DMK wants ECI intervention on nominated MLA issue||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has sought the immediate intervention of Election Commission of India on the issue of appointment of three nominated MLAs. DMK leader in Assembly and convenor (South), R. Siva, in a statement on Saturday, said the direct appointment of three nominated legislators and decision of the Supreme Court to accord voting rights to them have deprived the rights of political parties in the Union Territory. The ruling party in the Centre could change the power equation in the 30-member Legislative Assembly by having the right to appoint three nominated legislators. The nominated legislators could change the power equation if the government in power has only a razor-thin majority, he said. The ECI should either impose a ban on the direct appointment of nominated MLAs by the Centre or they should not be given the right to vote in the Legislative Assembly. The Commission should otherwise ensure that the elected government has the right to choose two persons as nominated legislators and leave the appointment rights for one MLA to the Centre, the statement said. The ECI intervention could only ensure a level-playing field to all political parties in Union Territory, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-wants-eci-intervention-on-nominated-mla-issue/article33778325.ece

Abdul Kalam space research payload cubes challenge 2021’ held in Rameswaram on Sunday. A total of 100 Femto satellites were launched through two high-altitude scientific balloons and they landed over 100 km away. Speakers hailed the students for their commendable performance. Over a video-conferencing facility, Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said she was delighted to take part in the event. ‘These students have fulfilled whatever our former President Abdul Kalam had thought,’ she said. ‘Children who used to play with balloons are launching small satellites using them. The main push behind this is the interaction they had with our former President Dr. Kalam,’ she added. Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy recalled his meeting with Dr. Abdul Kalam. ‘Today more than 100 satellites are being launched using balloons. India is a pioneer in space research compared to other countries. A lot of young scientists should come up in our country,’ he said. The event was organised by APJ Abdul Kalam International Foundation (AKIF) by House of Kalam Rameswaram along with Space Zone India and The Martin Group to kindle interest among students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). More than 800 students from standard VI to Plus Two and engineering colleges across the nation, designed and launched the satellites. ‘Prior to the main event, we conducted a series of online lectures and one-day hands-on workshops in different parts of the country. These satellites will provide us with live data for studies based on agriculture (germination of seeds), ultraviolet radiation, natural composite materials, vibration, wind speed, global warming, ozone depletion, among others,’ said Anand Megalingam, founder and CEO, Space Zone India. Gowtham, a 11th standard student from Government High School, Pennathur, Vellore, said he was able to see live data captured from satellites. “It was overwhelming to launch 100 Femto satellites through scientific balloons. It has kindled my interest in research and I wish to become an ISRO scientist,” he said. Shraddha Santosh Chungade, studying 7th standard at Zilla Parishad School, Pendapur, Gangapur, Aurangabad, said she was really happy to learn how satellites are made. Later, speaking to reporters, A.Sivathanu Pillai, founder CEO of BrahMos Aerospace and former chief controller of R&D, DRDO, said the former President always encouraged the youth to dream big and think big. Such a platform and opportunities for the children from different parts of the country would kindle their interests. Many students hailed from government schools. The data from these 100 Femto satellites can be analysed. The children have really performed commendable work and appreciated their efforts.

08 February 2021||SANKARANKOVIL,TAMIL NADU||‘Waiver will benefit partymen’||DMK president M.K. Stalin said the State government’s crop loan waiver announcement was made only to benefit AIADMK men who had availed of loans from cooperative societies in large numbers. “It is not for the benefit of real farmers,” he said at a meeting held on Sunday as part of the “Stalin in your constituency” initiative. He said the government had “enacted a similar drama” in 2016, wherein it was announced that farmers with up to 5 acres of land would get loans from cooperative societies waived. When the Movement for Linking South Indian Rivers approached the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a crop loan waiver for all farmers, the court allowed their prayer. “However, the State government, while exerting pressure on the borrowers to repay the loan with interest, appealed against this in the Supreme Court. Now, with an eye on the polls and for the benefit of AIADMK men, Mr. Palaniswami has come out with the waiver,” he said. Recalling that his father and then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi signed the order waiving a Rs. 7,000 crore crop loan immediately after assuming office in 2006, the DMK president said Mr. Palaniswami had only made the announcement, and the G.O. order in this connection was yet to be signed. He said former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, when he was with the DMK, was impressed with the party-related works of Mr. Stalin and wanted the family of Karunanidhi to be protected for the welfare of Tamil Nadu. Mr. Stalin appealed to the voters to join hands with the DMK “to salvage the problem-ridden Tamil Nadu”. Coming down heavily on Minister for Adi-Dravidar Welfare V.M. Rajalakshmi, representing Sankarankovil (Reserved) constituency, he said she had done nothing for the welfare of the students of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/waiver-will-benefit-partymen/article33777957.ece
08 February 2021||SATTUR,TAMIL NADU||People should also help to defeat BJP at Centre: Stalin||People should help to defeat the “fascist” BJP government at the Centre so that fuel prices were brought down, DMK leader M.K .Stalin said. Addressing ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin’ programme at Pattampudur near here on Sunday, he said though international price of crude oil soared during the United Progressive Alliance government, the Centre then had not increased the prices of petrol and cooking gas to the present level. Now international price of crude oil had come down drastically, but the Centre had increased fuel prices manifold by reducing subsidy and imposing several tax. “I appeal to the people not only to help a change of guard during the Assembly election, but also to send home BJP-led government at the Centre. He was responding to a question raised by one Basheer Ahmed of Virudhunagar, who complained about the problems he was facing due to petrol price hike. Mr. Stalin accused the AIADMK government of hurriedly floating “last minute” tenders to swindle public money. Since November 2020, tenders to the tune of Rs. 2,855 crore had been floated by the PWD, which is under the Chief Minister’s portfolio, he said. When people sought various works and MLAs demanded some beneficial works, the CM was hesitant to implement them in the past. But, now he had been on a spree of announcing new schemes. Pointing out that Tamil Nadu had a debt of Rs. 5 lakh crore, he said this government was trying to loot the borrowed money. They want to wipe off the State’s coffers. The government had claimed that it had no funds to provide old age pension, wages for MGNREGS workers and to provide pensionary benefits to government employees. Similarly, it had had no funds to provide interim relief to the people affected by COVID-19 and Cyclone Nivar, but now it had so much of funds to allocate for tenders. “This means this government is not for the people, but for tenders. After the DMK assumes office, the last minute tenders in each department would be taken up for scrutiny and those tenders floated for commission would be cancelled,” he said. Making caustic remarks against Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, he said the Minister was used to making abusing comments. Stating that a disproportionate assets case was pending against him in the High Court, he said the DVAC Superintendent of Police had submitted a report in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-should-also-help-to-defeat-bjp-at-centre-stalin/article33778106.ece
08 February 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Spectator killed in jallikattu||A spectator was killed on the spot after a bull hit him at the Ayyampatti jallikattu here on Sunday. According to an eyewitness, Murugesan, 35, of Jakkammal Street, Chinnamanur, had parked his two-wheeler, and was attempting to enter the venue from the tail-end point, where the bulls came out.

08 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Curtains go up again at Rasika Ranjana Sabha||The hall of Rasika Ranjana Sabha in the city echoed with the sounds of musical instruments and enthusiastic artistes on Sunday after a year-long hiatus. The hall, which was closed as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19, reopened with the staging of ‘Pavalavalli Tirumanam’, originally written by Sankaradas Swamigal. The resumption of theatre activities at the RR Sabha also marked the beginning of the World Drama Day celebrations undertaken by the Department of Art and Culture. Under the guidance of the Department, folk artistes from three different styles - street plays, musical theatre, and plays with dialogues – gathered from Tiruchi region and all three styles were depicted in ‘Pavalavalli Tirumanam’ on Sunday evening. A group of folk dancers from Tiruchi who underwent training to perform ‘Thudumbattam’, a folk art form popular in Coimbatore, over the last week, kicked off the evening with an enthralling performance. Speaking about the reopening, N. Sekar, honorary secretary of the Sabha said that he was grateful to see arts being celebrated again. “Our artists had a difficult time during the lockdown. We had provided Rs. 500 as a compensation to our artists, while some charitable individuals using us as a reference made some donations,” he said. The Sabha had also arranged for making short films of 13 plays, which were screened at the South Zone Cultural Centre, Thanjavur. “The centre provided remuneration to the theatre groups who acted in the films, which helped to sustain them during this difficult time,” he said. S. Devi, who led the group who performed the Thudumbaattam said that they had resorted to taking up odd jobs during the lockdown. “hey say you can't stop the dancing feet, but the virus really did stop us for a year,”she said. B. Hemanathan, Assistant Director, Department of Art and Culture, who organised the event told The Hindu that the they had provided Rs. 10,000 each to 320 artistes in the State to purchase musical instruments. A sum of Rs. 2,000 was provided to all registered artists of the Folk Artists Welfare Board as a compensation, he added. Mr. Hemanthan said that the department has created a portal where artists across the state could register, providing basic details including their bank details such that necessary assistance may be given to them. V. Kalaiarasi, Director, Department of Art and Culture, attended the event and congratulated the artistes on their performance. She encouraged them to keep practising their art and exuded hope of larger footfall of audiences.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/curtains-go-up-again/article33778090.ece
08 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Debt-ridden MSME sector looks up to government for sustenance||Welcoming the State Government's decision to waive farm loans, representatives of MSME sector in Tiruchi region have made a case for a similar gesture in the interests of several thousands of direct and indirect workers. Sick MSME units in Tiruchi region that had been dependent on BHEL for decades find themselves in a piquant situation after the orders started declining for BHEL due to the Central Government's shift of focus for renewable energy. Promoters of the industrial units say they have been bogged down by the rather heavy compound interest rates. “What we expect is not waiver of the principal amount, but the interest and the interest on interest. As the COVID-19 pandemic has hit us hard, the State Government must take a special interest to effectively implement the interest-subvention schemes,” Rajappa Rajkumar, president of BHEL Small Industries' Association said. “We have been trying hard for an appointment with the Chief Minister, but to no avail. There is little time left. The industries here can sustain only if the government takes a positive decision well before the code of conduct for the forthcoming Assembly polls takes effect,” he said. Echoing a similar view, president of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Industries' Association R. Ilango said the State Government could play an effective role for the survival of MSME sector by routing concessions through the District Industries Centres. While the initiatives taken for start of new industries is laudable, the existing industries in Tiruchi region must be provided with the opportunities for diversification to suit the requirements of the Defence Corridor project, for which the SIPCOT plays a facilitating role. Tiruchi being one of the five nodes for the Defence Corridor Project, the TIDITSSIA, BHELSIA and TREAT (Tiruchi Engineering and Technology Cluster) have been urging the Central and State governments to establish a local office to see through the transition of the manufacturing capabilities of the MSMEs, Mr. Ilango said. A local office in each of the five nodes of defence corridor will be of immense use as the industries would know the type of skills required for the workforce and get prepared beforehand, Mr. Ilango said.  The State must take a special interest to effectively implement the interest-subvention schemes Rajappa Rajkumar President, BHEL Small Industries' Association||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/debt-ridden-msme-sector-looks-up-to-government-for-sustenance/article33778099.ece

The passenger hailing from Pudukottai district was taken to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital for observation and treatment. The flight with 169 passengers onboard arrived in the morning. As per protocol, the woman passenger too was checked by the airport health officer at the aero bridge corridor when they found her carrying a COVID-19 positive certificate. Airport authorities said an alert was immediately sounded to all stakeholders including state health department officials. The formalities were done swiftly including immigration clearance and she was taken to the government hospital. As per the standard operating protocol and stipulated guidelines, disinfectants were sprayed at the aerobridge corridor, immigration area, arrival hall, arrival belt area and at the gate, Airport Director, Tiruchi, S. Dharmaraj said. The authorities felt that proper verification should have been done at the boarding point in Singapore by the airline. This is the second such incident at Tiruchi international airport within a week. On the previous occasion, too, the passenger had come from Singapore by Air India Express. Mr. Dharmaraj said a letter was sent to the Air India Express authorities asking the airline to verify the documents strictly and follow the guidelines stipulated by the Central government. The Tiruchi airport authorities would convene a meeting with the Air India Express officials on Monday following the two incidents.

08 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Gambling complaint leads to sealing of Union Club||In a late night operation on Saturday, Revenue officials sealed the Union Club, a popular sports cum recreational centre in the city, to curb gambling. Acting on a complaint of a Village Administrative Officer that the premises was being used for gambling, a team of revenue and police officials led by District Revenue Officer Palani Kumar rushed to the spot around 11 p.m. and searched the premises. The raid lasted for more than an hour. They found a group of people engaged in gambling by playing cards. A few others were allegedly served liquor without any valid license. On seeing the officials, the card players went out hurriedly abandoning the game. However, the police arrested R. Manikandan (25) of Keela Vannarapettai and S. Madan (36) of Rainbow Nagar in Uyyakokndam Thirumalai. The police also seized 52 cards, Rs. 20,000 and a liquor bottle. After collecting evidences, the revenue officials sealed the club for violating rules and regulations. They said that no one would be allowed to enter the premises until further orders. The arrested persons were subsequently released on bail. Collector S. Sivarasu told The Hindu that material evidences had been collected from the spot. Moreover, it had been found that the club had not paid the stipulated lease amount to the Government for more than 44 years. Notices were served to the club on many occasions in this regard. Suitable action would be taken as per the rule of law, the Collector said. In May 2019, the Tiruchi City Corporation officials demolished the century-old City Club on West Boulevard Road after a long legal battle. Sports infrastructure including badminton and tennis courts on the premises, which served the people for more than 100 years, were dismantled, to the shock of sports persons and aspiring players. Similar to the City Club, the Union Club on Bharathidasan Road in Cantonment was set up before Independence. It has an excellent infrastructure for sports such as tennis, table tennis, billiards and other games. It has been a popular sports centre in the city. It hosted a number of International Tennis Federation (ITF) men’s circuit tournaments until recently. Sports persons who came to the club for regular practice on Sunday were shocked to see the sealed premises. “We are saddened to see the closure of sports facilities. It has ultimately affected the overall growth of sports,” said D. Rajkumar, a regular user of the tennis court in the Union Club in Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gambling-complaint-leads-to-sealing-of-union-club/article33778368.ece
08 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Locked up public toilet irks devotees and residents||A public toilet located along the Kollidam flood bank road has been locked for months, much to the chagrin of the public and devotees visiting the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam. This is the area where children and adults tonsure their heads before going to the river bank to take a bath. Vinoth Kumar who undertakes tonsuring work near the river bank tells of the discomfiture the devotees face every day. After their hair is shaved off, devotees proceed to the river and then to the temple. However, since the toilet complex is under lock, many are forced to use the restrooms attached to the tonsuring shops. “We have three bathrooms where the devotees can rinse off before going to the river. However, many a time, people come and plead with us to use the restrooms as there is no other toilet here,” he said, adding that many of them are women and children. Tiruchi Corporation had constructed the toilet complex under the Swachh Bharat Mission plan. However, the toilet now lies in a dilapidated state. “Bushes have grown around the complex, and there is dust and filth everywhere. There is also no water supply,” Mr. Vinoth said. “The local residents are also dependent on the complex as many do not have toilets in their homes”, he said. Mr. Vinoth's customers too, are put off by the foul smell. “Especially, during Chithirai, when crowds throng this part of the city, the stench is unbearable. People urinate all over the area and the entire street smells terrible for at least a week,” he said. His customers too, do not approve of him allowing people to use the restrooms in his shop. “They say that people will sully the place and those who need to shower after tonsuring cannot use it. I cannot be flexible beyond a level causing annoyance to my customers,” he added. The local residents and shop owners have submitted a petition to the Corporation hoping for a prompt response to the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/locked-up-public-toilet-irks-devotees-and-residents/article33778370.ece

With the help of Sindhu, an anaesthetist, Dr. Viswanath performed the surgery on Saranya. The surgery that began at 12.40 am lasted nearly two hours. The finger was fixed with an intramedullary needle and the tendons soft tissue was repaired and the finger was successfully replanted. After 10 days of hospitalisation, the doctors discharged the patient from the GH on Sunday. Dr. Viswanath said that the replanted finger was functioning well, and that the bone was also fixed. The girl had recovered well. “Finger replantation is highly effective if the patient is brought to the hospital as quickly as possible. We did not want to waste time in referring her to other hospitals at odd hours. Hence, we performed the surgery with the available resources at Thurvarankurichi GH,” said Dr. Viswanath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-at-rural-gh-replant-severed-finger/article33778366.ece

No one was injured in the attack, which was apparently done by a gang targeting a youth facing a few criminal cases when he was inside the police station. The police said unidentified persons, who came to the Thatchanallur police station on Sunday around 11 p.m. in three bikes, hurled a bomb in front of the police station even as Devenedrakula Velaalar Ezhuchi Iyakkam president Kannapiraan of Thatchanallur was signing in the police records to fulfil the bail condition.

The resort, built near an adivasi village in Kurumbadi, is also said to be located inside a prime habitat used by wild elephants moving through the Kallar elephant corridor. Officials from the Burliyar panchayat said that the resort had failed to obtain the appropriate clearances for the construction for many years, but had continued to function despite pressure from the district administration to only reopen after obtaining the permissions. Burliyar panchayat president P. Susheela said that as the owners of the resort had failed to heed the directions of the district administration for a number of years, the Collector had called for a closure notice to be issued to the resort. “They had wanted one week’s time to get the relevant permissions, but we have given them only two days, after which a decision will be taken as to whether the resort should be sealed,” said Ms. Susheela when contacted by The Hindu.  Activists have called for stringent action against illegal constructions in the Nilgiris, arguing that buildings constructed illegally should be demolished by the district administration. S. Manogaran, a Coonoor-based activist and president of the Coonoor Consumer Protection Association, welcomed the action against the owners of the building. “There are buildings across the Nilgiris that are being built without proper clearances, and along important wildlife corridors which is increasing the chances of human-animal confrontations. Such buildings are encroaching on reserve forests and water courses, and all of these buildings need to be closed down and demolished,” said Mr. Manogaran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/local-body-serves-closure-notice-on-illegal-resort-near-coonoor/article33778001.ece

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||A very few candidates from T.N. join Navy, says NCC officer||The contribution of candidates from Tamil Nadu in joining Indian Navy is very less, with the contribution from the southern districts, including Madurai, being almost nil. So separate coaching centres must be established to train rural students to crack competitive defence examinations, says Commanding Officer of 2 Tamil Nadu Naval Unit NCC, Captain D. Senthil Kumar. Speaking to The Hindu , Capt. Senthil Kumar said that recently the Indian Navy had increased the intake of sailors to 6,500 to 7,000 every year as compared to previous years when only 2,000 sailors were recruited. Despite an increase in intake, the number of candidates joining from Tamil Nadu was very less. “Those who join the Indian Navy from Tamil Nadu are mostly from cities, with almost nil contribution from rural parts of southern districts,” he said. One of the reasons for the low percentage of students from the southern districts joining Indian Navy was a lack of awareness of Navy and types of roles offered there. “Unlike the Army, Navy personnel work in metropolitan cities. Any student who has completed Class 10 or 12 can earn about Rs. 30,000 each month by joining the Indian Navy. Indian Navy personnel have special allowances and can avail themselves of pension with just 15 years of government service. There are many employment opportunities available post retirement in government and private sectors for Indian Navy personnel,” he says. Students who had studied physics, chemistry and maths in Class 12 could write the exams that would be conducted in January and July every year. Lack of infrastructure Capt. Senthil Kumar said even if rural students were interested in appearing for the examinations, lack of sufficient infrastructure in preparing students for the examination, was a major cause for concern. “The examinations are conducted in English and Hindi and hence, many Tamil-medium students find it difficult to clear the examinations. This highlights the importance of setting up training centres for rural students,” he says. The State offers free NEET and UPSC coaching for students. Similarly, it could start free coaching centres for defence exams too, he said. “Corporates can also come forward to establish coaching centres for the Indian Navy as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives,” he said.

Alleging that the laying of high tension towers on farm lands had affected their livelihood, the protesting farmers demanded the State government to provide uniform compensation to those affected in all the districts. Their other demands were raising the minimum compensation to Rs. 10 lakh, laying underground the high voltage transmission line between Tiruppur and Virudhunagar, and stopping the move to set up a sub-station at Kavudhampalayam.

So, we had to take a decision based on discussions with the Advocate General. The properties may be handed over to a government agency for maintenance,” an official told The Hindu.  A press release from the Chennai Collectorate said one of the properties on Wallace Garden First Street, covering six grounds and 1,087 sq ft with an undivided share of land measuring 581 sq ft, was acquired on April 28, 1994. Three more properties on the same road, which were also registered on the same day, were on the list of confiscated properties. Additional buildings constructed on Wallace Garden First Street have also been confiscated. A two-storeyed house at Sriram Nagar on TTK Road in Alwarpet, measuring 4,300 sq ft of built-up area in two grounds and 1,237 sq ft of land, had also been confiscated. Officials said the market value of the six properties was estimated at Rs. 25 crore. The guideline value of 1 sq ft of land on Wallace Garden First Street is Rs. 6,030. The classification of the properties by the Registration Department is commercial class I type II, signifying a high real estate value. Some of the buildings have reportedly been rented out to a hospital. The rent would be collected by a government agency in the light of the announcement on confiscation, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/6-properties-of-sudhakaran-ilavarasi-confiscated/article33777960.ece

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Reader’s Mail||Periyar bus stand, which handles a large number of buses is being renovated under Smart Cities Mission programme of the Central government. But Arapalayam bus stand, which serves as a multi route terminus handling buses bound for Kodaikanal, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Salem and places in Kerala and Karnataka, is neglected in State schemes. Since Arapalayam bus terminus has space crunch, buses are haphazardly parked leading to traffic chaos inside the terminus and also near the exit. In the absence of waiting and cloak rooms, passengers coming from across the State are left stranded while they search for lodging facility during night hours, putting them, especially women and children and elderly, at risk . Moreover, due to dearth of shelters, people are exposed to rain and sun and are forced to stand in the open till they board buses. Senior citizens and physically challenged have no means to sit down and wait for the buses. As a result of poorly maintained toilets, a stench hangs in the air. I appeal to the authorities concerned to renovate Arapalayam bus terminus under the Smart Cities Mission.  M . Sainithii,      The SVN College bus stop in Nagamalai Pudukottai is vulnerable to accidents since traffic is heavy all through the day on Theni highway. College students and the general public find it hard to cross this road, situated near an intersection. I request the authorities to provide permanent barricades on either side of this road at this dangerous spot so that vehicles will slow down and people can cross the road with ease.  S.N.M.T. Nagarajan,      It is with reference to the news, ‘Boy with diphtheria infection recovers’ ( The Hindu , February 1) A five-year-old boy who was diagnosed with diphtheria was cured of two fatal complications - myocarditis and neuropathy - by paediatricians at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai after three months of hospitalisation. Even during a pandemic, the government doctors have attempted this critical case as a challenge.A fter being given rigorous physiotherapy the child’s mobility was restored. The sincere efforts taken by the government doctors in bringing back the poor boy to the normal condition is to be appreciated. In the recent times so many critical operations are performed successfully in government hospitals across the state. It is laudable.  P.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Readers Mail||As colleges and schools are reopening from this week, all precautions need to be taken. Teaching institutions must thoroughly sanitise the school grounds, work area, classes, laboratories, and all the buildings to guarantee a sterile and hygienic space for students, educators, and school staff. To maintain social distancing, it is better for students to stand/sit at least 2-3 meter away from other students, and to provide such an environment, the institutions need to arrive at a timetable by offering the option for a section of students to continue with online classes. All students, staff, teachers, among others, must go through thermal scanning at the entry and during several intervals of the day. The first step is to stop the transfer of the virus from one infected person to another by wearing masks and gloves. It is imperative that the administration installs alcohol-based hand sanitisers for the students, and staff. Students should be careful while exchanging or using others books and pen/pencils and other teaching materials. M. A. Aleem  Tiruchi   Students do not seem to realise that a second or third wave of COVID 19 transmission is possible. At the outset, college principals, heads of departments, professors and non-teaching staffs should follow all prevention methods like wearing of face mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently with germ protection soap. All educational institutions should maintain physical distancing during class hours and must not allow the students to move around or sit together in groups. M. Raja  Tiruchi   While, Tiruchi residents were happy that the civic authorities have decided to revert to the old system of keeping garbage bins at selected places, now comes the announcement ( The Hindu, Feb 4, 2021) that hereafter the corporation van will collect solid waste from residents/commercial establishments only once a week. This is a retrograde step and will only result in further pile up of garbage at street corners. It appears that the civic body is devoid of ideas on the way to move forward. The Corporation may depute its officials to Indore/Surat, India's top two clean cities to follow their pattern.  M. Nagarajan Crawford   Indiscriminate dumping of garbage and other wastes at Sundarraj Nagar near Subramaniapuram along the Pudukkottai Highway in the city is a matter of major concern for the local residents. The bad smell emanating from the dumped garbage, which included chicken, fish and vegetable wastes, is posing health hazard to the residents of the Sundarraj Nagar and the neighbouring Highways Colony. A private hospital and an eatery are situated within a stone's throw distance from the dumping point. People going on morning walks find the household wastes dumped during the night hours. Residents expect the corporation authorities to to remove the garbage everyday. It should also take steps to prevent the people from dumping the garbage by fencing the entire area. S. Mohamed Danish  Subramaniapuram   Since post offices functioning in Angarai, Nagar, Maanthurai, under jurisdiction of Lalgudi head post office share a common PIN code, inland letters are tossed from one place to another. Late delivery of insurance reminders, and college notifications have become commonplace. The postal authorities must lose no further time in assigning unique PIN codes to post offices to ensure speedy delivery. Murugappan SP  Lalgudi   Reckless drivers must be penalised heavily by the authorities for drunken driving and over-speeding in Tiruchi city if they are serious about preventing fatalities in the region. Police should crack down on such drivers as accidents and fatalities they cause causes undue sufferings in families. Medical expenses are huge. The Government should also seriously consider enacting a law to take stringent action against the offenders and provide instant compensation to the affected family. S. Prakash  Tiruchi   In the subway connecting Arasamara Street (Melapudur) and Kemps Town, rain water is stagnant causing inconvenience to passers-by. I request the authorities concerned to do the needful. X. Rosario Rajkumar  Karumandapam   The magnanimous step taken by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to waive crop loans to the tune of Rs. 12,110 crore has warmed the cockles of the entire farming community. This is similar to late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s noble gesture of waiving Rs. 5,318 crore in 2016 and sanction of Rs. 2,247 crore as drought relief in 2017. Nevertheless, crop loans waiver is only a temporary solution. The government should invest in the farming sector to enhance its contribution to the economy. R. Pichumani  Thippirajapuram   The walk-in-jog path, which was recently inaugurated by Chief Minister on the Old Amaravathy bridge attracts a huge number of people both in the morning and evening everyday. During weekends, a large number of two wheelers and cars are haphazardly parked at the entrance of the path, clogging the entry and exit paths. This creates a chaotic situation. It would be proper if the city police deploys traffic personnel to ensure free flow of vehicles at least during weekends. M.

A week ago, the BJP high command constituted the seven-member committee to oversee the preparations for the bypoll. The committee comprises Union Minister Prahlad Joshi, Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar and five Ministers from Belagavi district Lakshman Savadi, Ramesh Jarkiholi, Umesh Katti, Shashikala Jolle and Srimant Patil. Mr. Joshi has already held two meetings — one in Belagavi and the other in Hubballi — to collect opinion from party workers and various morcha leaders. “They have all been given a one-line direction — work for the victory of the party candidate whoever it may be,” a senior party office-bearer said. He pointed out that the committee is expected to steer the campaign, rather than select a candidate. This follows indications that some of them have sought ticket for themselves or their relatives or followers. In the first round, the party’s district election committee collected bio-data of 73 candidates. The party’s State election committee sought and obtained additional details for about half of them. The front-runners among the probables are Mahantesh Kavatagimath, MLC, Vishwanth Patil, former MLA, Ujwala Bhadavanache, former party district unit president, and medical professionals Girish Sonwalkar, Ravi Patil and Sonali Sarnobat, say party sources. Apart from these, three former Parliament members, Prabhakar Kore, Amarsinh Patil and Ramesh Katti, have shown interest. The former MLAs Sanjay Patil and Jagadish Metgud are also among the aspirants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-to-hold-meeting-on-bypoll/article33778134.ece

He was addressing a gathering in Hubballi after launching some development works. “The protest is not based on any reasonable issue. It is backed by the Congress and other Opposition parties. The Congress and other leaders are provoking farmers over non-issues as they have nothing substantial to say against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. He claimed that Mr. Modi was conducting an experiment with these new farm laws with the aim of improving the lives of farmers. “Farmers should give an opportunity to him to implement the new laws for one or two years. If the laws do not achieve their objectives, the government will withdraw them,” he said. He added that farmers were “assuming wrong things” about the farm laws. Meanwhile, in Belagavi, KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi dismissed this charge. “The New Delhi protest is non-political. It is a protest by farmers who are aware of their rights. Though the Congress is expressing moral support to the agitation, it is not part of it,” he said. He also accused the BJP of fomenting violence in Delhi in the name of the farmers’ protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-provoking-farmers-over-non-issues-shettar/article33778139.ece
08 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccination: Experts say it’s time to map vulnerable population||Despite the poor response to COVID-19 vaccination from healthcare workers, the prioritised group in the first phase, it is now important to start planning the process of inoculation of the elderly and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 experts have said. The Centre had announced that after the first round of vaccination for healthcare personnel and the second round for frontline workers (police, municipal, RDPR, and Revenue Department staff), those aged above 50 and those with comorbidities would receive the vaccine. However, in the absence of a registry or directory of this population, it is high time the government started a survey to map out and enrol them, experts said. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said that while it was still not clear whether the government would provide free vaccination to this group as well, the process of enrolment should ideallybegin now. “This group — senior citizens (above 50 years) and those with comorbidities — forms a huge chunk of the population. While vaccination for the first group (healthcare workers) is still under way and it will take off for frontline workers on February 8, it is not necessary that one phase should be completed for another to start,” Dr. Sudarshan said. TAC member Giridhara R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health, said the speed with which the vaccine or the virus reached people would determine the country’s progress. “Therefore, those who are most vulnerable should be quickly vaccinated. Mapping out this population and enrolling them should be the top priority of the government,” he said. He said that while the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) already had some data available, it was incomplete and a survey was needed at the earliest. “The country now needs to follow a 3Cs strategy: coverage (wide and fast) of vaccine, containment efforts to limit spread, and continuing genetic sequencing. Correlation of mutated strains to contained outbreaks, in addition to wider vaccine coverage, will ensure success,” he said. “Although it has been estimated that one in 10 adults has diabetes and one in three has hypertension, we need to map the elderly population.” However, Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said the State would go by the electoral rolls to find the elderly population. “We have already identified houses that have people with comorbidities. We had collected this data in our earlier survey. However, we are waiting for guidelines from the Government of India, and if the guidelines necessitate a fresh survey to map this population we will take it up. We have enough resources to do a survey and collate data at the earliest,” he said. Survey in BBMP limits But BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, who admitted that the data currently available with the BBMP was not accurate, said a new survey to map out and enrol this population would begin on February 15 and would be completed in 15 days. “The previous comorbid survey data did not reflect accurate, easily retrievable options. High-quality, human error-free data on individuals vulnerable to COVID-19 is critical now. We have already started the process and the survey will begin on February 15. This was discussed at length at a recent meeting of BBMP’s COVID-19 task force. The survey will be conducted by Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, with assistance from NGOs,” the Commissioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-experts-say-its-time-to-map-vulnerable-population/article33777914.ece
08 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Healthcare delivery in India poised to undergo change: President Kovind||The pandemic has exposed the strengths and weaknesses in public and private healthcare centres, not just in India but the world over, said President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday. He said healthcare delivery in the country was poised to undergo a change on all stages — prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. He was speaking at the 23rd convocation of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), where he was chief guest. “No single entity in the healthcare sector can deliver results and achieve outcomes. The evolution of the sector calls for active involvement and participation of all the stakeholders and the use of innovation to bridge intent and execution,” Mr. Kovind said, adding that the pandemic had taught everyone to be better prepared for unforeseen public health crises. “Although COVID-19 appears to be a one-of-its-kind health crisis, a section of scientists have warned that we should be prepared for similar challenges ahead,” he said. He also stressed the need to give more attention to public healthcare. He highlighted the Union Budget’s focus on “health and well-being”, which it recognised as one of the six crucial pillars of ‘atma nirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). “The boosting of healthcare infrastructure in the country is being given strong emphasis. Effective utilisation of this national resource will be possible only with your active support and contribution,” he told the graduating students. Mr. Kovind expressed joy on learning that 87 out of the 111 gold medals were bagged by women and said that he was happy that women were leading the country into the future in all fields, including the medical sciences. He also commended the doctors and paramedics who rose to the challenge of fighting COVID-19 at the risk of their own lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/healthcare-delivery-in-india-poised-to-undergo-change-president-kovind/article33777921.ece
08 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cinemas yet to see rise in footfall as filmgoers remain cautious||Film buffs are yet to flock to theatres despite the State government allowing single screens and multiplexes to operate on 100% seating capacity. Onthe first weekend after the relaxation of rules, ticket sales remained low. But theatre owners, optimistic that a revival is around the corner, are awaiting a string of big releases, which they say will bring in the big crowds. The State government had, on February 3, permitted full occupancy for four weeks at the request of the Kannada film industry. This is the first time in over 10 months that theatres are functioning on full occupancy after the COVID-19pandemic. “For the revival of the cinema exhibition industry, relaxation of seating norms is a prerequisite,” said Alok Tandon, CEO of INOX Leisure Ltd. “This will ease apprehensions in the minds of content producers and studios, who may now announce the release dates of their movies.” Single screens, especially, have welcomed the easing of rules. “We have over 800 seats, but were struggling to fill even 80 per show. It was difficult to pay our employees,” said V. Bharani, film representative at Mukunda theatre in Banaswadi. But despite the relaxation of rules, cinema halls don’t expect a surge in crowds anytime soon. “People turn up in large numbers only if there is a big film,” said Mr. Bharani. “The Tamil film Master starring Vijay (released on January 13) fetched us good collections though we were allowed only 50% occupancy then,” he said. The new normal The government has warned that it will revoke the occupancy permission if COVID-19 cases increase because of protocol violations. But theatre owners have said they will ensure there are no violations. Gautam Dutta, CEO of PVR Ltd., claimed it was safe to go to the cinemas. “In a cinema hall, you are much safer as everyone is actually looking at the screen and not talking to each other while wearing masks. Also, you are resting and breathing normally with fresh air being circulated every four or five minutes,” he said. He added that all of the SOPs laid down by the Union and State governments would be strictly adhered to. However, those who usually go to theatres remain sceptical. Joseph Immanuel, a regular theatregoer, said cinemas must be stricter in the checking of masks. “I find many people taking their masks off once they enter the hall. With 100% occupancy, when people sit next to each other, it will be riskier,” he said. Meenakshi A.C., meanwhile, is happy she can sit next to her husband in the cinema hall now. “I usually comment about the movie or ask him if I missed a line. It was difficult to do this with the alternate seating arrangement,” she said. Ms. Meenakshi also wants to watch movies without wearing amask and wants to collect ticket stubs again (most theatres have gone paperless). While these wishes might take longer to become a reality again, the permission for 100% occupancy is seen as a major sign of revival of the city’s cinema-going habits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cinemas-yet-to-see-rise-in-footfall-as-filmgoers-remain-cautious/article33777927.ece

08 February 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Single-window agency to clear mining proposals||In a bid to help those wishing to enter mining business in Karnataka, the Mines and Geology Departmentwill set up a single-window agency to clear mining proposals quickly. Besides, the department will send the cleared proposals to nationalised banks for purposes of loans. The decision to set up two single windows —one at the district level and another at the State level — was taken at a meeting of officials and stakeholders chaired by Mining and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani recently. “Our government wants to infuse confidence among investors. We want the departments to go to their doorstep rather than they waiting for permission for years. The only solution to reduce the harassment faced by investors to get permits from departments is to establish a single-window agency under the department,” the Minister said in a statement. If investments are below Rs. 5 crore, the agency headed by the Deputy Commissioner will clear the applications and for projects worth more than Rs. 5 crore, a panel headed by the Mining and Geology Minister will approve the proposals. The single- window clearance system is in practice in the Industries and Commerce Department, according to the statement. Currently, investors in minor minerals sector such as sand, stone, and granite have to go through four departments to secure no-objection certificates to commence mining activity. In case of patta land, one has to get the NoC from the tashlidar. “Irrespective of type of land (forest or patta) and type of mineral, an investor has to get an environmental clearance certificate. If the project is less than 25 hectares, clearance is required from the State pollution control board and for those above 25 hectares, clearance is required from the Central board,” the Minister said. Further, projects approved through single-window clearance committees will be sent to various nationalised banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/single-window-agency-to-clear-mining-proposals/article33777935.ece

Veerendra Heggade after inaugurating a 2 km long newly laid four-lane road from Snana Ghatta to Dharmasthala at the temple town, the Minister said that the government will take steps for sanctioning alternative land to the Forest Department for planting saplings before getting the land of the Forest Department between Periyashanthi and Dharmasthala for widening the road. Earlier, Mr. Heggade told the Minister that in some places on the stretch of the road the Forest Department owns land. It is coming in the way of widening the road. The Public Works Department has constructed the 2 km long road at a cost of Rs. 15 crore. The road has 7.50 m wide carriage way on both sides (totally 15 m in width) with a 2.50 m wide median. The Minister said that survey has been completed as part of work to widen the road from Punjalkatte to Charmadi on B . Road-Chikkamagaluru National Highway. He will apprise the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways soon of the need to widen this stretch when he meets him in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-will-take-steps-for-widening-road/article33778274.ece

08 February 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Need public to cooperate on development works’||Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, and Minister for Fisheries, Ports and Inland Transport S. Angara on Sunday asked people to cooperate in the execution of development works and help the government in fruitful use of funds. Speaking at a function organised to lay the foundation stone for four-laning the 2-km-long State highway stretch at Malavoor, Mr. Kateel said legislators alone cannot work for the development; people needed to cooperate too. Legal obstacles, he said, have hampered the execution of some development works in the district. “The Addahole-B.C. Road [road widening] work has been affected because of issues concerning the forest. Legal problems have brought works under the (Mangaluru) Smart City project to a halt. If the district has to develop, people should cooperate,” he said. Speaking about the obstacles allegedly posed by people in the execution of works in Sullia Assembly constituency, Mr. Angara said work on laying a 110-kV electricity line was taken up following demand from the people to address the frequent poor outages in the region. “The same people are now posing obstacles to the execution of the work by taking the issue of land acquisition to court,” he said. Deputy Chief Minister and Public Works Minister Govind Karjol said COVID-19 and the floods, which damaged roads and bridges, have hindered development works. While the State government has not taken up new works, it is granting funds to complete the ongoing works, he said. Financial progress of the works taken up in 2019-20 was nearly 97% and that of works taken up in 2020-21 was about 61%, he added. Minister for Muzrai and Backward Class Welfare Kota Srinivas Poojary and MLA for Moodbidri Umanath Kotian spoke. Belthangady MLA Harisha Poonja and Mangaluru North MLA Y.

08 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Aim is to keep city clean on all days’||Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Sunday claimed efforts were under way to ensure that the city was clean on all 365 days. Speaking to reporters after carrying out an inspection of the Outer Ring Road, which had become an eyesore as a result of indiscriminate dumping of garbage, Mr. Somashekar said the administration had earmarked regions and constituted teams that have been entrusted with the responsibility of keeping their areas clean throughout the year. While appealing to the public to eschew dumping garbage on the roadside, Mr. Somashekar said instructions had been issued to crack down on those found doing this. A close vigil will be maintained on garbage trucks that dispose waste by the roadside and appropriate action will be taken against the owners. This includes levying of penalty or jail terms. He said that the matter had already been discussed with senior police officials including Police Commissioner Chandragupta. Mr. Somashekar’s assertion on keeping the city clean assumes significance in view of complaints that mounds of garbage are found carelessly thrown by roads in several parts of the city, particularly along Outer Ring Road and Narasimharaja Assembly segment, and that the scramble by officials to clear the mess becomes evident only when the Swachh Survekshan approaches every year. Mr. Somashekar, after an inspection of the Outer Ring Road, said officials of various departments including MUDA, MCC, PWD, Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB), and NHAI, had been entrusted with different responsibilities to keep the roads clean. Emphasising on the need for a permanent solution, he said there was a need to keep the road surroundings clean too. He said he had discussed the possibility of planting saplings in the barren land surrounding the roads with officials of Forest Department, MUDA and MCC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aim-is-to-keep-city-clean-on-all-days/article33778296.ece
08 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tuber mela helps create greater awareness on ‘forgotten food’||The two-day tuber and roots mela that concluded here on Sunday helped to promote their consumption and ensure nutritional security, while also helping farmers. Organised by Sahaja Samruddha and Rotary Club of Mysore (West), the two-day event had farmers from across the State showcasing a variety of tubers and roots. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha, instrumental in conducting the mela, said certain tubers and roots could be a source of food security at the household level and their intention was to promote cultivation in the backyard to ensure adequate nutrition for the local populace. He also emphasised the need for their value addition for greater acceptance among urban consumers. The use of tubers and roots as a popular source of protein and vitamins had taken a backseat to a point that they had been forgotten, more so in urban areas, he said. But individual farmers are propagating cultivation. M.N. Shaaji, a farmer from Manadavadi was a case in point. He has so far conserved 120 tubers and roots, travelling across Kerala, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc., to collect rare varieties. Now he is cultivating them on his farm to produce seeds and has exhibited his collections at the mela, he said. This has also spanned a few start-ups. Suhas, an entrepreneur, has ventured into producing ice-cream with different varieties of fruits, tender coconuts, etc., apart from purple yam ice-cream. The valedictory on Sunday saw a surge in the crowd at the venue. A team from Tamil Nadu, Maharasthra, Andhra Pradesh collected rare seed materials for cultivation in their States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tuber-mela-helps-create-greater-awareness-on-forgotten-food/article33778297.ece
08 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Lawyers meet Bhagavan, condemn attack on him||A group of lawyers from Mysuru, Mandya and Chamarajanagar called upon Kannada writer and rationalist K.S. Bhagavan at his residence in the city on Sunday and denounced the attack on him by a lawyer in Bengaluru last week. The lawyers, under the aegis of Karnataka State unit of All India Lawyers Union (AILU), met Prof. Bhagavan and expressed solidarity with him. They will hold a programme called ‘Prof. Bhagavan avarondige vakeelaru’ (Lawyers with Prof. Bhagavan) in Mysuru next week. The date and venue are yet to be finalised. Lawyer Meera Raghavendra confronted Prof. Bhagavan at the City Civil Court complex in Bengaluru last Thursday and threw ink on his face while accusing the writer of being critical of Hinduism. While condemning the act, AILU, in a statement, said the incident taking place on the court premises made it more grave. “It is not important whether we are in agreement with Prof. Bhagavan’s views. Our country has laws that accept freedom of expression. Our Constitution is supreme. Hence, Prof. Bhagavan has the right to express his views. This should be respected,” the AILU said in its statement, and also claimed that the lawyer had brought shame upon the entire fraternity of lawyers with her actions. Contending that the lawyer had violated the Advocates’ Act, 1961, the AILU urged the Karnataka Bar Council to immediately take suitable action against her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lawyers-meet-bhagavan-condemn-attack-on-him/article33778294.ece

The victim was identified as K.V. Joy Varke of Wayanad in Kerala. His body was found in the field. It is suspected that the attack took place around 8 a.m. Ginger cultivation is rampant as a form of contract farming in the H.D. Kote-Sargur belt and local farmers lease out their land to cultivators from Kerala. Varke had obtained land belonging to Nagaraju, Jayaram, and Prabhu of Halehegudu village. He was watering the fields on the backwaters of the Nugu reservoir when the elephant charged at and killed him. Forest officials, including Deputy Conservator of Forests Prashanth Kumar, visited the spot. The Sargur-H.D. Kote belt borders Bandipur Tiger Reserve. Nugu reservoir abuts the jungles, which are part of the Bandipur buffer zone, and elephant movement is frequent here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ginger-cultivator-trampled-to-death-by-elephant/article33777918.ece
08 February 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||Rs. 2,200 crore earmarked for education, says Sriramulu||Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu has said that the State government has decided to take up development works, especially in the education sector, in the backward areas. He was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a residential school, a hostel and Valmiki Bhavan at a cost of Rs. 25 crore in Watagal village, Maski taluk, of Raichur district on Sunday. According to the Nanjudappa Committee report, Maski taluk is one among the backward taluks in the State. “The education sector is yet to be improved. The pass percentage in SSLC is very low. More than 20% of students have not been taking up higher education after SSLC owing to lack of infrastructure and facilities in the education sector,” he said. “The BJP government has planned to implement projects to uplift the education sector. A sum of Rs. 2,200 crore has been earmarked for the education sector, particularly to provide infrastructure to residential schools such as Morarji Desai, Kittur Rani Channamma, Ambedkar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Indira Gandhi, as 1.68 students from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are studying in government-run residential schools,” the Minister said. Underlining the importance of education, Mr. Sriramulu said that only education will trigger revolution in society and help in the development of the State and country even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi wishes to see revolution in education in 2021. “Good and quality education is part of the New National Education Policy which will be implemented in the State,” he said. The Minister also said that Rs. 26,000 crore that was earmarked for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes communities under the Special Component Plan and Tribal Special Plan schemes will be fully utilised. More funds for Maski Assembly Constituency will be released in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-2200-crore-earmarked-for-education-says-sriramulu/article33778137.ece
08 February 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||Yadgir to Barcelona, a journey of an aerospace engineer||This is a tale of a village boy, who studied in a government school in Tumkur in Wadagera taluk of Yadgir district, achieving success to become the district’s first Space System Engineer abroad. Basavaraj Siddappa Sankin (28), who was born in a poor agriculturist family in the remote village, is now working as Space System Engineer at AST, an American company based in Barcelona, Spain, after completing his one-and-a-half year Master’s Degree in Aerospace Science and Technology which provides advanced training in science and technology that are currently most widely used and applied in the fields of aeronautics and space exploration. He has been working there for the last three-and-a-half years. When NRIs were returning from Spain to India due to COVID-19 outbreak, Mr. Sankin, who did not choose to turn then, sent an awareness message through a video clip from Spain during the lockdown. He tried to create awareness among his people and asked them to maintain social distancing and wash their hands often and stay home to prevent the spread of virus. He, however, returned to his village recently. The journey from Tumkur to Barcelona has seen many a milestone: Mr. Sankin completed primary school studies at a government school in his native village before he joined a private college for PU at Gadag. Later, he completed Bachelor of Aeronautical Engineering in Mangaluru. Then, he moved to Barcelona to study the Master’s Degree in Aerospace Science and Technology. Poverty “I was born to a poor agriculturist family of Siddappa and Gowramma, along with three brothers. Poverty triggered a zeal inside me and made me become an Aerospace Engineer,” Mr. Sankin told The Hindu . Mr. Sankin also has a plan to serve people of his village through video messages by guiding them how to prepare for higher studies. “Young students from rural areas should not suffer from any status-issues but they should come out with confidence and courage and achieve their goals,” he advised. Grand welcome Residents of Tumkur were curious to see the son of the village who had been away from home for five years when he returned. They greeted him in a grand manner and took him out in a procession to his house from the village entrance. His family members welcomed him by offering an Arati. “Being an illiterate farmer, I am happy about my son’s achievement which I did not expect will happen when he was studying in my village. His hard work and commitment towards his studies have brought him success,” Siddappa Sankin, Mr. Sankin’s father, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yadgir-to-barcelona-a-journey-of-an-aerospace-engineer/article33778133.ece
08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Plan for e-buses hits a speed breaker||For the third time in a row, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has cancelled the tender to lease and operate electric buses under the Centre’s FAME II Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles in India). The Corporation cited high operational costs, the same reason given when the tenders were cancelled in the past. According to sources, the lowest bidder had quoted Rs. 65 per km as operational cost payable by the BMTC to the private party to lease buses. Non-AC buses BMTC Managing Director C. Shikha told The Hindu another round of tenders will be floated to lease 300 non-air-conditioned e-buses. “The cost quoted by the bidders was quite high. We expected a more competitive rate. Tender specifications will be modified to receive competitive bidding in the next round. We have already got an extension till March to lease buses under the scheme,” she said. Transport corporations have taken a huge hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ridership is yet to reach pre-COVID-19 levels. She said, “Considering BMTC’s financial position, we have to take decisions cautiously. Agreeing to higher operational cost may jeopardise the finances of the corporation in the long run as we are reaching an agreement for a 12-year lease.” The BMTC has been trying to introduce e-buses in Bengaluru. After failing to avail of Central subsidy under FAME 1 Scheme due to various reasons despite floating tenders in 2018, it made fresh attempts under FAME 2. The BMTC had first floated a tender in 2019. Last year, considering the poor financial condition of the Corporation owing to the pandemic, it approached the Central government seeking more subsidies and an extension of the deadline to operate buses. It also decided to opt for non-AC buses. Another major decision taken was to utilise Rs. 100 crore budgetary allocation of the State government as subsidy to lure more bidders. Smart City lifeline Despite these setbacks, commuters may still get to ride on e-buses soon as the BMTC is hoping to run them under the Smart City project. The Corporation is leasing 90 non-AC electric buses, which it plans to operate on feeder service routes to Namma Metro. After receiving the order from the State government, which is likely to come this week, the letter of intent will be issued to the successful bidder, said Ms. Shikha. “Once we give a letter of intent, the successful bidder starts leasing buses within three months. First, they will give a prototype of the bus as per our specification. Once that is cleared, other buses will be operated. We will try to induct a few services this financial year,” she added.  The cost quoted by the bidders was quite high C.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s response to the Governor’s address in the Legislative Assembly last week was full of asides and anecdotes. Among the more interesting ones was the story about who is “eligible” to enter heaven or hell. It was veteran politician R.L. Jalappa who had told him why “vices” in this ephemeral world are important to find a place in the eternal one, said Mr. Siddaramaiah. “He once said that Yama asks anyone who seeks entry into heaven or hell whether he had a good life on earth. If the man says that he kept aloof from all forms of enjoyment while alive, he is sent right back to earth,” he said. By that logic, Mr. Siddaramaiah said, people like Minor Irrigation Minister J.C. Madhuswamy and Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, given their “clean image”, are at the risk of being sent back. He then turned his attention on unsuspecting Forest Minister Aravind Limbavali, and asked, “Do you drink whisky?” Taken aback and not knowing how to respond, Mr. Limbavali smiled sheepishly and said, “You know, don’t you?”   Use of the word “lies” ( sullu in Kannada) in the Legislative Assembly led to a debate during the session last week. Speaking on Governor Vajubhai R. Vala’s address, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah ( in picture ) said it was “full of lies”. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri raised doubts about the use of word “lies” as past Speakers have termed it an unparliamentary word. The former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar said the word “lies” was used differently in different contexts. Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said veteran leader S.M. Krishna used the word in the Assembly when he was the Speaker in the early 1990s. Minister S. Suresh Kumar said use of the word “lies” is not against parliamentary norms but “telling lies” in the Assembly is. The debate ended when Mr. Siddaramaiah re-phrased himself to say the address was “far from the truth”.   As Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Minister for Major and Medium Irrigation Ramesh Jarkiholi failed to turn up in the Council to answer starred questions related to their departments, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had to hold the fort like an all-rounder. Answering eight questions related to Finance, Power, and Bengaluru Development on behalf of the Chief Minister and five related to water resources on behalf of Mr. Jarkiholi, Mr. Bommai also addressed questions related to the Home Department that he holds. Senior JD(S) member Basavaraj Horatti pointed out that Mr. Bommai had answered all 15 starredquestions that day which was a record of sorts. But he also criticised the other two for not attending the Council even for a single day. Bageshree S. Nagesh Prabhu K.V.

Dr. Isaac said the government’s policy was to ensure the development of the PSUs in the State. “The Centre is engaged in selling off PSUs. It plans to raise Rs. 1.75 lakh crore by selling stakes in PSUs. The Left Democratic Front government in the State, on the other hand, is initiating measures to strengthen the public sector companies,” the Minister said.

The new order, issued on January 30, said the earlier order was cancelled as civil cases in this regard were going on in the High Court and the earlier order created confusion on the status of trees. Trees’ status restored The new order issued by Revenue Principal Secretary A. Jayathilak has restored the status of various categories of trees on which restrictions on felling were imposed under the Kerala Promotion of Tree Growth Act 2005. In the earlier order issued last year by Mr. Jayathilak, it was stated that action would be taken against officials who prevented farmers from felling trees grown by them on land with title deeds. The order said that permission was not required to cut trees, except sandalwood, on such land. It also said that the ownership of trees in such land was entrusted with the title deed holder. Threat to rare species An official of Revenue Department said the new order would clear confusion over permission to cut trees. A blanket permission for cutting all species of trees would have wiped out rare species, especially in the Western Ghats areas. As per rules, there is no restriction on felling 28 species of trees grown by farmers in their land with title deeds issued under the 1964 Land Assignment Act. For felling 10 specified trees and some scheduled trees, permission is required. There is no permission to fell trees in Cardamom Hill Reserve and restrictions are in place for some title deeds issued in 1993 and afterwards. Farmers’ stance Fr. Sebastian Kochupurackal, general convener, High Range Samrakshana Samithy, an organisation under the Church for farmers, said widespread agitations would be launched against the new order, which he termed anti-farmer. “It is an infringement on the rights of farmers who are not allowed even to cut the trees grown by them,” he said.

08 February 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||No need for panic on ESZ declaration: Minister||Forests Minister K. Raju has said that there is no need for panic regarding the draft notification of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) declaring eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary as it would be revised before execution. Earlier, the ESZ was fixed at 118.59 sq. km around the sanctuary, including 18.21 sq. km of human settlements, inside the forest. The State government had submitted a revised draft notification on January 25 to the MoEFCC by reducing the ESZ to 88.21 sq. km after excluding the human settlements on 30 sq. km, said Mr. Raju in a release here on Saturday. When the revised draft notification would be published, all human settlements would be excluded from the ESZ, the Minister added. The draft notification, published on January 28, will be taken up for consideration after a period of 60 days. The public could also send in comments and suggestions on the draft proposals within 60 days of publication, said Mr. Raju. The guidelines for declaring ESZ was issued by the Central government on February 9, 2011, as per the direction of the Supreme Court. Later, it was decided to declare up to 10 km on the border of the protected area as default ESZ, if the zone would not be declared properly. A Cabinet meeting on November 23, 2019 decided to announce the ESZ from 0-1 km around 23 protected areas in the State and submitted draft notifications to the Central government. When the Central government had issued the draft notifications one by one by fixing the ESZ at 0-1 km around the protected areas, many human settlements were included in the zone and the public protested against the move. Later, the State government decided to submit maps of the zones on 28 September, 2020, by completely excluding human settlements. At present, human settlements in the State had been excluded from the ESZ, the Minister added.

08 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||No compromise on smart roads, says CSML||Faced with flak from a section of traders and road users over renovation of footpaths as part of efforts to develop five arterial roads as smart roads, Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) has asserted that footpaths and drains were rebuilt as part of a smart road design, and creating walkable localities is one of the key features of smart cities. In this, great thrust is given to develop space for pedestrians and non-motorised transport (NMT), in keeping with global trends. The road network is being created or refurbished not only for vehicles, but also for pedestrians and cyclists. Footpaths are being developed after clearing all encroachments. It is true that this redevelopment is disturbing a small section of the public, mainly traders and motorists who were unlawfully enjoying the right of way (ROW) of public roads, at the cost of rights enjoyed by pedestrians, said Jafar Malik, CEO of CSML. On allegations that the slope of a drain on DH Road was unscientifically altered, CSML sources said that all designs were part of the tender drawings and no alteration was made. A trader complained that the footpath in front of his shop was raised by around four inches, and that cars cannot park in front of the shop. This was needed because of streamlining the road level. There is need to curb unauthorised parking of vehicles, including on footpaths and on narrow roads, they added. “Generally, we don’t disturb the existing flow of drainage water. In locations where it is possible to reverse the flow, we designed it. We did this for drains starting from the High Court Junction to Market Canal and created a bypass drain to the existing drains from Menaka to Market Canal along Shanmugham Road. This proved effective during the last monsoon when most arterial roads except this stretch, were inundated.” Road slant “We do profile correction of all smart roads and wherever possible in other roads also. It is done in longitudinal direction, where existing undulations are corrected, to ensure a smooth driving surface. This may create increase in level at some areas, which is unavoidable. We keep the centre line level almost the same, but sides may be increased or decreased to correct the camber. This also may increase the level of the road kerb at some locations. Problems arise when shops abut roads, without any front setback. But we make sure that possible mitigations measures are done to prevent flood water entering their premises,” the sources said. Coordination issues On issues involving coordination with different agencies while developing smart city works, Mr. Malik said works are done in brown-field area. “Very often, there is delay in obtaining permission from owner agencies to redirect utilities which hamper safe and smooth movement of pedestrians and vehicles. This often delays many of our works. Agencies like KWA insist that their work must be done by their approved contractors. There have been instances of contractors delaying works to create more work for them. All this led to some works suffering delay,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-compromise-on-smart-roads-says-csml/article33778211.ece

The 44th meeting of the committee for the declaration of ESZ around protected areas, held last month, wanted Kerala to reconsider the notifications of these sanctuaries. In the case of Thattekkad, the State did not mark any ESZ on the eastern and south-eastern side of the protected area considering the density of population in these parts. The park managers of Aralam sanctuary also excluded some highly populated areas in its south-western boundary. The ESZ was proposed only on the north-western direction of the Idukki sanctuary, excluding all other sides of the protected area. The State justified the marking of the zero zones in these sanctuaries by highlighting the high human density and popular apprehension that farming activities may be hit in these areas. However, the panel observed that the justification given by the State Government was not acceptable and shall be re-examined. It also noted that there was no prohibition in agriculture practices within the ESZ. It was the responsibility of the State government to dispel such wrong notions, it was noted.  At the same time, the ESZ proposals of Silent Valley National Park and Kottiyoor Wildlife Sanctuary were approved. The proposal of Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary will be reconsidered at the next meeting after incorporating the changes suggested at the meeting, revealed documents. The panel asked the authorities to remove MLAs from the monitoring committees of Idukki, Kottiyoor, and Malabar Wildlife Sanctuaries. ‘Will revise proposals’ The zero ESZ proposals of Malabar sanctuary, which has a hydroelectric project in the southern side and tribal and other settlements on the western and north-western sides, was approved by the committee as there was not much scope of ESZ extent in the southern and western sides, the documents revealed. Surendrakumar, Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, said the State would revise the ESZ proposals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ecozone-proposals-on-3-sanctuaries-rejected/article33778257.ece

With the rate quoted by the three contractors being higher than the estimated cost, the State government and the Kochi Corporation are now going to have to decide who will bear the excess cost. The proposed treatment plants are to come up in Edakochi North, Edakochi South, and Perumpadappu. The estimated rate for the three systems was Rs. 41.8 crore, and the rate quoted was Rs. 54.09 crore. The tender was approved by the corporation council last year and was also approved by the State Level High Powered Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary. The steering committee had suggested that 50% of the excess amount of Rs. 12.28 crore would be borne by the State government and the other half by the corporation, requiring the civic agency to pay Rs. 6.14 crore. But UDF councillors opposed the suggestion that the corporation would have to make an additional payment. The civic body’s financial position will make it difficult to bear the cost, they said, adding that the support of local residents would have to be ensured before the project could take off. “But we cannot abandon the project. We will approach the Chief Secretary with the suggestion that the State government take up the entire excess cost,” Mayor M. Anilkumar said. Additionally, the corporation will also have to bear the cost of operation and maintenance of the systems, which amounts to Rs. 7.68 crore for five years and has already been tendered. Each treatment plant will have a capacity of 1.4 million litres per day. Sources at the corporation said the cost of the project had gone up since the earlier estimate had been prepared using prices from 2016. The sewerage plants will use a small bore system which carries and treats leachate from waste. The sludge from pits in houses will have to be removed once in three years and taken to the plant on Willingdon Island. The expenses for vehicles to remove the sludge have been covered in the operation and maintenance cost. This system was found to be effective for West Kochi, where the water table is high. Large pipes cannot be laid at a steep gradient to carry the sludge as well. Abhilash Thoppil, Congress councillor representing Edakochi South, said the area where the sewerage plant was to come up was densely populated, and it might be a better idea to implement it and ensure its proper functioning elsewhere before it was set up in a residential space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sewage-treatment-system-for-west-kochi-hits-fund-hurdle/article33778218.ece
08 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||SilverLine to decongest highways||The Rs. 63,941-crore Silverline semi-high-speed-rail corridor has the potential to take away 457 lorries off Kerala’s congested and accident-prone highways every day, since a dozen roll on-roll off (ro-ro) trains — each capable of carrying 40 lorries — will cover the 530-km-long Kasaragod-Thiruvananthapuram route in five hours, according to V. Ajith Kumar, Managing Director, Kerala Railway Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL). Such trains operate at speeds of up to 140 kmph in the UK and Germany. They can touch up to 130 kmph in Silverline, for which rolling stock (rakes) can either be imported or built in India by firms which have expertise. The ro-ro trains will be able to operate mostly at night and during off-peak hours, he said. In addition, the operational expense of a lorry will be limited to Rs. 26 per km, as compared to much more if it were to take the road route. Similarly, the five-hour travel time through the length of the State will be in stark contrast with the approximately 14 hours that a lorry would need if it were to take the road. Collateral benefits The collateral benefits will be much more in the form of lessening pollution, congestion, and accidents. The Silverline project will reduce emission of greenhouse gases by 2.87 lakh tonnes in 2025-‘26, when the project is expected to be realised. It will increase to 5.94 lakh in 2052-‘53, when much more passengers and cargo are expected to use the service, sources in the agency said. As per the plan, passenger trains in the corridor are expected to operate from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. The per passenger fare is estimated at Rs. 2.75 per km. The ro-ro trains will take over from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and during off-peak hours. Loading / unloading of goods from lorries at terminals, which will have direct link to wide roads, is estimated to be over in 90 minutes, as compared to 120 minutes on the Konkan route where the patronage for ro-ro trains is high, it added.

08 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Cargo ferry via NW to resume service||The transportation of containers through the Kottayam-Kochi National Waterway (NW) corridor will resume in a fortnight after a two-year lull, decongesting roads and at the same time ushering in an economical, eco-friendly and energy-efficient mode to ferry cargo. A 240-tonne barge capable of carrying up to twenty 20-feet containers had conducted four trips in the corridor, which is part of NW IX and NW III, in March 2019, carrying export / import cargo. The transit time along the 85-km waterway is around seven hours. “The vessel will shortly be dry-docked and put into service later this month, this time to ferry wheat, rice, and tiles. Efforts will be made to procure a second bigger barge to operate on the under-utilised route which holds tremendous potential. Waterway transport of cargo is 30% cheaper as compared to the road route, while materials like tiles can be transported without the risk of them cracking when being taken through ill-maintained roads,” said Abraham Varghese, managing director, Kottayam port. Between 250 and 270 container loads of wheat and rice arrive every month at the Kottayam port. Transporting them through narrow and congested roads will worsen traffic hold-ups and pollution. A shift to waterway transport will considerably help lessen the carbon footprint of transporting such a volume of cargo. The Kottayam port will become an even busier hub for cargo transit in central Kerala, once the Vizhinjam port is commissioned, it is learnt. Hazardous cargo “Transportation of fuel and other hazardous goods too must be shifted to waterways, since tanker lorries pose safety hazard to road users. The State government can step in by providing incentives to woo cargo operators to inland waterways that abound in Kerala. On their part, personnel of Customs, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), and Cochin Port Trust were of tremendous help in incorporating the Kottayam port, the sole inland container depot in Kerala which was accorded the status of a minor port by the State government, in the system,” Mr. Varghese said. “We will provide all assistance for barge operators on the route,” said Mathew George, Director, IWAI. The agency had cleared weeds and arranged pilotage to the vessel which operated the first trip, in 2019. This might not be necessary this time. The cost savings, vis-a-vis road transport, will increase when cargo is ferried over longer distances, he added. From Kottayam, the barge will transit through Alappuzha, Muhamma, Thannermukkom, Vaikom, and Aroor, following which it will reach the Vallarpadam container transshipment terminal, Mr. George said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cargo-ferry-via-nw-to-resume-service/article33778222.ece

Interacting with media persons here on Sunday, the Minister for Power and Renewable Energy, said it was a protest by middlemen from Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh. No farmers from elsewhere in the country are participating in the protest. Middlemen, who were reaping huge profits, were behind the protest. Those who are protesting should explain how the provisions of the three farm legislations would adversely affect the farmers, he said. Referring to the Budget proposals, Mr. Singh said Kerala would benefit substantially from the proposals. Kerala will have nine new railway projects including the electrification of railway lines. Kochi harbour is one among the five fishing harbours in the country that have been selected for upgradation. The centre has also cleared the second phase of the Kochi metro rail project. The government will make substantial contributions for the second phase of the project, he said. The Minister hinted that the power distribution sector would be opened up and more private players would come in. The move will lead to the improvement in the quality of service. The customers will benefit from the better pricing of power as there would be competition among the operators, he said. Over the past five years, India, which was a power-deficient country, made a turnaround and became a power surplus country. Currently, the country is exporting power to Bangladesh and Nepal, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/middlemen-blamed-for-stir/article33778229.ece
08 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||HC dismisses pleas||The Kerala High Court dismissed a batch of writ petitions seeking a directive not to proceed with land acquisition for the proposed semi-high-speed rail corridor without the approval of the Central government, the Railway Board, and other statutory boards. When the petition came up for hearing, the State government and the Railways submitted that they were in the process of constructing a new double line rail corridor as a Silverline semi-high-speed railway between Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod. This will be in addition to the existing two railway lines and will enable trains to travel at a maximum speed of around 200 kmph. The project was conceptualised to meet the growing demand from rail passengers and cater to future travel needs. The project is expected to materialise within five years on getting formal approval from the Railway Board. A joint venture company of the State government and the Railways, called Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL), had been formed for the implementation of the project. In fact, the NITI Aayog had examined the detailed project report and had sought certain clarifications. The State had already already furnished its reply. The petitions alleged that the project was financially enviable, ecologically destructive, and commercially non-feasible. Centre’s nod The court also recorded the submission of the State government and the Railways that they would proceed with the project only after getting concurrence from the Centre as well as the Railway Board and other statutory authorities. It also recorded that their submission that the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act would be followed strictly before acquiring land. The court said it could not interfere with a policy decision either on the ground that it was erroneous or on the ground that a better, fairer, or wiser alternative was available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-dismisses-pleas-against-silverline-project/article33778202.ece
08 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Corporation’s projects moving at a snail’s pace||Years after they were launched, multiple projects taken up by the Kochi Corporation have made little progress, some taking only baby steps towards completion. Despite being hauled by the State Pollution Control Board in the past, the corporation’s abattoir at Kaloor continues to operate with a dysfunctional biogas plant and no effluent treatment plant. A plan to set up a more modern facility at the same site is yet to take off. The detailed project report for the modernisation of the slaughterhouse has been submitted to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), which will shell out the project cost of Rs. 20 crore, said a corporation official associated with the project. A consultant had prepared the DPR, which was submitted to KIIFB in April last year and was returned to the corporation for correction, the official added. It was recently submitted again for approval. Meanwhile, the biogas plant at the slaughterhouse, which can treat effluents, will be repaired and the work, worth Rs. 3 lakh, will begin on Monday, he said. The PCB had suggested last year that the biogas plant be made functional immediately. The proposal for a Rs. 10-crore worth new, smaller slaughterhouse at Mattancherry is awaiting technical sanction from Suchitwa Mission, the official said. The corporation’s e-governance project, which could have placed applications, registrations and tax payment facilities online, has not budged since the council decided in June last year to hand the project over to Information Kerala Mission (IKM). Without the cooperation of TCS, which had prepared some of the modules earlier, it might not be possible to proceed, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. TCS had categorically stated in a letter to the corporation in June last year that they will not provide any further support. “This is being scrutinised at the State government level. The government’s assistance will be required to rope both TCS and IKM in,” he said.  New office Construction of the corporation’s new office building, which began in 2005, is yet to be completed. The corporation is set to assign the task of preparing a design and estimate for work on the interiors, like plumbing and sanitary fittings, to a company at a cost of Rs. 3.5 lakh. Ongoing work on the building costs around Rs. 24 crore and the interiors will cost an additional amount based on the estimate to be prepared. While the Mayor had earlier said that the council hall would not have sufficient seating space, the design error has been rectified, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporations-projects-moving-at-a-snails-pace/article33778212.ece

The meeting comes in the wake of the expert committee for the declaration of ESZ around protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and tiger reserves, rejecting the proposed notification for the sanctuary. While notifying the ESZ, an extent of one kilometre around the boundary of Thattekad Bird Sanctuary was considered and the eastern and south-eastern sides of the protected area were left out. Thus, an area of 16 sq km was notified as the ESZ with an extent ranging from zero to one kilometre from the boundary of the sanctuary. The Wildlife Warden, Idukki, said expert committee members suggested including two or three waterbodies, which were part of the Periyar, in the ESZ of the sanctuary.

08 February 2021||Kochi,KERALA||PWD promises to repair joints on overbridge soon||The gaps that have been developing between embankment and girders of Ernakulam North overbridge will be repaired shortly by the Public Works Department (Bridges wing). The four-lane bridge was built in 2013 by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC), as part of Kochi metro’s preparatory works. Its defect-liability period expired a year later. Motorists — especially two and three-wheeler riders — have ever since been complaining of the gaps at either end of the bridge, which hamper a smooth ride through its surface. “We have submitted an estimate worth about Rs. 5 lakh to repair the joints of the bridge, since a few discernible gaps persist despite being tar-coated recently. It is rather difficult to get specialist contractors to do the work, since the estimate is not very substantial. We may have to opt for breaking the joints and redoing the concrete, in case the problem still persists. A problem here is that traffic might have to be regulated for a few days,” PWD sources said. Sources in DMRC said that the bridge was handed over back to PWD since it owns the roads on either side. “The gaps persist since settlement is taking place on the embankment. We used to frequently carry out regrading work, to lessen the impact of the settlement. The PWD too would have to continue doing this every few months, till the settlement lessens,” they said. Taking this into account, the design for Pachalam overbridge — yet another preparatory work of Kochi metro — was altered. Thus, the height of the embankment was considerably lessened, to almost the level of roads on either side, by extending the girders to almost the ground level. A similar but improvised design was adopted for Champakkara overbridge, so much so that the last span rests a little below the road level, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pwd-promises-to-repair-joints-on-overbridge-soon/article33778223.ece

V.S. Akbar, who got elected as Mulavukad panchayat president in his debut innings as a member, seems insistence on proving that clichéd notion wrong. Within days of being sworn-in as a member, he started going around his ward to ensure uninterrupted receipt of welfare pensions. The pension for widows aged under 60 years and spinsters aged below 50 years need an affidavit from the newly elected ward member about their continuing eligibility when the panchayat governing committee changes. “I chose to door-deliver that affidavit to spare the aged beneficiaries of the hardship of having to come to me. I have asked other members as well to do the same. Besides, these visits help me get a clear first-hand idea about the problems faced by people,” said Mr. Akbar. Beneficiaries then can submit an application along with the death certificate of the husband, in the case of widow pension, copies of ration card and Aadhaar card, and the member’s affidavit with the village officer and get the relevant certificate through the common service centres. First contest Though it was Mr. Akbar’s first electoral contest, the 47-year-old Congress activist has been in the forefront of numerous popular protests related to issued faced by the panchayat over the years, from the shortage of drinking water and absence of road to lack of proper transport. He was among the organisers of nearly a year-long protest at Bolghatty Junction for road and other days-long-protests before the Kerala Water Authority and the Goshree Islands Development Authority and was also jailed in the process. Though he bought a bus to alleviate the transportation woes of the islanders who at that time was mostly dependent on the fleecing share autorickshaws, it ended in a fiasco. A bad road meant frequent maintenance and disruption of services, denting the revenues and that by extension affected the loan repayment following which the bank attached the bus. Contesting the election, said Mr. Akbar, who rose through the ranks of students’ and youth outfits, was never a priority till this time when the party wanted to field him from the second ward. He duly repaid that faith by wresting the ward back from the Left Democratic Front that won it in the last two elections. Priorities Having already convened a meeting of various departments to remove obstacles in ongoing works, he has now lined up the inundation of houses during high tide, the opening of the new homoeo hospital by facilitating water and power connections, and waste management as the priority issues for the maiden meeting of the governing committee scheduled for January 19.

District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao led the initiative, which entered its second phase. Mr. Rao said the drive would be continued with the participation of more citizens. “Anyone can join the drive by clicking the register option on the event panel on the Nammude Kozhikode app,” he said. A majority of the participants on the first day were those who had registered their names on the Nammude Kozhikode mobile app. The first phase of the cleaning mission was stopped following the outbreak of COVID-19. Project coordinators said the mission would ensure occasional cleaning of beach destinations. They said it evoked good response from youth and students’ organisations in the district. Meanwhile, some of the city residents have called upon the district administration to make beach vendors accountable for the collection and disposal of biodegradable waste. Many social media users posted their demand on the official Facebook page of the District Collector. Residents also flayed the district administration for not taking action against illegally constructed drains alongside the seashore. They said no cleaning drive would be meaningful without the closing of such channels. They also called for imposing hefty fines on those dumping waste near the beach. A group of morning walkers at the South beach said the lack of adequate number of waste bins for collecting biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste posed a problem. More number of waste collection points should come up with proper arrangements for their daily cleaning, they demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/clean-beach-mission-resumes-in-kozhikode/article33778193.ece
08 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Lorry owners plan 15% increase in rentals||Hit by the frequent hike in diesel prices and various maintenance charges, lorry owners across the State are planning to raise the rental amount by 15% to compensate for the losses. The delay in the consolidation of rental amounts as agreed upon by the State and Union governments has also prompted the segment to independently go ahead with the revision. Though the previously consolidated amount per kilometre for lorry service is Rs. 60, the actual rent received by majority of the operators is just Rs. 28, they say. With strong bargaining by traders, the lorry owners are not even in a situation to claim Rs. 30 a km. It is at a time when autorickshaws charge Rs. 25 a km in cities, the operators claim. “The delay in revision of rental charges has troubled many lorry owners who purchased the vehicles as a self-employment option. Many who purchased vehicles using bank loans are now unable to pay back the loans. Some of them have sold their vehicles at cheaper rates to escape from the loan burden,” says Shaju Almana, a functionary of the Lorry Owners Federation. There are around 17,000 National Permit trucks which connect Kerala with various other States. Apart from this, there are about 5,000 lorries carrying out inter-district services. The State mainly depends on these trucks for the transportation of a major portion of food products. Interstate trucks transport grain from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. According to various merchant associations in the State, any hike in the rental amount of trucks will have a direct impact on the prices of essential commodities such as rice, fruits and vegetables. The government should make a reasonable intervention to address the lorry operators’ genuine demands and consider more welfare schemes for them, they point out. Revision At the same time, the lorry owners claim that the revision of the rental amount alone would not result in price hike. According to them, the traders were trying to place the whole blame on the lorry operators. Another reason that has prompted the lorry operators to consider a hike in rental charges is the scrappage policy announced by the Union government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lorry-owners-plan-15-increase-in-rentals/article33778228.ece

A.A. Rahim, DYFI State secretary, told the media on Sunday that the MYL should also disclose if the funds were transferred to the family. An eight-year-old girl from a nomadic community of Bakerwal in Jammu and Kashmir was kidnapped from Kathua’s Rasana area on January 10, 2018, and was found dead seven days later. He alleged that Deepika Singh Rajawat, who appeared for the victim in the court, had been sidelined to siphon off the money. According to media reports, Ms. Rajawat said that not even a penny had been provided from Kerala for running the case. The controversy arose when Yousuf Padanilam, a former functionary of the MYL, alleged at a press meeting recently that the funds collected from Kerala in the name of the victim had been misappropriated. He claimed that MYL leaders had pocketed the money for themselves. The MYL leaders, however, countered the allegation claiming that the money had been spent for running the court case and providing financial support to the family of the victim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/release-details-of-bank-account-says-dyfi/article33778226.ece

Officials said 150 students and 34 teachers of Government Higher Secondary School, Maranchery, tested positive for the virus. However, none of them showed any symptoms. As many as 684 students were subjected to tests following detection of the virus in a student. Officials said all of them were Standard 10 students. The higher secondary students of the school will also be tested. The school has students from the neighbouring Thrissur district also. All students have been asked to go in quarantine. The district medical authorities ordered all schools across the district to maintain vigil against the spread of COVID-19. At a school at Vanneri, 39 students and 36 staff tested positive for the virus. The authorities were puzzled at the rate of spread in both the schools. District authorities asked the schools to strictly follow the protocol. They said students should maintain a minimum two-metre gap at school. Those from homes with COVID-19 positive patients or people in isolation should not go to school until directed by the health authorities. School premises, furniture, stationery, store rooms, water tanks, kitchen, canteens, toilets, labs, and library should be sanitised. Tanks, wells, and other water resources should be sanitised with bleaching powder. The authorities said old and stale food should not be used. Masks, digital thermometers, sanitisers, and soaps should be arranged at schools. Physical distancing should be ensured both for students and teachers in classrooms and staff rooms, officials said. Health check-ups should be done for teachers and students whenever needed. Physical distancing should be maintained in school buses too. “Masks should be made compulsory on board school buses, and thermal screening should be done for students before boarding buses. Curtains should be avoided in buses, and windows should be left open,” the health authorities advised. 663 more cases in Kozhikode As many as 663 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Kozhikode district on Sunday, while 623 recovered from the infection. According to the District Medical Officer, there were 656 locally acquired infections, and the source of six others was not known.

09 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||IFFK 2021: Tale of travails, transformations||A longing for the past, and what is being slowly lost, as well as an awareness of the inevitable transformations all around marks Gaurav Madan’s debut film ‘Barah by Barah (12x12)’. It is set in Varanasi, a city with history dating back to the centuries that is being unrecognisably transformed in recent times. Its protagonist is a photographer of dead bodies in Manikarnika ghat, who is the last of his kind in the profession, almost pushed to joblessness with the proliferation of smart phones. Also Read: Get 'First Day First Show', our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here Film in celluloid The mood of the content is reflected in the form too, with Madan choosing to shoot the film in celluloid, rather than the easier, digital way. Speaking to The Hindu , ahead of the film’s Indian première at the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala on February 11 in the capital, Madan says he was ready for the set of challenges associated with that decision, like having 15 rehearsals with the actors before every take. “Digital has made us lethargic. I came into the industry a decade ago, just before films made an exit, and I was fortunate to shoot a lot of ads and short films in it. I believe that digital can never replace film in terms of its organic quality,” he says. His co-writer Sunny Lahiri, who is also the film’s cinematographer, chanced upon the idea for the film during a visit to Varanasi, when he met a ‘death photographer’. “This guy was a very cinematic character. We have had several films on photography, but here is a person who actually shoots the dead. Usually, photographers tell their subjects to move or wait for their subject to do something, but it does not work that way. When we left for Benares to start the film, we did not have a script or a story, only this character. We stayed at a guest house near the ghats and then the story came organically, as a lot of things were unfolding in front of us,” says Madhan. Demolition works Parallel to the main story, they capture the physical transformations of Varanasi in recent times, as part of Ganga-Kashi Vishwanath corridor work, and the demolition works that has led to a lot of criticism. “We created a character, who is losing his house as part of the demolitions. We were shooting during the actual demolitions, so we were fortunate to capture a historic transition, which has a lot of politics too to it. The politics part of it I keep very subtle, but there are enough hints to tell you my point of view, because I believe in taking sides,” he says. Out of funds Halfway through the independent film, they ran out of funds and had to do a crowd-funding campaign to raise money. “A few people whom we approached for funding refused to watch the film, because they thought it is “just another Benares film”. People have a singular reference to Varanasi. There is so much more to the place than the ghats. We have consciously not over-romanticised the ghats,” says Madhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iffk-2021-tale-of-travails-transformations/article33778186.ece
08 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Main pipeline from Neyyar to come up soon||The construction of a main transmission pipeline over a distance of 23.8 kilometres for sourcing drinking water from the Neyyar dam site to the capital city, which forms the second critical component of the 120-mld Neyyar water supply project, is expected to kick off in the near future. The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has awarded the work to Erode-based Annai Infra Developers, and the two entities are expected to ink the formal agreement soon. The work involves the supply, laying, testing, and commissioning of a 1422-mm, mild steel, clear water gravity main from the 120-mld water treatment plant proposed at the Neyyar dam site to the ground-level storage reservoir (GLSR) of the KWA at PTP Nagar. Survey for the construction of the transmission main has been completed and the work does not involve land acquisition, a KWA official says. The Erode-based firm has bagged the contract for Rs. 137.70 crore, according to KWA officials. Funds for the work are being mobilised through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). A high-level meeting of the State-run water utility on January 28 has directed the projects division to ensure that the pipeline construction is completed in 18 months. One of the two projects One of two big projects in the KWA kitty that promise a long-term solution to the water woes of the city region, the Neyyar project envisages a daily supply of 100 million litres to the city and 20 million litres a day (mld) to Vilappil, Vilavoorkal, Maranalloor and Malayinkeezhu panchayats. Work on the primary component of the water supply project—the 120-mld water treatment plant at Neyyar—had been delayed due to ownership disputes over a six-acre plot identified for establishing the facility. With cases pending in court, the KWA has pinpointed another suitable site to avoid delay in the implementation of the project. Initially, the plan has been to commission the water supply project by March 2021, but that schedule has gone awry due to the land row and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Neyyar reservoir was designated as a possible alternative water source for the city region after the KWA was forced to rig temporary pumping facilities there when water levels in the Peppara dam—the main source—dipped alarmingly during 2017 summer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/main-pipeline-from-neyyar-to-come-up-soon/article33778355.ece

The Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has released the audio books and the sign language-adapted classes for revision portions for Classes 10 and 12, highlighting the focus areas, for the annual examinations in March, as part of the classes aired through the KITE VICTERS educational channel. The revision class audio books can be heard like one would listen to a radio programme and are easily downloadable and shareable on mp3 format. The entire Class 10 revision is covered in just 10 hours, says K. Anvar Sadath, CEO, KITE, in a statement here. All materials will be available on the First Bell portalfirstbell.kite.kerala.gov.inThe portal facilitates easy downloading and sharing of the audio books. KITE has issued directions to the officials concerned to extend the broadband Internet facility provided to schools as part of the High-Tech School project to the students who require these. Free software-based screen reading software ‘Orca’ has been installed in all laptops supplied to schools, and all visually challenged teachers are given specialised information and communications technology (ICT) training by KITE. Visually challenged children are already listening to the audio of the First Bell digital classes in a big way. The exclusive audio books will be an added advantage to these students, says Mr. Sadath. Sign-language Specific classes with sign-language adapted content have also been developed for students with hearing disabilities. At present, these students are provided with special classes developed by their teachers at the school levels. However, with the inclusion of sign language-adapted classes, they will be able to understand the revision classes in a more structured manner. The State Council of Educational Research and Training has provided sign-adapted training to teachers in the sector. First Bell has completed telecast of over 6,300 classes (3,150 hours) till date, including for the Kannada and Tamil medium along with the general medium classes. The White Board programme by the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, for students with special needs is in place in the State. With the inclusion of the audio books and the sign-language adapted classes, the First Bell programme has created a new model of digital inclusion. This model will subsequently be replicated for all classes, says Mr. Sadath.

Kerala cuisine||Known as food lover’s paradise for its generous use of spices and coconut, Kerala cuisine is also sought after for its diversity and cultural influences. The uniqueness and popularity of the region’s platter is used by Kerala Tourism to increase tourist footfalls and to promote the destination. Hence, the thumping response from travel fraternity and food enthusiasts worldwide to the unique campaign ‘Kerala Cuisine Contest 2020-21’, the online cooking contest that asks the traveller to embrace Kerala in their kitchen by exploring the authentic dishes and to get connected to the State, has not come much as a surprise. All that the contest requires the participants to do is to cook any of the Kerala dishes and share the cooking video on the official webpage created for the contest. The winners will get an all-paid seven-night family trip to Kerala post-COVID-19. The travellers may select from the array of dishes shared on the website and cook the dish of their choice. Kerala Tourism has shared more than 100 cooking videos on its website to help assist the newbies in cooking the dishes. The minimum duration of the video is three minutes and the maximum five minutes with the file size of one entry not exceeding 500 MB. Lockdown effect The unique campaign has struck the right chord with travellers for various reasons. Being stuck at home due to the COVID-19, many people have taken up cooking as a hobby. Just a month after its launch, the campaign received 3,000-plus registrations from various countries, including South Africa, Sri Lanka, Germany, Ecuador, Canada, UK, Australia, Spain, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia, US, Algeria, Netherlands, Greece, Zimbabwe, Romania, France, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Aland Island, Bahrain, Bhutan, Bosnia, Ghana, Guyana, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Montenegro, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Taiwan, and Tajikistan.

The contest has received endorsements from a cross section of people including a group of children below 12 years from the SRM Welkin Higher Secondary School, Sopore, Kashmir, who shared a short video that they created to promote the contest. Some travel enthusiasts from Zimbabwe also shared a similar video. There are also people like Roxana Dana Saila from Romania who dressed up in Kerala attire and uploaded videos. Kerala’s tourism industry, which is reeling under severe crisis due to the pandemic, is hopeful that such innovative campaigns will help to maintain ‘Brand Kerala Tourism’ a trending topic among holidayers. Renowned chefs, academicians and social media influencers have volunteered to be the celebrity ambassadors of the contest. Prominent names among them are chef Manjeet Gill, chef Ricky Narayan, chef Ajay Sood, executive chef Giovanni Fortugno from Italy, and chef Nellu Kaura, Asian Book Record holder, known as the ‘Lady with a Chef Coat’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wooing-tourists-with-cuisine/article33778195.ece

With schools closed for the most part and online classes not quite on a par with direct classroom experience, especially in the case of financially and socially backward students, the same approach was adopted when it was decided to take the Surili Hindi learning enrichment programme online for upper primary students. Surili Hindi will get under way in the district on Monday with the uploading of the first of 10 videos already ready. These videos, of five to seven minute duration, promise to be fun, keep the students engaged, and even let them pick up some of the language without conscious effort. Follow-up activities sent by teachers on WhatsApp will help them communicate even more in Hindi. One video a week One video a week will be uploaded, and then followed up with lots of activities till the next video is put up a week later. Surili Hindi will continue even during the summer vacations, they say. Twenty-four teachers were provided with day-long training at the Samagra district office ahead of the roll-out. They, in turn, trained upper primary Hindi teachers in their respective subdistricts. The videos have been prepared by the Palakkad district unit of the Samagra Shiksha with academic support from its Hindi core group. Though initially targeted at students from Classes 5 to 7, there are plans to prepare videos for Classes 8 and 9 in the next phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/samagra-shikshas-surili-hindi-ready-to-reach-students/article33778347.ece

Minister for Welfare of Minorities, Waqf and Haj, K.T. Jaleel, told The Hindu that MYL leaders had collected the fund during Friday prayers. However, the money was not used for the stated purpose. He said former MYL national committee member Yusuf Padanilam would petition Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan against the “fraud”. He would also petition the Director, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, and the Enforcement Directorate. The accusation was that MYL leaders had conspired to cheat contributors by promising that they would use the money for succouring families of Kathua and Unnao (Uttar Pradesh) rape-murder victims and giving them legal aid. MYL State general secretary P.K. Firoz and national general secretary C.K. Subar are among the respondents in the case. Lawyer’s stance The MYL has denied the charges vehemently. It said the party had spent nearly Rs. 10 lakh on the legal fee. However, lawyer Deepika Singh Rajawat, who appeared for the victim’s family in the Kathua murder, had said in a televised interview that she had received no payment, was unaware of the fund collection, and fought the case for free. The government is likely to order a preliminary Vigilance inquiry into the accusation.

Despite the university lacking a sustainable solid waste management protocol, the Department of Sociology has successfully turned its premises into a zero-waste institution through two years of focused efforts that involved doing away with plastics and other non-biodegradable products with eco-friendly alternatives. According to Antony Palackal, head of the department, careful planning that included a ‘waste audit’ preceded the implementation of Project Dhatri action research project. On a normal working day, the department used to generate nearly a quarter of a bucket of food wastes and 25 to 30 plastic wrappers. The quantity of wastes used to increase by around five times during seminars and open-defences that were organised in the department. The waste generated would be dumped in the backyard of the department premises and burnt occasionally. While the practice continued till 2019, the adoption of a sustainable waste management system ushered in a change. The students of the department swung into action to ensure four major conferences that were conducted in the department adhered to green protocol. Appreciation Their efforts earned them appreciation from the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation that has been working to spread the message of source-level waste disposal. According to research scholar Vishnu J. Menon, who has been coordinating the efforts, inorganic waste reduction and food waste generation analysis were undertaken at the end of each event to fine-tune their efforts until a successful model was found. A three-layered biocomposter bin was soon procured to collect food wastes and convert them into manure. The department trained its casual labourer into a ‘green technician’ equipped with the know-how of handling the bin. Plastic wastes that were generated in the department were being transferred to the Corporation’s material recovery facility in Kazhakuttom. The department also succeeded in developing a garden on its premises using the manure generated by composting units. An indoor vertical garden with automatic drip irrigation system was also soon established to enhance greenery. The department had submitted a proposal to replicate the waste management model across the Karyavattom campus, Dr. Palackal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-on-way-to-be-green-campus/article33778183.ece
08 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) seeks to shed its ‘anti-religion’ image||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has moved to dispel the Opposition propaganda that it is antagonistic to religion. The party is hoping to fend off the increasingly strident campaign that it is against Ayyappa devotees. Leverage issue The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have attempted to leverage the Sabarimala issue into anti-CPI(M) votes. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and CPI(M) State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan have indicated that the government will take ‘everybody’ on board once the Supreme Court finished reviewing its 2018 majority decision allowing women of all ages to worship at the Ayyappa temple. On Sunday, CPI(M) Central committee member M.V. Govindan sought to give an ideological veneer to the party’s ‘modified’ bearing on Sabarimala. He said the Marxist theory of dialectical materialism held that wealth, land, class, labour, and socio-economic realities triggered social conflicts rather than the needs of the mind and spirit. However, in India, the opposite was true. Indian society barely qualified as bourgeois democracy. It seemed mired in medieval values moored to religious beliefs. Hence, a purely theoretical Marxian approach to matters related to faith might not gain traction in the largely traditionalist setting. So, while remaining staunchly secular, the CPI(M) should take a pragmatic approach to religion, he said.  Middle ground Such a middle ground is essential, especially when the BJP is seeking to brazenly exploit Hindu faith to improve its electoral prospects in Kerala. BJP State president K. Surendran has promised to end government control of Devaswoms if voted to power. Devotees would administer temples and manage their vast assets. The Congress too has made Sabarimala the central election plank. Mr. Govindan’s pitch drew sharp criticism from the Congress. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran equated him to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The CPI(M) had shed its communist values and adopted a Hindu nationalist political line. Bid to demonise Its attempt to demonise the IUML as an Islamist outfit was part of the CPI(M)’s changed tack. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the CPI(M) should apologise for trampling on the faith of Ayyappa devotees. The party was scared of the groundswell of opposition from Ayyappa devotees would upend its bid for a second innings in power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-seeks-to-shed-its-anti-religion-image/article33778232.ece

08 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Economist seeks White Paper on higher education||Noted development economist K.P. Kannan has advocated the need to prepare a White Paper to assess the current state of higher education and research in Kerala. Its publication was vital to realise the government’s ambition to develop a knowledge-based economy in the State, he said. Prof. Kannan expressed his views on the subject while delivering the Dr. P.K. Gopalakrishnan Memorial Lecture at the 33rd Kerala Science Congress held recently. He said the preparation of a White Paper should ideally become the first step for policy formation, as it could become the basis of deliberations between the government and various stakeholders.  ‘Little public knowledge’ Such an exercise was necessary because there was little public knowledge on the various research activities and their findings undertaken by research and development (R&D) institutions such as the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, National Centre for Earth Sciences Studies, and the Kerala Forest Research Institute on land, water and natural resources. It was yet to be known if the State Planning Board was able to function as a bridge between the government and R&D institutions for exchange of knowledge. Referring to the increasing number of universities in the State, Prof. Kannan questioned the rationale behind establishing single-subject universities, particularly those that were devoid of any teaching or research departments. “By spreading our scarce public resources too thinly, we have made most of the 15 universities deficient of funds. This has had a cascading effect on their ability to ensure adequate facilities,” he said. A similar scenario unfolded in the cases of public sector enterprises that did not generate a net surplus, thereby placing an unnecessary burden on the tax payer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/white-paper-on-higher-education-sought/article33778182.ece

08 February 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Carving a safe space for women in hamlets||‘Pennidam’, a project conceived by the gender team of the Thrissur Kudumbashree Mission, is slowly making tribal hamlets women- and child-friendly and becoming a tribal development model for the State. Pennidam aimed at making every home a safe zone for women and children, said U. Monisha, Thrissur District Programme Manager of the mission. “During our visits to tribal hamlets, we realised that only an intensive and continuous intervention could make tribal homes women- and child-friendly,” said Ms. Monisha. Gender equality Cramped houses without any means of entertainment or exposure pushed the tribal community to frustrations and violence. “Actually gender equality existed in tribal society, maybe in a better way, than the so-called developed communities. But patriarchy and other gender discriminations seeped into the hamlets with their exposure to the outer world,” said Monisha. Pennidam, which was launched under the guidance of District Mission Coordinator K.V. Jyothish Kumar in November 2020, focused first on capacity building of women. It was initiated at the Vazhachal and Pokalappara hamlets in Athirappilly grama panchayat as a pilot project. Economic independence As economic independence was key to empowering the women, the mission initiated income-generating activities. Various activities and group projects are being organised. Until now, nearly five activities were organised ensuring participation of all women. “Improving physical and mental fitness was very important in making women more active and confident. In the absence of physical activities, they tend to withdraw to themselves. Their low self-esteem made them more vulnerable,” Monisha said. Activity groups were formed and these groups were trained in sports and games such as football, volleyball and badminton. Sports events were conducted. To improve their mental health, counselling and group therapies were organised. With the intensive interventions of two experienced resource persons, Nissy Anil and Shaji Joby, changes are already visible. “Sporting activities changed their attitude towards life. They have become more positive. The women started sharing their issues. Now they practice football and volleyball even without our guidance. Husbands, who earlier refused to send their wives for the games, now come to watch them play.” Active participation of women has been ensured in all sustainable development planning in the hamlets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/carving-a-safe-space-for-women-in-hamlets/article33778200.ece

08 February 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Withdraw COTPA, urges tobacco farmers’ group||The Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA) has appealed to the Centre to withdraw the proposed amendment bill to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) stating that the proposed bill would boost the sale of illegal cigarettes in the country. “The proposed COTPA (Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act) Amendment Bill 2020 will provide a huge boost to the ever-growing illicit cigarette business in India and will adversely impact the legal cigarette trade. As a result, there will be a drastic decline in demand for tobacco grown by Indian farmers and they will lose their only source of livelihood,” FAIFA said in an appeal to various ministries such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Labour, as well as the Prime Minister’s Office. “In the last few years, the government has imposed harsh tobacco regulations such as increasing the size of pictorial warnings, imposing punitive taxation on cigarettes with the tax burden more than trebling since 2012-13 and has even withdrawn export benefits. All these are leading to adverse consequences on the livelihood of crores of Indians without providing any alternative livelihood opportunities or help to farmers who cannot grow any other equally remunerative crop in the dry and arid regions they reside in,” said FAIFA president Javeri Gowda. Stating that cigarettes are the smallest component of tobacco consumption in India and constitute only 9% of tobacco use, FAIFA said that the legal cigarettes’ share of total tobacco consumption in India has declined from 21% in 1981-82 to 9% in 2019-20. Legal market “During the same period, overall tobacco consumption in the country has increased by 46%. The legal market for tobacco being excessively regulated has not in any way reduced the demand for tobacco products but has only caused a shift in consumption from legal to illegal duty evaded cigarettes and tax-evaded cheaper products,” Mr. Gowda claimed. “These harsh amendments will impact retailers and traders and they would not want to engage in the sale of legal cigarettes. As a result, criminal syndicates who have been pushing illegal tobacco will gain ground and will flood the Indian market with illicit cigarettes. Such illicit cigarettes may be of bad quality and will certainly not follow any of the regulations that are in force in India. Even currently, illegal tobacco product packages do not carry the statutory warning. Since these illicit cigarettes do not use domestically-grown tobacco produced by Indian farmers, the result would be loss of livelihood of millions of tobacco farmers who are dependent on the crop in the country,” Mr. Gowda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/withdraw-cotpa-urges-tobacco-farmers-group/article33778302.ece
08 February 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Krishna backwaters turn hub of mariculture in A.P.||A nearly 25 km stretch of the backwater channel in the Krishna estuary is flourishing with mariculture, for which it has emerged as a hub in Andhra Pradesh. High-value fish varieties like Asian sea bass and Indian pompano are being successfully cultivated here. It’s the prime livelihood option for many families belonging to some Scheduled Castes and Yanadi tribe people living by the backwaters along the stretch in Nagayalanka, Pedapalem and Edurumondi in the Diviseema region. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI-Visakhapatnam), the National Fisheries Development Board, NABARD and the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF-Chennai) are encouraging mariculture in the Krishna estuary by extending technical, scientific and financial assistance to the local communities. Humble beginning A decade ago, the CMFRI experimented on cage cultivation in support of a Diviseema-based progressive farmer, T. Raghu Sekhar, who later popularised it in the Krishna estuary. “At least 80 floating cages have been installed by the CMFRI and funded by the NFDB. A majority of them are owned by Dalit families and Yanadi tribe people in which they cultivate Indian pampano. Mariculture is a lifeline for the landless poor,” says Mr. Raghu Sekhar. CMFRI-Visakhapatnam in-charge scientist Subhadeep Ghosh tells The Hindu : “In A.P., the Krishna estuary has emerged as the hub for mariculture in the brackish water. Since 2019-20, we have installed nearly 80 high density polyethylene and galvanised iron cages here. The cages float on the water. .” UN role The MSSRF has chosen to promote the cultivation of Asian sea bass variety through the floating cages. MSSRF coastal systems research principal coordinator R. Ramasubramanyan says, “We have installed 10 cages, providing livelihood options with the adaptation fund granted by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The timely supply of seed and training will yield more results in mariculture, apart from uplifting the landless families.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/krishna-backwaters-turn-hub-of-mariculture-in-ap/article33777855.ece

When asked about the farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders over the farm laws, Mr. Prabhu said that the Budget offered the best to the agriculture sector by opening up the market through introduction of a digital platform called ‘e-mandi’, which he said would enable a farmer to sell his produce even in distant markets for a good price. This apart, the budget infused higher quantum of credit through NABARD during sowing and made higher allocations for crop insurance to safeguard the farmers from the vagaries of monsoon, thus addressing all of the issues faced by the farmers. While Indians excelled abroad, he lamented at their inability to prove their might within the country due to certain hassles. “Telugus in America are the most successful community, but Andhra Pradesh still has a high level of unemployment,” he said, narrating the expected impact of the Make in India, Startup India and other schemes in the years to come in kickstarting the economy. Terming the budgets presented by previous governments as ‘a jugglery of statistics’, he said that the ‘Modi budget’ would stick to facts with an eye on people’s benefit, rather than simply reeling out ‘fancy figures’. BJP national secretary Y. Satya Kumar, former State president K. Lakshminarayana, MLC Vakati Narayana Reddy, former Minister C. Adinarayana Reddy and Tirupati Parliamentary constituency president S. Dayakar Reddy honoured him on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/budget-best-in-recent-years-suresh-prabhu/article33777862.ece
08 February 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||SEC issues guidelines on transfer of govt. employees on election duty||Drawing the attention of the State’s Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police to the emphasis laid by the Election Commission of India and the State Election Commissions on the protection of government employees during the discharge of poll duties, State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar on Sunday specified certain guidelines related to the government officers and employees involved in the conduct of the panchayat elections. Foremost among them was that senior government officers posted as election observers should not be transferred without the concurrence of the commission during the elections and that the District Collectors and district election authorities should be entitled to full and natural tenures in their respective positions and not be transferred. If transfers are to be made before the expiry of normal tenures, the reasons for such transfers should be duly recorded. Similarly, police officers heading various police formations should not be disturbed during their normal tenures as deemed to be appropriate by the Director General of Police (DGP). If transfers are considered to be essential, specific reasons should be assigned. The last guideline was that the Returning Officers (ROs) and Assistant ROs, who have discretionary powers and are entitled to tenurial protection, should not be transferred before the completion of their normal tenures. Reasons should be given in writing if the government feels that they need to be shifted during the course of their election duties. While issuing the guidelines, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the employees’ associations had recently brought to his notice an instance of a senior functionary of the State government allegedly threatening the Collectors and Returning Officers with dire consequences if they did not toe the line. The SEC had since taken certain measures to instil confidence among the government employees on poll duty and felt the need to lay down clear guidelines for their protection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sec-issues-guidelines-on-transfer-of-govt-employees-on-election-duty/article33778309.ece

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Venkata Rao pointed out that the government was yet to pay the fourth and fifth instalments of the crop loan waiver benefits, impacting more than 32 lakh farmers in the State. “The arrears have mounted to more than Rs. 2,000 crore. The ‘Sunna Vaddi’ (zero interest loans) scheme promised by the ruling party is yet to be implemented,” he said. Mr. Venkat Rao deplored that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, despite promising not to increase current charges, has imposed Rs. 1,300-crore burden on the people. Similar promise was made on the RTC fares, but a Rs. 800-crore burden was imposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-has-betrayed-farmers-says-kala-venkata-rao/article33778310.ece

Suresh on Sunday said a three-member committee had been constituted to probe the circumstances that led to the suicide of Papisetty Tejasree, an engineering second year student of QIS College in Ongole in Prakasam district. The girl had resorted to the extreme step in the early hours of Saturday as she was reportedly unable to pay her college fee. The committee comprises G. Yesu Ratnam, Chief Engineer and Director, Infrastructure Development, Swarna Kumari, Director, Empowerment of Women and Grievances, and M. Swaroopa Rani, professor of Civil Engineering. All the three are from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU)- Kakinada. The Minister said that based on the report submitted by the committee, action would be taken against those responsible for the girl’s death. The news of Tejasree’s suicide had sparked protest by the student unions that staged a demonstration at the college. TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu criticised the government and blamed it for the prevailing situation.  Opposition blames govt. Taking to his Twitter handle, Mr. Naidu said, “ If the girl’s parents were unable to pay the fee, what stopped the government from helping them through the fee reimbursement scheme?” In the name of Nadu-Nedu, the government was out to ruin the education sector, Mr. Naidu said, and demanded that immediate help be extended to Tejasree’s family. He also sought effective steps to solve the problems of the student community. The Jana Sena Party also blamed the government for the student’s suicide. People in distress can dial 100 and seek help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-forms-panel-to-probe-engineering-students-suicide/article33777765.ece
08 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Women doctors participate in protest against ‘mixopathy’||In the larger interest of public health, the government should withdraw the notification of the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) that allows students pursuing Ayurveda stream of medicine to train in and perform surgery, Padmavathi Devi, chairperson of the women’s wing of the Andhra Pradesh chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), has said. As part of the nation-wide relay hunger strike being staged by the IMA in protest against what they call ‘mixopathy’, the women doctors of the association participated in the protest here on Sunday. IMA Vijayawada city president Madhusudhan Sarma formally launched the relay hunger strike. Pointing to the fact that the CCIM had approved M.S. (General Surgery) for Ayurveda graduates to perform 58 types of surgeries, Dr. Padmavathi Devi said this would tantamount to putting lives to risk. Modern medicine cannot be degraded by allowing Ayurveda practitioners to perform surgeries even if they were to be done in the rural areas, she added. Dr. Padmavathi said MBBS doctors were well trained as they go on to complete their post-graduation before performing surgeries. Those who practice indigenous medicines such as Ayurveda should do research in herbs and plants, and not be allowed to perform surgeries, she observed. She said the protest would continue till the government withdrew its decision. IMA Vijayawada branch chairperson Durga Vani and other doctors participated in the relay hunger strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-doctors-participate-in-protest-against-mixopathy/article33778383.ece

Gautam Sawang has said. “We are holding coordination meetings with the police of the neighbouring States to tackle the Naxalites during the local body polls, and the response from our counterparts is positive. Special focus is being laid on Naxal-dominated villages. Our target is to ensure incident-free polling,” Mr. Sawang told The Hindu . In all, 983 Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected polling stations are there in the State. As the Maoists have given a call to boycott the elections, the police, along with the officials of other departments, are holding meetings and taking all measures to build confidence and step up security in the tribal hamlets. “Naxalite activities are restricted to some pockets in Visakhapatnam Rural and East Godavari districts. Along with the Greyhounds personnel, the area domination and road opening parties have taken the villages into their control,” Mr. Sawang said. Joint combing The police have mapped the Naxal-affected villages, polling locations and centres. Top-level police personnel are holding meetings with their counterparts in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Telangana, and joint combing operations are planned. “Many inaccessible polling centres are located in the LWE areas. Special strategy is being planned to tackle the situation in the tribal hamlets.

Purandeswari said on Sunday. At a media conference here, Ms. Purandeswari said the BJP leaders would make all out efforts to convince the Prime Minister, but the final say in the matter rests with the Union government. She, however, evaded a direct reply on why the party leadership had failed to impress on the Centre on the need to avoid privatisation of the VSP, before a decision was taken on it. Vajpayee’s intervention The BJP always had a soft corner for the VSP. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, he had infused Rs. 1,300 crore into it to prevent it from being referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and thus gave it a new lease of life, she said. She also parried questions on whether she would resign her party post if the Centre failed to withdraw its decision. Asked whether the decision on the VSP would affect the BJP, which was trying to strengthen its position in the State, she said: “The BJP has never worked for political gains. It works for the nation.” On party leader Sujana Chowdhary reportedly talking in a different tone on the VSP issue, she said the crux of the matter is the same and the State leadership is opposed to the privatisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-convey-public-mood-on-vizag-plant-to-centre/article33777767.ece
08 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||City police launch campaign on installation of CCTV cameras||A few weeks ago, a burglar from Vijayawada had reportedly gained entry into a resort at Rushikonda and made good with about 53 tolas of gold. After four weeks, police nabbed the accused after hard work as there were no clues. The resort though a noted one was not equipped with CCTV cameras. Similarly, some days ago, unidentified miscreants had made good with about 600 grams of gold ornaments from a gold shop in One Town area. Lack of CCTV cameras is again the reason for growing crime, the police say. Since the last few weeks, the city police have been creating awareness and campaigning for installation of CCTV cameras for security of the self-owned premises / private establishments under the campaign ‘Mana Illu- Mana Badhyatha.’ Now the police have promulgated orders under 144 Cr PC to enforce installation of CCTV cameras. Police officials have fixed the deadline of March 31 for installation of cameras by the big establishments, failing which action will be initiated against them under relevant sections. However, police said that in case of small establishments, the choice has been left to the owners. “In spite of our repeated requests, some of the big private establishments like gold shops, hotels and resorts have not installed CCTV cameras. This has led to offences there,” said Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha. He said that having CCTV cameras will help in building confidence and a sense of security among the citizens, and also deter perpetrators from committing crime as their acts will be recorded. In many cases, the cameras helped police in investigating the crime, and also to gather scientific evidence in the form of footages resulting in the conviction of the accused in courts, the Police Commissioner added. Police have targeted 25 types of establishments which are being targeted for installation of CCTV cameras. They include banks, ATMs, financial institutions, jewellery shops, hotels, guest houses, restaurants, bars and pubs, wine and beer shops, residential apartments, office buildings, petrol pumps, shopping complexes, shopping malls, super markets, gyms, sports complexes / stadiums, cinema halls and complexes, educational institutions, hospitals and function halls / convention centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/city-police-launch-campaign-on-installation-of-cctv-cameras/article33778397.ece
08 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Birdwatchers witness a huge flock of gulls at NTPC||A bird-watching session by a group of birders last Sunday turned into a sight to behold when they spotted an unusually large flock of migratory birds at an ash pond near NTPC. In what could be the first major sighting of this season, the birdwatchers of Vizag Birdwatcher's Society and Wildlife Conservation Through Research and Education reported a massive flock of three sea gulls species in the well-known birding hotspot during the Asian Waterbird Census. About 1,150 species of Pallas’s gull, Heuglin’s gull and Steppe gull were spotted at this undisturbed stretch of water body, much to the delight of the birding community. “This is the first time we have officially recorded such a massive flock of seagulls here. While the Pallas’s gull has been recorded earlier in this area in very few numbers, the other two species are new records,” Janardhan Uppada, a prominent birder and member of Vizag Birdwatcher's Society, told The Hindu . The team, comprising Vivek Rathod, research biologist V. Bhagyasree, Prem Swaroop, Vikas and Janardhan Uppada found the massive flock of migratory birds at 8.45 a.m. “With little human interference, the birds seemed to be at peace. They forage in nearby backwaters and return to the same place every day for the four months of their winter stay here,” Mr. Janardhan said. The birders could watch the flock from a distance of around 60 m. “This is very encouraging news from this region. Usually, different species of gulls are seen in good numbers at the Kakinada coast. But this kind of numbers with three distinct species of gulls is a first for Visakhapatnam,” he confirmed. The three species of gulls migrate to this part of the world from the Siberian coast in December and head back by March once the temperatures start rising. Heuglin’s gulls are large gulls with a rounded head, strong bill and long legs and wings. The Steppe gull is very similar genetically to the Caspian gull. In the past, brown-headed and black headed gulls had been observed visiting the grounds of Mangamaripeta and Mutyalammapalem in fewer numbers.  Severe threat With many birding grounds under severe threat from industrialisation and urbanisation, this finding gives hope to the birdwatching community on the survival chances of such long-distance migratory birds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/birdwatchers-witness-a-huge-flock-of-gulls-at-ntpc/article33778392.ece

08 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Merger of steel plant with NMDC is the best option: MLC||MLC P.V.N. Madhav has said that the BJP leaders in State are opposed to the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) to privatise Visakhapatnam Steel Plant(VSP), which was established after 40 years of struggle. The decision was taken as part of the plan to raise Rs. 1,75,000 crore through disinvestment of public sector units (PSUs) and the third party analysis of losses of the PSUs. Air India, BSNL, LIC were in the list and later RINL-VSP was added. “We are opposed to the blanket privatisation of VSP,” he told the media here on Sunday. “Merging RINL-VSP with the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) is the best option as the VSP is strong in steel technology and NMDC in mining. It would help in leveraging the advantages of both for mutual benefit. This way, the VSP will soon make profits. We plan to put forth this proposal to the Centre through the BJP State unit,” Mr. Madhav said He recalled the efforts of the BJP leaders, which had prevented the privatisation of Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL), Bharat Heavy Plate and Vessels(BHPV) and the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI), the Vizag-based PSUs. When HSL was in the red, the BJP had demanded its take over by the Defence sector and today it was on the road to recovery and profits, he said. Similarly, BHPV was merged with BHEL. “When the Narendra Modi government had proposed privatisation of DCI, the Vizag-headquartered PSU, we (former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju, former MP K. Haribabu and I) met Union Minister of Surface Transport Nitin Gadkari and impressed upon him on retaining it as a PSU. Strikes were organised for over six months and finally the DCI was protected,” he said. ‘Privatisation inevitable’ Replying to queries, Mr. Madhav said that privatisation was inevitable and no political party was opposed to it, except for the Communists. Captive mines were not allotted to the VSP even during the UPA rule and all parties were responsible for it. Even now, the maximum employees in the VSP were working under private contractors, who run the show, he said. Mr. Madhav said local ancillaries were not being encouraged and most of the products sourced from other States.The VSP land could be utilised to set up a slag cement plant that would use the flyash , he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/merger-of-steel-plant-with-nmdc-is-the-best-option-mlc/article33778314.ece

08 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP will not budge till Centre revokes decision, says Minister||Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said that it is very unfortunate that the Centre has announced privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) without consulting the State government or MPs from the State. Terming it a ‘unilateral decision’ by the Centre, he said YSR Congress Party would fight against it till the Centre withdrew it. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that the BJP failed to fulfil the assurances given during bifurcation of the State. Starting with non-release of funds for the Polavaram project, the capital city and funds for operationalisation of the new railway zone, the BJP has shown sheer negligence and ‘step-motherly’ treatment towards the State, he alleged. The Minister asked the BJP leaders, whether they were of the view that people from the State do not belong to the country. Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that one lakh people, either directly and indirectly, were dependant on the VSP. He also recalled the agitation launched to achieve the steel plant and 32 persons sacrificing their lives in it. He described the VSP as a symbol of pride for people of Visakhapatnam and Andhra Pradesh. He said that the YSRCP was totally opposed to the move of the Centre. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had written a letter to the Prime Minister on the issue, he said. “Local BJP leaders and Jana Sena Party chief K. Pawan Kalyan should prevail upon the Centre to withdraw its decision,” he added. Mr. Srinivasa Rao also came down heavily against BJP leader Sujana Chowdary for his comments favouring the Centre’s decision. Gajuwaka MLA T. Nagi Reddy recalled the Visakha Ukku Andhra Hakkulu agitation. He said that the Centre must think of bringing the VSP out of the red instead of privatising it. Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana was among those present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/steel-plant-ysrcp-will-not-budge-till-centre-revokes-decision-says-minister/article33778339.ece

Addressing the media on Saturday, he said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had already written a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to review the decision. He said that YSRCP was aware that thousands of people were directly or indirectly dependent on the steel plant. “The Centre must form a committee and take steps to bring back the PSU into profits. It is unfortunate that the Centre took such as decision,” he said, adding that if needed, he would take members of trade unions of the VSP to meet the Union Minister of Steel Dharmendra Pradhan. Referring to TDP MLA Ganta Srinivasa Rao’s resignation, the MP said the point was how to make the Centre withdraw its decision. ‘Ready to quit’ “I will put all efforts to ensure that the VSP does not go into private hands,” he said, adding that be it protest, hunger strike or quitting, he would do whatever it takes to prevent the privatisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mps-to-meet-modi/article33778317.ece

He claimed that his client only criticised the SEC’s order that ‘unanimous elections’ in some districts should not be notified. Senior lawyer B. Adinarayana Rao told the court that the SEC’s order was necessitated by the Minister’s exhortation to election authorities to defy the orders of SEC, which adversely affects the conduct of elections, and that the SEC did not intend to fully curtail the Minister’s liberty. The SEC did not have any objection to Mr. Ramachandra Reddy discharging his functions as the Minister. ‘Unprecedented’ Advocate-General S. Sriram said that the right to free speech and liberty are provided under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution and they can be curtailed only on reasonable grounds and orders to that effect are liable to be tested on grounds such as proportionality and mala fide including arbitrariness. ‘Notice not given’ Mr. Sriram further argued that the kind of restraint which the SEC sought to impose on the Minister was unprecedented and therefore required a judicial examination. A prior notice would have established the facts as the content of the Minister’s speech was contested, especially in the context of the distinction between hate speech and an inflammatory speech. The SEC should have justified his restraint order on the touchstone of fair and due process, the A-G observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-strikes-down-secs-order-restraining-minister/article33778307.ece

08 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS to supply sealed covers in GHMC Mayor election||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the newly elected GHMC corporators of TRS and its Members of Parliament, legislators and Members of Legislative Council who constitute the ex-officio members of the municipal body would be given sealed covers with the names of the party candidates for Mayor and Deputy Mayor election on February 11. The corporators and ex-officio members will have to reach the party office at 9 a.m. for proceeding to the election at the GHMC office in vehicles arranged by party. The covers will have to be opened only in the election hall. Sources said the TRS planned to win the election of Mayor on its own without taking the support of MIM. The election will be carried out with majority vote, which effectively means that the TRS will scrape through even without the support of its ex-offico members. The TRS has 56 corporators in a body of 149 (one BJP member died after election) and enjoys the support of 38 ex-officio members. The MIM has 44 corporators and ten ex-officio members and BJP - 48 corporators and three ex-officio members. The Congress is nowhere in the scene with just two corporators and one ex-officio member. So, neither the MIM nor the BJP are a threat to the chances of the TRS. Of the 38 ex-officio members but six ex-officio members of TRS, six had already exercised their voting right in other municipalities. This leaves the party with a strength of 88 members who are eligible to vote in a body of 202. There were, in all, 52 ex-officio members of TRS, MIM, Congress and BJP but eight of them across parties had voted in other municipalities. Invitation to ex-officio members who were ineligible to vote was not extended for election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor but they could attend subsequent meetings. The Mayor will be elected after the corporators are administered oath of office. After the oath is administered, a quorum of at least 50% of elected members is required for the election. Majority corporators and ex-officio members can elect the Mayor and Deputy Mayor without the support of any other party if it chose to abstain from the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-to-supply-sealed-covers-in-ghmc-mayor-election/article33778158.ece

08 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cyber fraudsters lure victims with sleazy chat||Next time when you make ‘friends’ on dating apps or any social media platform -- beware! Online fraudsters have adopted new tricks of sextortion to dupe and blackmail people. The cyber tricksters make video calls to their ‘targets’ on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp after getting their numbers during their chat. They put a woman’s photo as a profile photo and chat with the victims and express their desire to speak to them over video calls. When a victim agrees, he gets a call from the ‘woman’, and on answering the call, he sees her in a nude state with face covered or the video gets paused and one can only hear the voice. Soon, the calls citing poor internet connectivity, tells the victim to call back. “Now, he gets excited and calls her back without any clothes,” the cyber crime police said. The video calls were recorded using screen recording applications and sent to the victims with demands for money for not uploading the video on internet or sharing it with their friends and relatives from his social media accounts, Cyberabad Cyber Crime ACP K Balakrishna Reddy told The Hindu . Initially, they demand anywhere between Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000 and once he starts paying, they extort more from them through online banking -- GooglePay, PhonePe or Paytm, he said. Every week more than half-a-dozen people, especially teenagers and middle-aged men ,are approaching the police of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda, stating that they were honey-trapped into going nude over video calls and are being blackmailed. Sometimes, the fraudsters make video calls to random numbers or accounts on video call-enabled social media platforms, and sextort them. “They should not transfer the money in a hurry. Instead the victims should approach us,” Mr. Reddy said. A few victims who already paid money, too approached the police. Police asked the victims to deactivate their social media accounts so that fraudsters do not get access to the friends list, and in case if they get trapped on WhatsApp, they should not answer calls from unknown numbers for at least a week. “In November last, I registered on an online dating website, and started chatting with a girl. Soon, we shared our contact numbers and started ‘sexting’. A few minutes later, he received a video call from her and I stripped naked,” said a victim on condition of anonymity. “A few moments later, I got a video of myself in a compromising state and the caller started blackmailing and demanded money. I got stressed and called one of my cousins, explained to him about the situation and asked him to send money. He suggested not to pay and simply block the number and it worked,” he said after sharing the screenshots of the chat. Police asked people not to accept video calls from any unknown persons. “Avoid accepting any unethical/indecent request made by a stranger during a video call. Screen recording of such video sessions may be misused by cyber fraudsters for blackmail or threat purposes,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cyber-fraudsters-lure-victims-with-sleazy-chat/article33778165.ece

Uttam Kumar Reddy charged the TRS regime with brazenly ‘misusing’ the official machinery to ‘stifle’ the Opposition’s voice against its ‘corruption-ridden rule’. Alleging that the ruling dispensation earned notoriety for authoritarianism and nepotism, he said that the Congress after coming to power in the State in the next Assembly polls would punish the guilty for their acts of omission and commission under the present regime. He was addressing a huge gathering of the party district and city committees’ chiefs from all over the State and booth-level functionaries of the town at a meeting held here on Sunday. Earlier, the top leaders of the State Congress including Mr. Uttam and Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka deliberated at length on the party’s strategy for the upcoming Legislative Council elections to the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda Graduates Constituency and also Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls. Prominent among those who attended the meeting include the AICC in-charge for Telangana Manickam Tagore, former Union Minister Renuka Chowdhury, TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar and former MP V. Hanumantha Rao. The meeting was held in Khammam, considered as the political nerve centre of south Telangana, in a strategic manner to boost the morale of the party cadre. In a veiled attack on local TRS leaders, Mr. Reddy alleged that the ruling party local leaders were minting public money by forming syndicates in the name of contracts at the behest of their State leaders. Those speaking against such greedy elements were being intimidated and implicated in false cases, he charged, reiterating that the party State leadership will not tolerate intimidation of the party cadres by the persons at the helm. We will protect our grass-roots level party functionaries from any kind of acts of intimidation, he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tpcc-trs-will-pay-for-its-corruption-ridden-rule/article33778172.ece

He said the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi has posted ‘encroacher-friendly’ officials in Mattampally mandal to grab lands allotted to tribals. And both TRS and Congress leaders have supported the encroachers, but the BJP will stand by tribal residents, he said. Girijana Bharosa Yatra, the BJP’s first meeting in the State to address tribals and their issues, began at Gurrambodu Tanda, a hot bed of land disputes between tribals and others. Hundreds of tribals and saffron leaders gathered for the meeting organised on the vast disputed land. The meeting assumed attention as just before the arrival of Mr. Sanjay, and BJP legislators, violence broke out leading to high tension between police and locals-activists. Both sides received injuries, as police resorted to lathicharge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/war-has-begun-bandi-sanjay/article33778174.ece

08 February 2021||SURYAPET,TELANGANA||Tension over land||High tension was witnessed at Gurrambodu tanda of Pedaveedu in Mattampally mandal on Sunday when aggrieved locals and activists of the Bharatiya Janata Party tried to destroy the fenced property of an alleged encroacher of tribal land. The mob uprooted the fence posts, destroyed the metal shed on the premises, even as the police ran in every direction to neutralise the situation. The fury continued as the disorderly crowd carried sticks and pelted stones. Police resorted to baton charge when the situation went out of control. This was when Kodad DSP Raghu and Huzurnagar police officers were outnumbered by the armed groups and received injuries. One of the police officials who had received bleeding head injury was taken for emergency care, while some officials armed themselves with batons and a few video-recorded the situation. The tension at the site at Gurrambodu tanda was over ownership disputes relating to survey number 540, where oustees of Nagarjunasagar project were allotted land several decades ago. Most of them, settled over two decades, are in possession of the land and are cultivating it. Of the total 1,870 acres in the survey number, the current dispute is over 520 acres, of which 120 acres was taken back by the government after conducting surveys and initiating disciplinary action against erring Revenue officials. However, about 400 acres of the remaining land, according to documents, belong to a person from Kurnool, who had a wire-fence around the whole property. Moreover, groups of active and protesting locals have been victims of private bouncers and security guards who had set up their own posts on the vast land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tension-over-disputed-land/article33778173.ece

Santosh Kumar has given a challenge to the party’s rank and file as also to other supporters and fans of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to plant one crore saplings across the State in one hour to coincide with KCR’s birthday falling on February 17, as part of the Green India Challenge. The task has also been taken up by the administration in districts by making arrangements for the drive on February 17, although it is taken up mainly as an event by the party. Party leaders have asked the rank and file, particularly elected representatives at different levels, to plant three saplings each and also take up the responsibility of protecting them till they reach a safe level to show their regard and greet KCR on his birthday. Focus back on NCDC The focus is back on setting up of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) here. The State government is said to have identified three possible locations for setting it up and sent the same to the Central government for consideration. Interestingly, the Centre had asked the State to allot land for setting up NCDC more than a couple of years ago and sanctioned funds. But the proposal did not move due to delays in identification of land. There is a renewed focus on NCDC since Union MoS for Home Kishan Reddy’s criticism of inordinate delay in allotting land. Coupled with this was the announcement by the Centre that funds would be allocated for setting up of virology labs in the latest budget. The government should at least now speed up the process of land allocation and see that the lab did not go to other States.  (B. Chandrashekhar and M.

I urge the GHMC ajthorities to set up speed breakers on priority. I would also request the traffic police to install speed limit indicators for motorists, to prevent accidents. Robin Zaccheus, Neredmet    There are certain stretches where the density of traffic is very heavy. One such stretch is between Warasiguda and Secunderabad. RTC can introduce mini buses into a single change (point to point without halts in between) for one-way movement with only driver-cum-conductor to manage the commute. There are several such points to identify and to enhance earnings. P. Vasudeva Rao, Boudhnagar    At some T-junctions like Saroornagar on the stretch between Dilsukhnagar and LB Nagar, red signal is displayed even for the vehicles moving straight which is unwarranted adding to the confusion which must be the case for right moving vehicles only and not for straight moving ones. But in similar junctions like Panama and Sushma, free straight vehicle movement is allowed. Traffic police are requested to take corrective steps in this direction. I.V.Prabhakara Rao, Vanathalipuram    I would like to draw the attention of the municipal and traffic police to the road from Balanagar to Jeedimetla, in Shapurnagar.

08 February 2021||Mumbai,||Cong. workers wave black flags at Sitharaman||Congress workers in Mumbai on Sunday waved black flags at Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman in protest against the 2021-22 Union Budget and the increasing fuel prices. However, the police stopped the protesters from reaching the venue of her meeting in the city, a police official said. As the Union minister reached Yogi Sabha Grah in Dadar for an interaction in the backdrop of the Union Budget presented by her last week, around 400 to 500 Congress workers started shouting slogans against her, the official said. They also raised slogans in praise of party leader Rahul Gandhi. The protesters had started assembling outside Dadar railway station since early morning, the official said. They shouted slogans against the Union Budget and the increasing prices of essential commodities like petrol, diesel, cooking gas cylinders and railway fares. Vijay Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 4), said, “The protest took place peacefully. No untoward incident was reported. No one has been detained and no FIR has been registered.” Mumbai Mahila Congress general secretary (administration) Sana Qureshi claimed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the general public and the poor people are facing job losses. “Now, the increasing prices of essential commodities will break the back of the common man. The budget has not offered any relief to the common man,” she said.  Another party functionary said they are not happy with the Union Budget, and hence showed black flags to the Union Finance Minister.  No untoward incident was reported.

08 February 2021||Mumbai,||If no scientific approach is adopted, ‘truth’ will always suffer defeat: HC||The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court held, “if no scientific approach is adopted, ‘truth’ will always suffer defeat”, and directed offences of cheating and conspiracy be registered against the trustees of the Jagadamba Devi Sarvajanik Trust after allegations were made on gold being hidden under the statue of the goddess in the temple. A Division Bench of Justices T.V. Nalawade and M.G. Sewlikar was hearing a criminal petition filed by Namdev Garad, former trustee of the trust situated at Mohote, Ahmednagar district, to call the entire record of accounts and audits of the trust, from 2009-2019, including details of precious metals collected and procedure undertaken for them. The plea seeks the registration of an FIR against the persons involved in the commission of the crime, and to excavate and dig out the alleged “enchanted gold hidden under the statue of the goddess at the temple”. Mr. Garad alleged that in 2011 and afterwards, some illegal acts were committed by the trustees, who were involved in the burying of around 2 kg of gold in the name of “ yantra s”, and showing an additional expenditure of Rs. 25 lakh “for conducting ceremonies with respect to the so-called yantra s”. He also alleged misappropriation of funds despite a judicial officer of the rank of District Judge being the chairman of the trust. An affidavit filed by the trust said a decision was taken for the renovation of the temple and the use of “91 Suvarna Yantras” which were to be found “below the statues of various Gods and Goddess[es]”. It is contended that by passing the resolution, gold weighing 1,890 gm was made available by the trustees and around Rs. 24 lakh was approved as material and labour charges for the preparation of yantra s and for performing rituals. The court noted: “The record of so-called inquiry made by clerical staff of the trust office, inaction on the part of Deputy Charity Commissioner, show of inquiry made by police into the matter show that authorities have no courage to take action even when such serious thing has happened. That might have happened due to general fear which may be in the minds of the persons that they are avoiding taking steps against the Trust committee. The general fear may be of different kind like possibility that they may invite trouble as the matter involves religious feelings and it can be viewed as an act against God.” The court directed the trustees to be charged with cheating and held, “The authorities are expected to work with a secular mind in such a case and they need to adhere to the ‘truth’. The authority needs to have scientific approach in such matters, and they need to adhere to the provisions of law. With that approach they need to make inquiry and investigation and take action.” “The authority cannot accept the religious propositions made in the present matter for trustees as such propositions cannot be scientifically proved. If no such approach is adopted, ‘truth’ will always suffer defeat and the tendency like one shown by the trustees in the present matter will go on increasing,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/if-no-scientific-approach-is-adopted-truth-will-always-suffer-defeat-hc/article33778037.ece

08 February 2021||Mumbai/Pune,||BJP criticises Elgaar Parishad organisers for backing Usmani||The Maharashtra unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday demanded action against the organisers of the recently held Elgaar Parishad in Pune for “supporting” Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader Sharjeel Usmani, one of the speakers at the conclave, for his “anti-Hindu comments”. In a tweet, State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said the Elgaar Parishad was creating divisions in society. “By supporting Usmani’s anti Hindu comments, Elgar Parishad proves what its real motives are,” he tweeted. The Bhima-Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, the organising body of Elgaar Parishad 2021 held in Ganesh Kala Krida Rang Manch in Pune, in a statement said it was “firmly standing with Usmani”. The statement said “activist Sharjeel Usmani is a 23-year-old Muslim student” and “the Muslim part of his identity had to be mentioned because the perverted, vile and violent reaction to Sharjeel’s speech is solely because of his religion”. It added, “the Brahminical element” had created “hoopla around one statement in Sharjeel Usmani’s speech”. Mr. Usmani, an alumni of the AMU in Uttar Pradesh, is accused of making derogatory remarks about Hinduism during the Elgaar Parishad event organised in Pune on January 30. The Pune police on February 2 registered a case under Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion) against him on a complaint by a BJP youth wing leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-criticises-elgaar-parishad-organisers-for-backing-usmani/article33778042.ece
08 February 2021||Nagpur,||Budget may have shortfall of Rs. 1 lakh crore: Ajit Pawar||A “shortfall” of Rs. 1 lakh crore is likely in the budget 2021-22 for Maharashtra, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said on Sunday. Speaking to reporters, he said the Central government is yet to release the dues of Rs. 25,000 crore to Maharashtra for this year under ‘one nation one tax’ programme, but the situation is changing now and money is being sent every week. He said such shortfall affects the future development works. The budget session is scheduled to begin on March 1. “We have to give salaries and pensions to the tune of Rs. 1.50 lakh crore every year out of the Rs. 4.50 lakh crore annual budget, leaving us with Rs. 3 lakh crore. In such scenario, a shortfall of Rs. 1 lakh crore is likely in the coming Budget,” Mr. Pawar, who holds Finance portfolio, told reporters. He said the allies in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government have decided against slashing allocations for departments of police, health, food and civil supplies and PWD. Mr. Pawar said the government didn’t slash funds for development as well as DPC funds. “The Centre had stopped MP funds since the last two to three years, but we increased the funds to Rs. 3 crore and did not reduce the quantum, given that these funds play an important role for development of constituencies,” he said. On the allegedly objectionable speeches made by some speakers at recently-held Elgaar Parishad in Pune, Mr. Pawar said, “There was no reason to give such statements.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/budget-may-have-shortfall-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-ajit-pawar/article33778041.ece

The victims, identified as Sanket Anil Gamare (30) and Akshay Anil Gamare (29), were the sons of a police constable from Borivali who is attached to the Mumbai Police. The brothers were returning from a party at a friend’s house. The SUV rammed into the bike outside K Star Hotel near APMC area.

08 February 2021||New Delhi,||HC refuses to recognise ‘fake’ marriage of couple||The Delhi High Court has refused to recognise a marriage performed in an Arya Samaj Mandir according to the Hindu Vedic rites and customs between a Muslim man named Akhtar, who falsely represented himself as Shiva, and a Hindu woman. The incident of impersonation came to light after the woman made a complaint at a police station here in December last year that Akhtar concealed his identity and introduced himself as Shiva before they became intimate and started having a physical relationship. The woman stated in the FIR that Akhtar took her to the Arya Samaj Mandir and got married there. She also stated that in the marriage certificate he has given his name as Akhtar. The woman complained that soon after their marriage, Akhtar started demanding money and when she visited his parents, she was driven away by them. Quash FIR In January this year, Akhtar moved the High Court seeking to quash the FIR on the ground that the parties have come to a compromise as the woman had pardoned him and they are willing to live as husband and wife. Forged Aadhaar cards In response to the plea, Delhi Police in its status report stated that Akhtar hid his identity and was sexually exploiting the woman for five years. The status report mentioned that Akhtar has even forged Aadhaar cards and have two such cards, one in the name of Akhtar and the second in the name of Shiva. The report also stated that the marriage certificate of Akhtar and the woman, was verified from the Trust concerned and the same was found to be a fake one. Taking into consideration the facts of the case, Justice Subramonium Prasad rejected Akhtar’s plea to quash the FIR noting: “This is not a matrimonial dispute between the husband and wife for the reason that the petitioner [Akhtar] has not married the respondent No.2 [the woman]”. “The marriage certificate is found to be a fake one and in any event, the petitioner could not have married the respondent No.2/complainant in Arya Samaj Mandir according to the Hindu Vedic rites and customs,” the court noted. Societal interest “A reading of the allegations in the FIR and the status report, it is evident that the petitioner has been accused of serious offences like rape and forgery, having a bearing on vital societal interest and these offences cannot be construed to be merely private or civil disputes but rather will have an effect on the society at large,” the High Court ruled. “In crimes which seriously endangers the well-being of the society, it is not safe to leave the crime doer only because he and the victim have settled the dispute amicably,” it remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-refuses-to-recognise-fake-marriage-of-couple/article33778027.ece
08 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Getting transcripts no longer a hassle||Delhi University is set to introduce an online mode for the application of transcripts for students and alumni, a step designed to ease the rather tedious process. According to senior DU officials, the facility will be available by February 15. In the past, the university had received several complaints from students pertaining to the lengthy process of procuring transcripts. With several students requiring transcripts to apply for jobs or joining universities abroad and their grievances mounting, the matter was brought to the notice of the university officials. With the introduction of the new system, officials explained, students will be able to apply for their college transcripts on the online portal, as opposed to the prevailing system whereby students or alumni need to visit the university’s examination branch. Simplified process D.S. Rawat, Dean of Examinations of the university said: “Currently, students or their representative with authorisation have to come to the exam branch to submit the form. Again after it is ready it has to be collected by the applicant or the authorised person. However, in the new system, students can apply for the transcript online itself and there will be no need to visit the exam branch for submission of the transcript application.” The university will also provide the option of getting the transcripts delivered to the registered postal address, which was not the case before. “Once the transcript is ready, students can either collect it from the exam branch or they can request the branch to post it to their address. For this, they have to pay an additional fee for the postal charges. These steps are being taken by the examination department to streamline the entire process,” Mr. Rawat said. Mechanisms will be installed to restrict the number of applications from a particular IP address, to prevent commercial places from promising students their college transcripts, officials said. “We will implement mechanisms through which only a limited number of applications from a particular IP address will be permitted. It will be restricted so that commercial centres, who apply on behalf of others and so on, are not involved. Students can directly apply. Through this process we are simply trying to minimise the involvement of third parties,” Mr. Rawat said. Welcome change Several of those who have already applied for the transcripts by visiting the campus said the new mode would be a “welcome change.” Shristi Dutt (name changed), who graduated from Delhi University in 2018 said: “I had applied for my transcripts a while ago because there was no option for an online mode yet. I had to physically visit the examination branch. I need my college transcript so that I am able to provide it to my employers. It has become a task to keep tracking the process as I do not live in Delhi currently. Travelling to the city just to retrieve the transcript is not a viable option, especially under the current circumstances.” “There are people I know who had to visit campus multiple times over weeks before the transcript is ready. If the university is indeed planning to launch an online mode of application and even postal delivery, it will be a welcome change and make the process easier for people like me who are not in the city at the moment,” said Ms. Dutt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/getting-transcripts-no-longer-a-hassle/article33778036.ece
08 February 2021||New Delhi,||Nine-month-old Iraqi boy gets new lease of life at city hospital||A nine-month-old boy from Iraq got a new lease of life after undergoing liver transplant a hospital in Delhi. Such a transplant is considered risky among those aged less than one year. However, doctors of Manipal Hospitals here took up the challenge and performed the nine-hour-long surgery on Ali Hamad on January 3. Hamad’s mother donated a part of her liver to save her son’s life. Hamad was discharged from the hospital on January 26, it said. According to Sailendra Lalwani, head of the liver transplant and hepato-pancreatic-biliary surgery department, no supply of blood to the liver is a big challenge to any liver transplant team as vascular complications are high in paediatric transplant patients. The reconstruction of the portal vein with graft is always a challenge as it increases the risk of thrombotic complications. To overcome this challenge, we planned to use an iliac vein graft procured during cadaveric liver transplant, said Dr. Lalwani who performed the surgery with a multi-disciplinary team. “On January 3, the baby underwent the transplant. There was no flow in the portal vein. We placed the interposition vein graft to give inflow to the liver. After the surgery the baby was shifted to ICU on a ventilator,” he said. Hamad was off the ventilator the next morning. After 20 days of the surgery, he was discharged from the hospital, the doctor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nine-month-old-iraqi-boy-gets-new-lease-of-life-at-city-hospital/article33778029.ece

Justice Prathiba M. Singh listed the case for further hearing on February 19 along with various other pleas filed on behalf of several children suffering from other rare diseases. The two children, who are two and three years old respectively, are suffering from Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II (Hunter Syndrome, Attenuated Type) which is a rare disease that is passed on in families. It mostly affects boys and their bodies cannot break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin, tendons and other tissues. Cost of treatment They have approached the High Court seeking direction to the Centre and AIIMS to provide them uninterrupted treatment free of cost. The two brothers, in their separate petitions filed through their father Ravi Jhawar, said they started facing difficulties and certain changes in their bodies in September and December 2019. The plea said the children were examined by doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and AIIMS and after examination and tests, they were diagnosed with MPS II. It added that the treatment of the rare disease is available and administered at AIIMS. The petition said the annual cost of treatment for one patient would be between Rs. 80 lakh to Rs. 1 crore and the income of their father is nominal and it would be impossible for him to bear the cost of treatment. “Without the financial support of the respondent no. 1 [Centre], the petitioner cannot be medically treated in view of paucity of funds. The petitioner is only concerned with medicine and not with any direct financial help,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-asks-govt-aiims-to-facilitate-free-treatment-of-children-with-rare-diseases/article33778028.ece

Mr. Shah mocked Mr. Thackeray’s Maha Vikas Aghadi government (comprising the Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress), as “a three-wheeled autorickshaw” trundling aimlessly in three different directions. He said the BJP made no ‘closed door’ promises to the Sena on the CM’s post after the 2019 Assembly polls. “Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena have jettisoned all of Balasaheb’s principles by forming an unnatural alliance with the Congress and the NCP in Maharashtra… They [the Sena] keep saying we have broken promises that we had allegedly given behind closed doors. I would like to emphatically say I have never indulged in ‘closed-door’ politics. I believe in transparency and making all promises on a public forum,” he said in Sindhudurg in the Konkan. New medical college Mr. Shah was inaugurating a medical college set up by former chief minister and BJP MP Narayan Rane — a bitter critic and arch-adversary of the Chief Minister. “During the 2019 Assembly poll campaign, Uddhav Thackeray had sought votes with Narendra Modi’s larger photo on the Sena’s banner. Both the BJP and the Sena had campaigned to re-electing Devendra Fadnavis… At that time, the Sena did not complain. I repeat, there was no such promise [of the Chief Minister’s post] given to the Sena,” Mr. Shah said, adding that the people of Maharashtra would never forgive Mr. Thackeray for his sly politics of power. Mr. Shah said the Sena had betrayed a ‘pure’ electoral mandate handed by the people of Maharashtra to forge an opportunistic alliance with the ideologically opposed NCP. “The BJP could have swept the polls had it contested on its own strength and employed the Sena’s stab-in-the-back tactics… the Sena would have been finished in the State.” Dismissing the Sena’s oft-repeated allegation that it was the BJP that had broken pre-electoral promises, Mr. Shah pointed out that in Bihar, in spite of the BJP scoring more seats than Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), the saffron party had kept its word. “Though Nitish Kumar admitted that the BJP could stake claim to the Chief Ministership owing to our larger numbers, we kept our word and anointed him as CM as promised… it is regrettable that the Sena’s lust for power has led it to betray us,” Mr. Shah said. He heaped praise on Mr. Rane: “I see him [Mr. Rane] as someone who speaks out against injustice without thinking of the consequences. Perhaps, it is because of this that his political career has been so full of twists and turns. However, he won’t face injustice in the BJP. We know how to take care and give respect to Mr. Rane.” Mr. Rane had formally joined the BJP and merged his party — the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha (MSP) — in October last year ahead of the Assembly polls. In September 2017, he had severed his decade plus-long association with the Congress which he had joined following his acrimonious exit from the Sena. His exit from the Congress, equally laden with acrimony, was with the expectation that the BJP, which is weak in the Konkan belt, would welcome him with open arms. Since then, the Konkan strongman has repeatedly targeted his former party the Sena, launching attacks on Mr. Uddhav Thackeray. Praise for health workers Mr. Shah lauded the efforts of the medical fraternity and the paramedics in the battle against COVID-19, remarking that India had been successful in containing the virus because people had participated wholeheartedly in the struggle along with frontline warriors, doctors and State governments. “The Modi government has fought the battle in a unique way. We implemented the lockdown on time. While we did not have the requisite infrastructure when the pandemic erupted, we shored it up in a record six months… Today, we have 2,200 testing laboratories and India is a major exporter of vaccines, masks, PPE kits. As opposed to the U.S., Italy or the U.K. and other European countries, India today has the fastest recovery rate,” he said. Expressing satisfaction on the pace of vaccination, Mr. Shah said four more vaccines were on their way besides Covishield and Covaxin. He said, “Our vaccination programme is progressing apace and we have inoculated 55 lakh people in three weeks. We are exporting vaccines to 14 countries now.”  It is regrettable that the Sena’s lust for power has led it to betray us Amit Shah Union Home Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uddhav-jettisoned-his-fathers-principles-for-power-amit-shah/article33778039.ece
08 February 2021||Yangon,||Protests sweep across Myanmar, Internet access restored partially||Tens of thousands of protesters poured onto the streets across Myanmar on Sunday in the biggest anti-coup rallies yet, as an Internet blackout failed to stifle growing outrage at the military's ouster of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Some estimates put the number of protesters in Yangon at 1,00,000 and there were reports of large demonstrations in other cities condemning the coup that brought Myanmar's 10-year experiment with democracy to a crashing halt. Backed by a din of car horns, chanting protesters in Yangon held up banners saying “Justice for Myanmar”, while others waved the signature red flags of Ms. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party as they marched to City Hall. Protests planned “I completely despise the military coup and I am not afraid of a crackdown,” said Kyi Phyu Kyaw, a 20-year-old university student. “I will join every day until Amay Suu (Mother Suu) is freed.” Protesters announced that they would return to the streets at 10 a.m. local time on Monday, defying the state of emergency imposed by the military and indicating no let-up in their resistance to the coup. They also called on civil servants and people employed in other industries to not go to work and join the protests. Many flashed the three-finger salute inspired by the Hunger Games films, which became a symbol of resistance during the pro-democracy protests in Thailand last year. “We will fight until the end,” said Ye Kyaw, an 18-year-old economics student. There were also demonstrations in Mawlamyine city and the Magway region. Monitoring service NetBlocks said Internet access was partially restored on some mobile networks in Myanmar Sunday afternoon, but social media platforms remained blocked and it was unclear how long the connectivity would last.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protests-sweep-across-myanmar-internet-access-restored-partially/article33777746.ece
08 February 2021||HAMBANTOTA,||A jumbo struggle for farmers in Sri Lanka||With rows of Sri Lankan flags fluttering in the morning breeze, it was not hard to spot the Independence Day event on Thursday in Walsapugala village, in the southern Hambantota district. But paired alongside were black flags, flapping as much, on poles slightly shorter.   “While they celebrate this day in a grand manner in Colombo, we are marking it with both national flags and black flags. We are not shaming our country, but we want to remind our rulers of the darkness that has descended on our lives,” said Mahinda Samarawickrama, leader of a local farmer organisation, delivering a fiery speech from the podium. “What does an Independence Day mean, when neither our farmers nor our elephants are free?” Mr. Samarawickrama’s organisation, and some 80 other farmer groups in the district, have been agitating for weeks, demanding that the government soon gazette a Wildlife Management Reserve in the area. This, they hope, will put an end to wild elephants ravaging their fields and homes. The farmers accuse the government of pursuing “thoughtless, large-scale development” that destroys the elephants’ natural habitat. “With their own lands gone, the animals come into our agricultural plots, destroy all our crops, kill our people. This has been going on for 13 years now,” said S.P. Surasena. In 2007, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was then serving his first term as President, kick-started big-ticket development projects, including the Hambantota port, Mattala airport, and international cricket stadium in Suriyawewa. He extended the Southern Expressway and promised an export processing zone to bring investment and jobs to his home district. These, coupled with a thrust on expanding commercial, export-oriented farming, meant unutilised land near water sources were coveted. Although the infrastructure projects, mostly China-backed, put Hambantota on the world map, locals are unimpressed. “Our farmers are losing land, youth are jobless,” said Chandrasena Gamage, a farmer leader. The district contributes considerably to the country’s paddy, vegetable and fruit — particularly banana — production. Sri Lanka has an estimated 6,000 elephants, and hundreds die every year, frequently in ‘hakka patas’ or traps made of explosives, and gunshot injuries. In 2019, Sri Lanka reported 407 elephant deaths, the highest number recorded in the world. In 2020, 318 elephants and 112 people were killed in conflicts, according to the Wildlife Department. “People speak of how many elephants or humans have died. It is tragic, but we also need to see what this is doing to agriculture as a whole,” said K.W. Sumith Kumara, a local activist. Most farmers do not view the problem as a “human-elephant conflict”, as often framed by officials and the media. It is a long-brewing conflict between development on the one side, and vulnerable farmers and the elephants on the other, they argue. Mounting challenge   The government’s delay in gazetting the wildlife reserve despite many assurances, has raised suspicion among farmers. Hambantota is home to 6.5 lakh people and voters here, including most farmers, backed the Rajapaksas in the November 2019 presidential polls and the August 2020 general elections. Of the seven district representatives in Parliament, six are from the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, including Cabinet Ministers Chamal Rajapaksa, elder brother of the President and Prime Minister, as well as Namal Rajapaksa, son of the PM. The continuing farmers’ struggle in Hambantota is the first instance of protracted resistance from within the ruling regime’s southern, Sinhala Buddhist core constituency, and it has drawn support from farmer organisations and trade unions elsewhere. Indian ‘inspiration’ Veteran farmer activist Terrance Gamini, who leads the Rajanganaya United Farmers’ Association in Anuradhapura, in the North Central Province, travelled eight hours by road to participate in the protest. “We see how farmers from different parts of India travel all the way to Delhi to extend their support. This is nothing,” he said. The Indian farmers’ struggle figured in several speeches at the event, as a source of “inspiration”. The farmers’ call for a dedicated elephant corridor has found resonance across the country, Mr. Gamini said, as farmers routinely faced the problem of elephants destroying their crops. The pandemic year worsened their situation, as they were unable to sell their produce amid restrictions. His take was a striking contrast to President Rajapaksa’s Independence Day speech in Colombo the same day. “It is our aim to further develop and strengthen the domestic agriculture sector so that it becomes a significant foreign exchange earner”, said the President, vowing to support farmers. Mr. Gamini, did not find reason to cheer. “Focussing on agriculture does not mean focussing on farmers. They mean agribusiness. That is what they want to develop. The plight of farmers does not really matter to them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/a-farmers-struggle-in-sri-lanka/article33777742.ece

The rally, which began in Pothuvil in the eastern Ampara district last week, covered several towns along the way in the Eastern Province and the Vanni, before reaching Polikandy in Jaffna district. Many civil society organisations came together, while prominent legislators and members of various Tamil and Muslim political parties joined the procession, chanting slogans against the government’s “repression” against Sri Lanka’s minorities. Over the last five days, police sought to prevent the rallies, local media reported, citing COVID-19 regulations. However, the masked participants carried on, pointing to other events marked by the government, that had proceeded, according to media reports. “The reason for this protest walk is to draw attention to the rights of the Tamil-speaking people that have been denied in this country,” Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran told AFP . The issues highlighted at the rally included the persisting calls from families of forcible disappeared persons, concerns around “land grab” and reported attacks on Hindu temples in the area, persisting militarisation, surveillance of journalists and human rights defenders, attempts to prevent memorialisation by Tamils, mandatory cremations denying Muslims burial rights during the pandemic, and long-pending call for a LKR-1,000 rupee basic wage for Malaiyaha or Hill Country Tamils employed in tea estates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-rally-in-jaffna-to-assert-minority-rights/article33777750.ece
08 February 2021||Tehran,||U.S. must lift curbs before Iran rejoins nuclear deal: Khamenei||Iran’s supreme leader on Sunday urged the U.S. to lift all sanctions if it wants Iran to live up to commitments under its nuclear deal with world powers, state TV reported, his first comments on the matter since U.S. President Joe Biden took office. “If (the U.S.) wants Iran to return to its commitments, it must lift all sanctions in practice, then we will do verification... then we will return to our commitments,” state TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying. Former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. in 2018 from the atomic deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. “This is the definitive and irreversible policy of the Islamic Republic, and all of the country’s officials are unanimous on this, and no one will deviate from it,” Mr. Khamenei said..  Mr. Biden said he won’t lift sanctions against Iran as long as the Islamic republic is not adhering to its nuclear deal commitments. Asked whether he would halt sanctions to convince Iran to return to the bargaining table, Mr. Biden offered a clear reply in a CBS interview aired on Sunday: “No.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-must-lift-curbs-before-iran-rejoins-nuclear-deal-khamenei/article33777740.ece
08 February 2021||London,||‘Oxford vaccine less effective against South African variant’||The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine fails to prevent mild and moderate cases of the South African coronavirus strain, according to research reported in the Financial Times . But in its study, due to be published on Monday, the pharma group said it could still have an effect on severe disease — although there is not yet enough data to make a definitive judgment. None of the 2,000 participants in the trial developed serious symptoms, the FT said, but AstraZeneca said the sample size was too small to make a full determination. “We may not be reducing the total number of cases but there is still protection against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,” said Sarah Gilbert, who led the development of the vaccine with the Oxford Vaccine Group. It could also be “some time” before they determine its effectiveness for older people in fighting the strain, which is a growing presence in U.K., she said. Researchers are currently working to update the vaccine, and “have a version with the South African spike sequence in the works” that they would “very much like” to be ready for the autumn, said Ms. Gilbert.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/oxford-vaccine-less-effective-against-south-african-variant/article33777738.ece

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Infrastructure push now, fiscal consolidation later||The fiscal year 2020-21 has been an extraordinary one, where India had to face an acute economic crisis triggered by a non-economic factor — a pandemic. The National Statistical Office has estimated that the economy would shrink by 7.7%. There are other estimates which put the shrinkage at an even higher level. Against this background, there were huge expectations from the Union Budget regarding stimulus to growth. The Budget, taken as a whole, has provided reasonable stimulus to growth through a change in the composition of expenditure and other measures to improve the climate for investment. But concerns remain about fiscal deficit.  Transparency versus stimulus Proposed growth in central expenditure, both in 2020-21 Revised Estimates (RE) and in 2021-22 Budget Estimates (BE), indicates the extent of contemplated fiscal stimulus. Since three quarters of 2020-21 have already passed, the expenditure push in 2020-21 RE over actual expenditure in 2019-20 has to be implemented in the last quarter. Controller General of Accounts data for expenditures already incurred in the first nine months of 2020-21 indicate that for reaching the projected RE levels, the growth required in the last quarter of the current fiscal year over the corresponding period of the previous year would be 102.9% for total expenditure, 109.9% for revenue expenditure, and 60.3% for capital expenditure. These upsurges appear extraordinary. This involves transferring on to the Budget, the accumulated food subsidies amounting to Rs. 2,54,600 crore given to the Food Corporation of India through National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) loans. The balance of subsidies amounting to Rs. 1,68,018 crore would be the food subsidy pertaining to 2020-21 (RE). This is a desirable change towards transparency. Taking revenue expenditure figures as budgeted, a contraction of 2.7% is seen in 2021-22 BE over 2020-21 (RE). However, after adjusting for the NSSF-accumulated food subsidy amount, the growth in revenue expenditure in 2021-22 (BE) is 6.7%. A good part of expenditure for the last quarter of 2020-21 may also pertain to clearing unpaid dues of various stakeholders including the private sector, autonomous bodies and government-aided institutions. Clearing these payments is desirable and would add to demand. It is these overdue expenditures which would enable the government to reach the high expenditure growth levels in the last quarter of this fiscal year. The main expenditure push comes through a budgeted growth of 26.2% in capital expenditure in 2021-22. Relative to GDP, capital expenditure is expected to increase from 1.6% in 2019-20 to 2.3% in 2020-21 RE and 2.5% in 2021-22 BE, signalling a significant change in priority.  Receipts augmentation Budgeted increase in the Centre’s gross tax revenues is dependent on nominal GDP growth of 14.4%, with a buoyancy of 1.6 for direct taxes and 0.8 for indirect taxes. The assumed high buoyancy of direct taxes appears optimistic although there would be a positive base effect. The nominal income growth projected may also be optimistic. Significant increases are planned in non-tax revenues and non-debt capital receipts. From a contraction of 35.6% in 2020-21 (RE), non-tax revenues are budgeted to grow by 15.4% in 2021-22. This increase is mainly predicated on higher dividends from non-departmental undertakings and spectrum sales. In the case of non-debt capital receipts, mainly covering disinvestment, a budgeted growth of 304.3% in 2021-22 stands in contrast with the contraction of 32.2% in 2020-21 (RE). Disinvestment initiatives have so far yielded minimal results. An important initiative pertains to the launching of a National Monetisation Pipeline. This would be the first practical step towards asset monetisation. The pipeline may eventually start yielding revenues, but the time lags involved remain unpredictable because of various potential disputes and claims associated particularly with government-owned land. A transparent auction process needs to be set up to facilitate suitable price discovery. Slippage in revenue estimates may not be ruled out on account of realisation of lower than anticipated increases in nominal GDP growth, direct tax buoyancy, and disinvestment targets.  Infrastructure and initiatives The budgeted increase in capital outlay would provide the central government’s share to the National Infrastructure Pipeline. However, success of the infrastructure expansion plan would depend on other stakeholders of the pipeline playing their due role. These include State governments and their public sector enterprises and the private sector. Some of the proposed Budget initiatives include setting up of a Development Finance Institution (DFI) with an initial capital of Rs. 20,000 crore, to serve as a catalyst for facilitating infrastructure investment. In order to manage non-performing assets of public sector banks, there is a proposal to set up an Asset Reconstruction Company and an Asset Management Company. These institutional initiatives may prove to be effective. Much depends upon the fine-tuning the operations of these institutions. In the action taken report, the Union government has accepted the recommended vertical share of 41% for the States in the shareable pool of central taxes. The government has accepted the Fifteenth Finance Commission’s recommendation for revenue deficit grants, local body grants and disaster-related grants. The scope of revenue deficit grants has been extended to cover 17 States in the initial years. The determination of these grants is not based on equalisation principle although some norms have been used in the assessment exercise. However, the government has put on hold the consideration of State-specific and sector-specific grants including performance-based incentives. The substantive issue pertains to the mode of transfers in terms of general-purpose unconditional transfers vis-à-vis specific purpose and conditional transfers. States had shown a preference for the former mode and it is for this reason that the 14th Finance Commission had raised the States’ share from 32% to 42%. The reduction from 42% to 41% is only on account of the consideration of 28 States excluding Jammu and Kashmir because of its new status. The increasing resort to the imposition of cesses which are almost permanent have reduced the shareable pool. In fact, the States’ share in the Centre’s gross tax revenues is only 30% in 2021-22 (BE).  A road map The COVID-19 shock has fortified the sharp upsurge in fiscal deficits in 2020-21 and 2021-22. The Fifteenth Finance Commission has also proposed a revised fiscal consolidation road map for the Centre and States. The Fifteenth Finance Commission has recommended the setting up of a High-Powered Intergovernmental Group to re-examine the fiscal responsibility legislations of the Centre and States. In the context of COVID-19, some economists have gone to the extent of advocating almost giving up the prudential norms. This will be a wrong lesson to learn from the crisis. The Centre has indicated taking the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26. The Finance Commission has also indicated a similar figure. The issue of debt sustainability can be certainly re-examined by taking into account the evolving profiles of debt, interest payments, and primary deficits relative to GDP. Fiscal deficit must be related to household savings in financial assets and the interest payments to revenue receipts. It should not be forgotten that in fiscal 2021-22, interest payments to total revenue receipts will be 45.3%, pre-empting a significant proportion of revenue receipts. We must be conscious of the burden of the rising stock of debt. C. Rangarajan is former Chairman, Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council and former Governor, Reserve Bank of India. D.K.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The question of race in Biden’s America||With the din and noise of Joe Biden’s inauguration as the 46th U.S. President behind us, what was striking about the horde of analyses that greeted the occasion was their disproportionate focus on the need to quickly contain the COVID-19 pandemic and to pull the economy out of the current morass. This is unexceptionable under the current, extraordinarily harrowing times. It is slightly disappointing, however, that many observers have chosen to either underplay or ignore the January 6 attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol in Washington, and the symbolism it carries for citizens. There is a persistent fear that the rampage will launch further strikes at unexpected places and against soft targets. The ease with which the mob gained entry into the Congress precinct is an index of its destructive might. These elements do not trust the Constitution and are not reconciled to a government that vows to heal a fractured society. A fragmented agency The Capitol attack also highlighted the chinks in the armour of the fragmented law enforcement agencies, especially the police at the grassroots. The U.S. has more than 15,000 standalone forces under local Mayors, each of whom belongs to a political party. How can one standardise law enforcement procedures and responses in desperate situations like the one on January 6? Federalism can no longer be an excuse for inaction in a country that is growing increasingly divided, disorderly and violent. The 50 States in the country will have to rise together to strengthen the hands of the Biden government in its efforts to unify the police and make them a reliable tool to root out lawlessness. Mr. Biden’s bipartisan approach alone can bring about this reform, which cuts across crass politics. Therefore, a huge challenge awaits the Biden administration in extirpating the kind of terrorism that was fuelled by white supremacists at the cusp of the shift in the power centre. Domestic terrorism seems to have gained roots, and it cannot be allowed to grow if the U.S. wants a respectable place within the comity of nations. The new regime would be assessed on its success in stemming the rot and in mending, at least partially, a criminal justice system that is widely perceived as lax and weighed against minorities, especially African-Americans. This is particularly so in the context of Mr. Biden’s assurances that he will work to remove the glaring inequalities in American society. In his inaugural speech, he pulled no punches in referring to the burgeoning black-white divide. Vice-President Kamala Harris, with her rich experience as a prosecutor and Attorney-General in California, and her multiracial identity, may be able to inject more fairness into the system. Incidentally, a few years ago, she also unveiled her own criminal justice reform measures that addressed the twin problems of mass incarceration and drug abuse.   What is predominant now in the country is the perception that African-Americans are unfairly treated by security agencies, especially the police. The healing process that Mr. Biden talks about cannot ignore the deep mistrust of most African-Americans over the alleged discriminatory treatment received by them at the hands of police and prison officials. Criminal justice history in the U.S. is pockmarked by outrageous police and prison atrocities on hapless citizens, like the assault on Rodney King in 1991 in the heart of Los Angeles. And who can forget the most recent of all such incidents, in which George Floyd, 46, was killed on May 25 last year, by one of the Minneapolis policemen who arrived on the scene after a shop owner tipped off the police that Floyd was walking away after tendering counterfeit currency for cigarettes? The incident triggered countrywide protests, confirming that the relationship between the average African-American and the police had gone far beyond repair.  Disproportionate incarceration The U.S. population is currently over 320 million. Of them, African-Americans account for around 45 million. Though they make up a large portion of the population, the crushing poverty within the community has a disturbingly negative impact on the criminal justice system. Crime is generally — if not always — believed to be proportional to economic status. Over the years, an impression, albeit not wholly supported by raw statistics, has therefore gained ground, that it is African-Americans who commit more crime per capita than the whites. This is often cited to explain the high number of African-Americans in prisons. According to recent official statistics, although incarceration rates have been coming down, at the end of 2019, there were still 1,096 African-Americans in prisons for an aggregate of 100,000 black residents. The corresponding ratio for whites was just 214. A similar phenomenon was witnessed decades ago, when the New York Police Department (NYPD), under its famous Chief William Bratton, introduced the controversial ‘Stop-and-frisk’ procedure to bring down crime. It got wide backlash from African-American leaders after it was found that more from the community were being searched than others. In the course of time, the practice had to be withdrawn for its blatant unfairness. This is another example of the lack of faith in the police’s efforts to handle crime. African-Americans strongly believe that all anti-crime measures are aimed at them. This is the dilemma that faces those who believe in stern policing. The Biden government will have to deal with this while handling disorder on the streets. While policing is essentially within the domain of States, the Federal government cannot be a mute spectator. A non-inclusive force There is another problem that both Federal and State governments face. Mr. Biden believes in diversity in governance. In this respect, there is no arm that needs greater attention than the police. Despite all efforts over the decades, the police remain a heavily white-dominated force. African-Americans are unwilling to join the police for several reasons, the most important of which is the fear of harassment at the hands of their white supervisors. A magical formula will have to be worked out to make police forces reflect the diversity of the country. One can go on expanding on the list of reforms that are needed for criminal justice agencies in the U.S, but what is most urgently needed is restoring the police’s credibility in the eyes of African-Americans. This is more easily said than done. A bipartisan approach alone can manage to achieve this.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||An India-EU trade pact may still remain elusive||After its invitation to British Prime Minister and arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson to visit India, New Delhi plans to start negotiations on investment and trade agreements with the European Union (EU). These are likely to run into the same problems as the discussions that began on a comprehensive free trade agreement in 2007 but were aborted due to differences on movement of professionals, labour, human rights and environmental issues and India’s high tariffs, inconsistent tax regime and non-payment of arbitral awards. Before COVID-19 and Brexit, the EU had the same GDP as the United States and was one of India’s major trade and investment partners. Being the largest democracies and unions of linguistically, culturally and ethnically diverse States, both the EU and India are well suited for a special relationship, but the reality is that the status is one without any spark of mutual chemistry. The EU now finds itself in an unusually turbulent situation. COVID-19, Brexit and international tensions caused by former U.S. President Donald Trump have unsettled the EU and exacerbated internal discords. The crises of 2020 obfuscated the structural lack of unity in the EU, because despite its desire for greater integration, it faces obstacles from adherence to the rule of law to a strategy for dealing with China, Russia, Turkey and Iran. After months of tortuous negotiation over Hungary and Poland’s objections, member States finally agreed on a long-term budget and a COVID-19 recovery package of $2 trillion. The two countries had opposed anti-COVID-19 support being linked to good governance, in particular, accusations of suppression of human rights and lack of independence in the judiciary.  Shadow of Euroscepticism The EU’s attempt to condition its budget on the rule of law during the pandemic and recession only sharpened the emphasis on the veto power to which every member State is entitled. Apart from the two main defaulters, many others also resiled on civil liberties, making the option of approving COVID-19 recovery funds by excluding the dissenters a proposition that would have risked a dangerous controversy on how united the EU should be.  It was not only Britain that spawned a populist movement agitating to leave the EU. Europe’s many Eurosceptic parties now focus on preventing closer unity, which has been lacking on the eurozone and migration crises and implementing COVID-19 lockdowns. Elections are due in many EU States, including Germany and the Netherlands, which both have strong Eurosceptic movements. The Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) is the official opposition in Germany, while in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders leads the largest opposition party. The fear of Eurosceptic parties forces mainstream politicians, as in Britain, to adopt populist rhetoric. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte  and French President Emmanuel Macron have criticised Islam and anti-secular immigrants, a pattern repeated in other EU countries including Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria. Trump and a recalibration The Trump presidency forced Europe to reassess its relationship with America, which stimulated the EU’s drive for greater self-reliance in security, economics, supply chains and climate change, and an attempt to emerge as a major global pillar alongside the United States and China. While there is relief that the U.S. may now be more predictable, Europe will resist taking sides in any U.S.-China tug of war. This is underlined by the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment concluded after minimal consultation with Washington. A common security and defence policy also causes division. Mr. Macron would like to see Europe take greater control of its security, but Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and others are uncomfortable with the prospect of building larger military capabilities, and remain content with security being subsidised by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S. while they continue to engage in profitable business with China and Russia. The COVID-19 pandemic led to riots in the Netherlands for the first time in 40 years, and the resignation of the Italian Prime Minister. It also introduced divisive vaccine nationalism into the Union. The EU hoped that its central vaccination procurement would be a symbol of solidarity, although initially some members closed their borders, Germany and France restricted exports of personal protective equipment, and there was suspicion by some about the motives of others that were hosts to big vaccine producers. Those fissures are now overshadowed by the EU’s procurement programme for the bloc from Astra-Zeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, which warn that vaccines cannot be delivered as scheduled due to production problems despite advance payment, and the anticipated shortfall will be up to 60% in the current year’s quarter. Lately, it transpires that the German government, ostensibly a strong advocate of European solidarity, had negotiated a separate vaccine contract with Pfizer in September last year. For the EU to resolve these innumerable and diverse problems without further widening existing ruptures will require enormous political will and adroit skill. Trade agreements with India will be the least of its problems.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The cost of Internet shutdowns||The movement led by farmers against the Central government’s agricultural laws has become a part of our national and international discourse. Keeping aside the merits and demerits of the contentious legislation, the manner in which the Centre introduced the Bills and its actions towards countering the movement have raised plenty of concerns. A principal concern among these has been the recurrent shutdowns, ordered by the Ministry of Home Affairs, of Internet services around many border areas of NCR since the unruly incidents on January 26. Unfortunately, these blockages are not new. India shuts down Internet services more than any other democracy in the world. The past four years have seen over 400 such shutdowns. Many parts of Jammu and Kashmir saw a partial restoration of digital services after a long period of 223 days — the longest Internet shutdown across the world — since the abrogation of Article 370 in the erstwhile State. Many, including UN rights groups, termed these shutdowns a form of collective punishment for people, and an overreach of governments on citizens’ rights and liberties. Currently, Indian laws have vague provisions for suspending telecommunication services, including the Internet, during times of public emergencies, or, if required, for protecting ‘public interest’. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court had declared in January 2020 that the right to access the Internet is one of our fundamental rights, alongside the freedom to carry on any trade, business or occupation over the medium of Internet, under Article 19 of the Constitution. The impact of shutdowns becomes even more pronounced during a pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the ones with good connectivity and know-how of digital tools were able to carry on with their lives with relatively fewer disruptions. Meanwhile, the ones without digital literacy or connectivity found themselves completely left out of all social and economic systems. Blanket bans on digital connectivity during the COVID-19 crisis may breed deep-rooted societal difficulties. The most vulnerable among us may be cut off from health and welfare alerts; there could be breaks in vital digital services, including those currently being used by hospitals to monitor the well-being of their patients at risk of infection, including the elderly, and pregnant women; students may lose access to avenues of learning as classes shift online; journalists may find it impossible to do ground-reporting from already volatile areas. Massive losses Today, almost all white-collar employment sectors, including IT, financial and consulting services, are encouraging their employees to work from home. Internet shutdowns will freeze economic activity in affected areas and cause large-scale disruptions in economic output. India is estimated to have lost over Rs. 20,000 crore in 2020 because of Internet shutdowns. Despite the costs and inconveniences involved, the shutdowns, on very rare occasions, do become necessary evils. However, it is hard to classify the ones initiated by the Central government in recent years under those categories. Internet bans should be a last resort and must be enforced following well-formulated protocols. Emergency response and relief systems for the vulnerable have to then work in parallel. Upgrading cyber divisions of law enforcement agencies with new-age innovations may offer several alternatives. The use of some of these technologies, including mass surveillance systems and communication interceptors, also presents its own ethical dilemmas. As the pace of globalisation, digitisation and connectivity accelerates, balancing civil liberties with security concerns will become an increasingly difficult task. Governments, especially in democracies, will have to create modern, independent institutions that have the authority and expertise to create frameworks that meet these challenges, without falling back on measures that result in state overreach.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Staying watchful||The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has expectedly yet again left benchmark interest rates unchanged and reiterated that it will continue with its accommodative stance, at least into the next fiscal year, in order to secure a sustained economic recovery. The central bank’s rate setting panel has reasoned that while there are promising signs in the welter of data that it has looked at, the ongoing recovery is “still to gather firm traction” making it crucial to provide continued policy support for restoring growth. The sharp deceleration in retail inflation in December, when headline CPI inflation eased to 4.6% after being stuck above the RBI’s upper tolerance threshold of 6% for six straight months, clearly appears to have smoothed the brow for the six members of the committee and provided them the space to stay focused in the near term on prioritising growth. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme as well as the Union Budget’s proposals to give a boost to infrastructure, and innovation and research, among other things, have been recognised as factors likely to restore confidence and lend a fillip to the growth momentum, respectively. Rural demand’s persistent resilience is what the MPC sees undergirding the demand recovery, aided, in its view, by good prospects for agriculture. And here, while overall rabi sowing has been 2.9% higher year-on-year as on January 29, the farmers’ agitation involving cultivators from key crop-growing States including Punjab, Haryana and U.P. is a cause for concern as a protracted impasse has the potential to disrupt farm output threatening both growth and inflation dynamics. The central bank has also understandably sought to privilege its role as the government’s debt manager through a clutch of regulatory announcements accompanying the latest monetary policy. The two main measures involve extending the enhanced ‘held-to-maturity’ dispensation for banks buying debt issued by the Centre and States by a year up to March 31, 2023, and allowing retail investors to make direct online purchases of government securities via a ‘Retail Direct’ gilt securities account held with the RBI. With the Centre alone targeting to borrow as much as Rs. 12-lakh crore at the gross level in the coming financial year, the debt manager faces the unenviable task of ensuring that the flood of debt not only finds takers at a price that does not push up borrowing costs for the rest of the real economy but also of trying and preventing it from crowding out demand for private investment credit. With interest rates being held at near record lows and inflation still persisting above the RBI’s benchmark repo rate of 4% resulting in negative real returns for savers, the RBI can ill afford to drop its guard on vigilance over prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/staying-watchful/article33777721.ece
08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A closed Open||Australian Open 2021, starting in Melbourne on Monday, will be one of sport’s boldest experiments in the coronavirus era. It can indeed draw upon the experiences of the US Open and French Open, which were successfully held last year even as the pandemic raged in North America and Europe. But the backdrop Down Under is markedly different. Australia has been commended for its COVID-19 response, which has seen robust testing and contact-tracing strategies employed alongside severe lockdowns and border closures to limit the total number of cases to 28,850 and deaths to 909. To airlift more than 1,000 participants from across the world to such an environment has understandably raised hackles in Australian society. That there were eight positive cases among those associated with the tournament did not help, especially after Victoria — of which Melbourne is the most populous city — recently conjured a 61-day streak without a single locally acquired case. Tennis Australia has left no stone unturned, pushing the Major back by three weeks, spending a whopping $40 million on players’ quarantine, organising six warm-up events including the ATP Cup, keeping the overall prize purse same as previous year’s nearly $55 million and securing permission to allow up to 30,000 fans a day. But last week, one positive case at a tournament hotel was all it took to eliminate a full day’s tennis and send 500-odd players and staff into isolation and testing, showing how tenuous things are. However, once the first ball is struck, events leading up are unlikely to distract from the on-court excellence. Barring 20-time Major winner Roger Federer, who is recovering from a knee injury, the full constellation of tennis stars has arrived. This will be the first opportunity for Rafael Nadal to take sole possession of the men’s record for most Slams, but the Spaniard is yet to play a match this season because of a bad back. Two-time defending champion Novak Djokovic, the clear favourite having triumphed a record eight times here, will want to add to his 17 Slams, while Dominic Thiem, the reigning US Open champion and a losing finalist in Melbourne last year, will look to burnish his credentials as a regular title-contender. Among women, World No.1 and home favourite Ashleigh Barty returns after skipping most of 2020, while a fit-again Serena Williams targets a record-equalling 24th Major. Defending champion Sofia Kenin and the current leading lady of the sport, Naomi Osaka, are the other top draws. Surprise French Open winner Iga Swiatek, and the trio of Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev among men will be watched with interest. Sumit Nagal, the lone Indian in the singles draw, would like to ruffle a few feathers. But when the mood is of cautious optimism, nothing can be taken for granted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-closed-open/article33777722.ece

The Apollo to-day fired two of its four jet thrusters in a course correction designed to place it right in the centre of its “entry corridor” for a splashdown in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Apollo-14 has begun picking up speed. The increase in speed came as the earth’s field of gravity began to have its effect on the spacecraft, although there still was some effect from the moon’s gravity. At 3:56 p.m. I.S.T. to-morrow, earth’s gravity will take over completely and the speed of Apollo-14 will increase even more. The ten-hour rest period scheduled for the spacemen ended at 7:58 p.m. I.S.T..||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/apollo-14-returning-after-successful-mission/article33777733.ece
08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Hazards of investing directly in stocks||The sharp increase in asset prices since March last has made many wonder whether investing directly in the stock market is better than buying mutual funds. In this article, we discuss why mutual funds are preferable for goal-based investments. Beyond diversification We are not going to argue that diversification is the important reason to choose mutual funds. Just because a fund holds 30-40 stocks does not mean it is diversified. It is the relationship that these securities have with each other in the portfolio that will determine whether the fund is truly diversified or not. You have no way of knowing the constituents of the portfolio, leave alone how they were created; equity funds disclose their holdings only once every month as per SEBI guidelines. Our arguments are, therefore, based on operational efficiency and behavioural factors. Consider operational efficiency. Your day job could make it difficult for you to track the market on a continual basis. By this, we mean keeping an eye on corporate developments and macroeconomic variables, all of which drive stock prices. And even if you are able to do this, how will you decide how many stocks to buy for your portfolio? This leads to behavioural aspect of investing. You may have hand-picked 20 stocks for your portfolio. And then some of the stocks that you excluded from your portfolio may outperform the ones you invested in. So, the regret from missing out on the prominent ones (in hindsight) will subtract the happiness that you experience because of the positive returns you earn on the investments you made. And there is more. Moderating regret It hurts less when your mutual fund investment declines 10% compared to your direct investment losing the same value! Why? You outsource your investment decision to a professional money manager when you invest in a mutual fund. So, you can blame the money manager if the fund performs poorly. Of course, your chances of achieving your goals will be affected whether the loss is because of mutual fund investments or direct investments. Nevertheless, outsourcing the decision helps alleviate regret. But choosing a mutual fund is also a decision that could lead to regret, you may argue. True, but only if you invest in active funds — funds that expect to beat their benchmark indices. Such funds have to actively choose stocks to create portfolios. So, returns may vary across funds within the same category (say large-cap funds). Indeed, your regret would be high if the fund you invested in is not within the five best performing funds in that category. You could, therefore, buy index funds. All large-cap index funds would be benchmarked to either the NSE 50 Index or the BSE Sensex. The difference in their return is a function of how much cash they hold to meet redemption requests and the fees they charge to manage the fund. Both these factors are stable. So, you can simply pick an index fund with the lowest tracking error. Conclusion There are other benefits of investing in mutual funds. For one, your initial investment can be as low as Rs. 5,000. You cannot buy a lot of shares with that money in today’s market. For another, managing your investment is easier because you have just one fund to consider — not 20 or 25 stocks as in the case of direct investing. That said, the dominating factor favouring mutual funds over direct investment is the behavioural aspect to your investment decision. A caveat is in order. Luck plays a dominant role in investment success. And this factor is more evident when you make direct investments. Also, your level of happiness is relative to your peers. So, if you compare yourself to a colleague or friend who made direct investments and became rich, you are likely to regret — even if you invest in index funds.

A stronger U.S. dollar played a key role in keeping the prices of precious metals subdued. While the Comex gold price remained weak all of January, there was a late flourish in silver towards the month-end. Silver prices spiked by more than 7% towards the end of January on reports of a GameStop-style squeeze driven by the retail investors. So, Comex silver managed to close with a marginal gain of 1.94% in January to settle at $26.91 an ounce. Comex gold, however, closed on a weak note, falling 2.4% to $1,850.3 an ounce. In India, MCX gold futures declined 1.7% to Rs. 49,337 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed 2.4% higher at Rs. 69,706 per kg. The short-term outlook for Comex gold is negative. The price struggled to get past the key $1,940-1,950 zone, which is not a healthy sign. Downside targets now work out to $1,730-$1,750. The negative outlook for gold would be under threat if the price closes above the $1,870-$1,880 zone. Till then, there would be a strong case for a slide to $1,740 or lower. Comex silver achieved the target of $29.5-$30 mentioned last month. The short-term outlook for silver too is negative. The price could slide to $24.5-25.1. This view would be invalidated if the price moves past $27.9. MCX gold too ruled weak in January. The short-term outlook is negative and the price is likely to fall to the support zone at Rs. 44,500-Rs. 45,000. This view would be valid till the price trades below Rs. 49,500-Rs. 50,000. MCX silver got within striking distance of the target of Rs. 75,000-75,000, touching a high of Rs. 74,400 before turning weak. The sharp reversal in the past few days is a sign of weakness. The short-term outlook is not positive and MCX silver could fall to the immediate target of Rs. 62,000-63,000. This view would be invalidated if the price moves above Rs. 75,000.

08 February 2021||Chennai,||Bess has the Indians in a spin, puts England in the driver’s seat||A natural riding on his skills, he shimmied down and struck the ball with brutal force. It was a thrill ride while it lasted. Actually, it seemed Rishabh Pant was batting without a care in the world. But then, cricket is a many-layered game. It is deeply tactical and a batsman’s seemingly reckless ways could actually be a thoughtful yet brave response to a challenge. Distinct threat Left-arm spinner Jack Leach was a distinct threat to the left-handers, getting the ball to jump into the batsman from the developing rough outside the off-stump from over the wicket. And how did the explosive Pant respond? He danced down to Leach, took the rough out of the equation, and blasted the ball for sixes between long-on and mid-wicket. Indeed, Pant’s 88-ball 91 was the highlight of the third day’s play even as England, led by off-spinner Dom Bess’ four-wicket haul, took a firm grip on the first Test at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday. Replying to England’s mammoth 578, India was 257 for six at stumps. Washington Sundar, stroking the ball with a left-hander’s elegance and grace, was batting on 33, along with R. Ashwin, on eight. Earlier, Cheteshwar Pujara’s well-made 73 — he drove crisply through covers and mid-wicket — was ended by a stroke of ill-luck when his full-blooded pull off Bess bounced off Ollie Pope to Rory Burns at short mid-wicket. With the pitch expected to deteriorate, India will have a demanding job saving this Test. Bess will be a distinct threat. The off-spinner was impressive on day three imparting revs on the ball and getting it to dip, drift and turn. He consumed Virat Kohli with a beautiful delivery that drifted and turned. The Indian captain pushed forward and was picked up smartly by Pope at short-leg. It was a classic off-spinner’s dismissal. The loop in Bess’ delivery was the principal reason Ajinkya Rahane miscued a low full toss and Joe Root, diving to his left, much like a goalkeeper, held a sensational catch at short-cover. Pant also was done in by the dip, as he charged Bess, could not get to the pitch of the ball, and holed out to deep cover. Before his fourth dismissal in the 90s in Tests, Pant delighted with his terrific bat speed, powerful wrists, astonishing power and fascinating footwork. And Leach took a pounding. Earlier, the rhythmic Jofra Archer struck twice in a red hot opening burst. Rohit Sharma, playing away from his body, nicked one that left him. And Shubman Gill (29), after an innings that oozed class, checked his shot and was well held by a sprawling James Anderson at mid-on. As the day wore on, Washington batted with style, conjuring two flowing cover-drives, off Ben Stokes and Leach. However, he could have fallen to Leach when on 25 had Archer held on to a skier running back from mid-on. The lasting image of the day was Pant dancing down to Leach. But then, him fluffing a stumping to reprieve Leach off Ashwin in the morning reopened another debate.  It has started to spin and it is only going to do more. We are pretty close to the new ball. We are in a great seat at the moment Bess||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bess-has-the-indians-in-a-spin-puts-england-in-the-drivers-seat/article33777806.ece

Mukerjea and Piperno, Indian tennis stalwarts from Kolkata, paid their tributes to Akhtar. Six-decade friendship “We knew each other for 60 years. We — I, Premijit Lall and he — practised together at the South Club. Both of them are gone,” Mukerjea told The Hindu . “It was a long relationship. He was a Davis Cup player, then a coach at the Davis Cup finals. It is sad that he was suffering in the end… Sad day for Indian tennis. He was a good Davis Cup player, but he was a better coach,” Mukerjea said. “We slept on the same bed, travelled together, fought together, but at the end of the day he was one of my best friends. When I first went to England to play, he was already there. He showed me the ropes — how to travel and how to do things. “We played together in Saigon (Vietnam) in an invitation tournament, and won the tournament there. In the Davis Cup, we played Pakistan in Pune. It was a long journey,” he said. According to Mukerjea, tennis was Akhtar’s life. “He coached from grassroots to National level players. He coached Vijay Amritraj, Ramesh Krishnan and Zeeshan Ali. You name a player and he has coached him. His contribution is unparalleled.” Agreed Piperno. “Akhtar Sir’s legacy is the many generations of tennis players he has produced. He played some role in everyone’s life… He was a father figure in Indian tennis,” said Piperno. “Four years ago I saw him on the courts in the heat and humidity of April. As South Club president, it was very difficult for me to stop him from coaching. He did not take it well initially, but understood later,” he said. Piperno, who took over from Akhtar as the Davis Cup coach in the 1990s, recalled his childhood days. Irreparable loss “After I came to Calcutta in 1971 as a 10-year-old, Akhtar Sir was the first and only coach I ever had. At the South Club, he selflessly dedicated hours and hours to improve our strokes. Everyone talked about his coaching methods, his one-liners. A jovial way of saying things in good spirit,” Piperno said. Undoubtedly, the loss is irreparable. “Naresh Kumar and I regularly spoke about Akhtar Sir’s health. Today, Naresh Kumar was disturbed (after hearing the sad news),” said Piperno.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mukerjea-bids-goodbye-to-a-longtime-friend/article33778047.ece

He impressed many and, at 75, he continues to capture the hearts of the people with his brilliant driving skills. He was a little off the pace the first few laps. “That was because my car was extra heavyweight over fuel and also there were others jostling around.” But, he took it easy and started setting the pace to clinch a place on the podium in the KMS50 Grand Prix racing here on Sunday. He wasn’t surprised. “I expected it, and I can admit that now. I feel like doing another 50 laps,” he said, and quickly added that the youngsters around gave him the additional turbo boost to quicken his pace. Advice to youngsters Vidyaprakash had some advice for them as well. “Learn your car as to how it handles and behaves, then come back to tell your engineers about the shortcomings and they will set it up for you.” The veteran added: “You’ve got to learn a lot about the electronics and the mechanical parts that are rapidly advancing now. “Even a simple driver has to be on top of it by learning day and night. I used to go back home after every race and look at my data acquisition system.” He said he’s still learning a bit on this track. “There’s some more potential in me and it will take another 40 laps to get to the top of it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/doff-your-hat-to-this-septuagenarian/article33777993.ece

There were some soft dismissals which didn’t go in our favour,” said Pujara. Freak dismissal The Saurashtra batsman was looking solid on 73 when his pull shot deflected off the short-leg fielder and went straight into the hands of the midwicket fielder. “It was just unlucky. That was the only way I was going to get out,” said Pujara about his dismissal. “The way I was playing my shots and seeing the ball, everything was going perfect. It was a bad ball and I tried to put it away, but it hit the short-leg fielder.” While praising Rishabh Pant’s knock, the 33-year-old felt that the wicketkeeper-batsman needed to be smarter with his approach. “I love batting with him and hope our partnerships can continue. I am happy with the way he is playing overall, but he still has to learn a few more things. “He has to look to put the team in a commanding position because he is capable of that. He is missing out on hundreds. I am sure he will learn from this.” Still a good pitch About the match, Pujara said, “There is more spin now, but it is still a good pitch to bat on. The first two days, it was flat. We would like to bat as long as possible in this pitch and we are confident because Washington and Ashwin are batting well.”  There is a clear communication with him that there are some shots he needs to avoid.

08 February 2021||Melbourne,||Russia drubs Italy to claim ATP Cup||A relentless Russia crushed Italy 2-0 to win the ATP Cup on Sunday with Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev in red-hot form leading into the Australian Open. Russia was the only nation in the 12-team event to boast two top-10 players and they had swept past Japan, Argentina and Germany en route to the decider. Italy faced the same juggernaut on Rod Laver Arena, with Rublev destroying Fabio Fognini 6-1, 6-2 in just 61 minutes before Medvedev overpowered Matteo Berrettini 6-4, 6-2 in 79 minutes. Medvedev is now on a career-long win streak of 14 matches, including his third ATP Masters title in Paris and victory at the season-ending ATP Tour Finals, with 10 of those victories over top-10 opponents. Rublev has been equally impressive, winning five ATP titles in a breakthrough 2020, more than anyone else, as he raced up the rankings. Mertens triumphs Elsewhere, World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty tuned up for the Australian Open with a 7-6(3), 6-4 battling win over Garbine Muguruza to claim the Yarra Valley Classic for her ninth WTA singles title.

08 February 2021||KOLKATA,||Tennis legend Akhtar Ali passes away||Tennis legend Akhtar Ali, a father figure in Indian tennis, passed away here in the early hours of Sunday following prolonged illness. Akhtar was 81 and is survived by his son, current India Davis Cup coach Zeeshan Ali, and two daughters. Ill health “Akhtar Ali passed away at 2:30 a.m. at his home. He had not been keeping well for the last few months. He was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and other health issues,” said BTA CEO Sujoy Ghosh. Akhtar was hospitalised for a few days before being brought back home recently. He was laid to rest at Sola Ana Kabristan, Khidirpur. Born on July 5, 1939, Akhtar made his mark in 1955 when he became the National junior champion and reached the junior Wimbledon semifinals. He represented India in eight Davis Cup ties against Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, Mexico, Japan and Monaco between 1958 and 1964. He played alongside stalwarts like Ramanathan Krishnan, Naresh Kumar, Premjit Lall and Jaidip Mukerjea. Akhtar, who was groomed by former Australian Davis Cup coach Harry Hopman, also played the Wimbledon and French Open. He was winner of the Asian mixed doubles championship. His last ATP Tour outing was against Vijay Amritraj in a clay court match in Bombay on November 11, 1974. A soft-spoken person with a good sense of humour, Akhtar — also a National squash champion in 1968 — was well known as a coach. He qualified from NIS Patiala, International Tennis Federation and the United States Professional Tennis Registry. He was National team coach from 1966 to 1993. Under his guidance, the Indian team — comprising Krishnan, Mukerjea, Premjit and S.P. Misra — reached the Davis Cup final in 1966.

08 February 2021||BENGALURU,||Next challenge is to get crowds in: Tiley||The last two years have tested Craig Tiley, the Director of the Australian Open, to the limits. If unprecedented bushfires had provided the season’s first Grand Slam with a sobering backdrop in 2020, it’s the turn of COVID-19 this time around. Ahead of the Australian Open, Tiley spoke to select media houses about the preparations, contingency plans and prize money. Excerpts: During the tune-up, we lost a day’s action because of a positive coronavirus case. Are contingency plans in place if there is a repeat? A) Yes, we do. Unfortunately, over 500 players staying at one particular hotel had to get retested, but we were up and running quickly. We are not expecting any positive cases in the next two weeks. If someone does test positive, we have a very rigorous tracing and testing process that takes just 24 hours. We are fortunate to be living in a place that is free of community transmission. In 2020, we had 830,000 fans at Melbourne Park. We hope to have half of that this year. How did you boost players’ confidence during quarantine? There was a big difference between the reality of the programme and the perception among players. Some thought they could get out and do their thing. But no. I had five-hour meetings everyday with the players, some of them challenging. [But] this was always about everyone’s health and the proof is in the pudding. After two weeks, everyone has come out negative; they are playing, competing. Their confidence came back over a period of time. The winners’ prize money is down 30% while early-round losers will get more. Has there been any pushback from the top players? Qualifying prize money went up by 17%, first round by 16%. A first-round loser will get A$100,000 ($76,700). We have significantly reduced the winners’ cheques, but top players like Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams all agreed with spreading the prize money more evenly because it has been a difficult year. It’s a great initiative and I have had zero pushback. In 2020 there was A$71.5 million in prize money. We have kept it the same this year, despite being forced to run at a multi-million-dollar loss. What’s been your biggest challenge? Our new challenge is about bringing the crowds on-site. But the biggest challenge is if something happens with the virus, how do you manage it? There are certain things we can’t control, what we’ll do is control the things we can.

08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The law of rebirth||The law of rebirth governs all existence in creation. The Bhagavad Gita teaches the important truth that every human being has a choice to get freed from this cycle of rebirth. The general trend in many is to have certain goals in life and much time and effort is spent in trying to attain them. But they cannot lead one out of the cycle. In this context, Krishna’s declaration, “I am easily attainable to the steadfast yogi whose mind and thoughts are constantly fixed on Me,” clearly shows the path of release for all, pointed out Srimati Sunanda in a discourse. This is in accordance to the law, ‘As you think, so you become.’ Human birth gives each one this chance to aim to attain a highly evolved and refined state, that is, the state of Brahman or Truth or Supreme Reality from which there is no return. Mahatmas and realised souls exemplify this state of refinement when all their energies have been dedicated to the welfare of all with no selfish motive. The motto is therefore to get rid of desires for worldly enjoyment. If one encourages such desires, he is busy trying to fulfil them throughout one’s lifetime. They thrive in the human mind and make it thirst for more, like the fire that remains unabated even after being fed with any amount of firewood. For instance, one who has reached the heights of fame, say has won in many Olympic competitions, cannot hope to remain there always. Unless he learns to handle the pressures of name and fame, he may be led to mental depression. At the end of the life term, only the physical body is discarded, but the desires assume a sukshma sarira and chase the soul through successive births. So, only when desires are exhausted, is one not born again. A human being sans desires attains the divine state.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/the-law-of-rebirth/article33777801.ece

08 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mass arrests harden resolve of farmers, supporters||Dilshad Khan, 21, and Navjot Singh Jyoti, 26, who had come to Delhi to take part in the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day, disappeared on January 29. Their friends and families had no idea where the two men were until, on February 1, the Delhi police released a list of people arrested in connection with incidents of violence. The men were among 120 people arrested following clashes between protesters and ‘locals’ near the Singhu border  on January 29. The Hindu spoke to the families and friends of four people who have been arrested. Three friends Dilshad and Navjot’s friend Navdeep said they had all come from Mohali for the parade. But their group leader told them that the rally had been cancelled and so the friends made their way back to the Singhu border. “We stayed together the whole time, but on January 29, they went to roam around and also to buy something from Narela. Then we didn’t hear from them,” he said. “We kept trying their numbers but no one picked up, later the phones were switched off. We looked for them all across the protest site at Singhu border and also got announcements made. We then looked in Tikri border also. Then we went to a police station in Narela but we weren’t given any information there either,” he said. On February 1, Delhi Police released a list of people arrested in connection with the clashes. Dilshad and Navjyot’s names were on the list. “We all heaved a sigh of relief. At least they are alive,” he said, adding that no one told Navjot’s parents that he had been missing. Navjot comes from a family of small farmers, his father also works as driver and his mother is ill. The family does not regret sending him to participate in the protest even though he is an only child. “If we get scared and don’t go for the protest then how will we get the three laws repealed?” said Navjot’s cousin Amarpreet Singh. “It is worrying that he is arrested, but he is okay. He will be out in no time,” added Amarpreet. Navjot had given his mother medicine before he left for the protest on January 25. His father is uneducated and doesn’t understand legal proceedings but his extended family is in touch with lawyers in Delhi. Dilshad, a factory worker, had decided to come to the protest as Navjot was his best friend. “We are not farmers but he went with his friend,” said Dilshad’s elder brother Dilbar, who is in touch with Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s legal team. “He told us he was serving people at the protest. When we spoke to him after his arrest, he just asked me to hire a lawyer and get him out of jail,” said Dilbar. Wrong place, wrong time Ankit Deswal, a 21-year-old national gold medallist wrestler from Haryana’s Panipat, was arrested in Narela. His family believes he was detained as “police were angry on January 29 and there was a Kisan Union flag on Ankit’s car”. His brother Manjeet, 24, said Ankit and his friend were on their way to an akhada in Sonipat and were crossing Narela when they were stopped and detained by the police. “He called us and told us that they were randomly stopped because of the flag,” Manjeet said. The family was informed about the arrest the next morning when they received a call from the police station. “When we spoke to Ankit on the phone, all he said was that he wants to come out because he wants to go to the akhada and practice,” said Manjeet. Manjeet said Ankit participated in the protest on a few occasions, but the “family was not actively participating”. “However, after Ankit’s arrest, we are participating regularly. The police have arrested my brother for no reason. In our village, if you arrest one, five more will be ready to go behind the bars,” said Manjeet. Out for groceries Harvinder Singh’s family is sure that he will go back to the protest site once he is released from jail and that the arrest will not deter his spirit to fight. The 56-year-old from Patiala had been camping at the protest site since November 26. On January 29, Harvinder had gone to Narela to buy groceries, said his cousin Mittarbir. “I called him around 3.15 p.m. and asked him where he was. He told me he was going to Narela to buy some items. I told him I will come along and asked him to wait till I reached,” he added. Half an hour later, when Mittarbir tried to call Harvinder, his phone was switched off. For the next few hours, several calls were made to find him but to no avail. Around 3.30 a.m., Harvinder’s son received a WhatsApp message from his father’s phone number informing him that he had been arrested and that he was at Alipur police station. “We went to the station the next morning but were not allowed inside. Eventually, we were told that he had been sent to Tihar jail. Later, we were informed that he had been shifted to Rohini jail. I had a word with him over the phone. He said he was okay but needed clothes, so, a lawyer helped us with that,” Mittarbir said, adding that the family has no regrets and the arrest doesn’t change the way they feel about the farmers’ struggle. Police response Responding to a detailed questionnaire sent by The Hindu on the arrest of the four persons, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Rajeev Ranjan Singh said: "All relevant facts pertaining to these arrests are placed in the case file. After perusing the same, the Judge was pleased to send these accused to judicial custody. Since the matter is sub judice, it will be improper to comment on the version of family members".||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mass-arrests-harden-resolve-of-farmers-supporters/article33778081.ece
08 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Internet services back at Singhu, protesters dance to online music||The protesters stationed at the Singhu border on Sunday were a happy lot. Mobile Internet services were back after several days. Harinder Happy, a media coordinator at the Singhu border said Net services have resumed, but due to a high density of mobile users (protesters), the speeds are slow in the area. The office-bearers of farmer units were using Wi-Fi services to avoid any congestion. Mr. Happy said that during the period when Internet services were suspended, they switched to Wi-Fi, but they faced congestion while live-streaming. Now, things are back to normal and the YouTube channel of Kisan Ekta Morcha is functioning well. Around 10 a.m., when Internet services resumed at the border, protesters rejoiced the occasion by streaming songs on their mobile phones and danced to the tunes. “Many elderly people made video calls to their family members back in their villages in Punjab and Haryana. They informed about their well-being and other updates,” said Shamsher Singh, a protester. Seventy-year-old Kulwant Singh, who has been protesting at the border for the past 30 days, said he is not used to the mobile phone. But he had to inform his family members concerned about him after they received the news of an elderly protester dying due to cardiac arrest at Singhu. “A man, who is from my village in Patiala, helped me call my grandson after my family made several calls to him regarding my health. I assured them that I will return soon after the government repeals the farm laws,” said Mr. Singh. Unstoppable movement The protesters said the government attempted to suppress the movement but they failed miserably. “Now, the movement is unstoppable. Shutting down the Internet won’t stop people from getting updates,” said Badshah Pal, a protester. Internet services have also helped freelance journalists and Youtubers covering the movement and in sharing live updates on social media. “We had to travel over 5km from the Singhu border to get Internet services. It was very tough, but now things are better and we can put up videos again,” said Shashank Shekher, a freelance journalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/internet-services-back-at-singhu-protesters-dance-to-online-music/article33778083.ece
08 February 2021||JAIPUR,||Congress wins majority of local body heads’ posts in Rajasthan||The ruling Congress on Sunday won the posts of chairpersons in 48 of the 90 urban local bodies in 20 districts of Rajasthan, which went to polls recently. The Opposition BJP formed the boards in 37 municipal bodies with its chairpersons declared elected, while the independent candidates were elected heads of three local bodies. As many as 197 candidates were in the fray for the municipal bodies where the boards were to be formed. The Congress was in a position of advantage after securing 1,194 of the 3,034 wards, while the BJP had won 1,146 and Independents bagged 631 in the results declared on January 31. The Congress suffered a setback in Ajmer, which was the only Municipal Corporation that went to polls, with the election of BJP’s Brajlata Hada as the Mayor. Of the 80 wards in Ajmer, the Congress had won 18 and the BJP 48. The urban local bodies for which the polling was held on January 28 included nine municipal councils and 80 municipalities. One candidate of Nationalist Congress Party and another of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party made it to the posts of chairpersons in Bikaner district’s Nokha municipality and Nagaur district’s Mundwa municipality, respectively. Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra said the ruling party had registered an “impressive victory” in the elections to the local bodies’ heads as a result of its measures for public welfare and hard work of party workers at the grassroots.  ‘First of its kind’ AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Ajay Maken said the Congress victory in the State’s urban areas was the “first of its kind”, as the party candidates had won in 120 of the 195 urban bodies where the chairpersons were elected in the polls since November 2019. He said the BJP had been restricted to just 74 chairpersons in these elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/congress-wins-majority-of-local-body-heads-posts-in-rajasthan/article33778063.ece
08 February 2021||February 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Farmers from Sonipat plant flower saplings at protest site||In response to the heavy police barricades at the Singhu border, protesting farmers on Sunday planted saplings of flowers like roses and marigolds in soil brought from their villages around Haryana’s Sonipat. A protester said planting saplings was a silent message to the authorities in response to the cemented walls, spikes on the roads, and multiple barricades fixed by the government in the area. Rajinder Kumar, 60, a native of Dhurana village, said that he, along with other villagers, had joined the protest at Singhu on Sunday. They had brought soil and saplings of flowering plants from their village. “It’s our message to the government that we will spread love even if it uses force to suppress us. The policemen armed with guns and batons standing on the other side of the barricades are also sons of farmers. We have nothing against the police. Our fight is against the stubborn government,” said Mr. Kumar. A commotion ensued at the protest site after a small snake was spotted in the freshly dug-up soil brought for preparing the plant beds. One of the farmers killed the snake with a spade as it tried to wriggle out to safety. Some of the farmers tried to stop the man from hitting the snake, but it was too late. Protesters at Singhu said that they are identifying other vacant and dirty plots for planting. They wanted to convey to the government that farmers can turn waste land into beautiful nurseries. “We will send flowers from these nurseries to the government if they agree to repeal the farm laws. The kind of barricading they have put at the borders, and the restrictions on the movement of visitors, will only give more power to protesters,” said Hardeep, a protester. After the violence of January 26, the police erected concrete walls between barriers and multi-layer barricading, with lines upon lines of police personnel stationed at all three borders — Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-from-sonipat-plant-flower-saplings-at-protest-site/article33778071.ece
08 February 2021||BENGALURU/CHENNAI,||TTV, Jayakumar accuse each other of being jittery over Sasikala’s return||On the eve of the arrival of V.K. Sasikala, close aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, in Tamil Nadu, leaders of the AIADMK and the AMMK were engaged in a war of words over whether the ruling dispensation was nervous about her return to the State after completing a four-year prison sentence. Addressing the media in Bengaluru on Sunday, T.T.V. Dhinakaran, AMMK founder and nephew of Ms. Sasikala, said, “Why are they afraid? They are in government. Ministers in charge of the administration ran to the DGP for two days... It is sad that they have stooped so low.” He wondered whether the ruling party was conspiring to disturb the law and order situation in the State. But AIADMK leader and Minister D. Jayakumar said it was Mr. Dhinakaran who was jittery about Ms. Sasikala's return. The Minister said his party was not afraid of any number of Sasikalas. ‘Clear stand’ “Dhinakaran is nervous because she has come out and would ask for accounts. He has taken all her money,” he alleged. “But we have taken a clear stand. There is 100% no chance of Ms. Sasikala rejoining the AIADMK,” Mr. Jayakumar added. When asked what the AIADMK's response would be if Ms. Sasikala visited the party’s head office, Mr. Jayakumar said, “Look, we are a great movement. We are not afraid of any mosquito or fly!” “We cannot take the law into our hands. We respect the law, and only the police can take action. So, we have given a complaint to the police. They will take care,” he said. Asked why other Ministers had not come out openly against Ms. Sasikala, Mr. Jayakumar maintained that their silence should not be construed as support for her. “There is no need for every Minister to speak,” he added. When asked why Ministers had to go to the DGP’s office to submit their complaint, he said all of them were party workers first, and Ministers later. “I went there not as a Minister, but as a party worker. We will always stand for the party first and not for the government,” the Minister said. Accusing Mr. Dhinakaran of being the DMK’s “B team”, Mr. Jayakumar alleged that the AMMK founder and DMK president M.K. Stalin had joined hands to defeat the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ttv-jayakumar-accuse-each-other-of-being-jittery-over-sasikalas-return/article33777945.ece

08 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘By-election will set the tone for 2022 polls’||Ahead of the upcoming by-election to five municipal corporations ward, the Delhi Congress held a meeting on Sunday. The booth-level workers were told that this by-election will set the tone and tenor for the civic body general elections due in 2022 and all efforts must be made to secure a win for the party. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar and AICC in-charge of Delhi Shakti Sinh Gohil told workers that they should reach out at the grass-root level and expose before the people the corruption, failures, incompetence and inaction of both the BJP and AAP governments. Mr. Gohil said the people of Delhi have been suffering for the past seven years as the BJP and the AAP governments have only been accusing each other of corruption, administrative failures and fund misuse without providing any development. He said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, also the Finance Minister, was canvassing in the local body elections in Ahmedabad, which proves the party’s lop-sided priority regarding Delhi where sanitation workers had to go on strike for their salaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/by-election-will-set-the-tone-for-2022-polls/article33778074.ece

Sasikala’s supporters are likely to gather in large numbers at both places when she returns to Chennai.

Beggars are being equipped with the necessary life skills at a special training centre established in Jaipur by the Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC). ‘Willing participants’ Over 40 beggars hailing from Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, who came to Jaipur in search of livelihood but ended up on footpaths, have been provided with shelter, where they are learning yoga, meditation, sports and computer operations.
