13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Not conceded any territory, says govt.||The disengagement at the south bank of Pangong Tso (lake) will see Indian troops moving to their post in Chushul and China to the Moldo garrison. In the next phase, additional Indian troops will move further down, around 40 km to Tara-Rhongo post and Chinese troops to Dorjo, a senior government official told The Hindu . The official spoke on background on a day the Defence Ministry said in a statement that the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was at Finger 8 and not at Finger 4 at Pangong Tso. At the same time, the Ministry said India had not conceded any territory as a result of this agreement. In August 2020, Indian troops had taken advantageous positions on the hills in the south bank following which China matched presence, leading to an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. This incident followed China blocking Indian patrols at multiple locations in Eastern Ladakh-north Pangong, Gogra-Hot Springs, Galwan, Depsang and CNN sector in Demchok, followed by amassing of troops and armaments. Patrolling curbs The official said the moratorium on patrolling had been recorded in the agreement document signed by the military commanders. “The agreement mentions in as many words that suspension of patrolling is temporary and will resume once both countries take a final decision. The right to patrolling in traditional areas is not compromised,” the official said. The suspension of patrolling is similar to what exists in the Galwan Valley, where 20 soldiers were killed on June 15, 2020, in a violent clash with the Chinese PLA. A buffer zone has been created here, said the official, adding that this was also a temporary mechanism. On Saturday, the main phase of disengagement at the north and south banks of Pangong lake is expected to begin. “We will verify each step by all means, physical as well as electronic. The next priority is Depsang and Gogra-Hot Springs, where the face-off continues.” Outstanding issues According to the Defence Ministry statement, the Defence Minister’s statement also made it clear that there are “outstanding problems to be addressed, including at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.” “The outstanding issues are to be taken up within 48 hours of the completion of the Pangong Tso disengagement,” the Ministry said. Stating that the assertion that the Indian territory is up to Finger 4 at Pangong Tso is categorically false, it said the territory of India is as depicted by the map of India and includes more than 43,000 sq km currently under illegal occupation of China since 1962. “That is why India has persistently maintained the right to patrol up to Finger 8, including in the current understanding with China,” it said. Permanent posts of both sides at the north bank of Pangong Tso are longstanding and well-established, the Ministry said. On the Indian side, it is Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3 and on the Chinese side, east of Finger 8. “The current agreement provides for cessation of forward deployment by both sides and continued deployment at these permanent posts,” it said. On the ongoing disengagement process, a defence official said India and China had put in place additional verification mechanisms to ensure that both sides adhere to the understanding reached for disengagement in Pangong Tso. This was done given the trust deficit and photography and videography are being done by both sides during withdrawal at each step and reported to their respective higher ups. The disengagement process is very slow and deliberate at each step, the official said. As the progress is under way, there is daily communication between local commanders directly and through the established hotline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/not-conceded-any-territory-says-govt/article33826007.ece
13 February 2021||MANGALURU,||‘Congress did not allow debate on anti-cow slaughter Bill’||MLC K. Prathap Simha Nayak said here on Friday that the Congress did not allow a debate on The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill 2020 which was passed in the Legislative Council by voice vote a few days ago. Addressing presspersons, the MLC said that the government was ready to discuss the Bill in detail. But the Opposition Congress created a ruckus in the House, tore the copies of the Bill and its members protested in the Well of the House without wanting to discuss it. In such circumstances, the Bill was passed by voice vote inevitably, he said. The conduct of the Congress members in the House was not in good taste, he said. Mr. Nayak said that the BJP had promised in its election manifesto that it would bring a law to prevent cow slaughter. Now it has fulfilled its promise. The MLC said that about 400 organisations in the State wanted the government to bring out legislation to prevent cow slaughter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/congress-did-not-allow-debate-on-anti-cow-slaughter-bill/article33826633.ece

13 February 2021||MANGALURU,||Couple injured in leopard attack near Kukke||A leopard attacked a man and his wife injuring them in Kutrupady village, Kadaba taluk in Dakshina Kannada, early on Friday. However, Forest Department officials caught it later after darting the animal. According to Deputy Conservator of Forests, Dakshina Kannada, V. Karikalan, the male leopard attacked the couple in their farm land when they went there to water crops at about 3 a.m. The farm land is abutting Kidu Reserve Forest, near Kukke Subrahmanya. He said that the leopard, aged about five, had a snare intact on its neck when it attacked Shekhar Kamath and Soumya Kamath. Probably, it got irritated by the sight of the couple on its way as the snare was still intact on its neck. It then jumped on them and later went into hiding in the nearby bushes. After Forest Department officials and locals began a search for it, the animal came out of the bushes at about 10 a.m. and climbed up a tree. After veterinarians Yashaswi and Murali darted it, the leopard slept on the tree from where it was caught at about 1 p.m. As a precaution, the officials had spread a net to protect the animal in case it fell from the tree after being darted. After the animal fell into sleep, personnel cut the branch of the tree on which the leopard slept and slowly lowered it into the net. Mr. Karikalan said that as the leopard was with the snare intact on its neck for more than eight hours, it will be kept under observation for about two days at Pilikula Biological Park in Mangaluru. He said that Ms. Kamath had scratch wound on her hand, while her husband suffered a fracture in his hand. Ms. Kamath was admitted to the Community Health Centre in Kadaba, while Mr. Kamath was admitted to a private hospital in Puttur. Mr. Kamath’s farm is about 30 km away from the farm land where, recently, a leopard, which got itself trapped along with a dog in a wash room of a house, escaped into the forest. Mr. Karikalan appreciated the efforts made by the Forest Department personnel led by Assistant Conservator of Forests Austin P. Soans and comprising Range Forest Officers Raghavendra and Manjunath in catching the leopard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/couple-injured-in-leopard-attack-near-kukke/article33826638.ece
13 February 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Four dead, 22 injured as private bus plunges into valley in Araku||Four persons, including a seven-year-old child, died and at least 18 others were injured when a private travels bus fell into a valley while negotiating a hairpin bend near Damuku under the Ananthagiri police station limits in Visakhapatnam Agency on Friday night. All the victims are said to be tourists from Hyderabad. The incident occurred when the tourists were returning to Visakhapatnam from the Araku Valley. According to Deputy Inspector General, Visakhapatnam (Range), L.K.V. Ranga Rao, of the 18 injured, at least eight are said to be critical. The identities of the deceased are yet to be ascertained, when the last reports came in. The number of deaths is likely to increase. While the police say there were 25 persons in the bus, the bus driver, Srisailam, undergoing treatment at a hospital, reportedly said there were 23 elderly persons and seven children in the vehicle. The bus belonging to Dinesh Travels had left Hyderabad on February 10, and after visiting Simhachalam in Visakhapatnam on Friday morning, the tourists left for Araku for sight-seeing. The injured were shifted to Community Health Centre in S. Kota in Vizianagaram district, which is about 30 km from the accident spot. After initial treatment they were shifted to other hospitals. Sources said a large number of locals, jeep and cab drivers from Damuku, Ananthagiri and Borra region rushed to the spot after coming to know about the accident and joined the rescue operations. Mr. Ranga Rao said the bus plummeted at least 80 feet deep into the valley. Rescue operations had been difficult, due to inaccessible terrain and pitch darkness in the forest area, police said. Describing the scenes over there, Lakshmi, an anganwadi teacher from Damuku, said it was completely dark and it was very tough to identify whether any passengers were missing in the surroundings. Control Room Meanwhile the Visakhapatnam district administration set up a control room for inquiries related to the accident. The contact numbers are - 08912590102, 0891259010.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/four-killed-as-bus-rolls-down-valley-in-araku/article33825945.ece

The two leaders had parted ways after Mr. Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao joined the YSRCP and was given party ticket from Bheemunipatnam Assembly constituency from where he emerged successful. Mr. Ganta Srinivasa Rao reportedly tried to join the YSRCP but his efforts proved futile. This is the first time after the general elections in 2019 that the two leaders shared the stage. They extended their support to the workers, trade union leaders and others, who launched a relay hunger strike on Friday. CPI national secretary K.

Resignation Addressing the trade union leaders, Mr. Ganta Srinivasa Rao said he had tendered the resignation in the ‘Speaker format’ in view of the criticism being made by some leaders over his resignation, and appealed to the Speaker to accept it. He promised to participate in all agitations against the privatisation of VSP. He said that the Prime Minister was unlikely to respond to letters, and opined that a special meeting of the Assembly be convened and a resolution adopted against the privatisation of VSP. He also sought that the Chief Minister lead the delegation of MPs to Delhi. Meanwhile, the fast launched by former MLA and TDP leader Palla Srinivas continued for the third day on Friday. Mr. Narayana, TDP State president K. Atchannaidu, Mr. Ganta Srinivasa Rao, CPI State assistant secretary J.V.

13 February 2021||Virudhunagar,||15 killed, 33 injured in accident at Tamil Nadu fireworks unit||In one of the worst fireworks accidents in recent times, 15 workers were killed and 33 injured in an explosion that ripped through Sree Mariyammal Fireworks near Vembakottai in Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu on Friday. “Fifteen workers have died, while 10 others are in a critical state,” said Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan, who visited the accident spot and hospitals. While 10 of them sustained 100% burns, at least eight suffered 60% to 90% burns, said Joint Director (Health Services) R. Manoharan. The bodies and the injured were kept at Sattur and Sivakasi government hospitals. Some of them were shifted to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai and the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital. Though the cause of the accident was under investigation, the Collector said it was suspected that one of the workers had negligently handled the chemical-filled fireworks that triggered a series of blasts. “Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation officials are investigating,” he said. Controller of Explosives K. Pandey, along with Deputy Controllers of Explosives Nitin Goel and Amit Goel, conducted the preliminary inspection at the site. The accident occurred at 1.30 p.m. at the unit in Achchankulam under the Ezhayirampannai police station limits. Video footage of the accident circulated on social media shows fire crackers bursting and smoke going up from a distance, for a long while. Apart from 108 ambulances that ferried the injured to the hospitals, locals used private ambulances and other vehicles to rush them to hospitals. District Revenue Officer R. Mangalaramasubramanian oversaw the rescue operation. Police personnel were enquiring in private hospitals about possible admission of additional injured persons. Some of the injured who were referred to higher centres of medical care had opted to go to private hospitals, an official said. Fire and Rescue Services personnel had to wait for long to enter the unit as the chemicals inside the factory kept bursting, according to Virudhunagar District Fire Officer K. Ganesan. Fire tenders from Sattur, Vembakottai and Sivakasi were pressed into service. PM announces Rs. 2 lakh Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about the accident, offering condolences, and announced an ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh for the families of each of those who died in the accident.

13 February 2021||New Delhi,||‘Oppn. creating fake narrative on Budget’||Countering the attack by the Opposition, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said it was creating a “false narrative” of the Union Budget being pro-rich and asserted that it was an instrument to construct a self-reliant India. In an hour-long reply to the debate on the Budget in the Rajya Sabha, Ms. Sitharaman said the Budget is about looking for a quick, short-term solution for those who desperately need it. It is also a Budget that has laid out a medium and long-term sustainable growth policy to keep India on the growth trajectory of being one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The Finance Minister said that despite schemes and initiatives, ranging from roads to agriculture, housing and scholarships to electricity benefiting the lives of people, a false narrative was being created by the Opposition that the government was working for cronies. “Despite steps being taken for helping the poor and the needy of this country, a false narrative is created to accuse that the government works only for cronies,” Ms. Sitharaman said, while acknowledging that more needed to be done for the poor. The Finance Minister alleged that it was the Congress-led UPA government which promoted cronies. She then went on to list various achievements of the government. Pointing out that under the PM Awas Yojana, 1.67 crore houses had been constructed, while under the Saubhagya scheme, more than 2.67 crore households had been electrified, Ms. Sitharaman said, “Are these houses for cronies?” She added that while the Congress was desperate to prove its ownership of the scheme, it was riddled with problems. “You may have given birth to the scheme, but you left it in a mess. What we have done after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge — we removed all the ills of the scheme and effectively used it,” she said. Listing data, she said during the UPA era the government could not for a single year spend the money allocated under the scheme. Her government, she said, has in fact spent the highest ever on the scheme, with allocation of Rs. 90,500 crore so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/oppn-creating-fake-narrative-on-budget/article33826012.ece

He will also hand over the main battle tank, Arjun Mk-1A, to the Army. He will inaugurate the Chennai Metro Rail phase-I extension project, which has been completed at a cost of Rs. 3,770 crore, and commission passenger services from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar. This 9.05-km extension will link north Chennai to the airport and the Central railway station. Mr. Modi will also lay the foundation for the extension, renovation and modernisation of the Grand Anicut Canal System. The canal is important for irrigation in the Cauvery delta districts. It will be modernised at a cost of Rs. 2,640 crore so as to improve its carrying capacity. He will inaugurate the fourth rail line between Chennai Beach and Attipattu. “This 22.1-km section, laid at a cost of Rs. 293.40 crore, traverses through Chennai and Tiruvallur districts, and will ease traffic from the Chennai port,” an official release said. This section connects the Chennai port and the Ennore port and passes through major yards, providing operational flexibility for the movement of trains. The electrification of the single rail line on the Villupuram-Cuddalore-Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur stretch and the Mayiladuthurai-Tiruvarur stretch awaits inauguration by the Prime Minister. Completed at a cost of Rs. 423 crore, the electrification of the 228-km Villupuram-Thanjavur stretch will facilitate a free flow of traffic without the need for a change of traction between Egmore and Kanniyakumari and will result in a saving of Rs. 14.61 lakh a day on fuel cost. At an event in the forenoon, Mr. Modi will hand over the state-of-the-art Arjun Mk-1A to the Army. The tank has been indigenously designed, developed and made by the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment, attached to the Defence Research and Development Organisation, along with 15 academic institutions, 8 labs and several MSMEs. He will also lay the foundation for the Discovery Campus of IIT-Madras. “The campus will be built at Thaiyur near Chennai at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,000 crore in the first phase, over an area of 2 lakh sq m.

13 February 2021||MADURAI,||‘Set up special courts for forest, wildlife crimes in every district’||A Madurai-based activist filed a public interest litigation petition before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Centre and the State to establish special courts in every district of the State to deal with forest and wildlife crimes. In his petition, C. Anand Raj said conviction rate in wildlife crimes was very low and delayed conviction did not serve any purpose. There was a need to set up special courts to hear such cases in an effective manner. He said India’s rich flora and fauna had always been a target of illegal wildlife trade. The crimes against wildlife also had an impact on the economy, development and the security of the country. Tamil Nadu was a pioneer in safeguarding wildlife and natural resources. It had enacted several laws for the conservation of wildlife. Many forests had been identified as protected areas. However, there were several cases pertaining to wildlife crimes still pending before trial courts, he said. The petitioner said if special courts were set up in every district, offenders would not escape the clutches of law and pendency of cases could be tackled effectively. He pointed out that India’s National Wildlife Action Plan 2017-2035 had recommended setting up of special courts. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and N. Sathish Kumar ordered notice to the Centre and the State, seeking their response. The court suo motu added the High Court Registrar as a respondent in the petition. The case was adjourned till February 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/set-up-special-courts-for-forest-wildlife-crimes-in-every-district/article33826078.ece

13 February 2021||Bengaluru,||SSLC students to get easier question papers this year||Class X students who started returning to their schools at the start of the year are worried as they have barely four months to prepare for the all-important SSLC board examination, which is tentatively scheduled to begin on June 14. Given that schools were closed for the better part of the 2020-21 academic year, Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB) plans to seteasier question papers. The board wants to reduce the difficulty level of the question papers for all the subjects. According to KSEEB officials, this year, on an average, 35% of the questions in each subject will be easy. In previous years, only 20% of the questions fell under this category, while 60% were designed to be of ‘average difficulty’. The remaining 20% fell in the ‘difficult’ category. “This year, only 5% of the questions will be difficult,” said a KSEEB official. Difficult year The weightage given to ‘average difficulty’ questions will, however, continue to remain the same. “Class X students have had a difficult year as a majority of their classes were conducted online. Physical classes began only on January 1. Many students have had difficulty grasping even core concepts, so have we decided to set easy question papers,” the official said. Incidentally, in the past SSLC students had told the board that they were finding it difficult to attempt application-based questions that were under the ‘difficult’ questions category.  Apart from tweaking the difficulty level, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education has also reduced the syllabus by 30%. A majority of students and teachers have welcomed the move and feel that it will help more students, especially those who did not have access to education material online. “It has been only one and a half months since classes started and we are now able to grasp a few concepts. But many students, like me, would have found it difficult to clear the exam as we could not attend the online classes regularly because of network issues. Now I am more confident of clearing the board exam,” said Santosh S., a student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sslc-students-to-get-easier-question-papers-this-year/article33826122.ece
13 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||SEC bars Kodali from speaking to media||State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar on Friday passed orders that Minister for Civil Supplies Kodali Venkateswara Rao be restrained from speaking to the media till the elections were completed on February 21. “He is also restrained to speak to any group or groups of people or in meetings till February 21 and the orders come into immediate effect,” said a statement issued late on Friday. Earlier in the day, the Commissioner had served a show-cause notice on the Minister for allegedly making “derogatory utterances which are malicious in intent” against the Commission. He said the Minister, at a press conference on Friday, had referred to the Commission in derogatory terms. “His utterances in bracketing the Commissioner with certain others are made in a manner lowering the esteem of the Commission as well as the public standing of the Commissioner, who is conducting elections to the gram panchayats in the State. The utterances impute unfounded mala fides as well,” he said in a statement. The Minister was given time till 5 p.m. to furnish his reply either in person or through a representative. Mr. Ramesh Kumar said that in a reply sent through his advocate at 3 p.m., the Minister tried to justify his attacks on him. He said the Minister had neither denied the contents of the video nor showed any sign of remorse. He asked the Krishna Collector, the rural SP, and the Vijayawada Police Commissioner to ensure enforcement of his orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sec-bars-kodali-from-speaking-to-media/article33826754.ece

13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||China causing mutual distrust, says Army chief||The “rising footprint” of China in India’s neighbourhood and its attempts to “unilaterally alter the status quo” along India’s disputed borders have created an environment of “confrontation and mutual distrust”, Army chief General Manoj Naravane said on Friday, asserting that regional and internal connectivity was central to unleashing the potential of the northeastern States and “balancing” the influence of China. “A common thread that runs along the northeastern States is lack of coordination amongst various agencies. The policy disconnect is further accentuated by the feeling that affairs of the North East Region (NER) are being run from Delhi. Most of the Central Armed Police Forces and Central agencies are headquartered in Delhi. National priorities, political compulsions of the States and local aspirations are seldom aligned, creating dissonance in execution,” he said. Another distinctive factor that reinforced the “feeling of alienation” among the people of northeast India was “our dismissive, sometimes indifferent and often contemptuous approach”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/china-causing-mutual-distrust-says-army-chief/article33826010.ece

Forest Department officials suspect that the elephants may have been suffering from haemorrhage septicaemia. With elephant deaths likely to go up, a team of veterinary scientists rushed to Kalahandi on Friday. “Four female elephants died along the Gusrigudi Naalah in the Karalapat Reserve Forest of the Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary of Kalahandi south division. On preliminary analysis and testing, the veterinary team suspects it to be a case of haemorrhage septicaemia,” T. Ashok Kumar, divisional forest officer, said. Indramani Nath, a veterinarian with Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT), Bhubaneswar, said haemorrhage septicaemia is a contagious bacterial disease. Animals that come in contact with infected water or soil contract the disease in which respiratory tracts and lungs are affected, leading to severe pneumonia. Haemorrhage septicaemia is generally observed in the pre- and post-monsoon period, he said. Mr. Kumar pointed out that the samples from elephant carcasses had been sent to the laboratory at the Centre for Wildlife Health, OUAT.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/four-elephants-die-in-odisha-forest/article33826019.ece

13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Unable to pay dues: Padmanabhaswamy temple||The administrators of Kerala's Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, one of the richest in India, informed the Supreme Court on Friday that the closure of the temple during the pandemic resulted in a “financial crunch”. The dent left by the virus is such that the temple, for the time being, is unable to pay the State of Kerala the Rs. 11.7 crore owed in “upkeep” expenses. “The money expended by the State should be returned to the State by the temple,” Justice Lalit addressed advocate Uttara Babbar, appearing for the temple's administrative committee, at the beginning of the hearing. Ms. Babbar said there was a “financial crunch... The temple was closed... They [administrative committee] have sought time”. The court left it to the State and the administrative committee to discuss and resolve the issue. ‘Audit under way The exchange came while’ the Bench was perusing a report filed by K. Babu, District Judge, Thiruvananthapuram, who said most of the directions issued by the Supreme Court in a judgment on July 13 last year on the management of temple have been complied with. The court scheduled the case for the second week of September to “consider the progress with respect to the auditing of the accounts of the temple”. In its July 2020 judgment, the court had ordered an audit to be conducted for the past 25 years. Advocate G. Prakash, for Kerala, said the audit was going on.  In its verdict last year, the top court had also declared the former royals as the manager or shebait of the properties of the Sri Padmanabha, the chief deity of the famed temple in Thiruvananthapuram. The court had also accepted the royals’ submission that the temple was a “public temple”. It had issued a slew of directions for its transparent administration in the future, including the formation of a temple administrative committee with the Thiruvananthapuram District Judge as the chairperson. The other members of the committee include a nominee of the trustee (royal family), the chief tantri (priest) of the temple, a nominee of the State and a member nominated by the Union Ministry of Culture. This committee would take care of the daily administration of the temple. It had also ordered a second committee to be constituted to advise the administrative committee on policy matters. Both committees should start functioning within the next two months and an executive officer should be appointed without delay, the ruling had said. The primary duties of the committees would be to preserve the treasures and properties. They would take a call on whether to open Kallara B, considered to be the richest among the temple vaults, for inventorisation. The committees would ensure that rituals and religious practices are conducted as per custom and on the advice of the chief tantri . The court said the committees would ensure that income to the temple would be used to augment the facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unable-to-pay-dues-padmanabhaswamy-temple/article33825931.ece
13 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Fight for farmers’ dignity: BKU||Adopting an aggressive tone at a massive “kisan panchayat” in Bilari town of Moradabad on Friday, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Naresh Tikait said, “98% Hindus voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but after the farmers’ protest, only 2% will remain with it.” More than the farm laws, he said, the farmers’ protest had become a fight for protecting the “dignity” of farmers. “If we let it wither away, nobody would take the name of farmers for the next 30-40 years,” he said. He said that when the government had silenced everybody, it was the BKU that had “reined in the government”. “The government has made numerous false allegations against us in the last 78 days. I am confident people will answer them in the coming days,” Mr. Tikait said. He said that this was not the first time that farmers had protested against a government but “we have never been insulted like this before”. “We have been ridiculed as andolanjeevi , called part of a jamaat . Panchayat is being called a jamaat . They will have to repent for this,” he said. “After 2013, an attempt was made to divide us on the basis of religion. Many of us were misled. We should give up our differences,” he said. Meanwhile, responding to PM Narendra Modi’s statement that the minimum support price (MSP) would remain, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary said, “MSP is only on paper. The MSP of paddy is Rs. 1,868 [per quintal] and the rate that the farmers got this year is Rs. 1,200 [per quintal]. The same happened with soybean and mustard.” He was addressing a large gathering in Mathura district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fight-for-farmers-dignity-bku/article33826488.ece
13 February 2021||New Delhi,||Relief operation on in Chamoli||The rescue operation at the Tapovan hydel project tunnel in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand continued on Friday, following confirmation that there was no immediate danger of the water level rising in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers due to the formation of a lake upstream. “Scientists from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, carried out an aerial survey of the lake. They confirmed water discharge from the lake,” said an official, adding that scientists had indicated there was no immediate threat of a flood in the two rivers. Earlier on Friday, following reports about the formation of a lake, a State Disaster Response Force team of eight personnel, five porters and two guides reached the spot to assess the situation. It is also readying a temporary helipad. More information would be available once the team returned, said Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Law and Order) Nilesh Anand Bharne. At the Tapovan tunnel, where about 35 workers are trapped, an Indo-Tibetan Border Police official said the drilling to study a silt flushing channel located about 12 metres below was completed late on Friday evening. “As informed, a 75-mm-diameter drilling has been done. This is good sign as there is no water/slush pressure observed in the silt flushing tunnel. However, a camera could not be inserted due to the presence of slush midway. Drilling of a larger hole [250-300 mm] has been planned now and the machine is being deployed at the location immediately. Meanwhile, sludge removal from the main tunnel is in progress,” the official said. The death toll in the aftermath of the snow avalanche rose to 38 on Friday. The identities of 11 of the dead have been determined so far. One of them, Basharat A. Zargar, an engineer posted at the Rishiganga power project site, was a resident of Soura in Srinagar, said a National Disaster Response Force official. While 30 bodies have been found in Chamoli, three were recovered from Rudraprayag and one from Tehri Garhwal. “DNA sampling is being done to facilitate the identification of the victim,” Mr. Bharne said. Eighteen severed body parts have been found from different places in Chamoli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/relief-operation-continues-in-chamoli/article33825974.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC issues notice to A.P. on polls in border areas||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Andhra Pradesh government on a contempt petition filed by Odisha for notifying panchayat elections in disputed inter-State border villages despite a status quo order from the top court. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar gave Andhra a week to file its response to the contempt plea but did not stay the polls for now. “Whatever consequences flowing from our orders will follow,” Justice Khanwilkar remarked. The second phase of the panchayat elections will be held in A.P. on Saturday. The remark was in response to a submission by senior advocate Vikas Singh, for Odisha, that “tomorrow they plan to go ahead with the polls” in the disputed villages. Advocate Mahfooz A. Nazki appeared for Andhra Pradesh. The court scheduled the next hearing for February 19. The dispute over territorial jurisdiction over 21 villages, popularly called as ‘Kotia Group of villages’, first reached the top court in 1968, when Odisha, on the basis of three notifications — issued on December 1, 1920, October 8, 1923 and October 15, 1927 — claimed that A.P. had trespassed into its well-defined territory. During the pendency of the suit filed by Odisha, the court, on December 2, 1968, directed both States to maintain status quo . The court dismissed the suit on technical grounds in 2006. With the consent of both States, it then directed that status quo be maintained till the dispute is resolved. Now, the Odisha government has sought contempt action against three A.P. officials: District Collector Mude Hari Jawaharlal, Chief Secretary Adityanath Das, and State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-issues-notice-to-ap-on-polls-in-border-areas/article33825929.ece
13 February 2021||Chennai,||Ph.D. entry in IITs tougher for students from marginalised communities||Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe applicants are half as likely to get selected for a Ph.D. programme at leading IITs in the country as aspirants from the General Category (GC) are. Data collated from a series of RTI applications, including from The Hindu , on the number of applicants versus the number of those admitted to Ph.D. programmes in the five older IITs has indicated that the acceptance rate is skewed against students from the SC, ST, and Other Backward Classes (OBC) communities. The acceptance rate, which refers to the number of students selected for every 100 students who applied, stood at 4% for students from historically privileged castes (General Category). It falls to 2.7% for OBC students and further down to just 2.16% for SCs and 2.2% for STs. Policy ignored This finding comes against the backdrop of the Education Ministry’s data submitted to Parliament last year showing the failure of the IITs to fill Ph.D. seats as per reservation. It showed that of the total admissions made by all IITs from 2015 to 2019, only 2.1% went to STs and 9.1% to SCs. The government’s reservation policy mandates allocation of 7.5% seats for students from the STs and 15% from SCs. Similarly, 23.2% seats went to applicants from the OBCs against the 27% mandated by reservation. Remaining 65.6%, or roughly two-thirds of all the seats, went to GC applicants. The IITs have often cited the lack of applicants from the marginalised communities for the situation. However, the RTI data reveals quite the opposite. Five-year period The RTI query data covered 3,279 Ph.D. admissions made from among 95,445 applicants in the five-year period from 2015 to 2019 in the four popular departments of civil (CE), electrical (EE), computer science (CSE), and mechanical (ME) engineering departments in the IITs of Madras, Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, and Kharagpur. These five IITs accounted for nearly 60% of all Ph.D. admissions made by all 23 IITs. Within these five IITs, the four departments included in the analysis accounted for roughly 25% of all the admissions made in around 80 different departments offering Ph.D. The trend of acceptance rate being significantly higher for GC students is more pronounced in the Delhi, Madras, Bombay and Kanpur IITs. Though the skewed acceptance rate was observed in IIT Kharagpur also, it did marginally better. In absolute numbers, only 238 of the 11,019 SC applicants and 40 of the 1,809 ST applicants got selected, according to the RTI data. The disparity is more visible when the proportion of each category of applicants was compared with their proportion among those who gained admission. The percentage of GC students among those admitted was always higher than their percentage among those applied. However, the converse was true for OBC, SC and ST candidates. Their percentages among those admitted was always lower than their respective percentages among applicants. For instance, in IIT Delhi, while 63.3% of all applicants were from GC, they accounted for 76.3% among those admitted. In contrast, the percentage of OBC, SC and ST candidates dropped from 22.9%, 11.9% and 1.9% in the application stage to 17%, 6% and 0.7%, respectively, in the admission stage. Few of the specific instances where the skewed admission rate was striking included the January 2019 admission cycle in EEE in IIT Delhi. Of the 195 SC applicants, only three were selected (acceptance rate of 1.5%) while none were selected from the 30 ST applicants. In contrast, 50 students were selected from the 1,071 GC applicants (4.7%). In the July 2016 admission cycle in EEE in IIT Kanpur, 29 candidates were selected from 396 GC applicants (7.3%) while not a single one of the 46 SC applicants made it. Bucking the trend Interestingly, data from IIT Guwahati painted a different picture, countering the explanations for the disparity in other IITs. According to data on 456 admissions and 13,033 applicants provided by IIT Guwahati, the acceptance rates for students from marginalised communities were roughly similar or even higher than GC students. While the acceptance rate for GC candidates was 3.3%, it was 4% for OBCs, 3.4% for SCs, and 4.9% for STs. While IIT Guwahati also failed to fulfil the reservation-mandated allocation of seats, it was the only major IIT that came closest to the desired numbers. The percentage of OBC, SC and ST candidates among those admitted were respectively 21%, 12.3% and 5.5%. ‘Selection bias’ Responding to the data, Professor and Chair in the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University Ajantha Subramanian said it was far more likely that the failure to fill the reserved seats was due to selection bias. Professor Subramanian, who has written on the workings of upper caste privileges in the IITs in her book The Caste of Merit , told The Hindu , “There has been long-standing opposition among IIT administrators and faculty to reservations, which they see as a form of unjust government intervention in their meritocratic institutions.” Arguing that the data showed the pyramidal structure of Indian education in which exclusion increased as one moved through advancing degrees, Professor Subramanian said the argument of “merit” was often used as an alibi for continuing social exclusion. “A truly just admissions policy must directly address the vastly different circumstances from which students come so that so-called ‘merit’ is recognised as the by-product of unfair structural advantages and not simply as innate talent,” she said. The recent report of an Education Ministry-constituted committee, which included administrators from a few IITs, has faced criticism for recommending the abolition of reservation in faculty recruitment. Sukhdeo Thorat, Professor Emeritus, Jawaharlal Nehru University, and former Chairman of University Grants Commission, who previously headed a committee to look into caste-based discrimination at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the data highlighted the need for a further detailed study on the issue. He stressed the need for increased transparency in the admission process and the presence of OBC, SC and ST members on the selection panels. ChintaBar, a student collective in IIT Madras, has said the acceptance rate must ideally be higher for students from reserved categories with different cut-off marks for them. Pointing out that the number of applicants from reserved categories was many times higher than the reserved seats, it urged the IITs to follow reservation in letter and spirit.  The Hindu reached out to the six IITs for their comment. IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur did not respond to repeated queries. The other IITs ruled out the possibility of any bias in the selection process, and said the admissions were conducted in a fair manner. Confirming that the reservation policies were followed in all seats funded by the Education Minstry and different cut-off marks were followed for reserved category students, they said efforts were being made to fill seats as per reservation. IIT Guwahati did not directly answer a question on reasons for the acceptance rate being uniform. The institute, however, said it was working towards admission policies to ensure all seats under reserved categories were filled.

13 February 2021||New Delhi,||Against curbing social media: V-P||At a time when the government is involved in a tug-of-war with social media giant Twitter, Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu called for ‘moderation’ in the use of social media to prevent abuse. Speaking to presspersons at the end of the first part of the Budget session, he said while he was against controlling the social media, the platform should also not be misused and abused. These platforms should not be converted into war theatre and principle of moderation should be followed. “Content for social media should be generated in a restrained and responsible manner by keeping the reactions to such content in mind. Such reflection would minimise offensive posts. Provocation should not be the objective. Sharing of views for better perspectives should be,” he said. Samajwadi Party MP Chaudhary Sukhram Singh Yadav on Friday had raised the issue of his Twitter account being withheld. “I have not done anything to direct Twitter to suspend my account. I only posted whatever is happening in the farmer’s movement and there is nothing wrong in it,” Mr Yadav said. On the ongoing farmers’ agitation, Mr. Naidu said that no one should take a “maximalist” position and talks were the only way out. “Taking extreme or maximalist positions by any side makes it difficult to resolve the issue as it makes accommodation of the other point of view difficult. Accordingly, the principle of moderation applies in this case as well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/against-curbing-social-media-v-p/article33825982.ece

The real time monitoring is part of improving Motor Vehicles Department’s (MVD) automated traffic enforcement activities and to gradually end the manual enforcement activities. Besides, the MVD can put an end to the complaints, ensure transparency and reduce manpower. Cjontrol room The control room for Thiruvananthapuram has been set up at the Transport Bhavan in Fort. The district control rooms are in Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Palakkad and Malappuram. Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran will commission them on Monday. Control rooms are already functioning in Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts. The control rooms in other six districts would be commissioned before March 31, Transport Commissioner M.R. Ajith Kumar said. Joint Transport Commissioner Rajeev Puthalath said road accidents had been brought down by 33.5% in 2020 and the aim is to achieve the 50% target set by the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety. The ANPR cameras are portable and could be placed anywhere. The Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) is behind the execution and the resources had been mobilised from the Kerala Road Safety Authority, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/traffic-enforcement-all-set-to-go-digital-in-kerala/article33826199.ece
13 February 2021||Afshan Yasmeen,||‘Excessive alcohol can cause irreversible changes to DNA’||It is common knowledge that excessive alcohol consumption is bad for health. But the assumption that all the damage can be set right after a person stops drinking is not true, according to researchers from NIMHANS. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause irreversible changes to the DNA and changes may persist even when alcohol is no longer consumed, revealed a study by researchers at NIMHANS including Pratima Murthy, HoD, Psychiatry, and Sanjeev Jain, Senior Professor of Psychiatry, who heads the Molecular Genetics Laboratory. The study, published online in the ‘American Journal of Medical Genetics’, is part of the PhD work of Soundarya Soundararajan under the guidance of Dr. Murthy. People who attended the Centre for Addiction Medicine outpatient clinic at NIMHANS from March 2015 to April 2016 seeking treatment for alcohol problems were screened for inclusion in the study, Dr. Murthy told The Hindu on Friday. Dr. Murthy, consultant, Centre for Addiction Medicine, said, “Although we inherit genes from our parents, their expression is regulated in a unique manner in each person, and may be influenced by lifestyle. Exposure to alcohol affects the pattern of gene expression, and may explain some systemic complications.” How it works “Alcohol (ethanol) is rapidly metabolised in the body, and its two carbon atoms (CH3CH2 or ethyl) are converted into single atoms (CH3 or methyl), that can react with many other chemicals, including DNA. This change (methylation) can modify the expression of many genes, or even have toxic consequences. We find that the chemical changes in the DNA associated with excessive alcohol consumption may not reverse,” she explained. Researchers analysed the chemistry of the DNA of individuals who had been drinking heavily for 10 years, on an average of 10 drinks/day. “We assessed their DNA when they first sought treatment and after three months when they reduced or stopped drinking. When we studied the pattern of methylation of simple DNA sequences scattered all over the genome, we observed a significant reduction in methylation in heavy drinkers. This persisted even after three months of abstinence,” she said. Two genes that are directly linked to metabolism of alcohol, however, were more methylated in those with alcohol dependence, and continued to remain so even after abstinence. “We concluded that in heavy drinkers, even when they stopped drinking, the methylation did not come back to the levels of non-drinkers, implying that chemical changes in the DNA associated with alcohol are not temporary,” she said. Early drinkers “The effects of alcohol were more pronounced in those who had started drinking at an early age. This suggests that starting to drink early may physically alter many genes, including those of the brain. This may have a significant effect on brain development and maturation, that may persist to later adult life. The study highlights the processes involved both in addictive behaviour and cancers,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/excessive-alcohol-can-alter-dna-study/article33825937.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Governance and lawmaking should be left to legislature’||Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday told the Lok Sabha that just as independence of the judiciary is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, the principle of separation of powers is also a part of that basic structure. He asserted that governance and lawmaking should be left to the elected members of the legislature. In his reply to a debate on the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, which was passed by the Lok Sabha, Mr. Prasad also urged the judiciary to exercise its discretion in accepting public interest litigations. The Law Minister said that there was a “rush to file PILs on almost every issue” nowadays. He appealed to the judiciary to look at “genuine” issues such as compensation, working conditions of the working classes, and so on. The amendment to the Arbitration Act proposes to empower courts to stay arbitration awards if they have been obtained through fraud or corrupt means. Responding to the queries raised by several members on the need to amend the Arbitration Act retrospectively, and to be brought in the form of an ordinance, the Law Minister said it was necessary to ensure that some parties did not try to take advantage of an arbitral award that may have been obtained through fraud or corrupt means. “If an award [that] is given against the Union government or a State government is given by fraud and an investor wants to enforce it, is it fair that thousands of crores of taxpayers’ money be given away? Some of the members have asked ‘why an ordinance?’ Why not? Should we part with taxpayers’ money?” Mr. Prasad asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/governance-and-lawmaking-should-be-left-to-legislature/article33825956.ece
13 February 2021||New Delhi,||Inter-marriages can reduce caste tensions, says court||Educated youngsters are showing the way forward to reduce caste and community tensions in India by tying the knot in inter-marriages, the Supreme Court said in a recent judgment. “Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners, which, in turn, is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community play a major role. Possibly, this is the way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such inter-marriages,” a Bench, led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, said. Justice Kaul quoted B.R. Ambedkar’s Annihilation of Caste , in which the Father of the Constitution said, “I am convinced that the real remedy is intermarriage. Fusion of blood can alone create the feeling of being kith and kin, and unless this feeling of kinship, of being kindred, becomes paramount, the separatist feeling — the feeling of being aliens — created by caste will not vanish.” Even as more and more cases challenging religious conversion laws enacted by several States reach the Supreme Court, Justice Kaul observed in the judgment on February 8 that “consent of the family or community or clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that their consent has to be piously given primacy”. The judgment came in a case filed by a lecturer, an MBA graduate, who fled from Bengaluru to Delhi to marry a man, an M. Tech. and assistant professor. The investigating officer, on a complaint filed by her relatives, directed her to leave her husband and be present at the police station. She refused, saying they were legally married and it was her choice to do so. The court quashed the case against the couple and directed the police authorities to not only counsel the investigating officers but devise a training programme to deal with such cases for the benefit of the police personnel. “We expect the police authorities to take action on this behalf in the next eight weeks to lay down some guidelines and training programmes how to handle such socially sensitive cases,” the Supreme Court ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inter-marriages-can-reduce-caste-tensions-says-court/article33825985.ece
13 February 2021||Bengaluru,||High Court issues notice to Karnataka govt., Centre on domestic workers’ plea||The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to the State and Central governments on a PIL petition complaining non-registration of all domestic workers under the provisions of the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act and extension of welfare schemes to them even 11 years after the law came into existence. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order on the petition filed by the Domestic Workers’ Rights Union. “The failure of the State to register domestic workers under the Act has resulted in more than four lakh domestic workers in Bengaluru city, and many more across the State standing neglected, without jobs, and without economic and social security, especially during this pandemic period,” the petitioner has alleged. The petitioner has complained that though the State government has announced financial assistance to people working in various other sectors of unorganised workers, no financial assistance was offered to domestic workers following COVID-19 pandemic though they lost their livelihood. Narrating how domestic workers were discriminated against, particularly during the pandemic, the petitioner has said that “casteist, feudal, and discriminatory practices imposed on domestic workers, including use of separate utensils and prohibition of use of toilets, amount to practice of untouchability...” Sexual harassment Despite the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act specifically covers domestic workers within its ambit, the ineffective functioning of local complaint committees has forced domestic workers to face sexual harassment at workplace sans help at the time of sexual harassment by employers.  Petition filed by Domestic Workers’ Rights Union ‘No financial assistance offered to domestic workers following COVID-19 outbreak’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-court-issues-notice-to-karnataka-govt-centre-on-domestic-workers-plea/article33826124.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mullaperiyar dam safe: T.N.||The Mullaperiyar dam is protected from earthquakes and is hydrologically safe, the Tamil Nadu government has assured the Supreme Court. Countering Kerala’s allegations of non-cooperation and lack of concern about the safety of the 126-year-old dam, Tamil Nadu accused Kerala of “obstructionist attitude”. The State said the installation of instruments to protect the dam structure and warn about dangers to the earth dam and the baby dam has been in limbo since 2015. This is solely because the Kerala Forest Department has refused permission to cut 23 trees. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar on Friday adjourned the hearing of the case to March 2. The Centre agreed to file a response on the spat between the two States over the safety of the dam. In an affidavit, Tamil Nadu said seismographic instruments suggested by expert bodies such as the Central Water Commission and National Geophysical Research Institute to warn about earthquakes are “proposed to be installed soon”. “It is pertinent to point out here that the dam is found to be safe against earthquakes,” Tamil Nadu said. Noting that the dam has been found to be hydrologically safe, Tamil Nadu said the dam is "designed to route Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge of 2.12 lakh cusecs fixed by the CWC and found to be safe for that flood condition". “The Maximum Water Level [MWL] of the dam is +155 ft, against the maximum permitted storage level of +142 ft,” Tamil Nadu said in its affidavit. The State further complained that Kerala had since 2014 obstructed it from collecting rainfall data from the Mullaikodi rainfall station. Tamil Nadu contended that the reports relied on by Kerala to accuse Tamil Nadu of negligence were over two decades old and outdated. Kerala affidavit In its affidavit, Kerala had informed the court of the Central Water Commission inspection report that said 70% of the installed instruments for monitoring the safety and health of the dam was not working properly. It said Tamil Nadu was yet to install the two seismoaccelerographs recommended to monitor tremors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mullaperiyar-dam-safe-tn/article33826608.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 vaccine for people over 50 years from March||The population above 50 years of age and those with co-morbidities in the 20 to 50 age group are scheduled to start receiving the COVID-19 vaccine from March, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Director Randeep Guleria said on Friday. He was replying to questions related to the COVID-19 vaccination drive at an interactive programme organised by the Health Ministry. Explaining that it was not clear for how long the COVID-19 vaccination offered protection, Dr. Guleria said: “A good amount of antibodies will develop in about 14 days after the second vaccine shot. Though the exact time length about the protection offered is not clear, we believe that the cover will last for at least eight months, or may be longer.” As people travelled and became carriers of viruses, he said, “everyone needs to be vaccinated globally to control the spread. Therefore, all countries need to get their share of vaccine.” On Friday, India’s total active COVID-19 case load saw a decline and stood at 1,35,926, show data released by the Health Ministry. “The distribution of new cases in India in the last 24 hours shows a positive picture with only one State reporting over 1,000 new cases. Four States and Union Territories have not reported any new cases in the last 24 hours, and these include Daman and Diu, Ladakh and Tripura,” the Ministry said. The Ministry said the distribution of daily deaths among States and Union Territories in the 24 hours reflected a significant decline in the number, with 18 reporting no new mortalities. India reported 9,309 new confirmed cases and 15,858 new recoveries during the period. The Ministry said that a total of 77,66,319 beneficiaries had been vaccinated till 6 p.m. as per provisional reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-vaccine-for-people-over-50-years-from-march/article33825967.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||President will decide on Rajoana’s plea||The government informed the Supreme Court on Friday that President Ram Nath Kovind will take a decision on the mercy plea of Balwant Singh Rajoana, who has been in jail for 26 years for the assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh. “The process has started. The President will take a decision,” Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta informed a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde. Mr. Mehta specifically drew the court’s attention to the gravity of the facts in the case, saying Rajoana was “accused of the killing of a former Punjab Chief Minister”. The court asked Mr. Mehta to indicate a time frame by which the decision would be taken. “I cannot speak on behalf of the Honourable President,” Mr. Mehta replied flatly. “We know that, but you can speak on behalf of the government,” Chief Justice Bobde reacted. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the mercy plea was filed in 2012. “The man has been waiting for several years,” Mr. Rohatgi objected to the six-week adjournment. Rajoana’s plea for presidential mercy has been hanging in limbo despite the government having decided over a year ago, in 2019, to spare his life in commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. In his petition to the Supreme Court from his jail cell, he said his repeated pleas to the government about the fate of the mercy plea were met with silence. The court said the law was settled that once the government had decided to recommend a presidential pardon for a condemned man, the pendency of appeals in the Supreme Court of his co-accused cannot delay the process initiated under Article 72 (presidential pardon) of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/president-will-decide-on-rajoanas-plea/article33825983.ece

13 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Sex racket accused gets 24-year jail term||The additional and district sessions court in Kottayam on Friday awarded 24 year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1.09 lakh to Suresh, the prime accused in the Vithura sex racket case. The sex trade involving the minor girl hailing from Vithura in the Kerala capital came to light in July 1996 when the victim landed in police custody along with one of the accused. Based on the victim’s statement, Suresh, hailing from Kollam district, was arraigned as the prime accused in the case for raping the girl, and forcing her into prostitution after keeping her in illegal custody for days.  Pronouncing the verdict in one of the 24 cases pending against the accused, judge Johnson John sentenced the accused to 10 years of RI and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh for the offence under Sections 372 (selling minor for purposes of prostitution) of the Indian Penal Code and another term of two years and a penalty of Rs. 5,000 for the offence under Section 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 or more days) of the IPC. The court further awarded RI for 12 years and a fine of Rs. 4,000 under Sections 31 and 51(D) of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act. Of the 38 witnesses in the case, the prosecution, represented by special public prosecutor Rajagopal Padippurakkal, examined 21 witnesses while eight expired earlier.  Though the case was registered in 1996, Suresh had been absconding for 18 years and surrendered in court in 2014. After being granted bail, he went into hiding once again and was arrested five years later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/24-years-of-ri-for-prime-accused-in-vithura-case/article33826219.ece

Prabir Purkayastha and author Githa Hariharan have been detained in their house since the beginning of the raid,” said a NewsClick statement uploaded on its website. According to the site, NewsClick is owned by PPK NEWSCLICK Studio Private Limited. It was founded by Mr. Purkayastha. ‘Equipment seized’ “Earlier, the Newsclick office was raided for over 36 hours and some equipment vital to our functioning as a news organisation was seized. Communication devices of directors and senior management have also been seized, which has, therefore, limited their ability to return to work or indeed, respond to queries of the media,” it said. The platform said: “Despite this harassment, Newsclick has cooperated fully with the authorities, and will continue to do so. We have nothing to hide, as we have operated completely in accordance with the law.” We are, however, disturbed to note reports in various media outlets based on information allegedly provided by senior officials of the Enforcement Directorate. The selective leak of misleading facts is nothing but a malicious attempt to smear the image of Newsclick and discredit our journalism. It also constitutes a violation of the sanctity of the legal and investigative process.” NewsClick said that as mentioned in its editorial statement of February 10, “these raids appear to be part of a trend of deploying government agencies against those who refuse to toe the establishment’s line”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-searches-on-for-80-hours-newsclick/article33825969.ece

The CFI is the students’ wing of the outfit Popular Front of India. Rauf was arrested by the ED on the charge that the inflow of funds into his account was aimed at funding agitations like the one against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). He was charged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED arrested him from the Thiruvananthapuram international airport in December 2020 while he was allegedly attempting to flee abroad. Its counsel contended that the charges levelled against Rauf were serious.

13 February 2021||Bengaluru,||BJP serves notice on Yediyurappa critic||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that gave a long rope to dissenter MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has been openly critical of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and consistently broached the issue of leadership change, has finally cracked the whip and served him a show-cause notice. However, Mr. Yatnal, who has been suspended from the BJP twice earlier over similar charges to only later be re-inducted, has remained defiant. “I have not indulged in any anti-party activity. Yes, I have criticised people in my own party, saddenedthat the government in the State was moving away from the ideals and standards set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I have never apologised, expressed regret or retracted my statements,” he said. He repeated certain charges he had made against the Chief Minister, including that of inducting “blackmailers” into the Cabinet. He also reiterated that he only said a person from north Karnataka should become the Chief Minister and he would stick by it. “ Na dainyam, na palayanam... satyameva jayate ,” he said. Though several BJP leaders, including party State president Nalin Kumar Kateel, had said the national leadership was taking note and would act suitably against Mr. Yatnal, lack of any visible action or censure from the party had often triggered speculation that he had the backing of a section of the high command rooting for leadership change in the State. Report from State unit Arun Singh, general secretary in charge of party affairs in the State, who sought areport from the State unit on Mr. Yatnal at the recent Shivamogga State Executive meeting, played a key role in the disciplinary committee initiating action, party sources said. Post the submission of report from the State unit, Mr. Yatnal has actively involved himself in the Panchamasali agitation against the government seeking reservation under category 2-A of the OBC list and countered the Chief Minister in the Assembly, embarrassing both the party and the government. A report on the same was again sent to the high command, sources said. While the Chief Minister’s camp has claimed the recent Cabinet expansion and the show-cause notice to Mr. Yatnal were signs of the high command backing Mr. Yediyurappa, they are still cautious. “We are adopting a wait-and-watch approach, hoping the party takes it to the logical conclusion and takes action against Mr. Yatnal, especially since he has remained defiant even after being served the notice,” a senior leader close to the Chief Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-serves-notice-on-yediyurappa-critic/article33825934.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||A puppet master with a chip in the brain||When tradition meets modernity, the result can sometimes be amazing. A puppet with robotic movements may not sound very charming but in a melding of traditional art and cutting edge technology, a shadow leather puppet in Kerala’s famous temple art Tholpavakkoothu is being animated by a robot. For the first time, the famous shadow leather puppets will tell stories of the epic Ramayana with the help of robots. M. Lakshmana Pulavar and his son Sajeesh Pulavar from Harishree Kannan Tholpavakkoothu Kala Kendra, Koonathara, are set to animate their leather puppets using robotics with help from Inker Robotics, owned by Rahul Balachandran. The first robotic leather puppet was installed at the Palakkad District Heritage Museum, which was inaugurated by Minister for Museums Kadannappally Ramachandran, on Thursday. Although there is a wide variety of art and cultural symbols showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Palakkad at the museum, the shadow leather puppets installed at Navarasa zone-5 have been a big draw with visitors with their robotic movements. According to Lakshmana Pulavar, the most difficult part of Tholpavakkoothu is the limb movements of the puppets. These are now being controlled through robotics. “We have puppets in several museums across the country. But this is the first robotic leather puppet,” said Sajeesh Pulavar, who graduated from the NSS Engineering College in Palakkad. He has turned to Tholpavakkoothu full-time to preserve and promote the temple art form. “It was a dream come true for me,” said Mr. Sajeesh.

13 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Police to probe bid to ambush Customs chief||The police and the Customs department have launched separate inquiries into an attempt to waylay Customs Commissioner (Preventive) Sumit Kumar in Wayanad on Thursday. The incident has much political import given that Mr. Kumar heads multiple investigations into the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling scandal. The probe had extended to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office with the arrest of his former principal secretary M. Sivasankar on gold smuggling charges. The Customs had also questioned Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel as part of its probe into the import of dates by the UAE consulate. The investigation had also targeted the contraband gold trade in Kerala and resulted in scores of arrests and seizure of unaccounted money and gold.  Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that the incident occurred after he inaugurated a Customs preventive unit at Kalpetta in Wayanad. He was travelling in his official vehicle to Kozhikode. An anonymous vehicle had tailed his car for 24 km along the winding hilly road. It attempted to force Mr. Kumar’s car off the steep road. The vehicle had started shadowing his car from 1.30 p.m. onwards. It vanished after the Commissioner entered Kozhikode. On reaching Koduvally, the Customs department lodged a complaint with the police, following which a case was registered. The department has taken a case on the charge of endangering a Customs official. A preliminary investigation concluded that the registration plate of the vehicle was fake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-to-probe-bid-to-ambush-customs-chief/article33826200.ece
13 February 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Pawar reluctant to let Kerala NCP unit exit LDF||The plan of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Mani C. Kappan, MLA, to take the party's State unit out of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) following a row over the Pala Assembly seat appears to have hit a stumbling block following the reluctance shown by party president Sharad Pawar to the proposal. Sources said here that a discussion between Mr. Kappan and NCP State president T.P. Peethambaran with Mr. Pawar on Friday remained inconclusive and the Pala MLA was determined to go ahead with his plan to join the United Democratic Front (UDF). A formal announcement in this regard is expected on Sunday when a rally led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala enters Pala. “Mr. Pawar stood dispassionate about the idea of a coalition change and sought more time for hearing the other side led by Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran before taking a final decision. Mr. Kappan, however, is running out of time as he has already set the plan for sharing the stage with Mr. Chennithala on Sunday,” said an NCP leader. More to follow suit Besides Mr. Kappan, a handful of other leaders owing allegiance to him, including a few members of the party’s State committee and district committees in Alappuzha and Kottayam, are expected to follow suit. ‘Only 10% with Kappan’ The faction opposing Mr. Kappan said that less than 10% of the NCP members in Kerala would go with Mr. Kappan. “A few members of the NCP block committee in Pala, including its president Joshy Puthumana and some of Mr. Kappan’s family members, may leave the party,” said T.V. Baby, a member of the NCP State executive committee who owes allegiance to the Saseendran faction. Though the UDF leadership has unanimously offered the Pala Assembly seat to Mr. Kappan, whether he would join the Congress or contest as a UDF Independent is yet to be known.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sharad-pawar-reluctant-to-let-kerala-ncp-unit-exit-ldf/article33825941.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Not conceded any territory, says govt.||“The outstanding issues are to be taken up within 48 hours of the completion of the Pangong Tso disengagement,” the Ministry said. Stating that the assertion that the Indian territory is up to Finger 4 at Pangong Tso is categorically false, it said the territory of India is as depicted by the map of India and includes more than 43,000 sq km currently under illegal occupation of China since 1962. “That is why India has persistently maintained the right to patrol up to Finger 8, including in the current understanding with China,” it said. Permanent posts of both sides at the north bank of Pangong Tso are longstanding and well-established, the Ministry said. On the Indian side, it is Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3 and on the Chinese side, east of Finger 8. “The current agreement provides for cessation of forward deployment by both sides and continued deployment at these permanent posts,” it said. On the ongoing disengagement process, a defence official said India and China had put in place additional verification mechanisms to ensure that both sides adhere to the understanding reached for disengagement in Pangong Tso. This was done given the trust deficit and photography and videography are being done by both sides during withdrawal at each step and reported to their respective higher ups. The disengagement process is very slow and deliberate at each step, the official said. As the progress is under way, there is daily communication between local commanders directly and through the established hotline. The Ministry of External Affairs said the Defence Ministry statement had “set the record straight” on the issue. “This agreement was reached after several rounds of sustained negotiations at the military and diplomatic level,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava when asked about the timing of the disengagement announcement at Pangong Tso.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/not-conceded-any-territory-says-govt/article33825948.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||China causing mutual distrust, says Army chief||To set the score right and unleash the tremendous potential of the northeastern region, he said, there was a need to establish an organisation that can synergise multi-agency coordination and optimise resource and effort. The realigned strategy for the northeast proposed a robust and effective northeast integrated security council. Stressing regional connectivity, the Army chief said, “With failure to deliver on promises, delivery deficit has plagued our efforts at improving regional connectivity. The Kaladan multimodal transport project and the trilateral highway have both seen cost and time overruns.” The regional security environment was characterised by the Chinese “belligerence” in the Indo-Pacific, its hostility towards weaker nations and relentless drive to create regional dependencies through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The resultant Sino-U.S. rivalry had created regional imbalances and instability. “Nepal, our traditional long-term partner, which has witnessed heavy Chinese investment, is going through a period of political volatility,” he said. Gen. Naravane said most areas in the northeast had progressed towards conflict resolution and consequently, the Army had undertaken transition from counter insurgency (CI) to integrated CI approach. Based on the contemporary security situation, the entire NER was divided into pockets of least resistance, partial resistance and active resistance to roll out a phased disengagement plan of the Army from CI deployment. The red belt along the India-Myanmar border required a permanent Army and Assam Rifles grid for effective border management. The force calibration had resulted in the disengagement of 14 infantry battalions. “Two division headquarters, earlier part of the CI grid, are now solely focusing on their operational role along the northern borders. This has been a significant achievement. The operational responsibility of these areas has now been taken over by the Assam Rifles,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-causing-mutual-distrust-says-army-chief/article33825949.ece

The accident occurred at 1.30 p.m. at the unit in Achchankulam. Video footage of the accident circulated on social media shows fire crackers bursting and smoke visible from a distance, for a long while. Fire and Rescue Services personnel had to wait for long to enter the unit as the chemicals inside the factory kept bursting, according to Virudhunagar District Fire Officer K. Ganesan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about the accident, offering condolences, and announced an ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh for the families of each of those who died in the accident. An amount of Rs. 50,000 will be given to those seriously injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami condoled the deaths and announced a solatium of Rs. 3 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased from the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund. He ordered an inquiry into the incident. He also instructed District Collectors concerned to visit cracker-making units at regular intervals to ensure that safety parameters are met. He announced a compensation of Rs. 1 lakh to those who suffered serious injuries. In a statement, Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit said he was shocked and grieved to hear about the fire accident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/15-killed-in-cracker-unit-accident-in-tamil-nadu/article33825950.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Oppn. creating fake narrative on Budget’||“Despite obviously seen steps being taken for helping the poor and the needy of this country, a false narrative is created to accuse that the government works only for cronies,” Ms. Sitharaman said, while acknowledging that more needed to be done for the poor. The Finance Minister alleged that it was the Congress-led UPA government which promoted cronies. She then went on to list various achievements of the government. Pointing out that under the PM Awas Yojana, 1.67 crore houses had been constructed, while under the Saubhagya scheme, more than 2.67 crore households had been electrified, Ms. Sitharaman said, “Are these houses for cronies?” She added that while the Congress was desperate to prove its ownership of the scheme, it was riddled with problems. “You may have given birth to the scheme, but you left it in a mess. What we have done after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge — we removed all the ills of the scheme and effectively used it,” she said. Listing data, she said during the UPA era the government could not for a single year spend the money allocated under the scheme. Her government, she said, has in fact spent the highest ever on the scheme, with allocation of Rs. 90,500 crore so far. Ms Sitharaman said for 2020-21, the Budget Estimate was Rs. 61,500 crore for the scheme, which has been increased to Rs. 1,11,500 in the Revised Estimates. The Minister dedicated much of the time in countering senior Congress leader and former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram’s speech on Wednesday speech on the Budget. Referring to Mr. Chidambaram's remark that major numbers are suspect in the Budget, Ms. Sitharaman said it was the Congress finance minister who had artificially increased capex numbers during 2007-08 when UPA was ruling the country. “He talked about competence, I do not want competence to fudge the numbers.” Accusing the UPA government of issuing bonds to oil marketing companies and fertilizer manufacturers in lieu of cash subsidy to “make balance sheets attractive”, the Minister said, “Fake narratives were created... Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not depend on fudging.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oppn-creating-fake-narrative-on-budget/article33825951.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC seeks response on petition against Twitter||The Supreme Court on Friday decided to examine a plea that says the social media platform Twitter is “sympathetic to terrorist groups”. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the government and Twitter Communications India Private Ltd. on a petition by Vinit Goenka, a member of the Governing Council of CRIS, Ministry of Railways. Mr. Goenka accused platforms such as Twitter of promoting and circulating prohibited content and hate messages. He said there was no mechanism or law to deal with the problem. “Respondent 4 (Twitter) is sympathetic to terrorist groups... Global terror groups like ISIS, Al Qaeda and Indian Mujahideen use the platform of Respondent 4 (Twitter) and other social networking platforms to circulate hate speeches because it helps them avoid detection,” the petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, contended. An additional affidavit filed by Mr. Goenka on February 8 listed a series of recent incidents to buttress his case. He referred to how the Home Ministry had, on February 1, directed Twitter to block 250 handles “promoting fake and provocative content”. Mr. Goenka said the Delhi Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) had made a statement that 300 Twitter handles were generated from Pakistan between January 13 and 18 to organise the tractor rally to disrupt the Republic Day celebrations. Twitter “did not care to censor” these handles, the petition alleged. He said Twitter had deliberately blocked the handle of Home Minister Amit Shah. Mr. Goenka alleged that Mahima Kaul, Head, Public Policy of Twitter, had posted “undignified, vulgar and immodest tweets on February 14, 2014 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi”. ‘Law needed’ The petition said a mechanism or law needed to be put in place for social media accounts in order “to stop the hatred, fake, investigative and other news which are contrary to the law”. It said 10% each of the 35 million Twitter handles and 350 million Facebook accounts in India were bogus. Hundreds of fake Twitter handles and Facebook accounts used the names, of constitutional authorities and eminent citizens. Fake news was the root cause of many riots, including the recent riots in Delhi. Political parties and candidates used fake social media accounts for self-promotion and image building and to tarnish rivals, the petition said. “Anti-national tweets should not just be deleted, but such accounts should be discontinued,” it stated. They should be used as proof that people have indulged in anti-national activities in India or abroad, the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-seeks-reply-on-plea-stating-twitter-is-used-for-hate-speech/article33825978.ece

13 February 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul accuses PM Modi of ‘cowardice’||A day after the Union government announced that India and China had reached an agreement on disengagement at the Eastern Ladakh border, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “cowardice” and “giving away Indian territory to China”. On Thursday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh informed Parliament that Indian and Chinese troops had agreed on disengagement on both sides of the Pangong Tso (lake) in a “phased, coordinated and verified manner”. At a press conference at the party headquarters, Mr. Gandhi said the Indian territory was up to Finger 4 in the Pangong area where the Indian post used to be located, but now the government had moved back to Finger 3. It was China that could claim success, as Mr. Modi had “handed over a portion of Bharat Mata [Mother India] to them”. “Why has Prime Minister Modi given up Indian territory to the Chinese? This is the question that needs to be answered by him and the Defence Minister,” he stressed and charged Mr. Modi with “betraying the sacrifices of our Army”. While the Army, the Air Force and the Navy were ready to take on China, the Prime Minister was not. The forces had “risked everything they had to capture” the Kailash range but the government had now asked them to move back without spelling out “for what”, he said. Most important, the Chinese were still in strategically important areas such as the Depsang Plains, Gogra, Hot Springs, he said, and questioned the Defence Minister for “not uttering a word about these areas”. “It is absolutely 100% cowardice to give our holy land. The Prime Minister is a coward who cannot stand up to the Chinese. That’s the fact, and he is spitting on the sacrifice of our Army,” he alleged. Lauds armed forces Accompanied by the Congress’s Lok Sabha leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, and party general secretaries K.C. Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala, Mr. Gandhi lauded the efforts of the armed forces in protecting the borders. “None in India” should be allowed to undermine them, he said. “I think the people should be enraged. I am surprised the press is behaving the way it is. You [the press] have a responsibility to raise these things,” he said. He had full faith in the capability of the armed forces, he said. “It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to protect the territory of this country. He has ceded Indian territory to the Chinese. It’s his responsibility to solve it,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-accuses-pm-of-cowardice/article33825958.ece

13 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CPI decides not to field three-timers for polls||The CPI State council has decided not to field party workers who have contested three Assembly elections this time. It means incumbent legislators and Ministers are unlikely to contest the upcoming polls. They purportedly include C. Divakaran, Mullakkara Retnakaran, E.S. Bijimol, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar, Forest Minister K. Raju and Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman. However, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, who was in the fray only twice, might make the cut. The CPI has also banned persons holding organisational positions from contesting. If asked to compete by party committees, they would require to relinquish their organisational responsibility. It means that the CPI is unlikely to field any of its key State and district-level functionaries. CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran, who chaired the council on Friday, said candidate selection would reflect the generational shift, demographic changes, and political currents that spurred the LDF to victory in the local body polls. The vote was for the party and not the individual. When pressed about friction in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) about yielding the Pala seat to the Kerala Congress (M), Mr. Rajendran said LDF constituents must forgo some of their seats to allow electoral space for new allies. The LDF would not shut the door on the NCP. The media should stop goading incumbent Pala legislator and NCP leader Mani. C. Kappan into striking out on the wrong path, he said. Sabarimala issue Mr. Rajendran said the Congress’s Sabarimala Bill was a trick to deceive devotees. A larger Supreme Court Bench was reviewing the 2018 majority decision allowing women of all age groups to worship at the temple. The LDF affidavit proposed a panel of Hindu pandits to decide faith-related matters. Sabarimala was not an election issue. Neither the Congress nor the BJP has a serious campaign plank. They are prosecuting a recriminatory campaign low on substance against the LDF, he said. The Centre’s infringement on federalism by denying States their share of the tax revenue was the central plank of the LDF campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpi-decides-not-to-field-three-timers-for-polls/article33826229.ece

The final-year Computer Science and Engineering students, Navin Sridhar and V. Kamalnath, were selected from over five lakh participants from engineering colleges across the country. They passed rigorous technical online tests conducted by the innovation cell of the Union Education Ministry and got through interviews to represent the country at the event, held virtually from February 1 to 3. They were selected from over 1,000 shortlisted teams. Mr. Sridhar’s team included one student each from Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia, besides three others from India. The Vietnamese national could not participate in the last minute. The team was asked to find a solution to prevent cheating and impersonation in online tests that are not proctored. Mr. Kamalnath’s team had to provide a solution to the problem of fishing boat activity. Countries often rely on self-reporting by fishermen to identify their positions in the sea, and this does not help Asian countries where thousands of smaller boats are operated. The team included six members, including four Indians and two students from Myanmar. Each student received Rs. 2 lakh as prize. The Asean-India hackathon was organised by the All-India Council for Technical Education and the Ministry of Education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-students-from-city-college-win-asean-india-hackathon/article33826524.ece

The colourful 9 km phase I extension stretch will be open for the public from Sunday, with trains running every five minutes. According to officials of the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the stations were designed by ensuring that they do not obstruct the traffic flow through the dense areas. They said they attempted to design the stations keeping in mind the cultural attributes of the areas. “The exteriors of the stations are designed artistically to add to the travel experience. Two types of graphic patterns have been provided throughout the line to break the monotony of the corridor running parallel to the Tiruvottiyur High Road. The shades of blue and white used in the elevated stations are inspired by CMRL’s logo,” an official said. Since the stations will serve as landmarks, their exteriors have been given a vibrant look, he said. “Several colours have been used below the buildings to create a positive environment throughout the medians as well. All structural elements are painted in different colours to enable people living in the vicinity to identify the stations easily,” he added. LED lights have been used in the signage so that passengers can identify stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-stations-on-the-north-line-sport-vibrant-designs/article33826528.ece
13 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anna varsity’s property mired in legal wrangle||A property owned by Anna University is now at the centre of a legal battle — spread across an acre, opposite the Kotturpuram gate and adjacent to the university’s residential quarters, it was going to be used for professional development activities of the varsity. The university had signed an MoU with the Indian Society for Technical Education on September 4, 1992, to that effect. The professional centre was to be managed by the Tamil Nadu section of the society, with Anna University nominating two representatives, who are also members of the ISTE. They were to be part of the managing committee. But nothing happened since the signing of the MoU and in 1995, the university’s 157th syndicate decided to take possession of the land. With the Vice-Chancellors remaining in power for just three years, the resolution, too, was not implemented. In the early 2000s, buildings came up on the premises, though not for the intended purposes. At this juncture, ISTE laid claim to the property. Cases languished as the university did not contest the claim. In March 2020, the case was revived and the court threw out ISTE’s claim. The court chided the university for not taking any action. It granted possession of the property to the university. Court’s judgment Armed with the judgment, the university filed a complaint, demanding that A. Kalanithi, its former Vice-Chancellor, who had filed an affidavit declaring himself the authorised signatory for ISTE, remove his belongings from the premises. He had occupied it illegally, the varsity’s complaint said. The case is coming up for hearing on February 16, sources said. The ISTE, on its part, has asked the university to honour the MoU.  In the early 2000s, buildings came up on the premises, though not for the intended purposes.

13 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rain hits the arrival of watermelons to city||The Koyambedu wholesale market has started receiving watermelons, heralding summer. But wholesalers note that only half the usual load has arrived at the market this year due to rain last month in producing areas. Instead of the usual 50-55 trucks that bring watermelon to the market around this time, only up to 30 truckloads, mainly from Telangana and Karnataka, have arrived. P. Sudhakaran, a watermelon wholesaler, said the fruits were now being sold at Rs. 13-Rs. 15 a kg. “It may take another 10 days for produce from areas such as Tindivanam and Melmaruvathur to reach the city. But there may not be much difference in the wholesale price,” he added. Similarly, muskmelons are also in short supply and are being priced at Rs. 20 a kg due to January rains. “Most traders are not doing brisk business as there is low demand from juice stalls this year due to the pandemic. We expect sales to pick up around April,” said S. Srinivasan, president, Chennai Fruits Commission Agents’ Association. The vegetables and fruits wholesale trade in Koyambedu has been affected as some wholesalers are yet to return even after the market’s reopening. Associations have also represented to the government to allow wholesale trade only in Koyambedu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-hits-the-arrival-of-watermelons-to-city/article33826526.ece
13 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Admission to PG courses impossible, says AICTE||The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) on Friday told the Madras High Court that it is “practically impossible” to permit Anna University to admit students to M. Tech (Biotechnology) and M. Tech (Computational Biology) for the academic year 2020-21 since the cut-off date for admissions had expired on December 31. Appearing before Justice B. Pugalendhi, who was seized of the petitions filed by aspiring candidates to the two prestigious courses, AICTE counsel Rabu Manohar said that only the Supreme Court could extend the cut-off date. But Special Government Pleader E. Manohar, representing the State government, contended that the AICTE had no role to play in the admissions. The students could be admitted this year by creating nine more supernumerary posts, if required, and by following the State’s 69% reservation policy, he said. Advocate Vijayakumar, for Anna University, said there was no necessity for the university to approach the Supreme Court for extension of the cut-off date. The AICTE itself could grant it. He sought time till Monday for reporting the progress. The judge accepted his submission after expressing displeasure over the university having created so much of trouble just because it was unable to decide whether to follow the Centre’s 49.5% reservation or the State’s 69% reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/admission-to-pg-courses-impossible-says-aicte/article33826549.ece

13 February 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Some advocates are looked on as rowdies and third-rate criminals: HC||Coming down heavily on an advocate who took more than 10 years to vacate a rented property and made his landlord run from pillar to post to get him evicted, the Madras High Court has said: “some of the advocates are nowadays looked at as rowdies and third-rate criminals by public because of conduct similar to the one of the tenant in this case.” In his stinging order advising other lawyers not to defend such “deceitful” advocates, Justice S. Vaidyanathan wrote: “An advocate, who happens to be a tenant, should be a gentleman and should vacate the premises within 30 days if a request is made by the landlord. If that happens, a lawyer will get a house on rent even without a written agreement.” The judge went on to state: “It is painful to say that many of the advocates are involved in land grabbing and if the antecedent of the petitioner (V.K. Kumaresan of Vellore) is verified, he may also be one of the land grabbers. The tenant has scant regard for the orders of the court, and he has portrayed a sadistic attitude.” Terming the petitioner as a “wicked, dishonest and unprincipled person,” the court directed the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP) to conduct an inquiry against him on a day-to-day basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/some-advocates-are-looked-on-as-rowdies-and-third-rate-criminals-hc/article33826751.ece

But Kala did not deliver on the promise. The manpower consultant preferred a complaint about this and Thamim demanded Rs. 20,000 for registering an FIR. An amount of Rs. 5,000 had already been paid.

13 February 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||New challenges await Corpn. on D.B. Road||As the Coimbatore Corporation looks at a February 28 deadline to throw open to traffic the D.B. Road in R.S. Puram, it is set to face challenges, some of which are those it set out to address before executing the model road project. The Corporation under the Smart Cities Mission has taken up work to redesign the 1.80 km road at Rs. 24.36 crore by providing utility ducts, widened platforms and other pedestrian-friendly facility. The civic body that was supposed to have completed the project in four to six months in 2017, suspended it and resumed work with a new design in 2018. The challenges that the Corporation is set to face are evident in that stretch of the road where it had completed work and thrown it open to traffic. The first of those is parking. In the absence of regulation, road users continue to park vehicles, both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, the way they did prior to the start of the model road project. With the carriage way reduced to 14m, the space available for vehicle movement has reduced as parking is unregulated, says a road user. The absence of regulation is also hindering the movement of customers, and carrying of goods to shops, rues a shopkeeper. As per the model road project proposal, the Corporation is supposed to provide on-street parking by clearly delineating parking space. And, road users are supposed to park vehicles parallel to the street. The shopkeeper says it remains to be seen if the monthly alternate parking system will return to D.B. Road after the Corporation completes the work. Another issue is that of street vendors. Though the Corporation has built the pavements wide enough to accommodate street vendors, it has not earmarked space for them and this in itself could lead to encroachment of the pavement, fear the shopkeepers. Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon says the benefit of the Rs. 24.36 crore investment the Corporation has made depends on its ability to work closely with the Coimbatore City Traffic Police to regulate traffic and parking and prevent encroachment of pavements. If the Corporation failed to regulate street vendors, shopkeepers will encroach upon the space in front of their establishments, the street vendors the other side of the pavements, forcing pedestrians on to the road. This will be undoing of the project, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-challenges-await-corpn-on-db-road/article33826553.ece

Many textile processing units involved in dyeing, bleaching and other processing are located in B.P. Agraharam, Periyasemoor and Soolai in the corporation limits that continue to discharge untreated effluents into the canal that finally enter River Cauvery. Residents and environmentalists were demanding a permanent solution to the issue. On Friday, residents noticed the change of colour of the water in the canal from black to red and alerted the officials. Later, TNPCB officials and police personnel inspected the canal and found dyeing effluents in bags dumped under the bridge at Thanneer Pandal Palayam which led to the colour change. Officials said that an inquiry would be conducted to identify the unit from where the effluents were dumped in the canal. Last week, 30 processing units in Vendipalayam that were discharging effluents into the Kalingarayan Canal were sealed by the officials. But, the seals of seven units were broken and they continue to function. Members of Kalingarayan Pasana Sabai had threatened to stage a protest demanding action against the unit owners. Hence, on Thursday, Erode Revenue Divisional Officer Saibudeen in the presence of Modakurichi MLA V.P. Sivasubramani held talks with the Sabai representatives.

13 February 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Power loom owners halt production seeking regulation of yarn price||With 30,000 power loom units involved in producing rayon fabrics halting production from February 11 to 21 in the district, power loom owners want yarn price to be controlled and necessary steps taken to encourage export. Of the 55,000 units in the district, unit owners in Erode, Chithode, Lakkapuram and Veerappanchatiram halted production as they claim that regular increase in price of yarn is causing them a loss of Rs. 5 per metre. They said that about 24 lakh metres of rayon fabric produced in these units everyday were halted affecting over 50,000 workers directly and indirectly. On Friday, the price of yarn was Rs. 215 a kg that was Rs. 150 a kg in November, 2020. B. Kandavel, coordinator, Tamil Nadu Federation of Power Loom Association, said that production of Rs. 7.5 crore worth fabrics were affected everyday and wanted the price of yarn to be fixed once in a month. “The raw material cost (yarn) is very high in the country and hence we were unable to compete both domestically and globally”, he said and wanted the Central government to import yarn from neighbouring countries. Countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh were able to sell their produce at low price globally whereas we were unable to market our products due to high production cost. “The government should not levy anti-dumping duty on yarn imports so that increase in supply will bring down the price of yarn”, he said and wanted steps to be taken to boost export.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/power-loom-owners-halt-production-seeking-regulation-of-yarn-price/article33826096.ece

Interacting with journalists after distributing welfare assistance to people at Kullampalayam village in Gobichettipalayam, the Minister, however, said the issue was under consideration, but no decision had so far been taken. “You should decide whether two teachers are needed for a school with less than 10 students,” he said and added that the government had to consider the expenses incurred towards maintaining such schools and paying salaries to the teachers.

13 February 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||Ahead of Valentine’s Day, Hosur’s rose exports hit all-time low||Hosur’s rose exports have seen a steep fall, pushing flower exports down to just 15 lakh cut flowers this Valentine’s season. This represents an 80% fall in exports, say Hosur’s flower growers. “A good year’s exports range between 50 lakh and 70 lakh roses. This year, we have exported just 15 lakh,” said Bala Siva Prasad, president, Hosur Small Farmers’ Association. Many factors have contributed to the steep fall in exports, with the obvious one being the pandemic. The roses are exported primarily to Singapore, Malaysia and west Asian countries, including Lebanon and Kuwait. European markets include the U.K. Other global markets for Hosur’s roses, such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the Philippines, are closed to exports. The sporadic lockdowns in the main European markets due to emerging COVID-19 strains had dampened Valentine’s Day celebrations in those markets, Mr. Prasad said. In addition to this, the non-resumption of connecting flights to the European markets and the increase in cargo handling charges due to the pandemic had made exports unviable this year. “The increase in cargo handling charges is in the ratio of 1:4. If it costed Rs. 100 a cargo earlier, it is Rs. 400 now. But the export price per stem is Rs. 12 to Rs. 13, the same as in the domestic market as of Wednesday,” Mr. Prasad said. This had disincentivised farmers from pitching their flowers for exports. Restricted markets abroad have pushed farmers to bank on the domestic market, albeit with local constraints. Besides, this year, the area of production in Hosur was scaled down to 1,000 acres from the usual 1,500 acres. “Over 500 acres were not cultivated because farmers did not have the capital due to the impact of COVID-19,” Mr. Prasad said. The Valentine’s Day production cycle sees farmers reinvesting the profits made during the October-November season of muhurtams . This year, the pandemic undercut grand muhurtams, slashing profits. All these factors significantly affected production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ahead-of-valentines-day-hosurs-rose-exports-hit-all-time-low/article33826540.ece

A special orientation for volunteers on the transect walk in the forest and the ways of enumeration of wildlife was held here at the Cattle Farm in Mathigiri on Friday. The enumeration would entail and inferring the presence of wildlife and also the biodiversity of the forests that include diversity of flora. According to the forest department, Hosur forest division is made of 121 reserve forests spread over 1,501 sq.mt making up 29% of Krishnagiri district surface area. The wildlife census is being undertaken in 504 sq.mt area. The forests here host elephants, leopards, bears, Indian Gaur, spotted deer, and peacocks. The forests are rich for its flora that includes Sandal, Teak, Rosewood among other trees Earlier, speaking at the orientation programme, Conservator of Forests, Dharmapuri division, Deepak S. Bilgi, said, the exercise would estimate the wildlife population by interpretation and extrapolation. It would map the trends, less by animal sightings and literal counting, which are rare, but through indirect evidences. The volunteers were also to look out for new species, which can end up in reports that map the landscape and its biodiverse flora and fauna. Stating that the Hosur forest division was one of the prestigious forest divisions in Tamil Nadu, with rich wildlife presence, Mr. Bilgi urged the volunteers “to experience the habitat to understand what kind of habitat animals live in, where do they drink water etc,” during the census, which is a “serious exercise.” The census is being carried with the support of non-profit organisations such as the Kenneth Anderson Nature Society, Tamil Nadu Butterfly Society, Coimbatore, World Wildlife Fund, and corporate entities such as the Titan Industries.

13 February 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||Recite Thirukkural and get a litre of petrol free||Poet-saint Thiruvalluvar’s masterpiece Thirukkural could teach you sublime life lessons but at the ground level, it can also fetch you a litre of free petrol now in Karur if the children in your family know at least 20 of the 1,330 couplets of the Tamil classic by heart. A fuel station owner at Nagapampalli near Karur has been offering half a litre of petrol free to customers whose kids recite 10 couplets of Thirukkural. If they recite 20 couplets, they get a litre free. Introduced on Thiruvallavur Day last month, the offer at the fuel station named after Valluvar, will run till April end. The offer is open to students of classes I to XI who are required to be accompanied by their parents. They should submit in writing the couplets that they plan to recite. A participant can enter the contest multiple times but must recite different couplets each time. The idea behind the novel offer, conceptualised by K. Senguttuvan, owner of the petrol station and chairman of the Valluvar College of Science and Management, is to encourage students read Thirukkural. “First, the reading habit is on the decline among students. And reading Thirukkural could help bring about a focus among students. I want students to grow with Thirukkural; but this needs some encouragement. Hence I came up with the idea,” says Mr. Senguttuvan explaining the intent. The love for Thirukkural runs in the family of Mr. Senguttuvan. His father, Karuppiah, had named his electrical store after Valluvur, way back in 1960. The shop at Paramthi Velur is still run by his brother. “My father showed us how to live by the values of Thiruvalluvar. Nobody who lived by those ideals have failed. Those who followed the path shown by Thirukkural will enjoy a life of fulfilment,” says Mr. Senguttuvan who also runs a hotel named after Valluvar in Karur. Students too seem to relish the contest. “I enjoyed reciting the kurals, some of which I had learnt in my school,” said S. Dhivani, a Class VI student of the Panchayat Union Elementary School, Malaikovilur, who recited 10 couplets. Her father, Selvaraj, termed the offer useful which has kindled the interest of students. Till Thursday, 147 students have availed the offer, according to Mr. Senguttuvan. “Though the price of petrol is nearing Rs. 90 a litre, I don’t mind. I want the students to imbibe the spirit of Thirukkural,” he says. Mr. Senguttuvan is planning a follow up programme for the participants at his college later so as to continue their learning of Thirukkural. Mr. Senguttuvan also runs a scholarship scheme for undergraduate students in the Valluvar College of Science and Management under which students who recite all the 1,330 couplets of Thirukkural are offered fee waiver for all three years. The only condition – the beneficiaries should visit villages for two Sundays every month to teach Thirukkural to rural students. Over the past five years, about 15 students have availed of the scholarship, he claims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/recite-thirukkural-and-get-a-litre-of-petrol-free/article33826111.ece

Mr. Senguttuvan also runs a scholarship scheme for undergraduate students at Valluvar College of Science and Management under which students who recite all the 1,330 couplets of Thirukkural are offered fee waiver for all three years. The only condition – the beneficiaries should visit villages for two Sundays every month to teach Thirukkural to rural students. Over the past five years, about 15 students have availed the scholarship, he claims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/recite-20-thirukkural-couplets-for-a-litre-of-petrol/article33826048.ece
13 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Madurai Malli’ turns dearer||Poor yield of ‘Madurai Malli’ (a variety of jasmine) in the district, mainly due to cold weather, has increased its price to a maximum of Rs. 1,200 a kg. Usually, the yield improves in February but there is no such improvement this year, say farmers. It is cultivated in Tirupparankundram, Chellampatti, Usilampatti, Tirumangalam and Kallikudi blocks in the district. Jasmine grows between February and November, says N. Jegatheesan, president of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who is involved in its export. The yield is lower during from December to January due to cold weather but it picks up in February. But, this year, there has been an unusual weather pattern as early mornings in February are cold,’ he says. S. Ramachandran, president of a flower vendors’ association at Mattuthavani flower market, says the market used to receive 5 to 10 tonnes of jasmine in February. ‘But, we received only around 0.5 tonne of jasmine on Friday morning.’ K.Sasikumar, a farmer, says that farmers are able to get a yield of only two kg of jasmine from an acre of land. ‘This year, there was an unseasonal monsoon as there was rain in the district till mid January. This affected growth of the crop.’ Some farmers started cultivating other crops due to losses in the wake of lockdown, says Prasanna Ramachandran, a member of ‘Madurai Malli’ Development and Production Trust. ‘With closure of markets and poor demand for jasmine during the lockdown, many farmers faced severe losses. So, some farmers chose to cultivate other crops.’ Many farmers failed to maintain their fields due to the uncertainty during the lockdown, says Mr. Sasikumar. ‘It has affected the yield. Farmers are expecting improvement in the yield at least from March onwards.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madurai-malli-turns-dearer/article33826628.ece
13 February 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Suspect found dead||K. Kannan, 43, of Tirupparankundram, a temporary sanitary worker, who was interrogated in connection with a recent theft of 56 sovereigns of jewellery, was found dead in his house on Friday. His family members alleged that police torture during the interrogation on Wednesday and Thursday had forced him to take the extreme step. In a video clipping, his son Karuppasamy is seen narrating how the police allegedly tortured him. Henry Tiphange, executive director of People’s Watch, a Madurai-based NGO, said that his office received a representation from family members on Thursday about “illegal detention” of Kannan. “After we sent an online intimation to Madurai City Police, he was let off yesterday,” he said. Stating that his body had an injury on the face, he said it was a clear evidence o police torture. “Judicial magistrate should conduct an enquiry under Section 176 (1) (a) as the death was due to police torture,” he said. Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha said that Kannan was one among some suspects who were enquired in connection with the theft case. “The closed circuit television camera at the scene of crime had shown two persons, who were sanitary workers. Sanitary Inspector was asked to tell them to appear before the police for enquiry,” he said. Since Kannan was talking something about the theft, the police enquired him. Denying that there was any torture by the police, he said the post-mortem report will reveal the facts. Meanwhile, the body was taken to the Government Rajaji Hospital. Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s helpline 104 and 044-24640050||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suspect-found-dead/article33826630.ece

13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||Mullaperiyar dam protected from quakes, says T.N. govt.||The Mullaperiyar dam is protected from earthquakes and is hydrologically safe, the Tamil Nadu government has assured the Supreme Court. Countering Kerala’s allegations of non-cooperation and lack of concern for the safety of the 126-year-old dam, Tamil Nadu accused Kerala of “obstructionist attitude”. ‘Permission denied’ The State said the installation of instruments to protect the dam structure and warn about dangers to the Earth Dam and the Baby Dam had been in limbo since 2015. This was solely because Kerala’s Forest Department had refused permission to cut 23 trees. A Bench, led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, on Friday adjourned the hearing to March 2. The Centre agreed to file a response in respect of the spat between the two States over the dam’s maintenance and safety. In an affidavit, Tamil Nadu said seismographic instruments suggested by expert bodies like the Central Water Commission (CWC) and the National Geophysical Research Institute to warn about earthquakes were “proposed to be installed soon”. “It is pertinent to point out here that the dam is found to be safe against earthquakes,” it said. Noting that the dam was found to be hydrologically safe, Tamil Nadu said it was “designed to route a probable maximum flood discharge of 2.12 lakh cusecs fixed by the CWC and found to be safe for that flood condition”. “The Maximum Water Level of the dam is +155 ft, against the maximum permitted storage level of +142 ft,” Tamil Nadu said. The State further complained that Kerala had, since 2014, obstructed collection of rainfall data from the Mullaikodi rainfall station, the only rainfall station in the catchments.  ‘Old reports’ Tamil Nadu contended that the reports relied on by Kerala to accuse Tamil Nadu of negligence were over two decades old and outdated. In January, Kerala had accused Tamil Nadu of adopting an “obsolete” gate operation schedule, which dates back to 1939. In its affidavit, Kerala informed the court of the CWC’s inspection report that said 70% of the installed instruments for monitoring the dam’s safety and health were not working properly. It said Tamil Nadu was yet to install the two seismic accelerographs recommended to monitor tremors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mullaperiyar-dam-is-hydrologically-safe/article33826085.ece
13 February 2021||P. SudhakarTIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||26,868 birds sighted in Tamirabharani Waterbird Count||As many as 26,868 birds belonging to 73 domestic and migratory species have been spotted during the recently held 11th edition of Tamirabharani Waterbird Count (TWC 2021) in 62 irrigation tanks in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts. It was organised by Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre (ACCC), Manimutharu; District Science Centre, Tirunelveli; Pearl City Nature Society, Thoothukudi; and Nellai Nature Club, Tirunelveli; on January 30 and 31. A day earlier, an orientation programme was held for the 120 volunteers - students, farmers, entrepreneurs, homemakers and physicians from across the State. They were divided into seven teams to conduct the count in 62 tanks in the three districts. Ten new tanks were added this year in Tenkasi district. Of the 26,868 birds sighted, there were over 4,300 Lesser Whistling Duck, 4,200 Cattle Egret. Among the migratory bird species, 1,398 Whiskered Tern, 1,343 Eurasian Wigeon, 1,223 Garganey, 1,019 Northern Pintail were recorded. A good number of birds were recorded in Vellur tank where 3,578 birds belonging to 30 species were spotted which was followed by Surandai tank where 2,566 from 33 species were sighted. Manur tank with 1,627 birds (30 species), Sundarapandiapuram tank with 1,250 birds (19 species), Vagaikulam tank with 1,193 birds (30) and Arumugamangalam tank with 1,130 birds of 27 species accounted for the major numbers. While Asian Open-Bill, Oriental Darter, Little Cormorant, Indian Shag and Black-headed Ibis breeding colonies were recorded in Gangaikondan tank, a good number of Oriental Darter breeding colonies with chicks were recorded in Nainarkulam in Tirunelveli Town, in the heart of the city. Black-tailed Godwits, a migratory bird from Siberia, was seen in Sengulam near Mukkoodal and Kalkurichikulam near Thazhaiyoothu and it has been categorized as ‘near-threatened species’ in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s ‘Red List,’ said M. Mathivanan, Senior Research Associate of ATREE’s ACCC, who coordinated the census. Bar-headed geese, a migratory bird from Mangolia and known to be one of the highest flying bird species, were seen in Veppankulam in Sivanthipatti. Volunteer Sankar, who participated in TWC 2020, included this tank for census based on his year-long observation. Sivanthipatti tank “The Sivanthipatti tank and grasslands around it support diverse flora and fauna. The district administration should protect the entire site,” said Mr. Mathivanan. The numbers were less this year as heavy rains in January resulted in overflowing of almost all irrigation tanks in the three districts. For instance, Tirunelveli district received 350 mm rainfall in January. With the majority of the tanks that were covered in census brimming with water, the birds flew to the tanks with less water, but were not covered in the census plan. Since the depth of water even in the periphery of the tanks is also high, very few birds could be seen near the shoreline. Mostly polluted “Most of the tanks we visited remain polluted. There were garbage, liquor bottles, plastic sachets, use-and-throw plastic items and old clothes which were discarded after a holy dip. The Venthankulam tank, which was desilted by a citizen group ahead of 2019 northeast monsoon and consequently attracted a large number of birds even for breeding last year, has been seriously polluted. It has become a hangout for anti-social elements at night. The tank is also used for open defecation by passengers coming to the recently created temporary bus terminus,” said Mr. Mathivanan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/26868-birds-sighted-in-waterbird-count/article33826087.ece
13 February 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||EC planning simultaneous elections in T.N., Puducherry||The Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will be held simultaneously, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora said on Friday. Addressing a press conference after winding up his two-day visit to Puducherry along with other officials of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to assess preparedness for the polls, he said the political parties in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry had sought simultaneous elections. “The dates will be announced later. The elections will be held in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on the same day,” he said. On the issue of nominated legislators, the CEC said the matter had been settled by the Supreme Court. “The petitioners are free to approach the court again,” he added. When asked to comment on the proposal made by a few parties to boycott the election till Statehood was granted to Puducherry, Mr. Arora said such decisions were also part of democracy. “The Commission is committed to holding free and fair elections. There will be zero tolerance towards attempts by parties to provide inducements in the form of cash, liquor and other freebies,” he said. Mr. Arora said that during a meeting with police and excise officials, he had directed them to curtail the movement of arrack and liquor from Puducherry to Tamil Nadu. The issue of smuggling arrack from the Union Territory was taken up with the Commission by law enforcement agencies in Tamil Nadu during an interaction in Chennai. The number of polling booths has gone up from 789 to 1,330 in Puducherry, and from 163 to 234 in Karaikal. Mr. Arora also released a book, titled SVEEP (Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation) Activities. He flagged off a vehicle to create awareness among the voters of the verifiability, transparency and accountability of VVPAT (Voter-verified paper audit trail) in the election and also provide a hands-on experience to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ec-planning-simultaneous-elections-in-tn-puducherry/article33826543.ece

Governor Kiran Bedi’s direction to the Chief Vigilance Officer to examine the disbursements from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Friday said Ms. Bedi should first reveal the details of the fund utilised by the Raj Nivas. Addressing a press conference, the Chief Minister said there was no irregularity in the allocations made from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, and hence, any agency was free to conduct a probe. “Let Ms. Bedi make public the utilisation of funds by the Raj Nivas, and then I will do the same. The Raj Nivas incurs an expenditure of Rs. 8 crore annually. I will also write to the Chief Vigilance Officer seeking a probe, as there are allegations of misuse of the money collected for the Corporate Social Responsibility programme. The President has been apprised of the issue,” he said. On the Lt. Governor’s decision to postpone the inaugural of the renovated Mairie Building as the Centre’s representative was not involved in the opening ceremony, he said the funds for the project were sourced from the World Bank. “It is not the Centre’s money. The Centre was only a facilitator. She acted with vendetta as her name was not on the invite list,” he said. The foundation for the reconstruction of the building was laid during his government’s time, he said adding as Chief Minister and chairman of the State Disaster Management Authority he had to the right choose the invitees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/let-l-g-make-money-utilised-by-raj-nivas-public-narayanasamy/article33826548.ece

13 February 2021||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Human error suspected to have caused the blasts||Was it an act of desperation fuelled by hunger or anger that claimed 15 lives and critically injured 10 others at Sree Mariyammal Fireworks near here? That is the question investigators were asking late on Friday. As per the statement of Manikandan, a cargo vehicle driver in the unit, one of the workers, identified as Gopal, had suddenly dumped a heap of dried chemicals that triggered the blasts. “It was 1.20 p.m. We all had completed our work,” he said. Some 20 persons were working under the trees outside the workshed, he said. Then, one of the workers had asked the contractor Akka whether they could go for lunch. Pointing out that a few more pieces had to be completed, she asked them to share the work before leaving for lunch. As per his account, some semi-finished goods, raw materials and black fuses were dumped all over. Even as seven persons, including some women, got ready to complete the task, Gopal was shifting the semi-finished goods. As he brought the goods towards the workers, the contractor  asked him to spread them out on the mat. “I don’t know whether he did it playfully or out of anger or hunger. He suddenly pushed them, and this triggered the fire,” said Mr. Manikandan, who is being treated at the Sivakasi Government Hospital. He said some able-bodied persons ran and took cover. Thereafter, there was a series of blasts in different worksheds in the unit, for which Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) has issued a licence. Though officials said the licence was issued in the name of one Santhanamari, PESO officials found that the premises had been sub-leased to three or four persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/human-error-suspected-to-have-caused-the-blasts/article33826066.ece

13 February 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers wary of govt.’s loan waiver procedure||The procedure to be adopted by borrowers to avail themselves of the benefits of the Rs. 12,100 crore crop loan waiver scheme has caused concern among a section of farmers, who fear it might affect their chances of availing loans in future. Soon after the scheme was announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, a circular was sent to the cooperative societies directing them to collect the Aadhaar numbers, copies of voter identification cards and other documents from the borrowers to ensure that the benefit reached the correct person. Officials contend that the move to seek such documents was intended to ascertain whether a farmer had taken multiple loans or not. But some tenant farmers fear that it could lead to a situation wherein they might not be able to avail themselves of loans in future. Pointing out that almost half the number of cultivators in the Delta region were tenant farmers, G.Sethuraman, president, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Nalasangam, said such farmers might have entered into lease agreements with landlords or religious institutions or trusts having landholdings in different villages or under different survey numbers in the same village. Hitherto, they used to avail themselves of crop loans from the cooperative institutions by producing “adangal” – a document issued by the village administrative officers stating that so and so had taken up cultivation on a particular survey number falling under the land records of the hamlet. Suspecting that insistence of Aadhaar number to get the benefits of the current scheme might be a prelude to “One Aadhaar, one crop loan” system in future, Mr. Sethuraman feared that such a decision would sound the death knell for the landless tenant farmers or tiny farmers. Stating that crop loan disbursement through cooperative institutions had already turned murkier, P. Sugumaran, joint secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers’ Protection Association, observed that any reforms aimed at streamlining the financial support to the agricultural sector should be implemented in such a manner that the interests of tenant, small and marginal farmers were not affected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-wary-of-govts-loan-waiver-procedure/article33826075.ece

13 February 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||BDU for fresh notification to fill 54 teaching posts||Having decided to withdraw its appeal in the High Court requesting consent to fill 54 teaching posts under the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers Cadre) Act, 2019, whereby the entire institution is treated as a single unit, the Bharathidasan University will, in due course, issue a fresh notification for the recruitment, reliable sources said. The universit’s decision comes after the High Court expunged remarks made by a single judge against the Higher Education Secretary last December while quashing a recruitment notification. The State Government, it is learnt, will be issuing a fresh order based on which the notification for recruitment will be issued, according to university sources. The government order will clearly specify the basis for recruitment - whether the entire institution or individual department must be considered as a unit for the purpose of reservation. According to senior professors in BDU, the time is now too short for carrying out the recruitment process. The process will come to a grinding halt once the Election Commission issues a notification for the Assembly polls. In all likelihood, the process will gather steam only after June-July after a new government assumes charge, a senior professor pointed out. The notification for recruitment of 54 teachers was issued by BDU during July 2019, and as per the original plan, the recruitment process was slated for completion by February-March, 2020. The process was halted after a writ petition was filed by the Association of University Teachers General Secretary M. Bala Murugan challenging the basis of recruitment and expressing apprehensions over dilution of the reservation policy. The AUT had, in the petition, cited an order issued by the Higher Education Department during August 2019 that State universities do not come in the ambit of Central Universities, under the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers Cadre) Act, 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bdu-for-fresh-notification-to-fill-54-teaching-posts/article33826053.ece
13 February 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Serving the poor, one dosa at a time||On a small street near the Woraiyur police station in Tiruchi, a nondescript building with clay tile roofing is the home and shop of S. Chinnathambi. Hungry visitors come here from across the city for his dosa. Crossing into a quiet part of the locality, away from the busy Woraiyur Market, one can see steam evaporating from a hot pan. Here is Chinnathambi’s shop, which opened five years ago. It sells small dosas for Rs. 2 each so as to serve the poor. If ‘idly podi’ is sprinkled on it, it costs Rs. 3 each. If it is made like an ‘uttapam’, dressed with onions and carrots, it is priced at Rs. 4. Small plastic stools are lined up in front of the shop, which is open from 7 p.m. till midnight. Mr. Chinnathambi had worked as a cook at a hotel nearby until five years ago. The hotel owner himself helped him set up the shop. “We made a conscious decision to serve dinner. While lunch is available at pushcarts across the city, a good dinner is difficult to come by. One must not sleep on an empty stomach,” he says. “We manage to carry on the business since our family is involved in it; we do not do it for the profit. There are people who come with just Rs. 10 and eat three dosas and an omelette. There have been many nights when I have gone to sleep hungry, and I do not wish it upon my worst enemies,” he says. Mr. Chinnathambi wakes up at 4 a.m. to soak rice and urad dal for the batter. “The rice and the dal soak until 11 a.m. when it is ground. The batter is left to ferment until we are ready to open the shop,” he says. In the meantime, Mr. Chinnathambi and his wife prepare coconut and ‘kara’ chutney, two varieties of kurma and sambhar. His two daughters, one in Class 12 and the other in Class 10, help them. “We grind 9 kg of rice every night. There have been nights when we have run out of batter and have had to buy it from nearby stores,” he says. On average, over 100 customers have dinner at Mr. Chinnathambi’s shop every day. He makes 600 to 800 dosas a day. Among his customers are people who work through the day at the Woraiyur market and many youth. Kids living in the locality, too, rush to the shop to eat one or two dosas. “They tell me that they get dinner for the price of a chocolate,” he laughs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/serving-the-poor-one-dosa-at-a-time/article33826070.ece

Several projects have been halted and labourers have been rendered jobless. Builders who have already entered into contracts have been badly affected as they face heavy losses. He urged the government to constitute a regulatory body to bring about stability in prices and protect the interests of the sector.

13 February 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Voters will uproot corrupt AIADMK govt.: Vaiko||Asserting that the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu would register a resounding victory in the Assembly polls, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said the people would uproot this corrupt government for having buried social justice that prevailed in the State for decades. Speaking to reporters here on Friday evening, Mr. Vaiko, who participated in the party’s election fundraising meeting, said people’s overwhelming support to the DMK during the electioneering by party president M.K. Stalin was heralding the Opposition’s victory. “The DMK and its allies are mobilising the angered people against this corrupt government. Thousands of people are gathering to listen to Mr. Stalin,” Mr. Vaiko said. He said the people’s support to the DMK-led alliance had enraged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami who was levelling baseless allegations against the DMK and others. “Though the State government is giving advertisements in a vain attempt to showcase its achievements, people don’t take it seriously as they are witnessing what is happening around them,” he noted. On the number of constituencies the MDMK would get, Mr. Vaiko said it was yet to be discussed and scotched speculations that the Congress would get lesser number of seats. When asked about the rumours on possible formation of the third front led by Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Neethi Maiam, he said he was not aware of it. On Jayalalithaa’s aide V.K. Sasikala’s assertion that she would enter active politics, Mr. Vaiko said she would not make any impact in Tamil Nadu politics. About rumours on his son Durai Vaiyapuri’s political entry, Mr. Vaiko said he would never enter politics as there was no heir-apparent in the MDMK. The party’s Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari and Virudhunagar units handed over Rs. 1.93 crore to Mr. Vaiko as election fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voters-will-uproot-corrupt-aiadmk-govt-vaiko/article33826082.ece

Palaniswami said on Friday. He began the second day of his election campaign in Tiruppur district near the Udumalpet bus terminus in the morning. He said the government had received a demand from farmers for 24-hour three-phase power supply. He listed the schemes introduced by the AIADMK government to promote agriculture. He accused DMK president M.K. Stalin and women’s wing leader M.K. Kanimozhi of engaging in “defamatory and false campaigns” against the AIADMK. The ‘1100’ helpline to address the grievances of the public had been in the works for two months and would be launched in another 10 days, he said. Speaking at Palladam, he contended that the government had been issuing advertisements in newspapers, listing its schemes and achievements to counter the DMK’s “false campaign”. Petition initiative Criticising Mr. Stalin’s initiative of collecting petitions from the public, he said the people decided that the AIADMK government must continue and the DMK president could become the Chief Minister “only in his dreams”. Countering Ms. Kanimozhi’s claims that the government had introduced the ‘1100’ helpline only after Mr. Stalin began collecting petitions, Mr. Palaniswami said that over 9 lakh petitions had been collected in all the constituencies under the Chief Minister Special Grievance Redress Programme, and the grievances highlighted in over 5 lakh petitions had been redressed. In the middle of the campaign at Palladam, Mr. Palaniswami asked the crowd to make way for two ambulances that were unable to move forward. He resumed his speech after the ambulances left. As part of the campaign, he addressed women self-help groups at a private hall at Palladam. Listing the schemes introduced for women, he said Rs. 12,500 crore was provided to the SHGs through credit linkage during the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-announces-24-hour-3-phase-power-supply-to-farm-pumps/article33826060.ece

Kanimozhi asserted here on Friday that her party had never been a slave to anyone. She was reacting to remarks made by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami at Udumalpet on Friday that the DMK had been a slave whenever it was part of an alliance that was in power at the Centre. “We had the courage to exit an alliance when there was a contradiction in ideologies,” she told mediapersons. Denying the charges made by Mr. Palaniswami that the DMK has been engaging in false campaigns against the government, Ms. Kanimozhi said her party had been highlighting the issues that the people raised at the ‘Makkal Gram Sabha' meetings. Showing the images of the poor condition of many roads, she alleged that many basic facilities such as roads, other infrastructure and collection of garbage had not been ensured in Tiruppur. Garment factories in Tiruppur had been affected due to the Goods and Services Tax levied during the COVID-19 pandemic. The units had not received any respite from the Central and State governments, she alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-was-never-a-slave-to-anyone-kanimozhi/article33826114.ece
13 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Activist alleges ‘help’ from panchayat chief to illegal resorts in MTR||Lawyer and environment activist ‘Elephant’ G. Rajendran has written to the District Collector expressing his apprehensions that the Masinagudi village panchayat president was ‘helping’ people running illegal resorts and home-stays in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR). In his petition, Mr. Rajendran alleged that the Masinagudi village panchayat president was ‘attempting to help the violators’ instead of taking action against them. “It is learnt that the Block Development Officer and others visited and tried to lock and seal some illegal resorts and home-stays. By mutual understanding with the president and others, the officials returned without taking action. It appears that the officials are also colluding with the violators and refusing to execute their power in accordance with law,” said Mr. Rajendran in his petition. The activist, who led the fight against illegal resorts and home-stays in the tiger reserve, called on the Collector to act against the village panchayat president and ensure that all illegal resorts and home-stays were sealed. Mr. Rajendran also wrote to the Nilgiris district police to reconsider their decision to allow traffic to descend to the tiger reserve via Kalhatti Ghat Road. He highlighted to the Nilgiris SP, V. Sasi Mohan, that the road was closed after ‘deep discussions’ in the interests of the safety of the public after a number of accidents. Mr. Rajendran said reopening the road would lead to massive environment problem in the region and also help bring business to illegal resorts and home-stays there. He also said it would lead to more accidents and increase the number of human-animal confrontations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/activist-alleges-help-from-panchayat-chief-to-illegal-resorts-in-mtr/article33826115.ece
13 February 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Wild elephant ‘Shankar’ captured with the help of four kumkis||Shankar, a wild elephant alleged to have been responsible for the deaths of three persons in accidental confrontations in the Gudalur forest division last year, was finally tranquillised and secured with ropes in Cherambadi in Pandalur by the forest department on Friday. The around 20-year-old elephant had been evading efforts to capture it since February 4, when it re-entered Tamil Nadu from Kerala to where it had fled in December last. Forest department officials said that four kumki elephants – Kalim, Sujay, Vijay and Srinivasan were brought to the location from the Theppakadu elephant camp from the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) to assist in the capture of Shankar. On Friday, a team comprising forest veterinary officer, Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, K. Ashokan, as well as E. Vijayaraghavan and Rajesh Kumar successfully darted the elephant twice with strong doses of tranquillisers, before using the kumkis to successfully restrain the animal with ropes. As the elephant was being protected by a herd of other elephants, some of the kumkis were being used to keep the herd away from Shankar, while veterinary teams were administering tranquilliser whenever necessary to keep the animal restrained. Forest department teams are mobilising heavy machinery to build a temporary road to bring a truck to where the elephant can be safely boarded. Shankar is to be brought to the Theppakadu camp where he will be put inside a ‘krall’ (elephant shelter) and trained to become a captive elephant, officials said. Incidentally, Srinivasan, one of the kumkis used to capture Shankar, used to be one of the elephants that closely associated with the jumbo during its time in the wild before it was captured by the forest department in 2016. Srinivasan was brought to Cherambadi specifically to coax Shankar away from the herd to which he had attached himself to in recent days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wild-elephant-shankar-captured/article33826074.ece

13 February 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||CM has not done anything by himself, says Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Friday that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had not done anything by himself in the last four-and-a-half-years but had come forward to implement schemes based on the complaints he (Mr. Stalin) received from people during the DMK’s outreach in all Assembly constituencies. Speaking at ‘Ungal Thogudhiyil Stalin’ (Stalin in your constituency) meeting held at Kaanai in Vikravandi constituency, Mr. Stalin asked who the Chief Minister was “as Mr. Palaniswami had not done anything by himself in the last four-and-a-half years”. He alleged that Law Minister C. Ve. Shanmugam had let down Villupuram district, from where he was elected. The district would have been better had he taken steps for its development. “He was removed from the post of AIADMK Villupuram north district secretary and Minister by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2012 for allegedly abusing officials and for irregularities in the Registration Department,” he said. “Mr. Shanmugam became a Minister in the present government on compassionate grounds, just to ensure representation to the district,” he said. Referring to the breach of a check dam in the district, Mr. Stalin said the Rs. 25 crore structure had collapsed within months of inauguration by the Law Minister. Although a few PWD officials had been suspended, no action had been taken against the contractor. The suspension was an eyewash and the officials would soon be reinstated, he said. He also wanted the Chief Minister, who holds the PWD portfolio, to make his stand clear on the issue. Mr. Stalin said the check dam breach was an example of the corrupt practices and irregularities prevailing in the State. Referring to the collapse of a roof at the Government Medical College in Namakkal and the damage to a mini clinic in Karur, he said there was no need for a magnifying glass to look at the lacunae in the administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-has-not-done-anything-by-himself-says-stalin/article33826062.ece

13 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cash-strapped RTCs keen on fare hike||The upward trajectory of fuel prices is crippling the already cash-strapped Road Transport Corporations in Karnataka. They are likely to approach the State government seeking revision in bus fares to compensate for the revenue loss. Last year, around this time, corporations were purchasing diesel at Rs. 62.51 per litre. Today, they are paying around Rs. 76.22 per litre (bulk purchase cost), an increase of over 20% at a time when people, for the most part, are still avoiding public transport for fear of contracting COVID-19. Due to poor ridership after the lockdown, RTCs have already incurred a loss of Rs. 2,500 crore. Shivyogi C. Kalasad, Managing Director of KSRTC, said, “A revision of bus fares is required to meet increasing operational cost. Moreover, the fares applicable for Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) have not been revised for seven years. Last February, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) was allowed to revise fares, but it has not made any significant change in revenue collection post-COVID-19.” He added that the matter was broached with the Transport Minister. “It is still in the preliminary stage of discussion. We have not formally approached the government seeking a revision,” he said. All the four corporations (KSRTC, BMTC, NEKRTC and NWKRTC) purchase 48,960 kilolitres of diesel every month. “There has been a consistent increase in the price of fuel. We are paying 25% more compared to April 2020. After schools and colleges started re-opening, we have started running buses on almost all the routes, but ridership remains low,” said Mr. Kalasad. Burden of student passes Another financial burden is student passes. The government’s share in subsidised passes has reduced from 50% to 40% while that of students has come down from 25% to 8%. “The respective corporations bear the rest of the cost. Over the last six years, cumulatively, Rs. 3,000 crore was due from the State government as its share for the subsidised passes. Of this, Rs. 1,500 crore was released to pay the staff after the outbreak of the pandemic,” he added. Seeking relaxation The Corporations have also sought concession from paying Motor Vehicle Tax. Every year, they pay Rs. 300 crore. Another concession sought is on payment of sales tax on diesel that comes up to around Rs. 500 crore. ( This is the first of a three-part series on the impact of the fuel price rise )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cash-strapped-rtcs-keen-on-fare-hike/article33826501.ece
13 February 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Crackdown on illegal arms trade, offences on darknet to be key focus of police force||A year after the State government carried out an enforcement campaign against narcotics, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai is learnt to have set the next target for the police for 2021: crackdown on illegal arms trade and offences on the darknet in the State. Speaking at the annual meeting of senior police officers on Friday,Mr. Bommai is learnt to have appreciated the department for the crackdown on narcotics in 2020 and said the State government wants to root out illegal arms trade in 2021. Traditionally, illegal arms trade has been rampant in certain pockets of Vijayapura district. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who chaired the meeting, told presspersons that cybercrime had emerged as the biggest challenge for policing in the State and that the government would give all support to equip the force to fight it effectively. Earlier, at the meeting, Mr. Bommai is learnt to have stressed the need for thepolice to hone their skills to crack crimes on the darknet, which was fast emerging as a platform where serious offences — cybercrime, and narcotics and illegal weapons trade — were coming together. The city police have cracked several cases where contraband narcotics were procured through the darknet. The Home Minister is learnt to have said that the force needs to be alert to the possibility of illegal weapons also being procured through the darknet. On police tenure Meanwhile, Mr. Bommai, in response to reporters’ query on frequent transfers of senior officers, said the State government was mulling over amending the Karnataka Police Act, 2007, to increase the tenure of senior officers back to two years. Earlier the minimum tenure was two years, but it was amended and reduced to one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/crackdown-on-illegal-arms-trade-offences-on-darknet-to-be-key-focus-of-police-force/article33826261.ece

Deve Gowda had merely said the party would not contest the byelections, but not in support of any other party. “Before ridiculing the JD(S) for withdrawing from elections, Mr. Siddaramaiah should have remembered Gundlupet and Nanjangud (byelections). Mr. Gowda had supported the Congress based on secular principles. The JD(S) had a strong base there (Gundlupet) and Congress candidate in Nanjangud was a JD(S) leader,” he said. The former Chief Minister also repeated his challenge to Mr. Siddaramaiah to form a regional party and win five seats. “Having failed to accept my challenge, he is testing his strength by criticising the JD(S). There is still time to prove our strength in north Karnataka,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hdk-rebuts-ex-cms-charges/article33826264.ece

Disclosing this during the valedictory of the five-day National Horticultural Fair organised by the institute at its Hessarghatta campus here, IIHR director M.R. Dinesh on Friday said this would help farmers to get the best available prices. Market trends  Explaining how the app works, Dr. Dinesh told The Hindu that it would have details of farmers and traders who have enrolled with the IIHR. At the same time, the app would also have trends in different markets in the country, including prices for different produce. “For example, if a farmer has grown papaya in Karnataka, he can know the trends related to prices for papaya in different markets through the app and accordingly decide upon the market which is offering the best price. He can contact the traders there for further transaction,” Dr. Dinesh said. Presently, the institute is in the process of uploading information and details regarding enrolled farmers to facilitate the commencement of operation of the proposed app, he said. So far, details of over 1,000 farmers have been received by the IIHR, he noted. According to him, any horticultural farmer from the country can register under the app which will start functioning from February-end. Meanwhile, Dr. Dinesh said already 2.63 crore people had downloaded the YONO Krishi platform of the SBI that has been integrated with the IIHR’s online seed portal. People living anywhere in the country can get quality seeds at their doorstep from the seed portal after paying online.

Speaking after inaugurating the three-day 24th Dakshina Kannada District Sahitya Sammelana, Mr. Rai, formerly Vice-Chancellor of Kannada University, Hampi, and Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), said that Dakshina Kannada, with multiple languages, dialects, religions, castes and creed, had the unique tradition of maintaining peaceful co-existence. It was intact, rich and mutually respectable. The youth of these days cannot brush aside this fact but understand that they are going to lead life in the same land and face the future. “The district is yours and you are going to live here. Social media should not be used to divide society and spread hostility,” Mr. Rai said. Stressing on the rich heritage of unity in diversity factor of Dakshina Kannada, the writer said that politics should become only a part of life and not life in itself. He asked young writers to revive children’s literature in Dakshina Kannada which had made a significant contribution to it. Writers Panje Mangesh Rao, M.N. Kamath and Palakala Seetharam Bhat were among those who had nurtured children’s literature in the district. “Children’s literature should be promoted as a movement,” Mr. Rai said. The former Vice-Chancellor suggested to the writers to launch a publishing house in the district on the cooperative model, as in Kerala. All writers can contribute to float the publishing house by registering it under the Cooperative Societies Act, he said. Dakshina Kannada had the tradition of having Kannada pandits, he said and added that scholars should come forward to study ancient kavyas. President of Dakshina Kannada Sahitya Parishat S. Pradeep Kumar Kalkura made the introductory remark. Bishop of Mangaluru Peter Paul Saldanha, seer of Moodbidri Jain Mutt Charukeerti Bhattaraka Panditacharyavarya, the former Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Harikrishna Punaroor, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Karnataka Bank M.S.

13 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Set up corpus in govt.-aided Kannada-medium schools’||Putting forth before the government an agenda to save government-aided Kannada-medium schools from the threat of being closed down, scholar M. Prabhakara Joshi said here on Friday that the government should set up a corpus of Rs. 5 crore in each such school through public-private partnership. The interest earned from the corpus or the capital fund should be used for the activities and development of the particular school, he said. He was speaking as the president of the three-day 24th Dakshina Kannada Sahitya Sammelana which began at Sharada Vidyalaya. Mr. Joshi said that the government should first conduct a survey of all government-aided Kannada-medium schools to know their condition. Later, impediments for their growth should be identified and addressed. A cell comprising both government officials and representatives of the particular school should be constituted to raise the corpus and manage it transparently. He said that study of Sanskrit will only supplement the understanding and also, the flourishing of Kannada. Sanskrit is not against the growth of Kannada. Mr. Joshi, also a senior and well-known Talamaddale Arthadari, said that if Kannada Sahitya Parishat did not recognise Yakshagana Sahitya which has its own identify, the loss will be to Kannada literature and not to Yakshagana. “The study of Kannada literature is not complete without the study of Yakshagana literature,” he said. The scholar said that Yakshagana is an art and literature which is held in high esteem above the barriers of caste and creed. Expressing his concern over Yakshagana losing its charm as a real art form in the recent days, he said that people should not support such performances which are not in good taste. “Do not encourage all shows innocently,” he said. The senior artiste said that Yakshagana is being lost now amid glorification and flaunting. Kannada books Shankara Bhatra Pravasagalu, Swayamvara Kalyana, Sagaradalli Bindu, Jokali and Manisara were released on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/set-up-corpus-in-govt-aided-kannada-medium-schools/article33826644.ece
13 February 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Samiti threatens agitation seeking removal of toll plaza||While demanding relaxation in paying toll for motorists from Mangaluru and Udupi at the Hejmady and Surathkal toll plazas on the National Highway 66, members of the Tollgate Virodhi Horata Samiti, Surathkal, said on Friday that they will soon launch an agitation demanding the closure of the toll gate near the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal. Talking to reporters, Muneer Katipalla, convenor of the samiti, said that following agitation by the samiti in 2018 the State government proposed closure of the toll gate at Surthkal and merge it with the toll gate at Hejmady, which is nine kilometres away, on the National Highway 66. Though the Union Government agreed to the proposal, no action has been taken so far in merging the toll gates. Toll continues to be collected at the NIT-K toll gate by offering relaxation to Mangaluru motorists. With the introduction of FasTag at toll gates, NHAI is withdrawing the concession offered to locally registered vehicles. From February 15, the NHAI proposes to collect toll from local motorists, including inter-city buses and taxis, at the Talapady, Surathkal and Hejmady toll gates on National Highway 66. Collection of toll, Mr. Katipalla said, will hit people hard, especially those regularly travelling on private buses between Udupi and Mangaluru. These commuters have to pay Rs. 8 more for every round trip between the two cities. Motorists, especially those in Padubidri, Mulky, Surathkal and Talapady, will also have to bear the brunt of this toll collection. “We will not allow this to happen. Toll collection from local people can happen only with our arrest,” he said. The samiti will shortly start an agitation seeking the removal of the Surathkal Toll Gate and also relief to other motorists. Harish Putran from Mulky Abhivrudhi Nagarika Samiti said that Member of Parliament and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel and other elected representatives of the two districts were lacking in commitment in resolving the issue. The meeting of Mr. Kateel with Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on the toll gate and other issues on Thursday is an eyewash in the light of call for protests against toll collection, said T.N. Ramesh, joint convenor of the samiti. Meeting Meanwhile, Mr. Kateel has in a statement said that Mr. Gadkari has directed NHAI authorities to call a special meeting on the issue of closing the toll gate near NIT-K in Surathkal. Mr. Kateel said that he met Mr. Gadkari at his residence in New Delhi on Thursday. Mr. Gadkari also mentioned about the Ministry being in the process of completing the tender process for widening the National Highway 75 stretch between BC Road and Addahole and of the National Highway 169 stretch between Sannur and Bikarnakatte. The Minister also assured of shortly taking up the work of developing the outer ring road in Mangaluru, the Mulky-Kateel-Bajpe-Polali-BC Road-Panemagaluru Road and the four laning of the stretch between Mani and Kushalnagar, Mr. Kateel stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/samiti-threatens-agitation-seeking-removal-of-toll-plaza/article33826655.ece

13 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mayor’s post reserved for woman||The post of Mayor for Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has been reserved for a woman from the general category while the post of Deputy Mayor has been set aside for the general category. Soon after the State government announced the reservation matrix for Mayoral polls in MCC, hectic political activity has begun in the hung civic body, hitherto held by alliance of JD(S) and Congress. In the 65-member MCC, BJP has 22 members while the Congress has 19 members and the JD(S) has 18 members. One BSP member and five independents make up the rest of the MCC. The reservation of the post of Mayor for a woman from the general category will not only ensure that a woman will occupy the coveted post for the third successive year in the ensuing term, but also opens up options for realignment of political formations in the hung house. There are as many as 32 women in the 65-member MCC out which 13 belong to the BJP, 11 to JD(S) and 7 from Congress and 1 from BSP. After the JD(S) struck an alliance with the Congress in 2018, Congress party’s Pushpalatha Jagannath became the Mayor after which JD(S) corporator Tasneem occupied the post in the second year. As per the terms of the alliance, the Congress candidate should get the post of Mayor in the third year while JD(S) will have its Mayor during the last two years. But, the souring of ties between JD(S) and Congress at the State level following the fall of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy has given an opportunity for the BJP to woo the JD(S). The saffron party, which is ruling in the State, has openly declared that it was looking forward to aligning with the JD(S) in an effort to have the first BJP Mayor in Mysuru. Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, said the BJP is open to aligning with the JD(S) and the party will make all efforts needed to have its Mayor in Mysuru. The JD (S), however, has not made its stand clear. “A meeting of the party workers from Mysuru has been convened in Bengaluru on Sunday, where former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy will address the party workers. A decision on the party’s stand for the Mayoral polls will be taken only after the meeting”, said former Mayor from JD(S) R. Lingappa. Though most of the JD(S) corporators are in favour of aligning with the BJP, sources in the party said that the five corporators belonging to the minority community in JD(S) are demanding that the post of Mayor be retained with the party if an alliance with BJP becomes inevitable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mayors-post-reserved-for-woman/article33826251.ece

13 February 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||All districts to get centres to train youth in competitive exams||All district headquarters in the State would be getting centres for training youth in IAS, KAS and other competitive examinations next year, Shalini Rajneesh, Additional Chief Secretary, Planning, Sports and Youth Empowerment Department, Government of Karnataka, said on Friday Participating virtually in a programme organised to wish the participants of a 60-day online IAS/KAS competitive examinations’ training and launch a book ‘Mukta Bhandara’, study materials for the competitive examinations, at the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) here, she said the KSOU’s Competitive Examinations’ Centre has become a model for training the youth. Similar centres can be set up in each district headquarters and the proposal has been discussed with Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education Ashwath Narayan. “The DyCM has responded positively to the proposal and funds were expected to be allocated in the 2022 budget for establishing the centres in all the districts next year.” Ms .Rajneesh said many youths from the districts and cities dream of cracking IAS and KAS examinations, and they also get suitable guidance/coaching in realising their wish. The youth from rural areas also need similar support and centres can be proposed even in the taluk centres keeping in view the interests of these students. Such initiatives can build self-confidence in the candidates, helping them to successfully face the competitive examinations.. Though the State has a population of nearly 2.5 crore youth, only 30 per cent of them get higher education; the rest don’t have access to higher education and such candidates have to be academically empowered, the ACS suggested. Ms. Rajneesh advised the participants to pursue IAS and KAS exams only to serve the people and bring change in the society and not for any personal interest or for livelihood reasons. “Opt for civil services only if you have the passion to serve the society.” Deputy Inspector General of Police in Nagaland, N. Rajashekar, who also took part virtually, advised the candidates to give top priority for time and make use of the opportunities available. “Do not pursue anything under pressure or somebody’s force. Take the exams seriously and put in your best,” he said, advising the participants to lay emphasis on solving previous years’ question papers and keep themselves well-informed about the current affairs. Hassan ZP CEO D. Bharathi, who also addressed the participants virtually, said dreams have to be pursued with a focused mind and added that learning is endless even after taking over key positions cracking the competitive examinations. KSOU Vice-Chancellor S. Vidyashankar said nearly 1,000 candidates took online coaching. A booklet on the success story of KSOU students who cracked KAS and other competitive exams will be brought out soon. It will be sent to every household in the State through ASHA workers, to encourage other talents to dream big. The KSOU is preparing the candidates for the competitive world and has launched various initiatives, including setting up of a state-of-the-art studio and video classes. Registrar Lingaraj Gandhi, KSOU Competitive Examinations Centre Head Jainahalli Satyanarayana Gowda, Finance Officer Khader Pasha, and Registrar-Evaluation K.M.

It will work as a potential accelerator and key driver in ground-breaking product development in the area the by fostering start-ups and young innovators. Omkar Rai, Director General, STPI, made the announcement during the CII Mysuru virtual annual IT conference on the “Impact of Cyber Security in the post-pandemic digital world,” here on Thursday. According to a CII release, U.B. Pravin Rao, COO, Infosys, delivered the keynote address where he spoke about the big surge in cyberattacks post-COVID-19. Working from home has become more vulnerable from getting hacked as many “work-from-home” systems will not have required protection from cyberattacks. High spending Mr. Rao said there has been more than 300 per cent increase in cyberattacks since the pandemic began. By 2025, the spending on cyber services alone will touch $100 billion. Also, by 2030, the cyber products’ market will reach $35 billion, which is currently a $4 billion market, and there is a big shortage of cyber talents today. Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, the scion of erstwhile Mysuru royal family, said Mysuru has been spearheading changes in the country with the setting up of premier institutions of everlasting value and expressed hope that the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence will also bring everlasting value to the country. He thanked the STPI and CII for supporting the initiative in Mysuru. Potential Amit Kumar, Chairman CII, Mysuru said CII is happy to be associated with like-minded institutions and organisations to promote Mysuru as a pioneer in the cybersecurity field and Mysuru has all the potential to become a cyber security hub in the country. Pavan Ranga, Vice-Chairman, CII Mysuru, said most of our business activities currently were being done online and all such activities generate data, which is available online and vulnerable to cyberattacks. “Cyber security is a human issue and we need to handle it wisely,” he suggested. Praveen Rao Pejaver, Convenor, CII Mysuru IT/ITES panel, said the new norm during and after the pandemic is and will be even more dependent on a secure and reliable cyberspace. Later in the conference, S. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT-B, spoke about Personal Data Protection Law (PDPA 2020) and Data Security. Bikash Barai, Co-founder, FireCompass, spoke on cloud computing aspects in cyber security and Sandip Kumar Panda on how the pandemic has impacted the cyber space in the world and how vulnerable is the data and privacy today.

13 February 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah has insecurity: Vishwanath||Scoffing at former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s reported plan to revive the Ahinda campaign, BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath said the Congress leader was haunted by the insecurity of his growing political irrelevance and isolation. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Friday, Mr. Vishwanath said huge response from the Kuruba community for the campaign to secure ST tag and the growth of D.K. Shivakumar’s leadership in the Congress party had ‘unnerved’ Mr. Siddaramaiah. Mr. Siddaramaiah never expected that the campaign for ST tag for Kurubas would elicit such a huge response without his participation. “He fears that he is becoming irrelevant and isolated in the community and the party. So, he has thought of Hinda and Ahinda”, Mr. Vishwanath said. He sought to highlight the futility of launching an Ahinda campaign in the Congress as the party itself stood for Dalits, Backward Classes and Minorities. “He does not have the culture of the Congress. We brought him to the party and he was fortunate to become the Chief Minister.” Mr. Siddaramaiah and former Minister H.C. Mahadevappa had joined hands to revive the Ahinda movement only for their “selfish” political gains, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-has-insecurity-vishwanath/article33826254.ece

Police said Kiran had a long-standing dispute with Swami, one of the accused, over a plot of land in Gowrishankar Nagar. On Sunday night, Kiran and Kishen, along with their friend Madhusudan, gathered at Nagi canteen near Sri Sachchidananda Swami’s Ashram on Mysuru-Ooty Road and consumed alcohol. They asked the canteen owner Raghu to call Swami so that they dispute can be discussed and settled. When Swami came, the discussions Kiran and Kishen had with Swami turned sour, leading to a confrontation. But, an enraged Swami left the venue with Raghu and returned with his accomplices Dilip and Madhu.

On Friday, the blue print was presented before Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, DULT head V. Manjula and Chikpete MLA Uday B. Garudachar. The busy 700-metre stretch between Tagore Park Circle and Ramakrishna Ashram has been proposed to be pedestrianised. Apart from pedestrians, only cycles and electric vehicles will be allowed. After the presentation, Mr. Prasad directed DULT officials to elicit public opinion before finalising the plan. Gandhi Bazaar is a shopping hub, with street vendors lined up on the pavement selling fruits, vegetables, flowers and puja materials. Parking facilities DULT’s proposal includes separate parking facility for two-wheelers, cars and autorickshaws, vending zones for street vendors and wide pavements for obstruction-free pedestrian movement. A multi-level car parking facility has been planned next to the flower market at Gandhi Bazaar. Early last year, attempts were made to revive the project. The then Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had inspected the area with Mr. Garudachar and project consultants. DULT had presented three options – complete pedestrianisation, partial pedestrianisation and a mix of both with adequate parking facilities. However, the plan was once again put on the backburner following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pedestrianisation-proposal-revived/article33826499.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the direction after noticing that several officers of the BBMP, the police and the State government failed to attend a recent meeting convened by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) to deliberate on the modalities of the survey. H. Shashidhar Shetty, Member Secretary, KSLSA, in his report submitted to the court, has cited non-cooperation by officials while pointing out that assistance of BBMP and the police is essential for mapping street children. It appears that nothing moves unless the court directs the officers, the bench orally observed while pointing out the need for proper cooperation and coordination to conduct the survey. The report also pointed out that only a few NGOs agreed to participate in the survey after being told that they have to render their service for a public cause. The High Court, while hearing a PIL petition filed by Letzkit Foundation, had directed the KSLSA to conduct a survey of children selling toys, flowers, and other articles on streets after the BBMP and the government failed to take steps to collect the data to initiate measures for their education and welfare. The KSLSA informed that it had conducted several rounds of observations in 432 spots across the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/survey-of-street-kids-hc-summons-officers/article33826503.ece

The rates have been fixed at Rs. 2,200 per hour for ‘Kayal’ fields and Rs. 2,100 for the rest of the fields. The rates were fixed in a meeting held at the District Collectorate here on Friday. Mercy K.J., Deputy Director of Agriculture, said around 400 machines would be required for harvesting the ‘puncha’ crop.  From other places too Apart from a small number of machines available in the district, the rest will be brought from other districts and neighbouring States. Farmers have undertaken paddy farming in more than 29,000 hectares of land in the district this season, a major portion of which is in Kuttanad. Officials said the harvest of the ‘puncha’ crop would begin next week.  Following an initial delay in the procurement of paddy in the recently concluded second crop season (additional crop season), the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) has taken steps to procure the harvested paddy in a time-bound manner this season. In the second-crop season, mills initially kept away from procurement after they failed to reach an agreement with the government over compensation for the procured paddy, which got destroyed in the 2018 floods. Following this, the government decided to rope in cooperative societies to directly procure paddy from farmers.  Pact with mills However, lack of storage, among other facilities, for cooperative societies in the district resulted in a delay in the procurement. The impasse ended after an agreement was reached between Supplyco and mill owners. Earlier in the season, an increase in water level coupled with bund breaches following unseasonal rain destroyed paddy in around 600 hectares in Kuttanad and Upper Kuttanad. Besides, pest attack and wild rice menace have also been reported from several fields.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rental-rates-fixed-for-harvester-machines/article33826204.ece

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, a day after his release from 93 days of imprisonment, the Indian Union Muslim Legue legislator asked if it was that big a problem for the police in Kerala to find an accused in a case. “The police can catch Thangal if they want. Are Pinarayi Vijayan’s police so weak,” he asked. The government has appointed a special investigation team to probe the case.

13 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Floating ‘koothambalam’ to woo tourists||About one lakh tourists who arrive in Kochi in cruise ships every year will soon be able to watch Kerala’s traditional art forms while seated in a floating ‘koothambalam’ - a cruise tourism facilitation-centre-cum-performing-arts-theatre that can accommodate 300 people at a time. The structure, which will be readied by August, will largely be based in the waterbody that abuts the international cruise terminal in Willingdon Island, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 14. It could be towed to any location in the backwaters, including to Bolghatty Island that had India’s first full-fledged marina on its eastern side, said S. Vijayakumar, Secretary of Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC). The Rs. 4.80-crore performing arts theatre, designed like a traditional ‘koothambalam’, a ritual arts stage attached to temples, is funded by Kerala Tourism. Although Kerala Tourism had accorded administrative sanction to the project in 2019, construction work on the floating pontoon-like structure could not be launched earlier due to the floods and the pandemic. IRS specifications It is being readied as per Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) specifications and was vetted by experts from the ship technology department of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras. The IRS approves the design and construction of boats and other vessels built as per global standards.  Square structure “We decided to rope in experts of IIT since the sea mouth is very near the cruise terminal. The square structure will be 30-m-long on each side. We decided to ready the innovative floating performing arts theatre since not all tourists who arrive in cruise liners opt for shore excursions. About 50% of tourists and 90% of crew remain on board vessels that call at Kochi, mainly for want of on-shore activities. The art forms that will be staged at the koothambalam-like structure will provide options for visitors to enjoy Kerala’s famed art forms. There will also be a cafeteria, a marine aquarium and emporium for handicraft items. It will also have a sewage-treatment plant. Readying adequate number of lifebuoys and life jackets is also part of the project,” said Mr. Vijayakumar. Revenue model A total of up to six shows can be staged at the venue, raking in approximately Rs. 2.25 lakh revenue per day. Apart from showcasing traditional art forms before a global audience, it will also provide much-needed impetus to many fledgling art forms. The artistes may even be hosted abroad. Such amenities in the Maldives and Sri Lanka prompt cruise liners to remain berthed at ports for more than a day, unlike in Kochi where most vessels that arrive at dawn leave at dusk. It will also further the cause of responsible tourism. Domestic tourists and Kochiites too would be able to witness events on the platform, added Mr. Vijayakumar. The floating theatre project will be implemented by the Kerala State Coastal Area Development Corporation. Yet another project that is in the pipeline is a Rs. 1.21-crore toilet complex of global standards. It will come up at Fort Kochi, the district’s prime tourism hub. It will be implemented by Kitco. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran will inaugurate the commencement of work on the two projects online on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/soon-a-floating-koothambalam-in-city/article33826619.ece

13 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Chasing goals on the hillside||For a few months now, a bunch of girls have been running up and down Koorumala, a hill in Elanji panchayat in the district, with football at their feet. The novel football coaching session is being imparted to them by Roller Sports Association of India, a sports promotion organisation at Namakuzhy, a sleepy hamlet along the border of Ernakulam and Kottayam districts. The module was developed by Jomon Jacob, a physical education teacher and a football coach of over two decades standing, who has also coached the Sports Authority of India’s (SAI) women’s football team. “The initial idea came from Colorado in the United States where I had got an opportunity to undergo coaching lessons but had to forego since I did not get leave. However, a scientist friend there sent me a module involving running up the hill with the football, used in coaching women footballers there,” said Mr. Jacob. Since the lockdown ruled out group sessions, he tried it on his own and sought tips from G. Kishore, who is in charge of SAI’s initiatives in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Lakshadweep. “It was appreciable since hill running is an essential training module in all sports to build speed and strength. I recommended the addition of a few more activities to improve skills and ball control as well,” said Mr. Kishore, who is also the principal of SAI’s Lakshmibai National College of Physical Education in Thiruvananthapuram. Thus woven into the run were ten more activities, including zigzag dribbling, juggling, reverse ball pass along the hill slope, three touch and stop, to improve speed, possession skills, and ball control. “Polishing these skills on the bumpy hill terrain means that you could easily fine-tune and master them on a flat football pitch. It also helps build endurance level and strength,” said Sreevidya K.M., one of the eight girls part of training. As of now, the session is held once a week, running into nearly two hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chasing-goals-on-the-hillside/article33826622.ece
13 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kerala Bank will go if UDF returns, says Chennithala||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said the United Democratic Front (UDF) will close down the Kerala Bank if voted to power in the upcoming Assembly elections. “It cannot be even called a bank as per the norms prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had started it without getting proper regulatory approvals,” he said here on Friday. Alleging that the government decision would erode the essence of the cooperative sector, Mr. Chennithala said the government had failed to complete the due processes required before starting such a bank. Back-door postings On the ‘back-door’ appointments made by the LDF government in the Department of Information Technology, Mr. Chennithala said the UDF would review all such appointments if voted to power. “Is the Chief Minister ready to probe the illegal appointments,” he asked. Asked whether the government is not serious about inquiring into the allegations of a racket that had offered jobs in the Kerala State Beverages Corporation, Mr. Chennithala said the solar scam accused Sarita S. Nair was behind the illegal appointments in various government departments. “The government is reluctant to act against her,” he said. Flays Centre He accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre of having increased the burden of the people by spiking the price of petroleum products. “Will the Left government in the State be ready to do away with a share of the additional revenue from the increase in petroleum price,” he asked. On reports that the Youth Congress had asked the party leadership to take over the Kalamassery Assembly constituency from the Indian Union Muslim League, Mr. Chennithala said such decisions would be taken by the party’s election committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-bank-will-go-if-udf-returns-says-chennithala/article33826242.ece
13 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Policemen land in soup over meeting with Chennithala||Five policemen from the city found themselves in the middle of a controversy after a picture of them honouring the Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala with a shawl emerged on the social media, triggering accusations of violations of the government service rules and the code of conduct of the Kerala Police Act. Four of them, three assistant sub inspectors and one civil police officer, were reportedly office bearers of Kerala Police Association (KPA) in the district during the term of the previous United Democratic Front government. While two were treasurers of the city and rural wings of the association, the other two were executive committee members. “The incident has been taken note of and an inquiry has been ordered. If found guilty, appropriate action will be taken against them since as per their code of conduct, they are not supposed to attend political gatherings,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The policemen had reportedly met Mr. Chennithala, who was in the city in the course of his State-wide march “Aishwarya Keralam”, on Thursday night. The image, however, got leaked on Friday morning after the junior-most member of the group, a civil police officer attached to the district headquarters camp in Tripunithura, posted it in his training batch’s WhatsApp group with around 150 members. Soon, it went around various social media groups of the police across the State and kicked up a row. It is learned that the Special Branch is in the process of submitting a report on the incident to the District Police Chief (Kochi City) based on which action will be taken. Though elections to police associations are fought on clear political affiliations, police personnel are not supposed to openly identify themselves with political parties or leaders as it violates the service rules and provisions of the Kerala Police Act. “We are very discreet even when we meet political party leaders to avoid exactly the kind of controversy it has kicked up now,” said a KPA source. The group fight among the cops owing allegiance to the Congress also reportedly played a part in kicking up the controversy. The ones who met Mr. Chennithala are learned to be with the ‘I’ faction and those supporting the rival ‘A’ group made sure that it didn’t go unnoticed, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/garland-turns-crown-of-thorns-for-five-city-policemen/article33826618.ece
13 February 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Help desk at Ernakulam Junction station rescues 507 children||In less than three years since its launch, the Railway Child Help Desk (RCHD) operating from the Ernakulam Junction station has rescued 507 children, including 66 girls. While over 50% of the children rescued from trains and the station were from Kerala, the rest were from other States, predominantly Bihar. The majority of the rescued children were aged between 15 and 18 years. It was on June 7, 2018, that the RCHD started operating from the first platform of the station as a joint initiative of the district administration, the Ministries of Railway and Women and Child Development, and Sahrudaya Child Welfare Service. Objective It was set up in view of the growing incidents of child exploitation on account of Kochi’s rising profile as a city of opportunities. Three similar help desks operate in Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode and Thrissur.  “Majority of the rescued children from within Kerala were found to have fled broken families or run away for trivial reasons such as being scolded or denied desired gadgets. Children from outside are mostly victims of child labour and though they are alone when we rescue them, the presence of their family members or relatives accompanying them in the vicinity could not be ruled out,” said Shano Jose, coordinator, RCHD, Ernakulam. The help desk officials take the rescued children back to their families, often accompanying them to their homes even outside the State. There were instances in which mentally challenged children were rescued and tracing their addresses proved to be a Herculean task. Rescued children stay at the child care institutions till they are back with their families. The absence of a care facility for boys was a major headache in the past though it was addressed after Don Bosco offered a new building for the purpose. Follow-up done “Even after they are reunited, we keep following up their condition and reach out to the respective police stations concerned to ensure they are safe. We also run awareness and sensitisation programmes. During the lockdown, we had run a programme called Wonder Train, giving children a task every day to facilitate familial bonding,” said Mr. Jose. The operations of the help desk were scaled down following the outbreak of the pandemic and total disruption of train services. Round-the-clock services were resumed last month. The help desk is being run by 12 staff members deployed in three shifts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/help-desk-at-ernakulam-junction-station-rescues-507-children/article33826687.ece

The decision comes close on the heels of its widely publicised membership campaign, advertisement for which was featured on the front pages of major newspapers on Sunday. “For two organisations to join hands, there must be an ideological compatibility, which will take time. Most of the other organisations had come up just ahead of the recently concluded local body polls and they need to highlight what they stand for and their strengths with clarity. whereas Twenty20 has evolved over the last eight years,” said Sabu M. Jacob, chairman, Twenty20. He, however, said that talks were on with many of these organisations for an understanding not to field candidates against each other. Asked whether the outfit would contest in more than one Assembly constituency in the coming election, Mr. Jacob said that a decision would be taken based on the outcome of the district-wide membership campaign and its ongoing ground studies. It was rumoured that the organisation may contest in Kunnathunadu and even Perumbavoor Assembly constituencies, considering that the four panchayats - Kizhakkamablam, Kunnathunadu, Aikkaranadu, Mazhuvannoor - where it secured power and Vengola panchayat, where it has 8 decisive seats, fall within their limits. The wide publicity for membership campaign, Mr. Jacob said, was aimed at clearing the air in the wake of speculation that the outfit may sway towards some or the other front. Neither to right not to left but marching forward, read the advertisement. Mr. Jacob said that while the outcome of the membership campaign would be significant to assess the reach of the organisation, no disproportionate importance would be attached to it since a lot of people receptive to Twenty20 need not take the membership. Besides, Malayalis basically liked to observe things from a distance before taking the plunge, he said. The campaign, which has already gone online, is expected to get further traction when it is launched over the more popular and user-friendly social media platform WhatsApp shortly. Meanwhile, the studies commissioned by the outfit to analyse its reach, the public’s perceptions, basic data of electorate, and major problems facing the people in different areas beyond the sphere of its immediate influence are nearing completion. The data is almost 80% complete and the final results are expected shortly. Twenty20 had conducted similar studies before expanding beyond Kizhakkambalam where it was launched initially.  Most of the other organisations had come up just ahead of the recently concluded local body polls and they need to highlight what they stand for and their strengths with clarity Sabu M.

The court had asked the agency to take over the church, its precincts and movables after removing physical obstructions and keep the church under its control until further orders. Home Affairs The Union Ministry of Home Affairs, which reviewed the court order, said the order apparently went “against the law and the existing convention and practice governing the Central force not to interfere with the maintenance of law and order, which is a State subject, unless there is a request from the State government for assistance.” Even if the Central forces offer assistance, submitted the Assistant Solicitor General of India, for implementation the court order, the assistance of the State police and the State revenue authorities may also be necessary for accomplishing such functions. The constitutional propensity and the practical and legal constrains in the deployment of Central force required that the directions should be issued to the District Collector/State Executive to seek the aid of the Central forces, he submitted. The Assistant Solicitor General submitted that the court overlooked the requirements under Constitutional and legal mandate and the practical constraints in which the Central force will be placed in the absence of effective cooperation of the district administration, the police and the State execute to ensure maintenance of law and order, he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crpf-moves-hc-against-order-to-take-over-church/article33826227.ece

13 February 2021||Kochi/Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||K-FON first phase inauguration on February 15||The first phase of the K-FON project to provide high speed Internet connection will be inaugurated online by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on February 15. As many as 1,000 government institutions in seven districts will be provided connectivity in the first phase. Government institutions and offices in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Palakkad will benefit from this. Optical fibre cables have been laid along 7,200 km across the State. K-FON is neither a telecom service provider nor an Internet service provider but will set up as a “vendor neutral” optical fibre network that will serve as the infrastructural backbone that can take high-speed Internet services to the public, State IT Secretary K. Mohammed Y. Safirulla said in Kochi on Friday. Once K-FON has established, the 35,000-km-long optical fibre network for the State, cable operators, Internet service providers and telecom operators can lease a portion of the core network from K-FON and provide high-speed Internet to consumers, Mr. Safirulla said in Kochi on Friday. The network will extend to 30,000 government establishments by July 2021. While the fundamental optical fibre network is likely to be complete by year end, the public might be able to access high-speed Internet through it only by the middle of next year. Free Internet The government hopes to provide free Internet connection through the network to 20 lakh households below the poverty line. It could provide Internet at a speed of 10mbps to 1gbps. Mr. Safirulla was speaking from the Network Operation Centre (NOC) for K-FON functioning from Infopark. The NOC will monitor round the clock the Statewide optical fibre network, and can detect faults through fibre monitoring system software, making it possible to fix network or connectivity issues. K-FON uses the Kerala State Elelctricity Board infrastructure for fibre-laying. The KSEB’s electrical poles and towers are being “fiberised,” Mr. Safirulla said. Much of the network will be overhead. The 14 districts will be part of a core ring that connects 378 KSEB substations via optical fibres. Each district will have a point of presence that will be at one of the substations. While K-FON is owned by the Kerala State IT Infrastructure Limited, the KSEB and the State government, the project is being implemented by Bharat Electronics Limited at a cost of Rs. 1,168 crore for the first phase. “Our existing infrastructure was outdated. Only about 36% of nearly 8,000 towers of telecom service providers had been fiberised, which means that Internet speed might not meet future demand,” Mr. Safirulla said. The bandwidth on optical fibres is unlimited and can be scaled up depending on willingness to pay, he added. The network would help bridge the rural-urban divide in terms of connectivity, by providing better digital infrastructure in rural areas, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/k-fon-first-phase-inauguration-on-february-15/article33826226.ece

13 February 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Railway station development on track||After a two-year hiatus, the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has finally decided to appoint a consultant for transforming Kozhikode railway station into international standards. This was disclosed by Kozhikode MP, M.K. Raghavan, who met RLDA vice chairman Ved Parkash Dudeja at his office in New Delhi. The consultant would be appointed before March 30, he said. The development comes after the Ministry of Railways decided to task the RLDA with the development of the Kozhikode station. An official team led by Mr. Dudeja would also visit Kozhikode by April, Mr. Raghavan said. The Rs. 75-crore project to develop the Kozhikode railway station was almost kept in abeyance following the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and then again the COVID-19-induced lockdown last year. The Ministry of Railways had chosen Kozhikode among the 23 stations in the country and the only one in the State to be redeveloped under the Swiss Challenge Method nine years ago. This was based on the suggestion by the Boston Consultancy Group. The proposal was to develop the station with world-class facilities and lease out the four sites, measuring 4.4 acres to a successful bidder for 45 years. However, the project had remained on paper ever since the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society, the only bidder, proposed to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the first phase in July 2018. The first phase itself has gone through multiple stages such as securing the approval of the Standing Technical Committee and Standing Finance Committee before obtaining the nod for preparing the DPR. Despite reminders and political pressures, the project could not go beyond the second and final stages of the Swiss Challenge Method. This was because the DPR was not released. Even if the DPR is released, it has to again go through the process of bid submission, evaluation for the highest premium and development selection. Incidentally, the union affiliated to the CPI(M) was against handing over the project to private stakeholders for development. However, now the project is back on the rails.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/railway-station-development-on-track/article33826155.ece

The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kochi on Sunday is for the inauguration of a slew of multicrore projects at the BPCL refinery, Cochin Port Trust, Cochin Shipyard and FACT. But it will actually sound the poll bugle of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Kerala. Mr. Modi will address a BJP core committee meeting before flying back. The Central leadership has identified 45 Assembly segments that the party is expecting a tri-cornered contest. However, the leadership has a gloomy prognosis for retaining the party's support base in Thiruvananthapuram, Kasaragod, Pathanamthitta and Palakkad, besides expanding its prospects in Alappuzha, Kollam and Kozhikode districts. The Central leadership feels that the party would find the going tough even in the Nemom segment won by O. Rajagopal in 2016. Strategy to be unfolded A full-fledged strategy would be unfolded only after BJP State president K. Surendran takes out the Vijay Yatra on February 21. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will flag it off from Kasaragod. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda will participate in the yatra culminating in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7. 45 crucial seats A blueprint for the 45 seats was based on the perception that the BJP will be a determining factor in these segments as the difference in the votes of the party nominees and the winners was between 5,000 and 20,000 there. Senior functionaries said multiple views had already emerged in the party against the background of former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy entering the State politics after the exit of the Jose K. Mani faction of Kerala Congress (M). A section believes that the Congress-led United Democratic Front government coming to power would mean the terminal destruction of the CPI(M), which is diametrically opposed to the BJP ideologically. Also, both the BJP and the CPI(M) bank on the votes of the Hindu community. Another section in the BJP thinks that a second innings for the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government means that many Congress leaders, in the higher and middle rung, would gradually gravitate towards the BJP, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-gets-battle-ready-for-assembly-polls/article33826225.ece

Sydney-based activist Barbara Ward said COVID-19 showed how the women workforce was a major casualty in the event of a worldwide tragedy. “It is the lowly-paid who end up becoming the most affected in times of big upsets. Women form a major presence here,” she said. Role of technology Ambarish Mitra, founder of Blippar, specialised in augmented reality, artificial intelligence and computer vision, explained how technology had infused traits of gender-neutrality in households. “I don’t mean some kind of software here, but routine devices such as washing machines, dishwashers or mixer-grinders. They have unburdened women with some of their traditional responsibilities as home-makers,” he explained. Different meanings Cynthia Castro, co-founder of Latin American Company Boomerang Effect, observed that gender equality didn’t mean the same for all communities across the globe. “It was when I realised the toughness of convincing men the need to be gender-sensitive I launched my own firm,” she said. Hayley Saddington, founder of Health-Tech, moderated the panel discussion, which also drew the participation of experts from various other technological sectors.

Shylaja on Friday said that the support of various non-governmental organisations, corporates and nationalised banks would be crucial for the success and sustainable income generation of social business ventures by women entrepreneurs from various financial and educational backgrounds. Addressing a plenary session on “Policy Dialogue: Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Social Business Empowerment in South Asia” at the second day of the International Conference on Gender Equality, Ms. Shylaja said the effective marketing of various products and services by competing against the powerful marketing strategy of rival players was continuing to be a challenging experience for many new women entrants. “There are uneducated women who do not have any business idea or finance. There are also women who do not have the budget but very good ideas for business. Our aim is to offer them all a sustainable option for income,” said Ms. Shylaja. She said that those having traditional knowledge should also be able to explore it for generating a sustainable income. Stressing the need to equip poor women for their livelihood, the Minister said it was time to look at the successful model in other parts of the world to begin with. “In the years to come, Kerala should be ready to come up with its own model.” Ms. Shylaja said the generation of profit alone was not the aim of such ventures. “What we seek is a sustainable income generation option for addressing the problems of poor women and their families”. Nishtha Satyam, Deputy Country Representative, U.N. Women, chaired the plenary session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-entrepreneurs-need-support-to-survive/article33826144.ece
13 February 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||New Registrar for Calicut University appointed||E.K. Satheesh, Professor in the Department of Commerce, has been appointed the new Registrar of the Calicut University. The Syndicate meeting on Friday gave approval for the latest appointment amid the dissent raised by some of the members. In addition, the appointments of eight teachers in the university were also approved at the Syndicate meeting. The appointments were made to fill the vacancies reported in the departments of botany, bomputer science and chemistry. Note of dissent Expressing dissent in the two decisions, Syndicate member P. Rasheed said the proposal for the appointment of the Registrar on a permanent basis was contrary to the University Act. He said the university should issue a fresh notification strictly in adherence to the provisions of the University Act and statutes. In his recent note, Mr. Rasheed also claimed that the notification for the appointment was issued with “illegal modifications against the university norms”. He argued that the post of Registrar was a “term appointment” for which the university had made a permanent appointment. Rank list In a separate dissent note, Mr. Rasheed also alleged that the university admitted candidates to the latest teaching posts even before the publication of the rank list. “The university has followed different criteria for short-listing the candidates. This was only to ensure the accommodation of favoured candidates,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-registrar-for-calicut-university-appointed/article33826147.ece

13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,KERALA||MP demands operation of big planes at Kozhikode airport||A demand to allow wide-bodied aircraft at Kozhikode airport after speedy completion of an inquiry into last year’s Air India Express crash, was made in the Rajya Sabha on Friday. Raising the issue through a zero hour mention, M.V. Shreyams Kumar of Loktantrik Janata Dal said the Kozhikode airport had been neglected in utilising its full capacity by increasing the traffic and expediting the development works. “Kozhikode airport has been one of the high earning airports with revenue of about Rs. 160 crore per year. It has been reduced to just above Rs. 70 crore now,” he said. The shifting of the Haj embarkation point to Kochi had left about 15,000 pilgrims from Malabar in difficulty, he said, adding international flight services from the airport too had been reduced to half their number. “It happened because large aircraft are not allowed operation for the past six months since the Air India crash on August 7, 2020,” he said. On August 7, 2020, an Air India Express Boeing-737 plane repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the pandemic, overshot the runway in heavy rain and crashed, leaving 21 persons dead. The authorities, he said, were waiting for the release of the report of the enquiry committee entrusted by the DGCA to restart the operation of wide-bodied aircraft at the airport. “The preliminary inquiry report was to appear at least within a month of the appointment of the committee. But even after six months, the inquiry report has not seen light. Even more, the committee has asked two more months to complete the inquiry,” he said. Mr. Kumar said most Gulf workers from Malabar had been depending on the Kozhikode airport for many years. Due to the discontinuation of large-bodied aircraft, big airline companies had withdrawn their services from the airport. Also, many development works were delayed, including the extension of the runway, new parking area, apron and approach road. “I request that the inquiry on the air crash be expedited and the report be released,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mp-demands-operation-of-big-planes-at-kozhikode-airport/article33826150.ece
13 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cong., BJP councillors walk out of meeting||Councillors of both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), walked out of a city Corporation council meeting on Friday in protest against Mayor Arya Rajendran not taking part in a general body meeting of working groups ahead of the preparation of the People’s Plan for the year. Though the council meeting was convened to discuss the draft proposals for the 2021-22 annual Plan, the proposals never became a point of discussion. The Opposition councillors demanded that the Mayor apologise for skipping the meeting to take part in a CPI(M) event. Mayor’s version Ms. Rajendran said she could not take part in the meeting as she had to attend a training organised by the Kerala Institute of Local Administration as well as an organisational event. The Deputy Mayor could not chair the meeting in her absence because of ill health. The Mayor said she was apprised of the proceedings. The BJP councillors also alleged that they did not also get enough time to study or discuss the draft proposals. The proposals brought to the council after discussions in the working group meetings and standing committees were passed without discussion. Ward sabhas from today The draft proposals will now be discussed in the ward sabhas, set to begin on Saturday. The suggestions from the ward sabhas will be discussed in the development seminar later this month. The annual Plan will be prepared after this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-bjp-councillors-walk-out-of-meeting/article33826726.ece
13 February 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||‘Binge-watching’ Godard to pen a book||Watching the entire oeuvre of a filmmaker in one go, rather than watching them one at a time over several years, can give one deeper insights into the individual’s style and constant concerns. Especially so, when it is a filmmaker like Jean Luc Godard, whose first film Breathless came out in 1960, and the latest The Image Book in 2018. Switching mediums When film critic G.P. Ramachandran began writing a book on Godard, the first thing he did was to sit down and watch the films one by one. But again, in the case of someone like Godard, who has constantly reinvented himself, making many a film unlike each other, jumping from one medium to another, shifting from one genre to next, it would be worthy to study those changes over the years. “Godard and his films were always a point of discussion for us during our film society days. But now watching them all again, at a stretch, revealed a lot about the kind of revolutionary approaches and reinventions that he has made both in form and content, and the kind of impact that he had on various filmmakers and the extent of his works across mediums,” says Ramachandran in an interview to The Hindu . Released at IFFK His book titled Godard Pala Yathrakal (Many Journeys of Godard), published by the State Chalachitra Academy, was released at the opening ceremony of the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala, during which this year’s Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Godard (Adoor Gopalakrishnan accepted on his behalf). “They say a revolutionary in an artiste will eventually kill the artiste, but in Godard, the artiste is reborn again and again, thanks to the revolutionary spirit. For instance, following the 266 minute-long video project Histoire(s) du cinema , he expanded the project to several media including audio books and installation. When he worked for television, he had said he was open to work in any media. He had said then that when the days of television itself gets numbered, he would shift to pen and paper,” says Ramachandran. He feels that it is a great honour for the IFFK that Godard, who famously refused to accept an honorary Oscar some years back, gladly received an award from the Kerala festival. The book contains 21 articles, touching upon the revolutions in form and content that Godard brought about, his politics, on the French New Wave of which he was one of the pioneers and separate chapters analysing all his major films.  “I only have this to say about the book, that a book on Godard which has been completed is like a book on him which is about to begin,” he says.  It is a great honour for the IFFK that Godard, who refused to accept an honorary Oscar, gladly received an award from the festival. G.P.

13 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Few complications, finds vaccine survey||A survey on post-vaccination symptoms experienced by 5,396 health-care workers in the country who received the COVID-19 vaccine has reported that 66% experienced at least one post-vaccination symptom. However, most of it was mild and self-limiting and for 68% the symptoms did not last over 48 hours. Only 6% spoke of any symptoms that lasted over 48 hours. For 80%, the symptoms did not affect their work the next day of vaccination. The online survey, conducted between January 29 and February 4, was led by Rajeev Jayadevan, on behalf of the Indian Medical Association, Kochi. The respondents belonged to all age groups, from 20 years and those above 60 years were 17.5%. They included doctors (85.8%), nurses (6.2%), technicians (1.1%), and others. About 56% were male and 44% were female. The majority (98.3%) received either Covaxin or Covishield. The survey was an attempt to capture the post-vaccination experience in the real world, outside of clinical trial conditions, so that the public will know what to expect after vaccination, says Dr. Jayadevan. The survey found that post-vaccination symptoms experienced by 8% of the respondents who had prior exposure to COVID-19 were no different from the symptoms experienced by the majority of respondents who were non-immune. Interestingly, the study found a remarkable linear correlation between age and the post-vaccination symptoms. Age group  Most of the symptoms were experienced by the respondents in the younger age group and the symptoms declined progressively as the age group went up. Older people also had later onset of symptoms and the duration of symptoms in this group was also shorter than in the younger age groups. Researchers point out that vaccine reactogenicity (common, expected reactions in response to vaccination) is not considered a reliable sign of immune response and, hence, lack of symptoms post vaccination should not be taken as a reduced immune response. Also, since the survey did not measure post-vaccination antibody response, it could not be ascertained whether this low level of post-vaccination symptoms in the older group is a reflection of immunosenescence (immunosenescence refers to the gradual decline of the immune system as age advances), researchers point out. More likely in women The survey also reported that across all age groups, post-vaccination symptoms were more likely among women (74.7%) than men (58.6%). Women also developed symptoms slightly earlier than men and for slightly longer duration too. Stressing the importance of reducing fear over new vaccines, researchers point out that often unrelated incidental illnesses may get wrongly attributed to the vaccine. But without knowing the background rates of a disease in a population, a causal relationship between the vaccine and adverse events cannot be established, they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/few-complications-finds-survey/article33826222.ece

The administration has not received any official report warning of potential health risks in this regard, District Collector Navjot Khosa said on Friday. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board and the Deputy Director, Fisheries Department, have also scotched the rumours that the oil leak had caused large-scale death of fish, Ms. Khosa said. The Food Safety Department is examining the quality of fish caught from the affected region. It will make the findings available at the earliest, she said. Result in two days Fish samples from the region will be analysed for toxic elements at the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology, Kochi, food safety officials said. “We have collected samples. The results are expected in two days,” Alex K. Isaac, Assistant Commissioner of Food Safety, Thiruvananthapuram, said. “The spillage has not been reported across a large area. Moreover, fish tend to flee an area if they detect chemical presence. Again, the affected area accounts for only a minuscule percentage of the fish sold in markets in the district,” said A. Biju Kumar, Department of Aquatic Biology, University of Kerala. Around 5,000 litres of furnace oil had spilled out into the coast following a pipeline break at the TTP on Wednesday morning. The Coast Guard has not found any trace of the spillage far from the shore. PCB stance Meanwhile, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board has said that the TTP will be permitted to resume operations only after a proper ‘health check-up’ of the unit is completed. PCB chairman Pradeep Kumar A.B. on Friday visited the TTP and directed the company to clear all traces of the furnace oil from the seashore. Residents’ ire Although the TTP had cleaned large sections of the beach, local residents had stopped the staff from clearing the spillage directly outside the discharge point of the drain leading from the TTP campus. They also sealed the mouth of the effluent discharge pipeline on Thursday night. The PCB furnished the TTP with a set of remedial measures, including the removal of the oil-soaked beach sand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/oil-leak-rumours-on-fish-safety-scotched/article33826207.ece

The subsidy has been increased by Rs. 30, Milma officials said. The new price will be effective from Saturday. Announcing the decision, Milma chairman P. A. Balan said dairy farmers would benefit substantially from the increase in subsidy, especially in a situation of financial distress caused by COVID-19. “The decision reflects Milma’s firm commitment to milk producers, a vast majority of whom are members of our cooperative societies,” he said. Milma had earlier given a subsidy of Rs. 40 per cattle-feed bag of 50 kg. From January 1 onwards, this subsidy was raised to Rs. 70 per bag. ISO certification Ten dairy cooperatives under Milma’s Thiruvananthapuram Regional Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd (TRCMPU) have obtained the ISO 22000:2018 certification in food safety management. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan made a formal declaration about the ISO certification and presented the certificates to three of the cooperatives at a function at Raj Bhavan on Friday. Women empowerment The Governor commended Milma for its role in helping Kerala achieve self-sufficiency in the dairy sector. Milma’s contribution towards empowerment of women is also significant, he said. “In the initial phase of ISO 22000:2018 certification of dairy cooperatives, we have successfully completed all formalities in ten cooperatives and the certification body SGS (Société Générale de Surveillance) has awarded certification to them,” TRCMPU chairman Kallada Ramesh said in a statement. The three TRCMPU dairy plants, in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta have the ISO 22000:2018 certification. In the next phase, TRCMPU will equip all primary dairy cooperatives with ISO 22000:2018 certification to raise them to international standards, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/milma-raises-subsidy-on-cattle-feed/article33826159.ece
13 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Extra layers give more punch to Biriyaani||Scratching the surface of an issue and propagating misconceptions, while not really adding anything of value to the debate, is what mainstream cinema often ends up doing. In Biriyaani , screened in the Kaleidoscope category at the 25th International Film Festival of Kerala, Sajin Baabu takes a subject discussed in the mainstream, and looks at it from a fresh perspective, adding layers that have been missing from our analyses. The starting point for him are the reports in recent years of Muslim youth being radicalised due to Salafist influence, and of some of them leaving home and joining the Islamic State terrorists. His concern here is not the radicalising or the youth who have left, but the effects of these on their families. In fact, the missing youth appears only in news reports, not as a character. Clinging to hope Khadeeja (Kani), the missing youth’s sister, is already facing quite a struggle in a loveless marriage to an older man. With her brother’s disappearance, their mother has become mentally unstable. The news of his disappearance also leads to social ostracism. Khadeeja’s life appears to be a constant shift from one hopeless situation to the next, yet she latches on to the few mercies that life throws at her once in a while. Sajin Baabu, in his third outing, has made a film unlike his first two, Unto the Dusk and Ayaal Sasi , showing signs of a more matured filmmaker. He aims potent jabs at the hyper-conservatism sweeping through religions, the hypocrisy beneath this external show of conservatism and fake piety, the inhumanity of some of the traditional practices and how the laws of the religion are always written to favour the men, and to ensure that the women do not ask the most basic questions. Stronger comeback Khadeeja is, despite her circumstances, not one who would be broken by adversities, rather she seems to come out of each of them with renewed strength. Kani Kusruti, who won a State film award as well as awards at some other film festivals for her performance, gives the character immense grace and a quiet confidence. Biryani, a much-loved dish which in contemporary times has also become a victim of communal propaganda, in this film is a mark of protest from a woman hemmed in from all sides by religion, society and circumstances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/extra-layers-give-more-punch-to-biriyaani/article33826737.ece

Private University Act of 2006 will be amended and 35% seats in private universities will be filled under government quota for the benefit of socially and economically underprivileged communities, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said. At a review meeting on higher education on Friday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that upcoming private universities should maintain high standards, and mulled converting the existing colleges into private universities.

Private University Act of 2006 in the ensuing Assembly session,” he added. English medium in Inter, degree colleges Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy stated that aided colleges should either be handed over to the government or maintained by the managements themselves completely. It was also decided to introduce English as a medium of instruction in all degree colleges.

There are many good courses online, include them in the curriculum,” he said.

13 February 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Naidu in grip of Jagan phobia’||Minister for Panchayat Raj Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy has said that TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu is suffering from “Jagan phobia” as he is unable to withstand the Chief Minister’s charisma. Addressing the meida here on Friday, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had fulfilled over 90% of the poll promises in just 18 months of coming to power and took the governance to the doorstep of the people through the village and ward secretariats. He said the YSRCP supporters would win the gram panchayat elections with a thumping majority. “Mr. Naidu is unable to accept defeat in the recent elections. He is misinterpreting the election results. The people have rejected the TDP by confining it to less than 10% seats,” he said, and brushed aside the allegations of forceful unanimous elections. “There is an overwhelming response from the people of Chittoor for providing good governance and implementing welfare schemes on saturation basis. With the charisma of the Chief Minister, the TDP supporters will be defeated in Mr. Naidu’s own constituency and in Chittoor district,” the Minister said. VSP row Referring to the Visakhapatnam steel plant issue, the Minister said it was a Central government institution. He said that POSCO was an international organisation. Its representatives had a courtesy call on the Chief Minister, and they did not broach the issue of acquiring the steel plant, he added. The Minister recalled that it was M. Venkaiah Naidu (now Vice-President) who had led the students’ protest seeking establishment of the steel plant in Visakhapatnam. As a key leader, he should speak on the privatisation issue, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-in-grip-of-jagan-phobia/article33826680.ece

On Friday, Mr. Reddy said Mr. Naidu was habituated to blaming others and there was nothing new in his recent allegations over SEC Nimmagadda Ramesh conducting the panchayat elections. “Mr. Naidu claims TDP supporters won over 38% seats in the first phase and also says SEC had failed to conduct the elections in a fair manner. He had even gone ahead and written a letter requesting Central Observers to conduct the polls,” Mr. Reddy said. He said the party was ready to prove its claims by displaying the candidates pictures on ‘YSRCPPolls.in’ website. Of all the 2,640 candidates who won in the first phase, pictures of 2,616 candidates and details of 24 rebel candidates were uploaded on the site. Mr. Reddy said that no one was ready to trust Mr. Naidu’s allegations over SEC, who indeed went against the State government by misusing his constitutional powers and putting the government officials under psychological stress.

13 February 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||First batch of rice flagged off from Kakinada port||Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) Chairman M. Angamuthu and East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy on Friday flagged off the first consignment of rice from the Kakinada deepwater port as the Kakinada anchorage port has already met its capacity to handle rice exports. The State government has recently permitted APEDA to export rice from the deep sea port operated by the Kakinada Sea Ports Limited (KSPL). The Rice Exporters Association (TREA-India) is exporting the rice that is beyond the handling capacity of the Kakinada Anchorage Port operated by the A.P. Maritime Board. “On Friday, the first consignment of 32,250 metric tonnes of broken rice has started from Kakinada Deep Sea Port to Senegal in West Africa. The export of rice from the deep seaport is a dream that has been realised with the support of the State government,” Dr. M. Angamuthu said. Speaking to The Hindu , TREA president B.V. Krishna Rao said, “The maximum annual rice export from the Kakinada Anchorage Port is three million tonnes. In the coming years, the total rice export from the two ports on the Kakinada coast is likely to be six million tonnes as two berths have been dedicated for the rice exports at the deep sea port.”  ‘Game-changer’ “The APEDA and the State government’s initiation to facilitate the rice export from the deep sea port will be the game-changer in the rice exports in India,” Mr. Krishna Rao added. On the modernisation of the anchorage port, Dr. Angamuthu has assured to hold talks with the State and Central governments to speed up the proposed modernisation. In an interaction with Dr. Angamuthu and Joint Collector G. Lakshmisha, KSPL Chief Operating Officer M.

13 February 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||Women face untold hardships at polling booths sans toilets||The panchayat elections have once again brought to the fore the gender-related problems that are always endured and seldom revealed. With the focus suddenly shifting to the villages, the absence of toilets and potable drinking water is felt yet again, especially in the far-flung and impoverished habitations. The situation in Dalitwadas and tribal hamlets needs no mention. As the polling officers, assistant polling officers and other staff arrive at the remotely-located polling stations, they immediately get a hint of what they have to put up with during the next two days. For the staff members, the problem starts the moment they get the voters’ list and ballot boxes from the Mandal Parishad Development Officer (MPDO). Though buses are provided, they have to carry the load all by themselves. Rules mandate that the polling officials should not stay in the houses belonging to those owing allegiance to any of the candidates in the fray. “Villages are known for closely-knit family relations, which, of late, have developed vertical division on political lines. In such a condition, we are left with the only option of staying in neutral places such as school buildings,” rues K. Subramanyam, a staff member. When The Hindu highlighted the issue, a senior district official said, “The staff should not have such high expectations, and instead adjust for a day or two as the facilities in villages will always be the same.” “The situation is far better today with ‘Nadu Nedu’ adding a wall and a toilet,” an MPDO said, admitting that a lot still needs to be done.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-face-untold-hardships-at-polling-booths-sans-toilets/article33826672.ece

The bank is necessitated with the arrival of expert surgeons Bala Murugan and Rakesh from Chennai, Hemant Kumar from Bengaluru and Bhaskar Anand from Udupi twice a month to perform complicated surgeries, BIRRD Director Madan Mohan Reddy told reporters here on Friday. All forms of treatment offered prior to COVID-19 have been restored at the hospital. Gone are the days when the waiting list for knee cap transplants and allied surgeries used to take a minimum of six months to one year. All such operations are now performed within 48 hours. Though the number of surgeries performed did take a dip due to the COVID-19 guidelines, the hospital is handling around 20-25 surgeries every day and the number is set to witness an upward curve, Dr. Reddy explained. Earlier, the hospital used to send the patients outside for the pre-anaesthesia tests. The TTD management has now upgraded its laboratory and appointed a cardiologist and a physician, while plans are afoot to strengthen the Anaesthesia Department by appointing three specialist doctors in the rank of Assistant Professor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/birrd-to-set-up-bone-bank-for-cancer-patients/article33826015.ece
13 February 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu writes letters to President, Amit Shah on local body polls||The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national President N. Chandrababu Naidu wrote letters to President Ram Nath Kovind and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the elections to the local bodies in the State. In the letter dated Thursday, Mr. Naidu listed out the developments in the State ever since the State Election Commission (SEC) announced the schedule for the polls. He alleged that there was a breakdown of democracy in the State. The SEC was unable to conduct free and fair elections. The Commission could not check the ‘gross violation’ of the Model Code of Conduct and connivance of a section of the police and other officials with the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), he said. The former Chief Minister stressed the need for intervention of the Central government, and the need for deploying the Central Protection Force to conduct free and fair elections. ‘No prompt action’ Many complaints had been filed with the State Election Commission and the District Election Authorities (Collectors). However, there was no prompt action by the SEC. Local body elections were taking place in a vitiated atmosphere, where all the democratic norms and fundamental rights were being violated. Since local body elections form the basis for self-governance, in essence the constitutional right to self-govern was being violated by the ruling party, he charged. In the above backdrop, it was necessary to strengthen the SEC in Andhra Pradesh. Further, it was necessary to involve officials and forces of the Government of India in order to ensure smooth, peaceful, free and fair conduct of local body elections in Andhra Pradesh, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-writes-letters-to-president-amit-shah-on-local-body-polls/article33826759.ece

Sources said trouble started when a Congress-backed candidate Ravi Kumar was allegedly prevented from filing his nomination by YSRCP activists. On receipt of information, Congress supporters, along with the party’s working president N. Tulasi Reddy, reached the place where they were stopped allegedly by the ruling party’s men. Tension mounted when a heated exchange led to jostling between the two sides. Police arrived and restored order at the centre. AP Congress Party Coordination Committee member Sunkara Padmasree criticised the ‘high-handed behaviour’ of the ruling party men against the senior Congress leader. Ms. Padmasree accused the YSRCP of ‘unleashing a reign of anarchy in the State’. “Candidates supported by Opposition parties are being prevented from filing nominations. The ruling party MLAs have been threatening to withdraw benefits of government schemes if anybody tries to contest against candidates that have their backing,” she alleged. She said if the YSRCP was so confident about its victory, it should let people decide through the ballot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-leader-slams-attack-on-tulasi-reddy/article33826760.ece

As a result, the SEC could not effectively carry out its constitutional duties to ensure a peaceful election,” Mr. Ramaiah alleged.

At a protest staged at Kurmannapalem here, Mr. Atchannaidu said the people were seeing through the game plan of the YSRCP, but the latter was trying to mislead them. He, however, said all political parties and people of all the regions should unite to ‘save VSP’. ‘Onus is on Jagan’ It was the responsibility of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to lead the delegation of MPs to New Delhi and exert pressure on the Centre till it revoked its decision to sell its stake in the steel plant. Any attempt to derive political mileage out of the agitation was nothing but betrayal of the people, he observed. Senior party leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu demanded that the Centre withdraw its proposal to privatise the VSP. Thousands of acres of land was allotted to the VSP to meet its future needs.

Tollywood’s best-known director Koratala Siva is toying with the idea of shooting some important sequences of his upcoming Telugu film “Acharya” starring Telugu superstar K Chiranjeevi, his actor-son Ram Charan and several other famous actors at Jawahar Khani 5 (JK-5) Open Cast Project (OCP) in Yellandu next month. A few scenes of a Telugu film with famous Tollywood actor Vijay Devarakonda in the lead role were filmed in Yellandu and Kothagudem in January 2019. The coal town of Yellandu, considered as the birthplace of the State-run Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), the only coal producing company in south India, has once again reinforced its film shooting potential. Mr. Siva on Friday called on Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar in Khammam and apprised him of his plan to film some sequences of his upcoming film in Yellandu from March 7 to 15, sources said. The Minister assured to extend all necessary cooperation to the film production team including the actors in conducting their film shooting in the coal town.

13 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||AIIMS Bibinagar delay raised in Parliament||TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has expressed his displeasure that even after 18 months of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bibinagar being sanctioned, the in-patient facility could not be created. Speaking in Parliament during the Question Hour on Friday, he said that the Government of India announced with a lot of fanfare that Rs. 1,028 crore were being sanctioned in 2018 but only Rs. 22.7 crore has actually been spent. Even as of today only a few out-patients were being treated at the proposed AIIMS facility. “While the Minister stated in Parliament that the expected date of starting the AIIMS super-speciality hospital on a full-fledged basis with all super-speciality wings is September 2022, local director of AIIMS Bibinagar Vikas Bhatia has given a statement recently that it will be completed only in 2024,” he said. He added that the inordinate delay in converting the existing NIMS complex to an AIIMS super-speciality hospital reflects the insincere and casual attitude of the BJP government towards Telangana. “The delay is probably because the State government has not made payments to the building contractors,” he said, and urged the GoI to take appropriate steps on a war-footing so that this super-speciality hospital becomes a reality soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/aiims-bibinagar-delay-raised-in-parliament/article33826712.ece
13 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Employees hope MLC polls will not delay their pay revision||Announcement of schedule for elections to two Legislative Council seats under the Graduates’ Constituencies has cast a shadow over the implementation of the Pay Revision Commission recommendations. The model code of conduct has come into force when there was forward movement relating to the PRC recommendations. The PRC submitted its report after 32 months of exercise on December 31 recommending fitment of 7.5 %, which was objected to by the employees’ representatives. The government subsequently constituted a three-member committee headed by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar which held elaborate discussions with the employees’ unions for taking their concerns on record. The three-member committee is said to have completed its report for submission to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for a final decision. But, the model code of conduct has come into force leading to uncertainty on whether the government can effect pay revision before the completion of the poll process scheduled to be completed in March third week. The Model Code restricts announcement of new schemes/projects and also grant new relief after the announcement of the elections, the EC said in the guidelines on MCC.  Exceptions to Code The Commission said work projects that have actually started on the ground after obtaining all necessary sanctions can be continued without reference to the EC. Likewise, existing works, including beneficiary projects where specific beneficiaries have been identified by name before coming of the Model Code into force can be continued. But uncertainty grips the implementation of the PRC given the large number of employees, including those who are voters in the upcoming elections and the magnitude of finances involved in it. Employees are, however, citing the instance of 2018 when the government took the EC’s consent for crediting the instalment of Rythu Bandhu into farmers’ accounts in October when the model code was operational. Employees’ unions are hopeful that the government would address a letter to the ECI through the office of the Chief Electoral Officer seeking its consent for implementation of the PRC recommendations as it is an ongoing process, not initiated afresh. The process initiated for giving promotions to employees at different levels is, however, unlikely to be affected as the EC’s guidelines say that regular recruitment or appointment or promotion through statutory authorities can continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/employees-hope-mlc-polls-will-not-delay-their-pay-revision/article33826600.ece
13 February 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||VC appointments likely in March first week||The much-awaited appointment of Vice Chancellors of various universities in Telangana can be expected in the first week of March with the selection process on. The search committees have done their exercise, in most cases, finalising the three names for each university while a couple of them are pending. Once this exercise is completed, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will take a final call. The government seems to be in the mood to send the files concerned of all the universities to the Governor at a time rather than individually. There is a likelihood of the Chief Minister either meeting or giving a courteous call to the Governor before the final call is taken. The State government has come under severe criticism for keeping the top posts vacant for almost two years. There is a pressure from academics to fill up the posts immediately while Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan sent an indication to the government about the posts kept vacant for a long time. As per the procedure, the government will send three names for each university with the first choice on the top to the Governor, who is generally expected to clear the names as per the government's wish. Unless there are some severe charges against the top candidate, Governors have always respected the government's choice. Aspirants spiralled this time with the government likely to play the social balancing factor opening opportunities to professors for not just one university but all of them. Applications from a single aspirant have come for multiple universities. Officials revealed that more than 980 applications have come with the maximum - 142 - applying for B.R. Ambedkar Open University followed by Satavahana University - 125. Osmania University has seen 114 aspirants and so is Telangana University in Nizamabad. Kakatiya University - 110, JNTU Hyderabad - 56 and Potti Sriramulu Telugu University - 23 - follow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vc-appointments-likely-in-march-first-week/article33826583.ece

13 February 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Singareni Collieries plans to start production in 14 new mines over 4 years||As part of its plans to increase coal production to 100 million tonnes per annum in the next five years, the management of Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) is making arrangements to commence coal mining in 14 new mines over the next four years in addition to taking up expansion of four existing mines. The plans were discussed threadbare at a two-day brainstorming session held here on Thursday and Friday. Chairman and Managing Director of the company N. Sridhar stated that but for the COVID-19 pandemic impact the coal production during the current financial year would have been nearly 70 million tonnes. Along with the directors of the company, officials from mining, planning, estates, marketing, finance, personnel, purchase and information technology departments participated in the two-day meeting for working out strategies for the company’s future plans. Mr. Sridhar stated that the company would evolve its plans keeping in mind the coal and energy needs of the State and the country. Stating that there was need to commence extraction of coal in 14 mines over the next four years, Mr. Sridhar suggested the officials concerned to work in tandem for getting several approvals and clearances for them along with expansion of four existing mines. Explaining the changes undergoing in the coal market, the CMD highlighted the need to improve the quality of coal as well as reducing the cost of production to be competitive. Use of machinery It was suggested that the use of machinery and their working hours had to be increased further for reducing the production cost. Company officials stated that various types of mechanised shovels were working for 10 hours to 14 hours a day now and there was need to increase the work hours to about 18 hours a day. Further, it was stated that the cost of coal production in the underground mines had reached about Rs. 9,000 per tonne this year (2020-21) and the company would benefit much if there is a reduction of the cost. It was decided to hold a meeting with the operators of heavy machinery not only to improve their work hours but also their productivity.  Diversification plans The brainstorming session had also arrived at a decision to work out an action plan to reduce losses in the underground mines, including improving the performance/capacity of side discharge loaders (SDLs). The CMD stated that the company had forayed into thermal and solar power generation to strengthen the company’s financial position and its longevity, keeping in mind the problems being faced by PSUs in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sccl-plans-to-start-mining-in-14-new-mines-over-4-years/article33826594.ece

After witnessing an unexpected slump in its production to about 50 million tonnes, estimated, this financial year due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the economic activity, the company has fixed a target of achieving 70 million tonnes production during in the next fiscal. In fact, the production target was set for 2020-21 but the pandemic has undone the company’s plans. In the environmental clearance given for the second expansion of Ramagundam Opencast-3 last month for enhancement of output from the peak 6.8 million tonnes per annum to 9.52 million tonnes at peak stage, an expert appraisal committee had stipulated that mining shall be carried out only by surface miners along with other conditions. However, the coal company has requested the expert panel to exclude the condition of mining only with surface miners stating that there was every danger of the surface miner bogging down in the developed galleries while extracting coal from the remnant pillars of the previous underground mine.  Not suitable Further, it was also cited that the presence of number of thin seams and higher gradient coal seams was not suitable for efficient working of surface miner. The expert panel recommended exclusion of the condition of mining with surface miner after the coal company also explained that the proposed technology of shovel dumper combination for the expansion project would be most suitable and environment-friendly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/moef-panel-eases-norms-for-sccl/article33826595.ece

Kishan Reddy, on Friday, has demanded the ‘secular’ Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to explain about its alliance with the ‘communal’ All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), especially when the latter had opposed the formation of separate Telangana, in light of both parties joining hands for election to GHMC Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts. “It is an insult to Telangana martyrs that the TRS government dances to the tunes of Majlis and its leaders who draw their lineage from the Razakars.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Romance on the high seas||Uppena (‘high tide’ in Telugu) is a film that can trigger conversations. The romantic musical discusses social strata divisions. A lot is spoken about honour but thankfully, the film probes something other than honour killings. It discusses masculinity, which is a welcome move. After Colour Photo , this is another story of romance set in a time before mobile phones became widely prevalent in the interior towns. Debut director and writer Bucchi Babu Sana leads us into a seaside hamlet near Kakinada of 2002. A mix of awe, fear and mystery shrouds Kotagiri Rayanam’s (Vijay Sethupathi) daughter Bebamma a.k.a Sangeetha’s (Krithi Shetty) trips to her college. It seems like a chip-off-the-old-block trope when two youngsters are manhandled for daring to venture near the car to get a glimpse of the aristocratic girl. But when the charade is unmasked in a few minutes, it shows the ominous and nearly insane extent to which Rayanam would go to protect his honour. Casting Vijay Sethupathi is a sign that we aren’t going to witness a cardboard antagonist. There’s scope to show something sinister and Uppena does this, while still working within the realm of mainstream Telugu cinema. The story has been told over decades and will still ring true. A poor boy falls in love with a rich girl and her father will not tolerate it. The divisions of social strata are stark. The love that Aasi (Vaisshnav Tej) nurtures for Bebamma is adoration laced with innocence. The romance is poetic, with Devi Sri Prasad’s lilting compositions matching the ebb and flow of the waves captured beautifully by Shamdat. Vijay Sethupathi’s presence lends the film more gravitas.

13 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||Amid wires, barricades a garden blooms||Identical signs painted in red ink on a white background caution visitors from accessing two adjacent sides of the Ghazipur border. But each seeks to convey a different meaning as the farmers’ protest nears the three-month mark. One has been placed on police barricades beyond which layers of security arrangements and razor wire seek to box farmers in. The other has been placed by farmers on a makeshift, mini garden they created last week in response to, and in peaceful defiance of, these very arrangements. Protected by green fencing on all sides, the small patch of land — which they dug up, added soil brought from various villages, and sowed potatoes, sugarcane, and flowers — serves as a symbol of all arable land in the country that they take turns to water and cultivate. “Police have used the sign to warn us against moving towards the Capital, which they want to protect through all these barricades and sharp wires. Our sign is to ward off the evil eye of corporates and the ill wishes of the government,” said Meghraj Malik, a farmer from Meerut. Peace lovers “Farmers are peaceful by nature. The government does what it does best by pointing guns at us and we reply the only way we know how to – by tilling the soil. Our answer will become louder with every inch the crops grow,” said Om Prakash Awana from Kasna in Uttar Pradesh. As the noonday sun grows hotter by the day, efforts beyond rotational participation are being made to make the farmers feel as less inconvenienced as possible. In addition to setting up more surface-level roadside tenements where the elderly can rest and increasing the number of bathing sites, water is being provided even at medical camps. Oranges too are being distributed to keep participants hydrated. “It is not that farmers aren’t used to the heat. We face all kinds of weather head-on in the fields. But the elderly need to be taken proper care of wherever they are,” said Ishwarchand Bidhuri from Dasna as he proceeded to hammer a nail onto two bamboo stalks to prepare a resting camp. “Days are getting hotter and summer is not even here yet; but no matter what happens, we will not cede an inch till the three black laws are repealed by the Centre,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/amid-wires-barricades-a-garden-blooms/article33826282.ece
13 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||From rag picking to learning alphabets||Practising the English alphabets repeatedly as they await turn to get their homework evaluated, Luv and Kush have come a long way since they first began collecting trash at the farmers’ protest site at Ghazipur border. First drawn to the area by the prospect of a steady daily income at their job, they are now among 90-odd children who regularly throng a small, makeshift pathshala, which had initially sought to impart primary level education mainly to agitating farmers’ children, enjoying their first tryst with literacy. “The children start coming around 9 a.m. even though the first class is supposed to begin at 11 a.m. For most of them, a majority of them rag pickers and slum dwellers, this is the first time they are attending any academic programme,” said Dev Kumar, who administers the programme on behalf of the Mata Savitri Bai Phule Mahasabha. “We have been here since January 22 and began the initiative for farmers’ children accompanying them to this protest with just 12 children. But most of them chose to leave after what happened on Republic Day,” added Mr. Kumar from Dankaur in Uttar Pradesh, a civil services aspirant who has left his studies midway to be part of the initiative. Two shifts Run by a floating team of close to a dozen, the school functions in two shifts from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Taught English and basic mathematics among other subjects in addition to being provided stationery, the children are also treated to chocolates and biscuits and instructed in cleanliness and social etiquette. According to Mr. Kumar, all the children had been registered and efforts would be made to ensure that their education continued well after the tent at the protest site was wrapped up for one reason or another. “The sweets were actually a big draw for the students, initially. Once they began trusting us we could move forward with trying to instil discipline and a sense of cleanliness in them,” he said. “We will ensure that their education continues even after the protest is wrapped up. We have their details on the basis of which we will contact local schools and get them admitted there under the EWS category,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-rag-picking-to-learning-alphabets-a-new-lease-of-life/article33826284.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Age, pandemic and motor neurone disease not a problem for Dr. Rai||A 64-year-old doctor from Tripura, who is suffering from motor neurone disease, has been offering his services in a makeshift hospital run by Life Care Foundation at the Singhu border since last Sunday. Kishan Rai retired in 2017 from an Agartala hospital as Senior Medical Officer before he started working in public healthcare. Now, Dr. Rai, who claims to have treated more than 700 COVID-19 patients, is doing his bit for the protesting farmers. The service, he says, gives him immense peace. “I could not sleep at my home after seeing the news of farmers staying on the road in biting cold, weather and rain. I contacted my doctor friends who knew people here and they told me that there are medicines here but experienced doctors are not enough,” he said. He was also concerned by the death toll, as more than 200 farmers had died, and many of them due to heart attacks. “I thought of coming here and screening people of any possible heart condition. We have taken ECG of about 40 people every day so that any such condition can be treated earlier or referred to a better centre,” he said. Worried son Dr. Rai lost his wife over two decades ago. So his son, who works in South Africa, was worried when he told him about his decision. “He was scared if something happens to me. But I knew nothing would happen,” he said. His satisfaction only grew once he reached here. “Every day, I am enriched by meeting the warm people of the Sikh community. It feels like all the sins of this lifetime are being washed out,” he said. With him has come Ashish Rai Chaudhary (62), a rheumatologist, who is also associated with Tripura Yuktibad Bikash Mancha. “We demand food, security and nutrition for all. If farm laws come into force, farmers will be at a loss and ultimately, people won’t get nutrition. This is a great movement and with our small effort, we are trying our best,” he said. Dr. Chaudhary said he felt it was their responsibility to be a part of this movement and “moreover we wanted to know if what is being shown on TV channels is true or not”. For instance, they saw on TV that the Ghazipur protest site is empty but when they visited the premise on Thursday, they realised “it was a lie because there were so many people”. Dr. Chaudhary said that he has been practising telemedicine for the last 15 years in which he meets the patient once and then stay connected with them online. “This increases outreach because of which I am even able to reach rural areas. Here also, I am sharing links with them so they can stay in touch with me via telemedicine to follow up. This is not a one-time thing,” he said. Inevitable responsibility His wife, an agricultural scientist, was ill, but she insisted on him going to the protest site. “My wife is ill and still she asked me to come [here]. Because this subject has been discussed at our home and we thought it’s our responsibility,” he said. Both doctors urged people and their friends back home to not only send donations but also come and serve people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/age-pandemic-and-motor-neurone-disease-not-a-problem-for-dr-rai/article33826278.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Advocate, five aides arrested for extorting money from wine shops||An advocate and his five associates have been arrested for allegedly posing as representatives of an NGO and extorting money from employees of wine shops by accusing them of selling liquor to minors, police said on Friday. Kumar Shashank (27), a resident of Neb Sarai, formed a gang by roping in two personal security officers (PSOs) — Naresh and Pardeep — a bouncer named Neeraj (24), driver Nitin (30) and Shatrughan (21), who posed as a customer at wine shops, they said. The matter came to light on Thursday after an employee of a liquor outlet approached the police team deployed near a mall in South Delhi’s Saket. He informed them that some people claiming to be officials of the ‘International Human Rights Commission’ had come to his shop and demanded money from the manager after accusing him of selling liquor to minors. Later in a written complaint, Naresh Singh, manager of the wine shop, stated that five men came to his shop, two of whom were armed. They claimed to be officials of International Human Rights Commission and one of them, who identified himself as Kumar Shashank, threatened him and accused him of selling liquor to people below the age of 25, a senior police officer said. Kumar told the manager that they had committed offences under the Excise Act and JJ Act, and their liquor licence would be cancelled and cases would be registered against them. Kumar also told the manager that he should pay him Rs. 2 lakh to evade all this. However, when the manager called the owner to inform him, the latter narrated a similar incident that had taken place at their other outlet where the matter was settled for Rs. 40,000, he said. When a police team rushed to the spot, the shutter of the shop was found to be shut. But a car with the name plate ‘National Secretary (Legal Cell) International Human Rights Organisation’ was found parked there. After opening the shutter, five men, including two armed men claiming to be the PSOs of the officer of the organisation were found there, a senior police officer said. Hired PSOs, bouncer During interrogation, Kumar disclosed that he worked as a legal advisor in a NGO named ‘International Human Rights Organisation’, which had its office in Pandav Nagar. He had hired a taxi with a driver at Rs. 50,000 per month and two armed PSOs for Rs. 32,000 each per month. He had also hired a bouncer and was paying him Rs. 25,000 per month to run the extortion racket, said DCP(South) Atul Kumar Thakur. The police have recovered the car, letterhead of the organisation, Rs. 20,000 in cash and two rifles from the PSOs, the DCP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/advocate-five-aides-arrested-for-extorting-money-from-wine-shops/article33826287.ece

13 February 2021||Ghaziabad,||‘We have never been insulted like this before’||Adopting an aggressive tone at a massive “Kisan Panchayat” in Bilari town of Moradabad on Friday, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Naresh Tikait said, “98% Hindus voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party but after the farmers’ protest, only 2% will be left with it.” More than the farm laws, he said, the farmers’ protest had become a fight for protecting the “dignity” of farmers. “If we let it wither away, nobody would take the name of farmers for the next 30-40 years,” he said. He said that when the government had silenced everybody, it was the BKU that had “reigned in the government”. “The government has made numerous false allegations against us in the last 78 days. I am confident people will answer them in the coming days,” Mr. Tikait said. He said that this was not the first time that farmers had protested against an incumbent government but “we have never been insulted like this before”. “We have been ridiculed as andolan jeevi , called part of a ‘ jamaat ’. Panchayat is being called a jamaat . They will have to repent for this,” he asserted. RLD panchayat Meanwhile, responding to PM Narendra Modi’s statement that the minimum support price (MSP) would remain, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary said on Friday, “MSP is only on paper. The MSP of paddy is Rs. 1868 [per quintal] and the rate that the farmers got this year is Rs. 1,200 [per quintal]. The same happened with soybean and mustard.” He was addressing a large gathering of farmers at Baldev in Mathura district. Reacting to the FIR lodged against him and 5,000 others in Aligarh on Wednesday, Mr. Chaudhary said, “If they [the government] would cane us, it would give us strength. There would be no compromise on pagri (dignity),” he asserted. Mr. Chaudhary said farmers wanted reforms in the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) system but the Prime Minister, through the farm laws, was ensuring that the APMC faded away. “This kind of treatment is expected from a quack, not a doctor,” he remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/we-have-never-been-insulted-like-this-before/article33826578.ece
13 February 2021||GURUGRAM,||People from Gujarat not being allowed to join stir: Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday said the farmer unions aimed to connect 40 lakh tractors with the ongoing agitation and hold meetings across the country to mobilise more people in support of their demands for repeal of three laws and legal guarantee for the Minimum Support Price. Speaking at a “Sarv Khap Mahapanchayat” organised by Dalal Khap 84 at Jhajjar’s Bahadurgarh, Mr. Tikait alleged that people from Gujarat were not being allowed to take part in the farmers agitation. He claimed that around 120 people in Gujarat were in jails and there was a need to fight for the freedom of the people in Gujarat. “India has attained freedom, but the people of Gujarat are not free as yet,” Mr. Tikait said. He called upon the people to be prepared to march to Delhi if required. Mr. Tikait said the Red Fort incident was a conspiracy to target a community and the farmers alleging insult to the Tricolour. Without naming anyone, Mr. Tikait said that a “boy” was misled to issue a statement an evening before the tractor parade and the next morning he was at Red Fort. “How did he reach there?” asked the farmer leader. Mr. Tikait said there was no need for the farmers to go to the Red Fort as laws were not made there. “The police put barricades on the route agreed upon for the tractor parade, but the roads leading to Red Fort were left free,” he said. Mr. Tikait said it was a conspiracy to demoralise the farmers and send them back homes. He called upon the farmers to write ‘Kisan Kranti Yatra 26 January 2021’ on their tractor-trolleys and be part of the movement. “We will go back homes, only after the laws are taken back,” said Mr. Tikait. He added that farmers won’t allow business over hunger. Mr. Tikait also coined a new slogan saying that the hands that plough the land would not beg for their rights. He alleged that a campaign was being run through IT cell to spread rumours about the movement and target its leaders. BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni said the agitation was the battle for the economic freedom of the farmers.  Huge participation Supported by the khaps across Haryana, the mahapanchayat saw a huge participation of farmers, including women and youth. Several leaders of the 40-member committee holding talks with the government on the farm laws were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/people-from-gujarat-not-being-allowed-to-join-stir-tikait/article33826577.ece
13 February 2021||Guwahati,||Action against ‘Mizo aggression’ needed, says Assam Congress||The Congress in Assam has asked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to live up to its 2016 promise of protecting jaati (race), maati (land) and bheti (foundation) by taking action against “Mizo aggression”. Assam’s land, the party said on Friday, was getting squeezed due to alleged encroachment by Mizoram. Referring to frequent violent incidents on the inter-State border with Mizoram, Congress MLA Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha said it was time the State government took some strong actions to save the State’s land. “We are losing land to Mizoram despite this government’s promise to protect our jaati , maati and bheti . Accompanied by policemen and miscreants, students from Mizoram often raid the border villages in (southern Assam’s) Barak valley and encroach upon our land. The State government must stop this and take some firm actions,” the MLA from Barak Valley told the 126-member House. Sujam Uddin Laskar, another MLA from the valley said the “Mizo aggressors” take advantage of Assam’s laxity and carry out construction after encroaching upon land in Assam. “Act before it is too late,” he said. Parliamentary Affairs Minister and government spokesperson Chandra Mohan Patowary said the State government was alive to the situation. “We don’t want any confrontation but cooperation. We believe in peaceful co-existence. We had several rounds of discussions with the Mizoram government. We will sit again so the issue can be resolved amicably,” he said in his reply. The last of the incidents on a disputed stretch of the Assam-Mizoram border took place on February 9 when miscreants, allegedly from Mizoram, torched more than 20 houses and injured at least 10 people in the Kachurthal area of Hailakandi. Earlier, two schools inside Assam were allegedly bombed by miscreants from the neighbouring State. Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts share a 164.6-km border with Assam’s Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts. Assam is also embroiled in border disputes with Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.

A statement issued by the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) said Rs. 1,000-crore has been allocated for the 2021-22 fiscal to be spent on the Bairabi-Sairang railway project that the Railway Ministry wants completed within the next two years. State capital Aizawl is 18 km uphill of Sairang. The distance between Bairabi, a railhead in Mizoram’s Kolasib district close to the border with Assam, and Sairang uphill is about 51 km. “The Bairabi-Sairang project was sanctioned in 2008-09. The anticipated cost of the 51.38 km project is about Rs. 5521.45-crore. Till last year, Rs. 3763.6-core has been spent on the project,” an NFR statement said. “There will be 55 major and 87 minor bridges in the entire project. It will also have five road over bridges and six road under bridges. There will be several tunnels with a total length of 12,639.20 metres,” the statement added.

13 February 2021||Jaipur,||Centre’s farm laws will hit 40% of population: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the Centre’s controversial agriculture sector laws would push 40% of the country’s population to “destitution, penury, hunger and unemployment.” The three statutes would effectively shift the control of farming occupation to big corporates, he said. Addressing two ‘Kisan Mahapanchayats’ organised by the ruling Congress in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh and Sriganganagar districts, Mr. Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of helping out his “friends in the corporate world” by implementing the farm laws. But he also warned Mr. Modi of the impending rage of peasants and labourers.  ‘Who is this Modi?’ “This agitation is going to spread from villages to cities. Even the British Empire could not survive in front of the farmers. Who is this Narendra Modi?” Mr. Gandhi said amid a thunderous applause by the farmers of the two districts, which share border with Punjab. The two rallies were organised at Krishi Upaj Mandis in Pilibanga and Padampur. Village-like ambience Mr. Gandhi, accompanied by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, AICC general secretaries Ajay Maken and K.C. Venugopal, Pradesh Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and MLA Sachin Pilot, sat on cots and handmade ‘mudda’ chairs placed on the stage. The arrangement was made to create a village-like ambience and connect the audience with the party leaders. The former Congress chief, seen wearing a green coloured traditional Sikh turban, was on a two-day visit to Rajasthan for extending support to the farmers’ agitation. Throwing a challenge, he said there was no option before the BJP-led government at the Centre other than repealing the three laws. Mr. Gandhi said the agriculture business of ‘Bharat Mata’, which was of the size of Rs. 40 lakh crore, was feeding the nation. “The issue of destructive farm legislation does not pertain to farmers alone. It is the issue of labourers, peasants, traders, small and medium businessmen and the middle class,” he said. Ladakh issue Referring to the disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, Mr. Gandhi alleged that the Modi government had ceded the territory between fingers 3 and 4 on the banks of Pangong Lake. “Mr. Modi does not have the courage to face China, but he threatens the farmers,” he said. The Congress leader explained the provisions of the three laws to the audience, while affirming that they would lead to closure of government mandis, hoarding of agricultural commodities, monopolistic practices in the farm sector and denial of judicial redress to cultivators. Mr. Gandhi asserted that the enactment of farm laws amounted to an attack on common people in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, after the onslaughts of demonetisation, goods and services tax and an abrupt lockdown. He said the Congress would not let the new laws ruin farmers and make sure that they were withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/centres-farm-laws-will-hit-40-of-population-rahul-gandhi/article33826575.ece

Mr. Patole said, “We feel terrible for passing such a resolution in a democracy, but six years of misgovernance by this government has forced us to do this.” The State Congress president said since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described agitating farmers as a ndolanjeevis, he has decided to call Mr. Modi dhongijeevi (imposter) for making false promises and fooling people. Mr. Patole also reiterated his commitment to transform the Congress into the number one party in Maharashtra. “I have given my word to Sonia [Gandhi] ji and Rahul [Gandhi] ji . I witnessed this sentiment among people who are welcoming me everywhere I go. I am sure that we will achieve that,” he said. Mr. Patole also recalled the historical importance of the August Kranti Maidan, where Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India movement in 1942 against the British occupation of India. “Now in 2021, it is time for the Congress workers to work to dethrone the Central government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/time-to-dethrone-bjp-led-central-govt-nana-patole/article33826192.ece
13 February 2021||Mumbai,||BJP slams restrictions on Shiv Jayanti celebrations||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised the Maharashtra government for imposing restrictions on the birth anniversary celebrations of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on February 19 in view of COVID-19. As a large number of people gather at Shivneri fort on the midnight of February 18 to celebrate the occasion, the government has appealed to people not to visit forts and refrain from organising programmes involving over 100 people. Processions and bike rallies should be avoided and cultural programmes should be telecast through cable networks or online platforms instead of holding them in public, the guidelines said. Statues or portraits of Shivaji Maharaj can be garlanded in the presence of a maximum of 10 people by observing physical distancing. Blood donation camps and health-related programmes to spread awareness of COVID-19 and other diseases should be organised while observing social distancing and hygiene norms, the guidelines said. The BJP said the government did not impose such restrictions on events such as the Elgaar Parishad. Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said the State was showing its true colours. “The State government is opening up wine shops, bars and hotels, but it is imposing restrictions on Shiv Jayanti. Elgaar Parishad that hurt the sentiments of Hindus is allowed, but Shiv Jayanti is not. The Shiv Sena has surrendered to the Congress and the NCP,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-slams-restrictions-on-shiv-jayanti-celebrations/article33826190.ece

Mr. Fadnavis told reporters that he has written to the Maharashtra Director General of Police (DGP) about the incident and sought his intervention. The woman, who hailed from Beed district, died after falling from the balcony of a flat in Hadapsar area of Pune in the wee hours of Monday. Some social media posts had claimed that she was in a relationship with a State minister. ‘Social media celeb’ The woman was reportedly known for her videos on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. After her death, audio clips of her purported conservation with two people also went viral. “My office received 12 clips of two persons talking about the woman,” Mr. Fadnavis said, adding that he has forwarded these clips to the DGP’s office. “It is unfortunate that a young woman who was making her name on social media dies in a suspicious manner. I cannot understand what is stopping the Pune police from filing an FIR,” the former chief minister said. BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar had alleged in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday that a State minister was involved in the case. A senior official from Wanwadi police station said on Friday that an accidental death report was registered in the case, and an FIR is registered in such cases only if probe confirms that it was a suicide. “There was no suicide note. But we are probing all angles,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-questions-delay-in-filing-fir-in-suicide-case-in-pune/article33826198.ece
13 February 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Unseasonal rains: onion prices go up at APMC market||Unseasonal rains in Maharashtra last year have led to a 50% fall in onion production, resulting in a rise in the prices of the kitchen staple in wholesale and retail markets. Since the first week of February, onion prices have shot up to Rs. 30-Rs. 35 per kg from around Rs. 15-Rs. 25 per kg at the wholesale market of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Vashi. Similarly, retailers selling onions at Rs. 35-Rs. 40 per kg have increased the rate to Rs. 50-Rs. 55 per kg. “The unseasonal rainfall last year damaged the crops. The onions in the market are from old stocks as most of the new crops have been destroyed in the rains,” Ashok Walunj, director of the onion-potato market, APMC, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/unseasonal-rains-onion-prices-go-up-at-apmc-market/article33826197.ece
13 February 2021||Pune,||Cong. will retain Speaker’s post: Pawar||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the Assembly Speaker’s post, which is lying vacant following the resignation of Nana Patole, would remain with the Congress. “The decision regarding the Speaker’s post had already been decided. The post will stay with the Congress. In the event of any change in this equation, that decision will be taken by the heads of the Shiv Sena [Uddhav Thackeray], the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) [Sharad Pawar] and the Congress [Sonia Gandhi] which constitutes the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition,” Mr. Pawar said. At the time of the formation of the MVA, the Sena staked claim to the Chief Ministership, the NCP secured the Deputy CM’s post, and the Congress got the Speaker’s post as ‘compensation’. With the Speaker’s seat now empty, it was speculated that if the NCP or the Sena staked their claims to it, then the Congress would demand a separate Deputy Chief Ministerial post. Mr. Patole had quit the post before his appointment as the new Congress State president. Mr. Pawar also took jibes at Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, remarking that his boast of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retaining key civic bodies of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad would come a cropper in the 2022 polls. “Mr. Fadnavis has said that the BJP would go it alone for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) civic polls. They claim to be confident of victory… but I’m warning them that we [MVA] will steal their thunder,” said Mr. Pawar. In 2017, the BJP had broken the NCP’s stranglehold over the PCMC (Ajit Pawar’s bastion in Pune) and the PMC, sweeping both civic bodies. The BJP has 77 corporators in the PCMC and 100 in the PMC. The BJP has begun preparations in earnest, anticipating the 2022 electoral struggle for the two cash-rich civic bodies. Mr. Pawar, in his capacity as Pune’s Guardian Minister is girding the NCP’s loins to take on the BJP.

13 February 2021||Yangon,||‘Work with military for democracy’||Myanmar’s coup leader used the country’s Union Day holiday on Friday to call on people to work with the military if they want democracy, a request likely to be met with derision by protesters who are pushing for the release from detention of their country's elected leaders. “I would seriously urge the entire nation to join hands with the Tatmadaw for the successful realisation of democracy,” said Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. “Historical lessons have taught us that only national unity can ensure the non-disintegration of the Union and the perpetuation of sovereignty,” he added. In addition to General Hlaing’s message published in the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper, the new junta also announced that it would mark Union Day by releasing thousands of prisoners and reducing other inmates’ sentences. Min Aung Hlaing’s February 1 coup ousted the civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and prevented recently elected lawmakers from opening a new session of Parliament. The military has said it was forced to step in because Ms. Suu Kyi’s government failed to properly investigate allegations of fraud in November elections, though the election commission has said there is no evidence to support those claims. Recent rallies against the coup — now daily occurrences in Myanmar’s two largest cities, Yangon and Mandalay — have drawn people from all walks of life, despite an official ban on gatherings of more than five people. Factory workers and civil servants, students and teachers, medical personnel and people from LGBTQ communities, Buddhist monks and Catholic clergy have all come out against the coup in force. Thousands of protesters, including Myanmar celebrities, demonstrated outside the Chinese Embassy in Yangon on Friday to criticise what they said was Beijing’s failure to condemn the coup. “The students and the people are about to face bloodshed,” Phyo Yadana Aung, a protester, said. She accused state-run media of spreading “misinformation” about the protests. On Thursday, people from Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups, who are concentrated in far-flung, border states, joined in — a striking show of unity in a country where some groups have resented the Burman majority’s control and have also had their differences with Mr. Suu Kyi. , has made them uneasy allies with her party. The protesters are unlikely to be swayed by Gen. Min Aung Hlaing’s call for unity, which came on Union Day, a national holiday celebrating the date in 1947, when many of the country’s ethnic groups agreed to unify following British colonial rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/work-with-military-for-democracy/article33825927.ece
13 February 2021||Rome,||Former European bank chief Draghi set to be Italy’s new PM||With almost all the political parties behind him, Mario Draghi on Friday entered the final leg in his bid to form a new government to lead Italy through the COVID-19 pandemic. The former European Central Bank chief, called in after the outgoing centre-left coalition collapsed, could visit President Sergio Mattarella as early as Friday to be officially named Prime Minister. Mr. Draghi has spent the last nine days assembling a government of national unity to manage the deadly pandemic that hit Italy almost exactly one year ago, triggering a deep recession. After securing the support late Thursday of the last key player, the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), Mr. Draghi has almost all the main parties on board, from leftists to the far-right League. “The Draghi government is born,” headlined Rome-based daily Il Messaggero , while the Corriere Della Sera said, “Draghi in the home stretch.” However, the 73-year-old economist has shown he is willing to take his time, and could take a few more days to finalise his cabinet. Italy has high hopes for Mr. Draghi, dubbed ‘Super Mario’ after vowing to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro single currency in the 2010s debt crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/former-european-bank-chief-draghi-set-to-be-italys-new-pm/article33825919.ece
13 February 2021||Washington,||Trump’s lawyers all set to rebut impeachment case||Lawyers for Donald Trump take the Senate floor later on Friday to rebut the Democratic-led impeachment of the former President for inciting insurrection, with Republican lawmakers then widely expected to vote to acquit him. Democratic impeachment managers rested their case on Thursday after two days of often emotional presentations. Now the Republican property tycoon’s lawyers will get a chance to respond. They are expected to make arguments brief, hastening the Senate verdict.  Charge against Trump “There’s no reason for us to be out there a long time. As I said from the start of this thing, this trial never should have happened,” one of the lawyers, David Schoen, told Fox News . The impeachment team charged Mr. Trump with stoking an insurrection after losing re-election to Joe Biden on November 3. According to the case against him, the former President began to lay the groundwork for the riot within weeks of refusing to concede with claims that he’d only lost because of mass voter fraud. On January 6 he staged a fiery rally near the White House, calling on the crowd to march on Congress, which was in the process of certifying Mr. Biden’s victory. The mob then invaded the Capitol building. Five people, including a police officer and a woman shot during the unrest, died as a result of the mayhem. Impeachment managers insist that Mr. Trump, who has never expressed remorse for his encouragement of the violent crowd, is so dangerous he should be barred from holding office again. But the former President’s lawyers are set to argue that his speech was rhetorical and that he cannot be held responsible for the actions of the mob. They also argue that the trial itself is unconstitutional because Mr. Trump is now out of office, although the Senate rejected this claim earlier this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-lawyers-set-to-rebut-impeachment-case/article33825925.ece

He was arrested in mid-January after returning from Germany. In turns defiant, mocking, and affectionate, the 44-year trained lawyer has used the court appearances to build up his support, infuriate his opponents and craft an image as Russia’s preeminent political prisoner. Mr. Navalny turned his February 2 hearing — when a judge ordered him jailed for nearly three years on old fraud charges — into a blistering attack on President Vladimir Putin. Mocking the Russian leader over allegations that the Novichok nerve agent used to poison him had been placed in his underwear, Mr. Navalny told the court that Mr. Putin would “go down in history as a poisoner of underpants”. He sparred with officials and prosecutors in court, mocking their claims that he should have turned up for parole appointments by pointing out that he was in a coma. His making of heart signs for his wife, shortly before judge Natalya Repnikova read the sentence, was splashed across newspapers around the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-court-navalny-mocks-putin/article33825917.ece

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||In shrinking habitats, desperate cats||Pedda Vagu, the sinuous stream which originates in the Kerameri Hills of the Kumram Bheem Asifabad district in north Telangana, was a silent spectator of a ghastly incident over three months ago. On November 10, a Koya tribal youth, 20-year-old Sidam Vighnesh, and his cousin, 12-year-old Sidam Srikanth, went fishing in Pedda Vagu. They laid their catch to dry on a flat boulder on the banks and went home. The next day, the two of them along with their neighbour P. Naveen (14) decided to divide the catch equally, so that they could use it as bait for bigger fish. Vighnesh went to the nearest semi-grown teak tree to pluck its leaves into which he could apportion the dried fish. Little did he know that a tiger lay in the thickly grown fire flame bush beside the teak. “We thought Anna (brother) was playing hide and seek when he didn’t return. We approached the tree stealthily, but found him crouching near it,” Naveen recalls. Vighnesh was gesturing to them frantically, asking them to leave as he had spotted the tiger. He did not notice that the feline was already creeping up on him. As Srikanth and Naveen ran for their lives, they heard Vighnesh scream. Villagers from Digida, the remote hamlet in the Rebbana forest range where Vighnesh lived, rushed to the spot with drum beats and whistles, but they found neither Vighnesh nor the animal. Tell-tale signs of blood-soaked foliage, pug marks, and drag trail took them deep inside the thick forest, where, near a clearing, they found the body, a small portion ripped and eaten. The tiger vanished into the woods on hearing the clamour, and then took a detour to head into the Pedda Vagu. “We saw the animal turn around midstream in an attempt to return. It fled after we threw stones,” recalls Kurshinga Diwakar, an eyewitness. This was the first human kill by a tiger in about 20-25 years in these parts. A second victim Eighteen days after the incident, on the other side of the Pedda Vagu in Penchikalpet forest range, Pasula Nirmala, 16, from Manneguda hamlet of Kondapalli village panchayat, was taken down by a tiger while picking cotton in a field. “I was close by. Suddenly I heard her scream. I turned and saw her in the tiger’s jaws. Running behind, if I hadn’t fallen down on my face, I would have been able to save her,” rues her mother Pasula Lachhumamma. But her nephew Annam Chakravarthi bravely ran behind the tiger and threw a stick at it. “The tiger dropped her and crouched. When I went closer and retrieved the body, the animal started following me, growling and roaring. It left the spot after we threw stones, but lurked in the surroundings for a long time,” says Chakravarthi, 20. Following the ghastly deaths, the Telangana Forest Department has issued advisories to the villagers to be followed while moving outside their homes; supplied them with masks to be worn at the back of their head, to deflect tiger attacks; laid camera traps; and collected pug marks. A committee has been formed as per the standard operating procedure prescribed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), for technical guidance and monitoring of the situation on a day-to-day basis. “We have stopped going for work in the fields after the tiger attacks. We are not sure how effective the masks are,” says Tekam Sunitha from Manneguda. Chintapudi Gundaiah, another villager, says tigers are not new to this territory, but this one is different as the presence of humans does not seem to scare it. The human kills by a tiger have caused panic and dismay in the villages. But they are not surprising: widespread habitat destruction, cattle grazing and resource extraction, along with an increase in the tiger population, have led to a man-animal conflict in the region and a dwindling prey base for the tigers. Crossing the border For a tiger to be declared a man-eater, it should have committed a series of human kills and partaken the flesh, according to the NTCA. In these cases, the proof is inconclusive as the bodies were retrieved soon after. Besides, there is always the question of the identity of the attacker as there are several tigers in the region. Five adult tigers (two female and three male) were moving around in the Rebbana and Penchikalpet forest ranges, which fall in the corridor region of the Kawal Tiger Reserve, when the incidents occurred. According to sources, the suspect tiger, identified as A2, was a male which had drifted into the area from the periphery of the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. It was among the big cats that had made the premises of the Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station its home for want of territory in Tadoba, where the tiger population is rapidly expanding. Maharashtra forest officials have reportedly confirmed that this feline was typically unafraid of human presence. It was listed there for capture before it entered Telangana. Efforts by the Telangana foresters to capture the animal, in coordination with their Maharashtra counterparts, have intensified since. Expert teams trained in the use of tranquilliser guns have been brought, and baits have been tied. The suspect, meanwhile, has been moving across the Pranahita river between the two States, keeping the foresters on their toes. Officials tracking the tiger say that the animal makes multiple kills in a short span, and does not return twice to the same kill, thereby thwarting attempts to capture it. Areas outside the Tadoba and Tipeshwar tiger sanctuaries, which are located in the Chandrapur and Yavatmal districts of Maharashtra, respectively, have a sizeable tiger population. These tigers often cross the border in search of territory and enter the Kawal Tiger Reserve landscape in Telangana.   As per the All India Tiger Estimation, 2018 (Tiger Census) figures, the number of adult big cats in Maharashtra increased from 106 in 2006 to 312 in 2018 through successful conservation efforts. Of these, 93 were enumerated from regions outside the protected areas, such as the Chandrapur and Brahmapuri forest divisions. The Kawal landscape, including the core, buffer and the corridor areas, recorded two adult tigers in the Census. According to the Forest Department, the number of adult tigers in the core and corridor areas has now grown to at least 10, owing to increased protection. An extended habitat The Kawal Tiger Reserve was notified in 2012. It covers an area of 2,015.35 sq km under the present Nirmal, Mancherial, Adilabad and Asifabad districts. Of this, 892.23 sq km is classified as the core area, and the remaining as buffer. Given its connectivity with Tadoba in the north and the Indravati Tiger Reserve in Chhattisgarh in the east, Kawal was hoped to be an extended habitat for the spillover tigers from both States. To facilitate migration of the big cat, the Telangana Forest Department has, in its Tiger Conservation Plan submitted to the NTCA, declared a tiger corridor in the Kagaznagar and Asifabad forest divisions. The foresters counted 26 tigers entering the Kawal landscape so far, based on the data obtained from camera traps and pug marks. But several big cats which came either left or disappeared, till the arrival of Phalguna, the matriarch that gave birth to two litters of four cubs each in the Kadamba forest range in the Kagaznagar division. With many tigers disappearing, the corridor area earned the disrepute of being inhospitable to the striped cats. Very few could stay/survive due to serious man-animal conflict. Of Phalguna’s first litter, only one tigress is seen roaming in Chennur division, with a wire snare around its hip as a remnant of a failed poaching operation. None of its siblings can be seen as adult members anywhere in the core, buffer or corridor areas. From Phalguna’s second litter, two female tigers are presently seen moving in the forest ranges of the Asifabad-Kagaznagar divisions, while a male is reported to have crossed over to Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district in search of domain. Phalguna herself has not been seen for the past two years. While foresters routinely explain away disappearance of every tiger as a migration to Maharashtra, doubts linger about the truth in these claims. Official records mention three tiger deaths in the region since 2016, of which the last two were discovered within a short gap in January 2019. Both the instances came to light only when tiger body parts were confiscated from poachers. An uproar ensued and a public interest litigation was filed in the Telangana High Court by wildlife conservationist Diya Sur Banerjee, who sought judicial intervention for unified control of the Kawal Tiger Reserve. “I had done a survey for the High Court, which exposed roads and electric wires going through the core area. Deliberate electrocution caused the tiger deaths. Like any other tiger reserve, Kawal too should have one demarcated core and one buffer which helps in unified protection and management,” Banerjee said, while speaking on her petition. Responding to the petition, the High Court issued a slew of directions, which included controlling poaching, aerial bunched electric cabling in the core area, and unified command. This led to a major reshuffle in the Telangana Forest Department. Anti-poaching measures were intensified, and wire snares and other poaching devices were confiscated from the farmers who used them against marauding wild boars. Subsequently, the number of tigers entering and surviving in Telangana has increased. Agricultural encroachments The next issue is heavy fragmentation of the habitat in the corridor region. As a consequence, tigers are unable to cross over to the core area. Agricultural encroachments into the reserve forest are aplenty, especially in Kagaznagar division, often with political sanction. According to the Forest Department, encroachments in the Kagaznagar division amounted to nearly 17% of the forest land in the division. The Forest Department claims that the majority of them happened around the time of promulgation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, owing to ignorance about the cut-off date, and misconceptions about the future regularisation. The corridor area has 111 villages, of which 30-40 are unnotified tribal hamlets. Acres of cotton crop welcome visitors to these villages. ‘Cotton mafia’ is how the Forest Department officials and NGOs term the chain of cotton trading right from sowing up to the sale. “The Sahukar lends us everything — seeds, fertilizers and pesticides — and helps us with money for the labour too. After the crop is harvested, he comes to the doorstep and purchases it,” says Manepally Chinnaiah from Manneguda. The Sahukar is not keen on investing in foodgrains. The higher the area under cotton, the louder the chimes in his coffers. Fertile forest lands brought under cotton cultivation yield better crop and double his profits. Besides, cotton does not need irrigation. Kondapalle village, under the limits of which the tiger claimed its second victim Nirmala from a cotton field, has agricultural intrusions into the forest lands to the extent of 1,500 to 1,600 acres. In fact, a very narrow forest link remains amid a vast expanse of agricultural fields, due to which encounters with tigers have become common. Also, since 2005, more than 200 new families have arrived and settled in the village with 480 households. “Since 2010, forest felling spiralled in the hope that the State of Telangana, once formed, would regularise the land. Blade tractors were deployed for clearing the woods. All this could not have happened without the connivance of the Forest Department. Now, officials from the department are claiming even our own titled lands as theirs,” says the Sarpanch of the Kondapalli Panchayat, Sanjeev Upasi. Since registrations have been stopped for the lands till a joint survey is conducted by Revenue and Forest officials, none of the benefits announced by the government for the farming community are reaching the villagers. This issue assumed more importance than the tribal girl’s death when the villagers gheraoed Forest Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy, demanding titles for the lands, during his visit to the girl’s family. ‘Podu’, a form of shifting cultivation practised by Adivasis, is routinely invoked by political leaders to justify forest felling. But when an exorbitant premium is placed on land value, it is a fact that cultivation never shifts once the forest is cleared. “In the past, when there was plenty of forest area and populations were low, ‘Podu’ was perhaps a sustainable practice, but not anymore. In northern Telangana, the routine encroachments by non-tribal people with political patronage cannot be termed as ‘Podu’,” says Imran Siddiqui, founder of the Hyderabad Tiger Conservation Society and NTCA’s representative in the committee formed in the aftermath of tiger attacks. Inhabitants and foresters The Mannewar Gond tribals populating the Manneguda hamlet do not have much land anyway. Even the little they had got in the Forest Rights settlement has been lost to moneylenders. Pasula Nirmala’s parents lost theirs to the Pranahita-Chevella project which is shelved now. The family has to depend on daily wage labour and occasional hunting for livelihood, as a result of which they are seen as wildlife poachers by the foresters. However, when it comes to forest felling, all communities in the village use the services of this tribe. “Tribals hardly gain anything from forest clearance. They become pawns in the hands of other communities who use them to file cases against us,” says Forest Range Officer, Rebbana, B. Purnima. The Revenue Department routinely grants land titles to the villagers in the same survey numbers previously allotted to the Forest Department for compensatory afforestation, which complicates the problem. Mistrust defines the relations between the inhabitants and the foresters, evident in the former’s assumption that the feline attacker was let loose by the department in order to evict the villagers. The same suspicion was aired by the MP of Adilabad, Soyam Bapu Rao, who had warned the Forest Department officials to capture the tiger soon or see it poisoned. Uniformed personnel slap criminal cases and penalties against people over small pretexts such as carrying an axe into the forest. Confrontations between villagers and the forest officials are frequent and occasionally violent. Though relocation of villages from the core areas is part of the Project Tiger funded up to 60% by the NTCA, the initiative has not taken off in Telangana, as the State government has not released its grant, even after two villages were identified for a pilot and the residents volunteered to shift. No smooth journey for the big cat State and Central government projects in the corridor area too act as major disturbances for the migration of tigers. The Goleti mines of the Singareni Collieries and a minor irrigation project on Pedda Vagu at Ada village are existing disturbances, while a third broad gauge railway line connecting with the national capital, and the expansion of a national highway between Mancherial and Chandrapur, are upcoming hindrances. “For Project Tiger to be sustainable, there should be undisturbed right of way for the tigers from Central India up to the Eastern Ghats. If they are obstructed from migrating, their gene pool can’t be maintained and inbreeding will threaten the very existence of the species,” says Field Divisional Officer, Kagaznagar, M. Vijaya Kumar. As a consequence of habitat destruction, cattle grazing and resource extraction, there is a dwindling prey base for the tigers. For a sustainable prey base, there should be a minimum of 15 ungulates per sq km, as per the Wildlife Institute of India’s norms. Frequent cattle kills in the corridor area are evidence that the tiger is unable to hunt its natural prey. “We are taking measures such as ridge-to-valley water shed management and grassland development to improve the prey base. We are making attempts to reduce biotic pressures. They are paying off, and we are hopeful that one female tiger making the core area its home and breeding here will change the picture of conservation in this region,” says Field Director-Project Tiger of Kawal Tiger Reserve, C.P. Vinod Kumar. Calls are also mounting to declare the corridor area as the ‘satellite core’ of the Kawal Tiger Reserve, for intensive monitoring and better funding. Considering that each tiger/tigress requires an inviolate territory of 25 to 40 sq km, all these measures could fall short of any result, if the human-animal conflict is not reduced to its minimum. If the experience of Maharashtra and Telangana is any lesson, tiger conservation cannot be seen in isolation from the associated issues of poverty and livelihoods, which in turn determine political will. Without collaboration of actual stakeholders, there is a risk of Project Tiger becoming counterproductive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-shrinking-habitats-desperate-cats/article33825916.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Amid fault lines, a revival of the farmers’ identity||This year in Uttar Pradesh, thousands of farmers gathered on January 29, at the government inter-college ground, Muzaffarnagar, following a call by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president, Naresh Tikait, for a ‘mahapanchayat’ to express solidarity with the protest at the Ghazipur border led by his brother, Rakesh Tikait. Among the key speakers was Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, the most influential Muslim leader of the BKU, and considered to be a close friend of the late Mahendra Singh Tikait. The presence of Mr. Jaula and Muslim farmers at the meet has been read as a sign of a re-emerging Jat-Muslim alliance under the kisan identity after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots affected the social fabric in rural western U.P. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its regional leadership were behind a local caste dispute growing into a communal issue that polarised villages along religious lines. At the time, it seemed that Jat farmers had suddenly claimed the Hindutva identity. But that did not happen overnight. The farmers’ polity has had deep roots while farmers’ mobilisations have a long history in the western U.P. region. The ongoing agrarian change and crisis generated by neoliberal economic policies have shifted the agrarian economy to non-farm occupations. These new developments caused fissures in the farmer’s polity in the northwestern region, giving the BJP a political advantage. Recent events indicate a revival of the farmers’ identity as a community. A transformation The Jats have dominated landownership in large parts of western U.P. since at least the mid-19th century. Muslims form a section of the Jats, and both groups have co-existed in the villages. Between the mid-1960s- to late 1980s, the Green Revolution boosted the Jats. As landowners, they have been patrons ( jajmans) of the artisan-services and labour castes who are largely Pasmanda Muslims. The artisan-service castes are either landless or small-marginal landowners. The BKU has provided an inclusive platform to various rural groups including labourers, marginal and middle farmers across religions. In the 1980s, the BKU led by Mahendra Singh Tikait, along with Muslim farmers and landless labourers, organised protest movements for cheap electricity and higher crop prices. However, in the early 1990s, when the Green Revolution had advanced, farmers’ income stagnated and land holdings became smaller through subdivisions. Neoliberal economic policies, a decline of state subsidies to agriculture, the rising cost of farming inputs, growing stagnation in farm production, and ecological precarity, all led to non-farm economic activities, and a further weakening of Jat farmers and the BKU’s politics. Definite social changes Increasingly, villagers are found more at urban sites than in the fields. Face-to-face interactions among different communities and individuals, once common, are now a rarity. Farmers who would depend on the artisan-service castes for everyday services (repairing agricultural implements, hair dressing and washing clothes) now look to new technologies or nearby towns for these services. The breakdown of the jajmani system has resulted in a cash flow. The young generation across caste groups has come under the spell of the consumer culture. Villagers who live on non-farm incomes and remittances now self-identify as middle class. Family, kinship and an obligation-based rural economy have been transformed into an individual-centric economy based on skills and cash transactions. Intra-caste, family and kin inequalities are on the rise. The formation of rural middle class is under way which includes the Muslim artisan-service castes. Independence from jajmani relations combined with universal suffrage has not only created political competition between the Jats and their clients but also changed their mutually dependent economic interests into competing ones. In the resultant shift in attitudes among the younger generation toward the dominant caste patrons, the young generation of artisan-service castes are now asserting their rights. Such assertion by the marginalised groups often leads to skirmishes and conflicts. But the disintegration of vertical relations and everyday face-to-face interactions between different caste-communities and individuals (who work in urban areas), and the growing disconnect from the village and its social norms have all weakened the capacity of rural society to absorb and resolve everyday conflicts. More importantly, these changes have also reduced the ability of the Jats and other dominant castes to use their power and resolve conflicts in their favour. Shifting identities, BJP’s rise Distress in agriculture has led Jats to look for new avenues of employment as well as new political alliances. In a globalising economy, these shifts have brought the younger generation in proximity with the large urban Hindu middle class, influencing their tastes, language, rituals, symbols, politics and ethos. Changes in aspirations and identities forged by the new mediatised culture and mobilities have created an altered socio-cultural landscape. Communication and entertainment technologies have aided new social and economic connections, providing spaces for different socio-political formations. Economic and spatial mobilities have fragmented the Jat community. By giving representation and political offices, the BJP has tapped into the political and economic aspirations of youth. An increasing number have shifted away from their Arya Samaj roots and joined different religious and spiritual sects that are urban based and have spread to rural western U.P. With agricultural and village festivals on the decline, Hindu rituals and festivals, and religious meetings and functions organised by member-groups of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are the new centre of focus. The BJP has appropriated their symbols of pride by organising celebrations such as on the birth centenary or ‘sacrifice day’ of Jat freedom fighters. Certain TV channels (Astha) have become quite popular too. Increased interactions with the wider world have had an influence on the sense of caste and religion. Similarly, religious channels such as QTV and Peace TV are quite popular among the Muslims in this region and who are also influenced by ideas shared by young Muslims who work in West Asia about being Muslims there. In the last three decades, backward Muslims have begun to exhibit (pan-Islamic) religious symbols in public places. There are now more men and women participating in the Tablighi Jamaat, a religious movement. The ideas, norms and practices of the Tablighi Jamaat have changed the public presence of the Muslim identity. There is a growing intensification of a pan- and fundamentalist-religiosity among Muslims and Hindus in the region. Crises and a re-assemblage The political aspirations of the rising new middle class among the Jats had fragmented and weakened the kisan identity and polity in the region. In the general elections (2014 and 2019), and the U.P. Assembly elections (2017), the Rashtriya Lok Dal lost badly and a new political leadership emerged among the Jats. This new leadership of the BJP represented the aspirations of youth who perceived Muslims as a threat. However, continued agrarian distress, rising electricity charges, diesel and fertilizer costs, and unpaid dues of sugarcane by mills have severely affected Hindu and Muslim Jat farmers. The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government’s stringent anti-cattle slaughter measures have devastated already broken farmers as stray cattle ruin crops. The COVID-19 pandemic has also hit the rural economy. Jat farmers have had a hard time getting agricultural labour and help since a large number of Muslim artisan and service castes displaced by the 2013 riot have left the villages. These everyday hardships have changed their perceptions about each other. The realisation for cooperation is what compelled leaders such as Mr. Jaula, Vipin Baliyan, and Puran Singh to organise joint Hindu-Muslim kisan panchayats in 2017 and 2018. Rakesh Tikait, under the banner of the BKU, organised a massive rally just before the 2019 election and led a march to Delhi. Both Hindu and Muslim farmers were participants. In addition, the Centre’s three reform farm laws have not only created fear among the farmers of losing land but have also disenchanted them as far as the BJP is concerned. Finally, the events of the night of January 27, 2021 have hurt the dignity of Hindu and Muslim Jat farmers, and accelerated the process towards a new farmers’ alliance. The ongoing farmers’ movement has shown the potential to heal old wounds and unite the polarised western U.P. society. A new dawn beckons amidst the many insurmountable fault lines.

It was a year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. And yet, for Australians, it also started with the most devastating bushfires in our history. For all its challenges, 2020 demonstrated the importance of innovation, resources and leadership to protect and support our communities and countries. Climate change is an increasingly pressing global issue, which will require our collective will to ensure a sustainable future for our countries and for the world. By working together, we can reduce emissions — which will remain critical to ensuring global average temperatures stay well below 2° Centigrade — and adapt and build resilience to the climate change already occurring. Opportunity at summit The virtual Climate Adaptation Summit hosted by the Netherlands on January 25-26 provided a valuable opportunity to the international community for collective action to realise a more climate-resilient future. At the summit, Australia reaffirmed our commitment to ambitious and practical action to combat the impacts of climate change at home, in our region, and around the world. Australia is one of the driest inhabited continents in the world. We also have the oldest living cultures and some of the richest biodiversity in the world. We are fortunate to be able to learn from the continuing connection of the First Australians, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, to their country. For over 65,000 years their traditional knowledge and practices have preserved and protected Australia’s natural environment. The recent bushfires demonstrated the importance of bringing together traditional Indigenous knowledge about the land with modern science. Indigenous Rangers are on the frontline of this work, preserving and protecting Australia’s natural and cultural heritage. For example, using traditional fire management practices, through cool and controlled burns. Ensuring resilience Australia has committed over Rs. 1,500 crore to making our natural resources, environment and water infrastructure more resilient to drought and climate disasters. We are spending more than Rs. 200 crore on bushfire recovery efforts, supporting local communities to design their own economic, social and environmental recovery. This includes the important job of regenerating habitats, helping native animals recover and building knowledge for better land management. By July 2021, Australia will establish a new National Resilience, Relief and Recovery Agency to drive the reduction of natural disaster risk, enhance natural disaster resilience and ensure effective relief and recovery to all hazards. While our adaptation and resilience work starts at home, Australia is also committed to supporting neighbouring and global communities tackle climate change. Australia has pledged at least Rs. 150 crore over the period 2020 to 2025 for global climate finance; Rs. 50 crore of this funding will directly help our Pacific neighbours deploy renewable energy, and improve their climate change and disaster resilience. We are sharing our climate adaptation expertise, experiences and skills with the world through our development programme and the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific. Working with India Australia’s strong support for the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, spearheaded by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is another example of how we are working together with partners — such as India — to help ensure our infrastructure is resilient and adapts to the effects of a changing climate. As is our ongoing engagement with the International Solar Alliance — a global initiative designed to harness solar power to provide for the energy needs of members of the alliance. Our work with India on Water Resources Management is another important initiative initiated by India and designed to further enhance each country’s water management capabilities and share expertise and best practice. Green technologies To support our resilience and adaption efforts, Australia is also investing in and developing the green technologies of tomorrow. Indeed, Australia is aiming to leverage Rs. 7,000 crore of new investment in low emissions technologies by 2030. To get there, we recently released our Technology Investment Roadmap — a comprehensive plan to invest in the technologies we need to bring emissions down, here and around the world. We are focussed on accelerating technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture use and storage, soil carbon, energy storage to backup renewables and decarbonise transport, and low or zero emissions steel and aluminium. Dr. Alan Finkel, Australia’s Special Adviser for Low-Emissions Technologies, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January on the enormous potential of these technologies to support the global transition to net zero emissions. Widespread global deployment of those technologies will reduce emissions or eliminate them in sectors responsible for 90% of the world's emissions — 4,500 crore tonnes. Our goal is to get the cost of deploying these new technologies to parity with existing, higher-emitting alternatives. This is a practical pathway to achieve net zero emissions that also presents economic opportunity. But of course, we cannot do it alone, which is why we are working with the major economies in the region — such as India — to transfer technologies which will support lower global emissions. The Australia-India Joint Energy Dialogue will strengthen cooperation between our two countries in pumped hydro storage, cost-effective battery technologies, hydrogen and coal gasification, adoption of clean energy technology, fly ash management technologies, and solar forecasting and scheduling. And there are many more opportunities for Australia and India on low-emissions technology which we will continue to explore together as partners. Partnerships are key Whether in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, or tackling the ongoing challenge posed by climate change, we need to embrace innovation and strengthen global partnerships. We need to consider those most in need, engage all stakeholders equally and respect indigenous culture and knowledge in taking climate action. Our scientists tell us that, even with the most ambitious global emissions reductions, we will still need to adapt to changes in our climate over the coming decades. Practical actions that help us adapt to those changes and strengthen the resilience of our local environments are critical. Together with India, we can make a difference.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Regulation lite||India’s Internet-based Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming services have operationalised a code of self-regulation from February 10, soon after the I&B Ministry announced that it had prepared a set of guidelines and directives for the industry. The inexorable growth of OTT channels has infused creative talent into film-making, aided by the absence of overbearing censors and vested interests, although it might be argued that it also has a small minority pursuing crass commercialism. COVID-19 buoyed subscription revenues from home-bound viewers for OTT ventures streaming films, reality shows, serials and documentaries, and with cinemas closed, even broke the industry taboo against online-first film releases. Yet, the urgency of this code arises not from any challenge to law and order or morality posed by films, but the gauntlet of police and court cases that film-makers and the channels are now having to run. Governments are also lending tacit support to the view that creative expression may be becoming too influential to be left free. The FIRs in U.P. against the Amazon Prime Video series, Tandav , invoking legal provisions on cyber terrorism, obscenity, promoting social enmity and defiling places of worship, on the ground that its portrayal of god was derogatory, and a plea in M.P. on the same series seeking a court direction to bring OTT channels under censorship laws indicate the growing oppressive environment. It is time the Centre took a firm stand against displays of manufactured outrage and let newer channels of creativity flourish. The collective initiative of the OTT services under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India, which places emphasis on abiding by the IPC, laws on women’s and children’s rights, copyright and age-appropriate certification and parental control, while upholding Constitutional provisions on free speech, should be given an opportunity to work. Such a voluntary code is consistent with the recommendations of the I&B Ministry’s Expert Committee on film certification chaired by Shyam Benegal in 2016. The panel upheld creative expression and full ownership of any visual production, leaving viewing decisions to audiences, more accurately classifying films by viewer age, and ensuring transparency in the way reviewing bodies are constituted. The idea that films must be pre-censored and arbitrary cuts made by government-appointed nominees, mostly out of prejudice, is antiquated and repugnant to liberal societies. Clearly, a plethora of laws are available to assess, based on complaints, whether there has been an egregious violation of law, and this determination ought to be made by unimpeachable bodies representing a wide spectrum of civil society. A policed approach to films and media can only grow a monoculture of propaganda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/regulation-lite/article33825904.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Setting the tone||U.S. President Joe Biden has sounded the starting bell for the great game of bilateral give-and-take between Washington and major world powers, including India and China, when he made his first calls, as President, to key allies and partner nations. Already, it is evident that the issues and tensions that will define the cadence of U.S.-India ties and U.S.-China ties are variegated and embrace the complexity of today’s multi-dimensionally interconnected world. While some analysts complained that Mr. Biden took “too long” to call Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on February 8, it is noteworthy that the call was shortly after the White House had reached out to immediate neighbours and treaty allies, thereby indicating that Washington’s engagement with India will continue to be a priority. Mr. Biden’s call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which came two days later, reflected a sharper, even strident, exchange of views, with palpable diplomatic choke points, including China’s actions towards Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Uighur minority community in Xinjiang, making their presence felt in the call readouts. What is clear is that the Biden administration will seek to retain a few elements of the Trump White House paradigm — such as persisting with trade tariffs — while pursuing foreign policy objectives that resonate far more closely with core Democratic Party values, including fighting for the integrity of democratic institutions abroad. Indeed, the Biden White House’s insistence on keeping respect for democratic institutions front and centre amidst the gamut of bilateral issues might be causing South Block some discomfort. Given the State Department’s comments so far on the farmers’ protest in the NCR, including statements that could be interpreted as pushback against Internet outages imposed at the protest locations, Mr. Biden’s flagging “his desire to defend democratic institutions and norms around the world”, and a “shared commitment to democratic values” as the “bedrock for the U.S.-India relationship”, might not be the solace Mr. Modi’s foreign policy team was looking for. But Mr. Biden has adopted a softer approach with New Delhi than he did with Beijing — he had “fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices”, in addition to the points of diplomatic tension regarding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang. In their core message, Mr. Biden’s calls to Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi hint that unlike the transactional approach of the “America First” dogma, the thread of the U.S.’s foreign policy paradigm now will comprise progressive values, a commitment to internationalism, and reliance on regional cooperation on global governance subjects including climate change. Indeed, this could put the brakes on the accelerating global trend toward nationalism in foreign policy across the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/setting-the-tone/article33825905.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||Data buoys: inflation cools to 4.06%, IIP rises 1%||India’s retail inflation slowed to a 16-month low of 4.06% in January, helped by a sharp deceleration in food prices, while industrial output rebounded to growth of 1% in December aided by increases in electricity and manufacturing. Inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which was 4.59% in December, continued to decelerate after being stuck above the RBI’s upper tolerance threshold of 6% for six months from June to November. Rural inflation eased last month to 3.23%, while urban inflation stood at 5.1%. The moderation in consumer prices was driven by a broad-based softening in food inflation, with the Consumer Food Price Index rising just 1.89% in January, appreciably slower than December’s 3.4% pace. Concern over core However, core inflation, excluding food and fuel prices, was estimated to be at about 5.7% and hovering close to the same level as in December. Economists foresee a resurgence in overall inflation from February as a base effect wears off. The sequential momentum in core inflation had risen, following the highest ever WPI-core momentum reading in December, rising mobility indicators and falling COVID-19 cases, said Sreejith Balasubramanian, economist at IDFC AMC. “Going forward, the base effect which helped recent lower prints, will wane in February and March and the magnitude of disinflation in vegetables would also most likely ease, while the price movement in pulses and vegetable oils needs to be watched closely,” he added. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data for December provided some cheer as it revealed a recovery in output following a 2.1% drop in November. The rebound was led by a 5.1% jump in electricity production and a 1.6% increase in manufacturing output. “There is some comfort in both the IIP growth number and CPI inflation for December and January, respectively,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings, terming the 1% IIP growth a ‘gentle surprise’ to its forecast of 0.1% growth. “Our forecast of 0.1% was against the backdrop of negative growth in the core industries, but the situation has been buffered by an impressive performance of consumer goods — both durable and non-durable — with the base effect providing an upward bias,” he said, adding that increases in electronics, auto and capital goods output had also helped. The December data once again reinforced the view that the uptick witnessed in September and October was due to a combination of festive and pent up demand and the recovery was still fragile, opined Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings. “However, the positive aspect of the December 2020 factory output is that it has now crossed the pre-COVID level,” he added. Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said many non-food categories had recorded a quickening in inflation in January. “Food prices have displayed a mixed trend so far in February. The rise in onion prices, as well as higher crude oil prices and their transmission into retail fuel prices are areas of concern... We do not think January’s inflation numbers create room for an imminent rate cut,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/data-buoys-inflation-cools-to-406-iip-rises-1/article33825893.ece
13 February 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC upholds validity of e-voting results on winding up of Franklin Templeton funds||The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the validity of poll results showing a wave of consent among unitholders to the winding up of six mutual fund schemes of Franklin Templeton. The court termed objections raised about the e-voting process and the poll results as ‘mere nitpicks’. Ninety-five percent of the unitholders who voted had expressed consent to the winding up of the six schemes, the court noted in a 52-page judgment. The disbursal of Rs. 9,122 crore among the unitholders would continue unhindered. “Unitholders are the best judge and are more conversant with their own interests. All that is to be seen is that broad parameters of fairness in the administration, bona fide poll/election, and that fundamental rules of reasonable management of public business have not been breached,” a Bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna observed. One of the objections raised was against the appointment of former Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy as Observer. The court, however, dismissed the objection, saying Mr. Krishnamurthy was appointed by the court to ensure fairness and transparency. “We reject the objections to poll results and hold that the unitholders of the six schemes have given their consent by majority to wind up the six schemes,” Justice Khanna, who authored the verdict, held. The court also cleared the air on what constituted ‘consent’ in this context. Justice Khanna said ‘consent’ had to be given by a majority of the unitholders present and voting as per the Mutual Funds Regulations. “‘Consent’ in clause (c) of the sub-regulation (15) to Regulation 18 refers to affirmative consent to winding up by ‘the majority of the unitholders’... Silence on the part of absentee unitholders can neither be taken as an acceptance nor rejection of the proposal,” the court interpreted the regulations.  A section of unitholders had termed the decision to wind up as a “smokescreen to conceal misfeasance and malfeasance”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sc-upholds-validity-of-e-voting-results-on-winding-up-of-franklin-templeton-funds/article33825891.ece

13 February 2021||Chennai,||Chepauk in the grip of surface tension as India seeks redemption||The interval of the serpentine thriller in Chennai, with several twists, will soon be over with the start of the second Test at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. And this match at Chepauk will have an audience. As much as 50% of the stadium will be occupied. And spectators will lend the game colour and character. All eyes will be on the surface. The first Test saw the team batting first gain an advantage since the pitch played flat for the first two days. Toss out of the equation It appears the Indian team-management is keen on a rank turner for the second Test. Which means it wants the ball to turn from day one and do so quicker off the surface. This will, arguably, take the toss out of the equation. The surface has a fair amount of black soil. But what you do not want is a vicious turner that would give an unfair advantage to the spinners. But then, it can be hard making accurate predictions about the pitch, particularly in these times when you get to see the surface only on the day of the Test. The pitch also has clay content that will help bind the surface, and this could slow it down. So, we might still get a sluggish turner. India is likely to see two changes, with left-arm spinning all-rounder Axar Patel replacing Shahbaz Nadeem and wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav coming in for Washington Sundar. Dropping Washington would be unfortunate because his 85 in the first Test was a high-quality innings under pressure. Asked to bowl to a 7-2 field, he could not be his own self with the ball. India’s senseless use of DRS meant that when Washington found the edge of Jos Buttler’s bat, the team had run out of reviews. Then Rohit Sharma put down a sitter at mid-wicket. And in the second innings, Washington, almost totally ignored, sent down just one over in the fag end of the innings. It just did not appear fair. Whatever be the combination or the nature of the track, Virat Kohli’s rather bizarre management of overs has to improve. If you compare the symphony between the field settings and the bowling changes in the first Test here with Ajinkya Rahane’s captaincy in the last three Tests in Australia where India came back gloriously, the Mumbaikar’s handling of the bowling and the field placements was far superior. Meanwhile, England announced its 12 and there will be four changes in the eleven. Crucially, India’s nemesis James Anderson has been rested. Jos Buttler has flown back to England, Jofra Archer is injured and the inconsistent Dom Bess dropped. Anderson’s pace partner, the tall Stuart Broad — he could be a handful with his bounce and leg-cutters — accomplished wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, off-spinning all-rounder Moeen Ali and the pacey Olly Stone come in. Stone — a like-for-like replacement for Archer — will fight it out with all-rounder Chris Woakes, whose bowling style is similar to that of Anderson. It will be an intriguing choice.  The teams (from):   India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Ajinkya Rahane (Vice-capt.), Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Rishabh Pant, R. Ashwin, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Washington Sundar, Mayank Agarwal, Mohammed Siraj, Hardik Pandya, K.L. Rahul, Wriddhiman Saha and Shardul Thakur.   England: Joe Root (Capt.), Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Dan Lawrence, Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope, Moeen Ali, Ben Foakes, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Jack Leach and Olly Stone.

13 February 2021||Melbourne,||Thiem rallies to oust Kyrgios||Local fans had a night to remember as well as one to forget at the Australian Open on Friday after home favourite Nick Kyrgios took U.S. Open champion Dominic Thiem to five sets before spectators were asked to leave ahead of a lockdown in Melbourne. With his back against the wall and a fired-up home crowd cheering every Kyrgios point, third seed Thiem came back from two sets down to triumph 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in a see-saw battle. “There are easier things to do,” Thiem said when describing playing in front of a raucous crowd that will be absent for the next five days. Djokovic tested Top seed Novak Djokovic battled through an injury scare and came through an epic five-setter to beat Taylor Fritz 7-6(1), 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2 inside an empty arena after fans were asked to leave 30 minutes before midnight. Second seed Simona Halep eased past Russian Veronika Kudermetova 6-1, 6-3 while seven-times winner Serena Williams was tested in the opening set of her 7-6(5), 6-2 victory over Anastasia Potapova. Naomi Osaka beat Ons Jabeur 6-3 6-2 with a power-packed performance but also displayed her delicate side when she escorted a butterfly that had settled on her face out of harm’s way. Felix Auger Aliassime dispatched higher seed Denis Shapovalov 7-5,7-5, 6-3 in an all-Canadian affair while French Open champion Iga Swiatek advanced with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Fiona Ferro. Argentine eighth seed Diego Schwartzman suffered a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 defeat to Russian qualifier Aslan Karatsev.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/thiem-rallies-to-oust-kyrgios/article33826034.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||EB fluffs it up again||SC East Bengal’s defensive frailties at the death continued to haunt it as it conceded a stoppage-time goal, for the fourth time this season, to settle for a 1-1 draw with 10-man Hyderabad FC in an Indian Super League clash at the Tilak Maidan, Vasco, on Friday.  The result takes Hyderabad to the third spot and extends its unbeaten run to nine games while SC East Bengal (SCEB) now moves to ninth spot. The first real chance of the game fell to Joel Chianese in the 21st minute. Luis Sastre threaded a delectable through ball that released Chianese on goal. The Australian tried to place it beyond Subrata Paul but the ‘keeper made a sprawling save. SCEB’s Anthony Pilkington produced a moment of magic in the 42nd minute when he nearly gave his side the lead. The Irishman received a lob on the right flank and weaved his way into the box before unleashing a fierce left-footed strike that seemed destined to find the top corner. Laxmikant Kattimani, though, pulled off a stunning one-handed save to parry it away. The Red and Gold Brigade began the second half with great vigour and stormed ahead at the hour mark. It was a goal that came against the run of play as Aridane Santana’s shot bounced off the post and SCEB went on to score at the other end. Pilkington flicked the ball in Bright’s path and the Nigerian sprinted 50 meters before putting it past Kattimani. The switch of play was completed in all of 11 seconds. SCEB looked set to secure its fourth win of the season but it wasn’t to be as Aridane struck in stoppage-time. Substitute Fran Sandaza flashed a teasing low cross across the goal and Aridane slotted it home to earn his side a crucial point. Mohammad Yasir was sent off soon after for a rash tackle on Wahengbam Luwang, but it had no bearing on the result.  The result: SC East Bengal 1 (Bright Enobakhare 59) drew with Hyderabad FC 1 (Aridane Santana 90+1).   Saturday’s match: Chennaiyin vs FC Goa, 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/eb-fluffs-it-up-again/article33826037.ece

13 February 2021||CHENNAI,||It will turn from day one, says Rahane||Ajinkya Rahane dismissed any concerns regarding his form after a string of low scores ahead of the second Test against England which begins here on Saturday. “I don’t need to worry about what happened in the first Test. It is about what the team wants from me for this Test match. I am going to contribute. I am very confident about it,” said Rahane who had scores of 1 and 0 in the first Test, which India lost by 227 runs. The vice-captain has a lower average at home than overseas and has just one score above fifty in the last seven Tests, but pointed to his record in India’s previous home games, against South Africa and Bangladesh, when he scored a ton and a couple of half-centuries. “We are playing at home after two years. We last played at home against South Africa [sic: Bangladesh] in 2019. If you take that record, you will find something over there. “My focus is completely on how I can contribute to the team. If you take the last 10-15 Tests, you will see some runs over there,” he added. Commenting on the wicket, Rahane expressed a belief that it will offer turn from the first day. Familiar with conditions “Yeah, it looks completely different. I am sure it will turn from the opening day. But we will have to wait and see how it plays and take it from there. We have to forget what happened in the first Test. We know these conditions well. We have to put our best foot forward as a team.” While this will be the first time that an Indian Test venue will be hosting back-to-back games in a series, Rahane felt it was not a big challenge. “I don't think it will be tricky as such. Yes, the wicket will be slightly different and we will have to adjust accordingly. We have to change our plans according to how the pitch behaves and we have played quite a lot in Chennai. So the sooner we adjust to the wicket, the better it will be,” he said.  I don’t have an idea regarding this issue and what has happened. So I don't think I should comment on it Rahaneon Jaffer’s religious bias in selection while being coach of Uttarakhand||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-will-turn-from-day-one-says-rahane/article33825994.ece
13 February 2021||CHENNAI,||Freshness essential in these conditions: Root||After announcing four changes to the playing XI, England skipper Joe Root hoped that freshness in the bowling attack could make a difference for his side. When asked about pacer Olly Stone’s lack of experience outside England, Root said, “In these conditions, freshness is essential when you come into the game. Attack your spell for 3-4 overs, have a real impact and that could work in our favour going into this match.” Root added that the final decision on whether Chris Woakes or Stone will play alongside Stuart Broad would be made after Friday’s practice. Similar balance “We can have a similar balance to the last Test with Stone having the extra bit of pace. With Woakes, we can capitalise on reverse-swing, control and try to build pressure. He also strengthens our batting,” said the English skipper. Another change to the attack is the return of Moeen Ali in place of Dom Bess and the skipper hopes the former’s experience in these conditions will come in handy. “I'm very excited for him to get this opportunity. He obviously had a rough tour [in Sri Lanka], having to deal with COVID and quarantine but since then has applied himself extremely well.” Have the talent Speaking about the win in the first Test, Root said, “The thing that impressed me was how well we implemented our game-plan. We managed to get those big first-innings runs that we often talk about. Hopefully, guys can take confidence from performances like Anderson or Stokes or mine and believe they can deliver those big performances to win the series. We have the talent to do that.”  The thing that impressed me was how well we implemented our game-plan Rootabout the first Test||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/freshness-essential-in-these-conditions-root/article33825996.ece
13 February 2021||Chennai,||Three stands to be open for public||The I, J and K stands at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium will, on Saturday, be open for the first time since the 2012 ODI between India and Pakistan. This will also bring to an end a long saga that saw the three stands being out of bounds for the spectators season after season. It was only after the Madras Cricket Club (MCC), during an extraordinary general meeting in January 2020, decided to demolish its gym to create eight metres of setback space between the MCC gym and the ‘K’ stand, as ruled by the court, that the decks were cleared for the reopening of the stands in question. Then the MCC approached the Corporation and CMDA for approval to carry out the demolition. The permission was given. The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA), on its part, agreed to bear the cost of the demolition and the construction of a new MCC gym. The TNCA and the MCC had to face several hurdles along the way. The MCC had to prove that although some portions of it were heritage structures, the gym was not. Then the lease for both the TNCA and the MCC ran out and had to be renewed. This took time. The three stands, when full, can accommodate 12,000 spectators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/three-stands-to-be-open-for-public/article33826508.ece

The events will be held for under-11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 (boys and girls), men and women. As the tournament involves mostly junior players, there is a distinct possibility of parents, guardians and coaches coming to the venue. To limit the number of spectators, TNSRA is considering a number of few options. “We are looking to limit the spectators to fall in line with the government’s protocol,” Squash Rackets Federation of India (SRFI) secretary Cyrus Poncha told The Hindu here on Friday. SRFI is also planning to hold a PSA (men & women) event here by the end of March, followed by the Senior National championships. As regards the PSA event, Poncha said, “We (SRFI) have received the nod from Sports Authority of India. We are also in talks with PSA to get things finalised so that we can follow their protocol,” said Poncha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/state-closed-squash-cships-from-february-25/article33826507.ece

13 February 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||I.M. Vijayan is director of KPFA||I.M. Vijayan has been appointed as the director of the proposed Kerala Police Football Academy (KPFA). Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan made the announcement and said the football academy was formed as part of the centenary celebrations of Malabar Special Police (MSP) and will be set up in Malappuram. Honoured “I am honoured to be named as director of the Kerala Police Academy. There is a lot of talent in the State and it is important that we give them proper training at an young age. I am confident that through this academy we will be able to strengthen the grassroot football development in Kerala and contribute more national and international players from here,”' said VIjayan. However, Vijayan, who holds an AFC coaching license, was non committal on his coaching role but said he will be overseeing the sports activities. “The academy will function under the Kerala Police Sports and Youth Welfare Society and will be located in the MSP School campus. “The selected boys will be provided free food, accommodation and coaching. I will be concentrating more on the sporting activities,” he said. Vijayan, who is closely following the fortunes of Kerala Blasters in the ISL, is disappointed with the performance of the Kochi club. “It is a pretty inconsistent side. A good team will not consistently squander winning positions like this. I am disappointed at the way they lost to ATK and Mumbai. They have conceded the maximum number of goals this season which shows that there is glaring weakness in the defence,” he said. Vijayan picked Hyderabad’s Liston Colaco as the best player in this ISL. “Liston is a very good player who has a bright future ahead of him. He can become one of the best strikers in the country. He has got skills and guile to score goals from inside the box. I’m impressed with the goals he scored in this ISL. “Ashique Kuruniyan is another player to impress me but unfortunately he got injured,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/im-vijayan-is-director-of-kpfa/article33826137.ece

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Qualities of bhaktas||Uddhava has many questions for Lord Krishna, all of which the Lord answers patiently. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, we find Uddhava’s question on how a bhakta can be identified. Lord Krishna tells him about the qualities of bhaktas, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. A bhakta is anxious to worship the Lord in His archa form. He is eager to pay his respects to the Lord’s devotees. He praises and worships Krishna’s devotees. He likes to tell others about the qualities and deeds of bhaktas. A bhakta likes to hear stories about the Lord. He always meditates on the Lord. Whatever he gets in this world, he places it at the Lord’s feet. He thinks of himself as the Lord’s servant. He likes to celebrate festivals relating to the Lord, like Sri Jayanthi, for example. Bhaktas arrange for songs to be sung in temples, musical instruments to be played and dances to be offered as worship. They like to visit His temples. They offer flowers of good quality to Him, especially on days like Ekadasi. They perform the yagas prescribed in the Vedas. They worship according to the Pancharatra Agamas. They are meticulous in observing vratas like Ekadasi, for such vratas are not for worldly purposes. They help install His idol in temples. They establish flower gardens in temples, and facilitate the construction of vimanas and sannidhis in temples. Whatever they can do in a temple, they do it gladly. They do not think that any work done in a temple is inferior. Whether it is sweeping or mopping the temple floor, or doing a rangoli, they are ready to do anything. If something is offered to them in the temple, they do not see it as a reward for their service, for they do not expect a reward for serving the Lord. They are not showy. They offer to the Lord foods that He is fond of.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/qualities-of-bhaktas/article33825986.ece

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Kannur on my mind||I’ve been dreaming of a good Kerala meal for a while now. If all goes well, I hope to have a satiating Vishu feast in a couple of months at my Malayali friends’ place. Since sadhya is usually vegetarian, I thought I should, meanwhile, make the most of some fluffy appam and chicken stew. I went to the net and found that there were two new Kerala restaurants in my neighbourhood. I decided that I’d try both out. The first was Kannur (Ph: 8750483283), and the second Mariyan (Ph: 8447127533), both in Mayur Vihar Phase III. From Kannur, I ordered some parottas (Rs. 10 each), chicken curry (Rs. 120), buffalo meat fry (Rs. 120), tomato fry (Rs. 50) and (by mistake) kadhai paneer (Rs. 140). With taxes and delivery charges, the bill came to about Rs. 660. From Mariyan, a few days later, we asked for the Mariyan Special Chettinad chicken curry (Rs. 180) — though this is not from Kerala — buff meat dry fry (Rs. 160) and appam (Rs. 12 each). On the two menus are also dishes such as vegetable korma , kadala curry, egg roast, biryani and various kinds of fish preparations. I love both parottas and appams. Kannur’s parottas were flaky and crisp. I had one parotta with the chicken curry gravy, which was nicely spicy, and the tomato fry, which was rather interesting — tart, but not overly so. Even though the paneer was not on my list, it turned out to be pretty good: the pieces were soft, and the gravy was thick and creamy. I was looking forward to the buffalo meat fry, but that sorely disappointed me. I tried out a piece when it arrived, and found it much too hard. So I pressure cooked it a bit, but even then it was too chewy. I had thought I’d have one parotta with the meat fry, but after bravely struggling with the meat, I gave up. Mariyan’s buffalo meat fry, however, was delicious. It was a bit different from the ones that I’ve had over the years. For one, it didn’t have the little coconut bits that the Kannur buff had (I really enjoy the fried coconut in this dish). Second, the meat had been cut into strips, like small fish fingers. And the pieces had been dredged with corn flour and masalas, and then fried. It had a heady flavour of garlic, and the cornflour gave it an enjoyable crunch. The Chettinad chicken curry was delicious, too. The gravy was thick and had a coconutty taste, while the meat was so tender that it fell off the bone. I had the curry with two appams (which, despite the 6-odd-kilometre journey, were fluffy and soft when I had them for dinner). I missed not having parottas with the buffalo meat. Well, that can soon be remedied; all that I need to do is make a call. I am glad I have these small Kerala eateries in my neighbourhood. There was a time, not so long ago, when I used to comb the areas around hospitals in search of good Kerala food. Hospitals meant staffers from Kerala, which, in turn, translated into good regional food. Now, these eateries can be found in all parts of Delhi. Namaskaram , I say to them.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Kalari, the new yoga?||It is 6.30 am on a Tuesday, and 20 of us, between the ages of eight and 48, watch and attempt to copy Lavanyaa Gladston’s moves ( c huvadu ) and stances ( v adidu ). She does a series of warm-up jumps, push-ups, and a split without losing her breath, and though we’re not different in age, my 43-year-old body just can’t keep up with her Bharatanatyam-dancer-Kalaripayattu-practitioner’s form. “There’s a whole bottom row of people who have switched off their videos,” she says, referring to her Zoom screen, of the 40-year-olds who are too self-conscious to be seen by the younger people in the class. “But they’re also the most diligent, never missing sessions, and always turning up on time. Many of them wish they’d come to Kalaripayattu earlier.” I’ve thought about learning Kalaripayattu before, the martial arts form calling me in my search for better body confidence, and better reaction time to men who casually bump into me on the road. The fact that the closest studio was 20 km away, that I wasn’t thrilled about touching the large-bellied teacher’s feet, and that the other students managed to gracefully touch their toes to their hands held high, kept me away. Then the pandemic struck and with the lockdown, everything went online.  Online anonymity  Gladston, an architect, has students from outside of Chennai, where she is based — even from the US and Canada — who would not have had access to her if it hadn’t been for online classes. About 70% are women (for many of whom mobility in a city is a problem). And an online class is much less expensive (she charges Rs. 500 a month for two classes a week; most charge below Rs. 2,000). “The idea is to create awareness,” she says, talking of the impact the pandemic had on mental health and family finances. A martial art scores over a regular gym session because “you’re learning an art form, with flexibility, balance, and core strengthening built into the movements,” says Gladston, whose husband’s friend posted about the class on the Facebook group Gurgaon Moms, after which she received calls from the North. There are limitations, of course: there’s no 42 x 21 foot mud pit, and bedrooms and living rooms seldom have enough space to take the large steps that the form demands, while terrace floors can cause chafing, since it is performed barefoot. The aim is to learn the sequence (what Gladston says should not be compromised), and take what you can from it, whether it is the breathing, the grounding, or the basic squats and leg lifts, which were a part of India’s culture just a couple of generations ago.  Find your reason  Today, most people come to enhance their dance or fitness practice, since the form is based on animal movements; and students learn to use their minds and whole bodies to react to a threat. “Those who come for self defence may not be able to fend off a group of men, but they will gain the self-confidence, body awareness, stability, and the ability to think quickly,” says Ranjan Mullaratt, who runs the residential Kalari Gurukulam in Bengaluru and now does online classes. During the lockdown, he found students enrolling for a clutch of reasons: to utilise the time on their hands, as a physical activity, and an immunity booster. With communication coming at us about adopting all things desi and turning to immunity-led practices, people were perhaps unwittingly drawn to something that gave them both. “Yoga is slow and just half an hour of Kalaripayattu can leave you sweating,” says Mullaratt, of the cardio-intensive format that also builds strength through its preparatory exercises.  Moving towards mass  Like many movements that gather momentum, several unrelated strands have come together to give the form a push. With Kalaripayattu and three other traditional Indian martial arts forms now a part of the Khelo India Youth Games, the competition and fitness aspects will come to the fore. There’s also novelty. Eight years ago, when Varun Yadav was studying for his engineering degree, he admits that was what brought him to Kalaripayattu. “When you’re 19 or 20, you tend to show off a little,” he says, though he later imbibed the discipline of playing it down. He went on to study it seriously in a residential gurukul in Kerala. Today, when he teaches students, he knows most come because they’ve seen a Vidyut Jammwal YouTube video, or because a celebrity has put out a post about learning it. There are also figures like Sadhguru who have brought it into public consciousness, especially dispelling the notion that Kalaripayattu is native to Kerala alone. Murugan Pillai, who runs the Nithya Chaithanya Kalari Ayurveda Kendram in Delhi-NCR and Hyderabad, says a variant began in the 4th century BC. This version is now called Southern Kalari, a closely-guarded Shaivite practice in Tamil Nadu, with the sage Agasthya acknowledged as its first guru. “If you look at different martial arts forms across the world, they are closest to Southern Kalari,” he says, pushing forward the thought that it was the root of even Shaolin and other forms. What is now called Northern Kalari was propagated in the 4th century AD by Parshuram and is a Vaishnavite practice in Kerala, more accessible for today, with schools spread across the country, even the world.  The next connect  Nithin Madathipparambil, a Kochi-based practitioner who also teaches yoga worldwide on Zoom, has seen in-person enrolments increasing. “Before the lockdown, there would be one or two people a week; now there are about five walk-ins.” He believes eventually Kalaripayattu will be bigger than yoga, because “yoga and meditation talk about still energy. Kalari is about balanced energy; we still need to go out on the street and interact with people”. Kajal Srivastava, who lives in Delhi, agrees. She took it up three years ago, and hopes to see a k alari (training space) at every street corner some day. A former UPSC aspirant, she says it has transformed her as a person, boosting her body strength, her self-confidence, her immunity, and dispelling the depression that came on as she didn’t make it through the tough exam. “I lost weight, my thyroid problem was resolved, and now I have muscles. This is where I belong,” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/kalari-the-new-yoga/article33826460.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Tears in Leicester Square||After a gruelling two-month start-to-finish schedule in London in late 2019, the cast and crew of The Girl on the Train found themselves at Leicester Square in the heart of the city. The moment director Ribhu Dasgupta called ‘cut’ after the last scene, the film’s lead Parineeti Chopra broke down. “I was emotionally exhausted. I remember that last day’s wrap — I was crying and Ribhu was crying. The whole unit was crying in the middle of Leicester Square because we were all drained in the most amazing way,” she says during a Zoom interview, adding, “The next day, I felt a kind of emptiness that I hadn’t felt before. It just shows how much we gave in those two months. It felt like running a marathon and then suddenly you’re made to sit on a chair. It was a crazy experience for me.”  The Girl on the Train is an official Hindi adaptation of Paula Hawkins’ eponymous bestseller, which was also adapted by Hollywood in 2016, starring Emily Blunt, Rebecca Ferguson and Justin Theroux. The latest re-telling of the thriller that drops on Netflix later this month is the story of Meera (played by Chopra), a lawyer with a dark past and a broken marriage who begins to fixate on the perfect life of a couple she sees in their home while on her daily commute in a train. Route to adaptation While the Emily Blunt version was transplanted to New York, Dasgupta chose to keep his version true to the book and set the story in London. “I wanted to adapt this novel and film for a long time, but I didn’t have access to it. When I finished my last film with Reliance ( Te3n starring Amitabh Bachchan, which was a remake of the 2013 South Korean thriller, Montage ), Shibasish Sarkar (Group CEO, Reliance Entertainment) offered it to me saying they have the rights to the book. I had read the book and I’d seen the Hollywood film, so I knew where I should go and where I shouldn’t while adapting it,” says Dasgupta. It was the way the story has been re-told that got Aditi Rao Hydari excited to play Nusrat, the girl on the balcony. “There’s a lot of ‘Are you seeing what you are seeing or are you not?’ that adds to the mysterious element of the film,” adds Hydari. While making a film that’s been adapted before, most actors prefer to not watch the source material but Chopra wanted to see the 2016 one as a template for her personal growth as an actor. After all, Blunt’s performance did win her a BAFTA and SAG Best Actress nomination. “It was amazing to be able to have a film we could watch, not as a reference but to take whatever was needed for us. We have been inspired, and it was lovely to be able to say, ‘You remember how she did that scene?’ Those kinds of references were great for me personally,” she says, quickly clarifying, “Having said that, we’ve done a spin on it that’s completely ours. It is not like we’ve copied anything.” Interestingly, on the other end of the spectrum, is Chopra’s co-star Avinash Tiwari, who is not a big fan of the Hollywood film. “I read this script and loved it. I think actors get all the credit for their performances, but I truly feel it is collaborative. Everything comes together to create a performance — your co-actors, your director and how he’s looking at a story and what he wants to say in the film. I think these things really influence how you want to go ahead and create a performance,” says the actor, who was last seen in Netflix’s Bulbbul . The OTT switch  The Girl on the Train was meant to release in theatres last summer. But the pandemic hit, theatres shut and the world hit pause. While Kirti Kulhari, who plays Aaliya Shergill, a cop in the film, believes ‘nothing can replace that feeling of looking at a film or yourself on the big screen’, she adds, “The way events have unfolded in the last year, the game has completely changed for the better.” Hydari agrees. “I had two OTT releases that were theatricals to begin with — in Malayalam ( Sufiyum Sujatayum ) and Telugu ( V ). I was disappointed when I first heard about it, but I was so happy after those films were released. Theatre [viewing] is magical and so immersive, but one click and everyone can watch the film — it is unifying. Then it doesn’t become about Telugu, Tamil or Hindi films; it is the Indian film industry. It is about feelings and stories at the end of the day, where does language come in?” she concludes. Girl on the Train releases on February 26 on Netflix.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/tears-in-leicester-square/article33826431.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Curtains up: Chennai gets back on stage||In the last week of November 2020, Bharatanatyam exponent Malavika Sarukkai walked into the Narada Gana Sabha in Chennai after nearly nine months to record a performance for Yours Truly Margazhi , a festival organised by The Federation of City Sabhas in collaboration with Kalakendra. Besides the camera crew, and her musicians on either side of the stage, the auditorium, which seats 800, wore a deserted look. While she is used to dancing for the camera, Sarukkai says, “That afternoon, even though I missed the warmth of an audience, I danced like there was no tomorrow. I felt I had reclaimed the space where dance belongs; it was like going back home.”  Last year was the first time since 1927 — when the Margazhi season of music and dance began in Chennai— that there was a lull. Auditoriums remained empty even as the digital world came alive to recreate the live experience as closely as possible. The iconic Music Academy’s 94th annual concert went digital, with a week-long festival of music between December 24 and 31. On a note on the website, president N Murali said, “The Academy cannot be left behind in this digital revolution. It was, therefore, decided to suitably re-design and enhance its website so as to make for a more enriching and interactive experience for rasikas wherever they are situated.” Since then, no events have been held, although secretary Ramji Natarajan tells us that they are contemplating a course of action and there will be an announcement soon.  Back to action But now, from the slumber of hibernation, proscenium stages in Chennai, and across India, are slowly turning their lights on, with performances that adhere to safety protocol. On February 7, after 11 months, classical musician Sandeep Narayan drove to Hosur to perform to a live audience as part of the annual Hosuril Thiruvaiyaru . His excitement, even over the phone, is palpable. “I thrive off audience interaction and I missed that,” he says, referring to the three concerts he had recorded during what constituted the Margazhi season in Chennai. When Vaibhav Arekar met his dancers of Sankhya Dance Company last December — to just dance — he says they were all overwhelmed with emotions. The group is gearing up for two performances: one at the prestigious NCPA in Mumbai on February 20 (sold out at half occupancy), and another in Pune later in the month, with a handful of tickets still available.  This weekend contemporary dancer-choreographer Preethi Athreya presents Bird , a “series of solo movement propositions” inspired from Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s novel, A Very Old Man w ith Enormous Wings . The venue is the Alliance Française of Madras, known to host eclectic content, including the much-loved Short + Sweet Theatre Festival. When the four dancers — Deepak Kurki Shivaswamy, Surjit Nangmeikapam, Vikram Iyengar and Joshua Sailo — and Athreya met, after working individually for the past few months, she says they were “exploring beyond the composition, in an attempt to work with what it feels like to be among people, bodies, breath, and voices, again”. Lockdown makeover In the heart of Chennai, the iconic RR Sabha in Mylapore now sports a new look and feel. They conducted their own Margazhi festival in December, with about 85 people in its 250-seater auditorium. Hari Krishnaswami, secretary, Narada Gana Sabha, says the auditorium is clocking a steady increase in terms of bookings and people have begun planning as far ahead as December 2021. At Sir Mutha Concert Hall, head of operations Krish Kumar curated a concert at The Foyer, a new outdoor venue under a banyan tree. On the last Saturday of January, students of the music school on campus took part in this test run. Other additions include a VIP lounge and a ticketing portal. “I do believe that we need to do whatever it takes to revive the industry and, with that intent, the audio/lighting inventory has been slashed by 50% for the next eight months or so,” he says. From The Artery in Royapettah, which was designed for chamber concerts, founder and arts curator Ramanathan Iyer says he has reconfigured the space as a ‘set’ for recordings, along with a recording studio. He consciously opted out of going virtual, but believes every crisis is an opportunity for re-invention, adding, “Despite the democratic nature of the digital medium, we haven’t tapped into its full potential.”  It is good to be back Chennai-based Mahesh Venkateswaran, a senior technology professional who quit his corporate gig to start MadRasana ,a Margazhi concert series,, organised a six-day virtual music festival in mid-December. Artistes were recorded in interesting outdoor venues “so no concert looks the same”. He adds, “We even played around with the placement of the instruments to enhance the audio quality; the camera gives you this advantage.” He is currently ideating on how to push the bar not just in form, but also content. In December, Kalakshetra also played host to their annual festival and sold tickets at 50% occupancy. VR Devika, scholar, storyteller, cultural activist and arts connoisseur, who donned her silks and self-made mask to watch the show, recalls, “I was thrilled to be able to go out and actually watch these performances come alive... in the company of trees and the sea breeze.” At the Bharata Kalakshetra auditorium, director Revathy Ramachandran recently wrapped up the two-day Trinity Festival , which was streamed online too. “Perhaps the live is going to co-exist with the live streaming experience,” she says, addingthat “nothing can take away from the thrill of watching a dance or music performance in person”. Meanwhile, from his office in Nungambakkam, Bruno Plasse, director of Alliance Française of Madras, says he is positive of the auditorium getting back on its feet, and soon. “I think people are ready,” he says, based on the enquiries he has been receiving. Their latest event at the Edouard Michelin Auditorium was held on February 5, where two shows of Sit Down Ra , an adults-only comedy by Temple Monkeys, organised by Chennai Art Theatre, were sold out. “After all, human interactions cannot be contactless and many important decisions to start projects start with personal interaction,” concludes Plasse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/curtains-up-chennai-gets-back-on-stage/article33826436.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Open letter to Rihanna||Dear Barbadian Behen , Following your thoughtless and most unnecessary tweet, as a proud Indian, I have no choice but to write this letter to put things in perspective for you. Your position  As you well know, there are two types of West Indians. The first kind is a superior race of noble, fair, courageous folk who are never wrong. They eat khakhra , thepla , dhokla and fafda, and do the garba with devotional majama during Navratri . Examples of this upstanding race are Nirav Modi, Amisha Patel, the Gir Lion and Amitabh Bachchan (yes). They are so admirable that our entire ancient nation is currently in the process of following what has come to be known as the West Indian Model Then there is Type Two. The set you unfortunately belong to. Let’s just say this group possesses none of the qualities associated the world over with Type One. Your sort is known to spend time lazing about at picturesque beaches in minimal gear, sporting dreadlocks, drinking rum, smoking hallucinogenic herbs, eating highly un sanskari things like barbecued pig tails, and twerking. Our rights Please note, in Chapter 6, Subsection (iii) of our ancient text, Sri Mahad Jhajjanaka Charita (revised edition, 2014), these four points are made with extreme clarity. A. As per the incontestable celestial rights bestowed on us, all pardesis may — and should — praise us freely and fearlessly, and embrace us in a sanskari fashion when we go to meet them for important multibillion dollar deals. B. Pardesis are encouraged to sell us cool watches and suits, serve as background dancers for our patriotic heroes in song sequences, practise yoga, and give us jobs as CEOs. C. However, all pardesis must completely refrain from criticising us in any manner. Unless, of course, it is to do with urban naxals, librus, tukde-tukdes or Nehru, in which case we will laugh uproariously, lol!  D. Finally, we, the special blessed few, can — and will — tell white, black and other multi-hued pardesis , how to lead their lives, who to vote for and how not to wear revealing clothes as and when we feel like it.  The consequence  The most upsetting thing about your unwarranted tweet, dear Barbadian behen , is the deleterious effect it has had on our tireless crusader, our modern day Mahatmi , Kangana Ranaut. You diverted her from her righteous path by highlighting this minor issue regarding a few farmers. This inadvertently made her lose track of the real problems this country is facing. I speak of Malaika Arora and her dog Casper, of course. And the dishonour they are bringing our great nation. Deflected by your tweet, Kangana hasn’t noticed that every single time Malaika — sporting yet another gym look — takes Casper out for a walk, the nepotistic canine urinates with impunity on the nearest parked car. Or, for that matter, that Alia Bhatt is in the Maldives wearing a bikini and dancing to a Hrithik Roshan song. Or that the nepotistic kids party that KJo threw for Yash and Roohi had Taimur in attendance. Or that Hrithik Roshan (him again) and Susanne Roshan both attended Rakesh Roshan’s party. Or how Taapsee Pannu and Swara Bhasker are posing in bargain basement rip-offs of Kangana’s carefully-curated designer looks. What will happen to our nation, our culture, if Kangana doesn’t remedy these injustices? Whatever you do, Barbadian behen , in the interest of global peace, stay out of Kangana’s way. Please let her work, work, work, work. And if you must sing, why can’t you emulate Falguni Pathak? Yours sanskarily , A concerned Indian  Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/open-letter-to-rihanna/article33826438.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Revisiting spices||The Greeks call cinnamon the spice of love. Cardamom is often referred to as drops of heaven. But beyond such Hallmark-esque titles, spices often underline stories of trade and colonisation. “I remember reading that when St Thomas was asked why he was travelling to India, he said ‘to look for Christians and spices’. That stayed with me,” says writer and art historian Georgina Maddox. “Today, we take them for granted, so I wanted to bring out and enunciate everything that is associated with them.” Maddox has been toying with the idea of a show around spices for over a decade — “from the perspective of how something so innocuous could be so political” — but it was in late 2019 that things came together. “Monica Jain [curator-director of Delhi-based Art Centrix] approached me to curate something for her space and it all serendipitously fell into place,” she says. Peppery Soliloquies , with the works of nine artists, began to take shape, exploring historical narratives, emotions, taste, and more. “Then the pandemic happened and it added more immediacy, with most of us going back to the kitchen, to the very basics.” Even the farmers’ protests in New Delhi have unwittingly added another layer, she feels, because it “brings out the fact that the production of food is a very political act”.  Personal touches The mixed media show features names such as Arunkumar HG, Chetan Mevada, Karl Antao, Meghna Patpatia and Khanjan Dalal. “The artists have created new pieces or revisited older ones for the show,” explains Maddox. A few have even come from personal collections. “I was having lunch with [art curator and documentarian] Ina Puri when she mentioned that [the late painter] Manjit Bawa used to make her a delicious baingan bharta with chillies. He later painted a shora , depicting the ingredients. She has lent it to me and it will be displayed along with a handwritten note of the recipe.” Another piece is from Maddox’s own collection — a painting that Lavanya Mani had gifted her in 2006, following a discussion about spices and its colonial undertones.  From the family diary The show is also quite personal to Maddox because it explores a part of her own family’s micro-history — her mother’s love of cooking, to be exact. “I will share a table at the show, with Michael Swamy’s book, The East Indian Kitchen , which I revisited in 2020; Tract , a lovely photo book by Arunkumar HG, where he looks at the spices grown in India; and my mother’s cookbook,” she says. The book was painstakingly compiled over decades with family recipes, “secret recipes [like the ‘food for love’,” Maddox laughs], and clippings from magazines. “I began looking more closely at my history after I presented a paper in 2017, at the IIT Madras, on how the Anglo community is fading. I was advised by one of the other writers there to tap into the micro-history of my family to curate my shows and I’ve been doing that since then,” says Maddox, who is of Anglo-Burmese decent. She shares that she plans to extend this research into a book soon. Meanwhile, Peppery Soliloquies will fill in a few gaps.  From February 12 to March 12, at Art Centrix, New Delhi.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Wong welcomes the ox||Chef Andrew Wong does not dodge uncomfortable questions. “I am not politically tone deaf,” he tells me on a call from London, where his much-vaunted Pimlico restaurant, A Wong, has just won a second Michelin star, becoming the only Chinese restaurant outside China with two stars. We are talking about the backlash against the Chinese community and its culture in our pandemic-hit world, and whether restaurants such as his are affected. Wong says that initially diners in London did drop off. “But when restaurants reopened after the second lockdown, people came back. I realised how strongly Chinese cuisine is integrated into the mainstream in the UK, as it is in India,” he adds. Nevertheless, because he realises that “no one else in the world [other than the Chinese] will be celebrating the New Year of the Ox [starts on February 12] this year”, he is doing his own bit of reaching out and building bridges. Even as I write this, the restaurant A Wong is being wrapped in a vinyl mural created by multimedia artist Gordon Cheung. The installation, titled ‘The Year of the Ox’, is an outcome of an exchange between the chef and the artist on their knowledge and nostalgia about their shared heritage — “so that even people passing by can partake of it”. (An interactive app helps bring the work to life: flowers grow, an ox glistens and transforms, symbolic of how our world can too in the new year.)  A legacy of dim sum  Before he turned to his family business of restaurants, transforming the traditional Cantonese eatery his parents ran, Wong studied anthropology at the London School of Economics. It is perhaps this background that roots his inventiveness in the past. This approach to food is most visible in how he has transformed the classical dim sum. In New Delhi, at the terrace of The Oberoi, Baoshuan — sister to A Wong and a restaurant of which he is designated “mentor chef” — faces the greens of the Delhi Golf Club. Once upon a time, this space, then Taipan, had tried to replicate a traditional tea house with yum cha trolleys and endless helpings of traditional dumplings. Glitzy Delhi society had turned it into a power brunch of sorts. When Wong was invited to conceive a restaurant here in 2018, he undid the former trappings of power and glory. The dim sum at Boashuan’s newly-introduced Infinity Brunch (Rs. 3,250++, per head) have a zingy freshness only faintly reminiscent of the classical. Among the hot new entrants are a hedgehog bao and a runny 63 degree egg, baked with a pot-sticker, all of which come individually plated but in a service style that seems to have got much lighter than in the restaurant’s initial days, perhaps in keeping with 2021’s casual-is-in sensibilities. Wong’s signature reworking of the classics is evident in the Shanghai dumpling, injected with an acidic burst of ginger-vinegar, and topped with pickled tapioca. “It took me 10 years to perfect this dim sum,” he says. The hargao , supposed to be a test of any dim sum chef’s skill, is transformed with a foam of vinegar. “Historically, there were around 2,000-3,000 dim sum, though the world is fixated on just 50 items on every menu,” says Wong, who travelled through China researching its regional traditions. Dim sum were not just dumplings, but any small plates, including pickles and soups, and many references to their incredible variety are found in classical poetry and art. It is this tradition of inventiveness that he follows at his restaurants in London and New Delhi; a tradition that will evolve in the Year of the Ox, “not in terms of actual deliciousness perhaps but because eating dim sum is about sharing and friendships”. In a new year as the world puts behind its isolation, newer ways to connect will emerge. Through food, art, or food as art.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/wong-welcomes-the-ox/article33826465.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Sabyasachi: Back at Bergdorfs||Most people may not even have bought new calendars yet, but Sabyasachi Mukherjee has already had a busy five weeks. The brand and designer entered a 51% strategic partnership with Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited (ABFRL), and fulfilled one of his oldest dreams to sell a full collection at Bergdorf Goodman. His pop-up store at New York’s pre-eminent luxury department store runs between February 18 and March 20. Previously having designed collections for Pottery Barn, Thomas Goode & Co, Christian Louboutin, and the yet-to-be-released H&M, he is no stranger to international fascination. This would be his second innings at Bergdorf Goodman. Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, Mukherjee launched his jewellery line at the New York store. It was a regal fest, as far as the designs are concerned. None of those diffusion or prêt adjustments to suit an international audience. “My new line for Bergdorf is a historic moment. Not only are they acknowledging an Indian designer, but they are acknowledging the Indian consumer,” he says. This, because for the first time, Bergdorf Goodman will be selling saris and lehengas among others, right next to international luxury brands. It is the first time an Indian designer has been invited to sell Indian clothes and not just its sensibility. The timing is particularly sweet to him, as “US Vice President Kamala Harris just broke the glass ceiling, and there are so many Indians on US President Joe Biden’s cabinet”. Having returned disillusioned from NYC as a young designer (“everybody wanted a piece of India as long as it wasn’t too Indian”), he had promised himself that he would return to the city only on his own terms. Bergdorf is the biggest seal of approval for any designer. While his own NYC store launches in 2022, this move is a strong opening statement.  Blue hair and silk trench coats The collection and campaign imagery are in his signature palette and is one of his youngest and breeziest iterations yet. The clothes could easily be gender agnostic (he echoes this generation’s voice — conversations on sexuality and gender are no longer debates and should be beyond controversy). One of the models sports blue hair, a departure from his preference towards slicked back hair or big bouffant styles for the bridal campaigns. In a true celebration of Indian crafts and heritage, quilted silk trench coats in solid colours and loungewear (approx Rs. 48,000 to Rs. 1.77 lakh), his signature mixed-media printed kaftans, pashmina scarves (approx Rs. 73,000 to Rs. 6.99 lakh) and 24K gold Benarsi saris (Rs. 3.97 lakh) make the collection. There is also a new fine jewellery edit (Rs. 3.61 lakh to Rs. 2.5 crore). Not bad, keeping in mind that he turned the collection around in a record 60 days. Bergdorf’s will also mark the global launch of the Sabyasachi handbag collection, featuring embroidery and unique motifs, ranging from approximately Rs. 17,000 to Rs. 1.3 lakh.  Enough with the memes What does he have to say about ABFRL’s acquisition in the Sabyaschi brand, reportedly worth Rs. 398 crore? “A lot of designers enter partnerships as distress sales. Our brand is a profit-making company,” is his response. Mukherjee, who turns 47 this month, wants to use the next decade or so to build the company and choose a successor to last beyond his years. He is well aware of the rumours and jokes, though. “People have been asking if I am going to be available at Pantaloons now.” He makes it clear he is a couture brand and that partnerships are back-end strategies to grow businesses. “Mr Birla and I have immense respect for how the other has built their business. We are clear on wanting to grow the brand together from strength to strength. Value systems cannot be replaced by money.” He feels responsible for the people who have worked with him for years and their families — in part, why he entered the strategic partnership with ABFRL.  An inclusive manifesto While Mukherjee is known to be an astute businessman, he is also sentimental. “The brand belongs to the people now,” he says.. And of course, there are plans to introduce more products with accessible price points within accessories, and venture into beauty and wellness. His on-hold H&M collection would have been that thought in motion. “As a middle-class boy, I could never go to a disco or visit malls. I couldn’t afford it. I know what it feels to be excluded. H&M was my great moment of joy, to be able to engage with a larger audience.” He is under an NDA, but hints that the collection will come back. But first, India “It is time for the world to realise that India is not only a back-end service centre for global luxury brands,” Mukherjee observes, adding that it irks him when people say India cannot deliver quality. “The only thing India hasn’t been able to do is stand up for itself and market itself well!” The pandemic has shifted our value systems, that is evident. The focus is on karigari , and products that carry history. To a discerning shopper who can look beyond marketed luxury, India is at the forefront. For brand Sabyasachi though, an India-first manifesto has been its North star from the beginning. Beyond the glam campaigns and shows, his clothes are simple. There’s a sherwani or bundi jacket for a man, and a lehenga , a sari or salwar kameez for the woman; no unrealistic trails or power shoulders. The clothes don’t confuse you, and they’ll last you a lifetime — that is his true gift to India, and now the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/sabyasachi-back-at-bergdorfs/article33826437.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||The virtual date debate||It was January 2020 and Pavitra L* was ready to quit the world of online dating after three years. “It was stale, seeing the same people on multiple apps,” says the 26-year-old architect from Mumbai, sharing that she “did take frequent breaks, sometimes for months”. Once the Covid-19 lockdown hit in March, however, she was back, ready to swipe right on anyone with whom she felt she could have a conversation. “There’s only so much that you can interact with parents and siblings,” she laughs, adding that friends too were busy adapting to the new work-from-home life. Dating apps swung into action too. For a month in April, Tinder made its (paid) Passport feature free for everyone; for instance, users in Delhi could chat with someone in Dubai. They also brought their ‘Swipe Night’ — an interactive choose-your-own-adventure experience, where your choices impact who you match with later — to the Indian market for three consecutive weekends. Meanwhile, Bumble tied up with Airbnb for virtual experiences like Turkish Fortune Coffee Reading, while OkCupid suggested online date ideas such as working out together.  Pandemic a leg up for apps?  Since mid-2018, login data had shown that online dating apps were on the decline. US-based marketing research company, eMarketer, found a steady downward trend of their usage. Cut to 2021, and we’re living in a completely different world. While both Bumble and Tinder, India’s top dating platforms, declined to share the total number of users in the country, regulars on the apps say there has been a definite surge. A recent report in The Hindu noted that “consumers across the globe spent more than $3 billion on dating apps in 2020, a 15% increase from the previous year”. While there’s always a notable spike in usage and in-app spending around Valentine’s Day, last year, the numbers remained consistent even after February 14, states app intelligence firm, App Annie. But now that India has ‘unlocked’, the question is how have expectations and attitudes changed with regard to dating from pre-pandemic times? Simran Mangharam, dating coach and founder of Floh, a platform that connected singles at events, started online coaching last June, when she was forced to put Floh on pause. Now, she has around 300 clients, meeting a maximum of four a day for one-hour sessions that vary from just being a space to talk to giving specific tips for virtual dates such as “hold your coffee cup” a la Will Smith-starrer Hitch . She has noticed a definite shift, pre-pandemic to now. “With the lockdown, people started introspecting and did a lot of work on themselves. They actually pointed out things that they were doing wrong, that did not get them what they wanted in terms of the person or the relationship. For example, a girl was very stuck on the kind of person she wanted — profession, city. She later told me: ‘I realised that these were barriers I had put up; my parents weren’t saying anything’. Earlier, I used to nudge them to arrive at this conclusion.” Mangharam adds that a lot of people, men in particular, who were on the fence now want to be in a committed relationship. They ask, ‘How should I go about it? my goal is to get married.’ The pandemic has accelerated the timelines that they’ve given themselves.”  Swipe stories  Bengaluru-based independent researcher Yogesh G (27), like many others, was in a bind during the lockdown. Having been on dating apps like Tinder and Grindr since 2016, and using chat rooms on Yahoo and Imo to make connections, he was no stranger to virtual dating. In a bid to “channel [his] sexual energy”, he got on Blued, a Chinese social networking app for gay men and transpersons. “From April to August, I ended up having video chats with everyone from auto and truck drivers to men with corporate jobs,” he says. Chennai-based Prashant V, a techie and paid member of multiple dating apps since 2014, says the number of matches he got went up exponentially during the lockdown. “I felt like a lot of people ended up on these apps for lack of anything better to do. It was definitely the best time to get phone numbers and start chatting/video calling outside of the platforms, something people were reluctant to do earlier,” shares the 27-year-old. A case in point is Rithick Sinha. Boredom drove the 23-year-old engineering student (who moved back home to Lucknow from Pune) to download Tinder, before switching over to Bumble and Hinge. “It was a way to interact with new people, to connect with anybody who you’re not seeing day in and day out. Once you sift out the fake profiles with Angelina Jolie’s pictures, of course,” he says wryly.  Looking for #deep  But what’s missing, according to most people, are deep and spontaneous conversations. “When you’re talking to somebody in person, their answers are less forced and you can make out what their real thoughts are,” says Sinha. He, like many other users we spoke to, prefers going offline with his dates. Despite multiple methods of interaction, including video calls, he feels that intangible concept of ‘chemistry’ between two individuals is hard to decipher when you are seeing a 2D version of a person on screen. Anupa Samuel (30), a teacher in Bengaluru, agrees. She has used all the dating apps out there (“you name it and I’ve been on it!”) because “I’m always looking for something serious”. Last year, she connected with around 20 women over chat and video calls. “I even had a virtual dinner date. However, it just wasn’t like having a ‘real’ meal with somebody. I wouldn’t do it again. I’m glad that places have opened up and certain people are okay coming out,” she says.  What the apps have to say  Bumble India PR Director, Samarpita Samaddar, however, says their data has a different story to tell when it comes to online interactions. With over 540 million messages exchanged by Indian users in 2020, they interpret the data to show that people are taking more time to get to know each other. “This has led to more virtual communication before the relationship is taken offline,” she says, adding that according to an internal study 78% of users feel the need to build trust before meeting in person, in keeping with the ‘slow dating’ trend of 2021. Rovan Varghese, a counsellor who works with adults, both single and in relationships, across the gender and sexuality spectrum in Bengaluru, says that the uncertainty of the times could be driving people closer emotionally at a faster rate. “Topics like life goals, philosophies, intimate details regarding one’s successes, failures and disappointments... things that you wouldn’t put forward to someone who was going to be your date tomorrow. People are becoming more vulnerable and putting their real selves up front,” he says. Pavitra admits that she opened up to her matches last year and had candid conversations about earlier relationships, family, and future plans. Describing it as a cathartic experience — not unlike a confessional — she says, “It was freeing to be able to compare notes with someone going through the exact same thing that I was.” But she feels that conversations have taken a more superficial tone once the lockdown lifted, and the possibility of in-person meetings became a reality once more. (Bumble’s latest study found that almost 73% of single Indians are ready to travel a couple of hours within their city for an in-person with someone they met online.) Meanwhile, Tinder, where the age group skews younger (Gen Z, ages 18 to 25), shares that the demographic may have a different approach. Rashi Wadhera, Director of Communications, anticipates a couple of trends for 2021. “Today, it would be hard to deny that ‘real life’ is both physical and digital. For Gen Z, online dating is dating. Meeting people on an app is normal. Secondly, members have repurposed what the app offers [to find non-romantic connections].” Their recent survey found that as many as 62% say they have redefined their dating goals, behaviour, or etiquette.  Success stories  For some, companionship have turned into relationships. Yogesh is now in a polyamorous relationship, having met his partner on Grindr. Prashant has been off the apps for close to seven months. “I met my now-girlfriend on Tinder three years ago, and we remained friends. The pandemic kind of escalated things, and we’re dating now,” he says. This speaks to the worldwide trend where isolation had many texting their old flames. Mangharam can attest to this. “People really reconnected with people from the past; whether it was friends, family or exes. Regarding relationships, it really depends on why things didn’t work out the first time. I would tell them to see how they are feeling because red flags like infidelity are patterns that will not change and, in those cases, they should stay away.” Did anything long term emerge from reconnections? “At least three of my clients are getting married to their exes!” she concludes.  * names changed on request||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-virtual-date-debate/article33826480.ece

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai’s emerging hotspots||While the pandemic has led to economic uncertainties across the real estate sector in the country, Chennai has bucked the trend and witnessed growth. The city’s realty sector has been witnessing steady growth since the third quarter ending September 2020 and the uptick is due to three important factors: a lowered rate of interest, pent-up demand translating to sales velocity and an urge to own a home. The perceived pent-up demand has transitioned into a trend, resulting in an increase in sales over the last two quarters and this is expected to sustain in the coming quarters as well. Where culture meets technology Chennai embodies a perfect amalgamation of rich cultural heritage with modern technology as it is a strong manufacturing base with burgeoning IT/ITeS spaces. Offering a wide spectrum of residential options, the city caters to the high-end IT population that fuels the demand for mid and high-end homes. At the same time, it also addresses the needs of the traditional manufacturing class, with limited affordability, which has given rise to affordable homes. Mount Poonamallee High Road (MPR) and Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Road (PTR) have emerged as residential hotspots in the city, driven by the growth of IT / ITeS spaces, good connectivity with other key locations in the city, a robust road network and well-developed social infrastructure. Strong residential demand backed by good commercial supply and improving infrastructure is expected to push the prices further in the coming years. In addition to good physical infrastructure, it also offers robust social infrastructure and a well-rounded lifestyle which is expected to attract end-users. Despite the dip due to the pandemic, Chennai’s hotspots witnessed almost stable sales in the last three quarters. The reason to be optimistic about the future demand potential in these areas is due to the emergence of business parks in the vicinity with good supply in the offing. New job opportunities coupled with improving connectivity thanks to the Metro Rail is likely to drive the demand for residential units here. Well-connected with industrial hubs of Ambattur and Avadi, MPR promises to emerge as a destination for both investors and end users. With an office supply of 11 million sq.ft. with good social infrastructure and proximity to the airport, metro rail services and Guindy, the micro market has had the highest appreciation of property prices in the city since the announcement of the metro rail corridor from Lighthouse to Poonamallee. Peek into Pallavaram Other areas that are seeing a high demand for offices and homes include the Pallikaranai - Medavakkam stretch and PTR located in proximity to Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) and GST Road. Large business parks set up by reputed national and international developers along with many standalone office buildings along OMR are easily accessible from these zones. Located in South Chennai, PTR in particular is showing positive prospects for both residential and the commercial office spaces with attractive rental rates and capital value. The micro market is gaining prominence as an office market with an upcoming 13 million sq. ft. of Grade-A office supply by reputed national and international developers creating 1,30,000 jobs in the next 3-4 years. The strong IT development with good connectivity is expected to drive residential demand, pushing it to surpass the supply in the next couple of years which is likely to fuel a strong price appreciation. With educational institutions, hospitals, retail malls and other civic facilities coming up here, it is an attractive option for buyers and investors. With the ongoing road-widening and flyover project at Keelkattalai along with upcoming three metro stations at GST Road (Pallavaram - Kothandan Nagar), Keelkattalai (Eachankadu) and on OMR (Okkiyam-Thoraipakkam), the PTR stretch is likely to witness significant commercial and residential development, well-developed social infrastructure and excellent connectivity.  Looking ahead Over the years, Chennai has carved out an identity for itself as a stable market. Despite COVID-19, new launches in 2020 bounced back to 92% of the launches that happened in 2019, while sales reached 50% of the pre-COVID era. This growth momentum is expected to continue in 2021 backed by historic low interest rates, flexibility of developers in terms of payment schemes and price negotiations, strong growth in commercial realty and the industrial sector and various stimulus packages offered by the government.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Build a fence of financial security||The year 2020 is forgettable but the lessons we’ve learnt from it shouldn’t be forgotten. The crisis and uncertainty did bring introspection among many who neither had proper back-up nor were prepared to face the financial challenges. One of the many challenges most faced was a drop in income or even worse, losing jobs; those depending on business income too had to face uncertainties with shop closures. The secret of being ‘cash-wise’ is to build a fence of financial security around us. The following points would be handy to face tough situations that may come unannounced yet again in the future: Loan-to-earning quotient Loans are taken to fulfil dreams and aspirations, and home loans remain the largest in quantum and longest in tenure of repayment. Most of one’s income goes towards home loan EMIs and one should be prudent enough to plan the repayment capacity. Ideally, the income should be split into three parts: towards mandatory household expenses; all types of EMIs; and investing for the future life goals. In simple terms, if one is earning Rs. 60,000 per month, Rs. 20,000 should be allocated for each of these three important aspects. Home loan insurance At the time of taking a home loan, the entire amount should be insured; if the borrower dies during the course of the long repayment tenure, the insurance company would settle the loan dues with the lender and the house will be free of any mortgages in favour of the surviving family members. In fact, the one-time premium too can be clubbed with the loan that gets merged with the overall EMI. So, there should be no reason why one should not insure the loan. Contingency funds The pandemic has taught the best lesson of being financially prudent: one should keep aside, either in a liquid fund (a low risk debt mutual fund) or in a bank fixed deposit, six months’ worth of mandatory financial commitments including household expenses, all types of EMIs, rent (if any) and such other unavoidable commitments. For example, if the household monthly expense is Rs. 15,000, EMI Rs. 20,000 and monthly rent is Rs. 10,000, then Rs. 45,000 x 6 = Rs. 2.70 lakh should be invested separately to meet any contingencies that may occur unannounced. Fixed or floating rate While banks and lending institutions are quick to increase the rate of interest, they may not show the same enthusiasm during a drop in rates (based on the monetary policy announcements done by RBI regularly). Yet, it would be a better decision to choose a floating rate loan than a fixed rate option.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/build-a-fence-of-financial-security/article33826483.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Of vetiver blinds and jaalis||Some memories from childhood stay with us forever. For me, one such memory is of my visits to small, quaint libraries in Salem. The smell of the books and the fragrance from vetiver ( khus ) blinds still linger. I remember helping my mother spray water on these blinds during warm summer days and then the cool breeze would waft in, filling the room with the aroma of vetiver. This was our natural air conditioning system. These blinds are made from the roots of vetiver, which is a perennial tall grass. Its roots are aromatic and other than blinds and mats, they are used for making a fragrant oil that is used in perfumes and aromatherapy. Like bamboo, this material is also an environmentally-friendly option that adds charm to our indoor spaces. While a spray of water on vetiver blinds works to cool air in hot and dry regions, for humid conditions of Chennai, they work just as well without the water. The narrow slits in these blinds will allow the passage of breeze and, combined with high openings for hot air, ensures adequate and continuous ventilation within indoor spaces. In today’s context when mechanical air conditioning leads not only to environmental damage but also to adverse health effects, open grills and/or jaalis are better options. They allow the free flow of breeze and augmented with blinds, they control glare. In order to prevent water ingress during the monsoon, adequate shading will need to be provided by means of deep overhangs or verandahs. The use of jaalis will also address safety concerns. The pattern of openings in such grills leads to the Venturi effect — where the velocity of wind increases when it passes through smaller openings, leading to a deeper penetration of the breeze into the indoor spaces. The blinds would also serve as a heat and glare control device, to be used when required. The use of conventional glass shutters could then be avoided, which are not only unnecessary when open but also only end up letting in heat when closed. Artistic designs in these jaalis will result in interesting patterns of light and shadow. In fact, traditional jaalis involved extensive handiwork by artisans and were a major aesthetic element in Indian, Indo-Islamic and Islamic architecture. Today, prefabricated jaalis made with terracotta and precast concrete are readily available. Custom designs can be created in materials as varied as natural stone and metal as well. It’s a given that these design interventions can be artistic, cost-effective, are healthier for us, and more importantly, foster environmental sustainability. So the next time you are looking at redoing your interiors or perhaps getting a home built, make use of these materials and see the wonders they can do for your spaces.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Kalari, the new yoga?||It is 6.30 am on a Tuesday, and 20 of us, between the ages of eight and 48, watch and attempt to copy Lavanyaa Gladston’s moves ( c huvadu ) and stances ( v adidu ). She does a series of warm-up jumps, push-ups, and a split without losing her breath, and though we’re not different in age, my 43-year-old body just can’t keep up with her Bharatanatyam-dancer-Kalaripayattu-practitioner’s form. “There’s a whole bottom row of people who have switched off their videos,” she says, referring to her Zoom screen, of the 40-year-olds who are too self-conscious to be seen by the younger people in the class. “But they’re also the most diligent, never missing sessions, and always turning up on time. Many of them wish they’d come to Kalaripayattu earlier.” I’ve thought about learning Kalaripayattu before, the martial arts form calling me in my search for better body confidence, and better reaction time to men who casually bump into me on the road. The fact that the closest studio was 20 km away, that I wasn’t thrilled about touching the large-bellied teacher’s feet, and that the other students managed to gracefully touch their toes to their hands held high, kept me away. Then the pandemic struck and with the lockdown, everything went online.  Online anonymity  Gladston, an architect, has students from outside of Chennai, where she is based — even from the US and Canada — who would not have had access to her if it hadn’t been for online classes. About 70% are women (for many of whom mobility in a city is a problem). And an online class is much less expensive (she charges Rs. 500 a month for two classes a week; most charge below Rs. 2,000). “The idea is to create awareness,” she says, talking of the impact the pandemic had on mental health and family finances. A martial art scores over a regular gym session because “you’re learning an art form, with flexibility, balance, and core strengthening built into the movements,” says Gladston, whose husband’s friend posted about the class on the Facebook group Gurgaon Moms, after which she received calls from the North. There are limitations, of course: there’s no 42 x 21 foot mud pit, and bedrooms and living rooms seldom have enough space to take the large steps that the form demands, while terrace floors can cause chafing, since it is performed barefoot. The aim is to learn the sequence (what Gladston says should not be compromised), and take what you can from it, whether it is the breathing, the grounding, or the basic squats and leg lifts, which were a part of India’s culture just a couple of generations ago.  Find your reason  Today, most people come to enhance their dance or fitness practice, since the form is based on animal movements; and students learn to use their minds and whole bodies to react to a threat. “Those who come for self defence may not be able to fend off a group of men, but they will gain the self-confidence, body awareness, stability, and the ability to think quickly,” says Ranjan Mullaratt, who runs the residential Kalari Gurukulam in Bengaluru and now does online classes. During the lockdown, he found students enrolling for a clutch of reasons: to utilise the time on their hands, as a physical activity, and an immunity booster. With communication coming at us about adopting all things desi and turning to immunity-led practices, people were perhaps unwittingly drawn to something that gave them both. “Yoga is slow and just half an hour of Kalaripayattu can leave you sweating,” says Mullaratt, of the cardio-intensive format that also builds strength through its preparatory exercises.  Moving towards mass  Like many movements that gather momentum, several unrelated strands have come together to give the form a push. With Kalaripayattu and three other traditional Indian martial arts forms now a part of the Khelo India Youth Games, the competition and fitness aspects will come to the fore. There’s also novelty. Eight years ago, when Varun Yadav was studying for his engineering degree, he admits that was what brought him to Kalaripayattu. “When you’re 19 or 20, you tend to show off a little,” he says, though he later imbibed the discipline of playing it down. He went on to study it seriously in a residential gurukul in Kerala. Today, when he teaches students, he knows most come because they’ve seen a Vidyut Jammwal YouTube video, or because a celebrity has put out a post about learning it. There are also figures like Sadhguru who have brought it into public consciousness, especially dispelling the notion that Kalaripayattu is native to Kerala alone. Murugan Pillai, who runs the Nithya Chaithanya Kalari Ayurveda Kendram in Delhi-NCR and Hyderabad, says a variant began in the 4th century BC. This version is now called Southern Kalari, a closely-guarded Shaivite practice in Tamil Nadu, with the sage Agasthya acknowledged as its first guru. “If you look at different martial arts forms across the world, they are closest to Southern Kalari,” he says, pushing forward the thought that it was the root of even Shaolin and other forms. What is now called Northern Kalari was propagated in the 4th century AD by Parshuram and is a Vaishnavite practice in Kerala, more accessible for today, with schools spread across the country, even the world.  The next connect  Nithin Madathipparambil, a Kochi-based practitioner who also teaches yoga worldwide on Zoom, has seen in-person enrolments increasing. “Before the lockdown, there would be one or two people a week; now there are about five walk-ins.” He believes eventually Kalaripayattu will be bigger than yoga, because “yoga and meditation talk about still energy. Kalari is about balanced energy; we still need to go out on the street and interact with people”. Kajal Srivastava, who lives in Delhi, agrees. She took it up three years ago, and hopes to see a k alari (training space) at every street corner some day. A former UPSC aspirant, she says it has transformed her as a person, boosting her body strength, her self-confidence, her immunity, and dispelling the depression that came on as she didn’t make it through the tough exam. “I lost weight, my thyroid problem was resolved, and now I have muscles. This is where I belong,” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kalari-the-new-yoga/article33826169.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Open letter to Rihanna||Dear Barbadian Behen , Following your thoughtless and most unnecessary tweet, as a proud Indian, I have no choice but to write this letter to put things in perspective for you. Your position  As you well know, there are two types of West Indians. The first kind is a superior race of noble, fair, courageous folk who are never wrong. They eat khakhra , thepla , dhokla and fafda, and do the garba with devotional majama during Navratri . Examples of this upstanding race are Nirav Modi, Amisha Patel, the Gir Lion and Amitabh Bachchan (yes). They are so admirable that our entire ancient nation is currently in the process of following what has come to be known as the West Indian Model Then there is Type Two. The set you unfortunately belong to. Let’s just say this group possesses none of the qualities associated the world over with Type One. Your sort is known to spend time lazing about at picturesque beaches in minimal gear, sporting dreadlocks, drinking rum, smoking hallucinogenic herbs, eating highly un sanskari things like barbecued pig tails, and twerking. Our rights Please note, in Chapter 6, Subsection (iii) of our ancient text, Sri Mahad Jhajjanaka Charita (revised edition, 2014), these four points are made with extreme clarity. A. As per the incontestable celestial rights bestowed on us, all pardesis may — and should — praise us freely and fearlessly, and embrace us in a sanskari fashion when we go to meet them for important multibillion dollar deals. B. Pardesis are encouraged to sell us cool watches and suits, serve as background dancers for our patriotic heroes in song sequences, practise yoga, and give us jobs as CEOs. C. However, all pardesis must completely refrain from criticising us in any manner. Unless, of course, it is to do with urban naxals, librus, tukde-tukdes or Nehru, in which case we will laugh uproariously, lol!  D. Finally, we, the special blessed few, can — and will — tell white, black and other multi-hued pardesis , how to lead their lives, who to vote for and how not to wear revealing clothes as and when we feel like it.  The consequence  The most upsetting thing about your unwarranted tweet, dear Barbadian behen , is the deleterious effect it has had on our tireless crusader, our modern day Mahatmi , Kangana Ranaut. You diverted her from her righteous path by highlighting this minor issue regarding a few farmers. This inadvertently made her lose track of the real problems this country is facing. I speak of Malaika Arora and her dog Casper, of course. And the dishonour they are bringing our great nation. Deflected by your tweet, Kangana hasn’t noticed that every single time Malaika — sporting yet another gym look — takes Casper out for a walk, the nepotistic canine urinates with impunity on the nearest parked car. Or, for that matter, that Alia Bhatt is in the Maldives wearing a bikini and dancing to a Hrithik Roshan song. Or that the nepotistic kids party that KJo threw for Yash and Roohi had Taimur in attendance. Or that Hrithik Roshan (him again) and Susanne Roshan both attended Rakesh Roshan’s party. Or how Taapsee Pannu and Swara Bhasker are posing in bargain basement rip-offs of Kangana’s carefully-curated designer looks. What will happen to our nation, our culture, if Kangana doesn’t remedy these injustices? Whatever you do, Barbadian behen , in the interest of global peace, stay out of Kangana’s way. Please let her work, work, work, work. And if you must sing, why can’t you emulate Falguni Pathak? Yours sanskarily , A concerned Indian  Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Tears in Leicester Square||After a gruelling two-month start-to-finish schedule in London in late 2019, the cast and crew of The Girl on the Train found themselves at Leicester Square in the heart of the city. The moment director Ribhu Dasgupta called ‘cut’ after the last scene, the film’s lead Parineeti Chopra broke down. “I was emotionally exhausted. I remember that last day’s wrap — I was crying and Ribhu was crying. The whole unit was crying in the middle of Leicester Square because we were all drained in the most amazing way,” she says during a Zoom interview.  The Girl on the Train is an official Hindi adaptation of Paula Hawkins’ bestseller, which was also adapted by Hollywood in 2016, starring Emily Blunt, Rebecca Ferguson and Justin Theroux. The latest re-telling of the thriller that drops on Netflix later this month is the story of Meera (played by Chopra), a lawyer with a dark past and a broken marriage who begins to fixate on the perfect life of a couple she sees in their home while on her daily commute in a train. Route to adaptation While the Emily Blunt version was transplanted to New York, Dasgupta chose to keep his version true to the book and set the story in London. “I wanted to adapt this novel and film for a long time, but I didn’t have access to it. When I finished my last film with Reliance ( Te3n starring Amitabh Bachchan, which was a remake of the 2013 South Korean thriller, Montage ), Shibasish Sarkar (Group CEO, Reliance Entertainment) offered it to me saying they have the rights to the book. I had read the book and I’d seen the Hollywood film, so I knew where I should go and where I shouldn’t while adapting it,” says Dasgupta. It was the way the story has been re-told that got Aditi Rao Hydari excited to play Nusrat, the girl on the balcony. “There’s a lot of ‘Are you seeing what you are seeing or are you not?’ that adds to the mysterious element,” adds Hydari. While making a film that’s been adapted before, most actors prefer not to watch the source material but Chopra did, as a template for her personal growth as an actor. After all, Blunt’s performance did win her a BAFTA and SAG Best Actress nomination. On the other end of the spectrum, is Chopra’s co-star Avinash Tiwari, who is not a big fan of the Hollywood film. “I read this script and loved it. I think actors get all the credit for their performances, but I truly feel it is collaborative. Everything comes together to create a performance — your co-actors, your director and how he’s looking at a story and what he wants to say in the film. These things really influence how you want to go ahead and create a performance,” says the actor, who was last seen in Netflix’s Bulbbul . The OTT switch  The Girl on the Train was meant to be released in theatres last summer, when the pandemic hit and theatres shut. While Kirti Kulhari, who plays Aaliya Shergill, a cop in the film, believes ‘nothing can replace that feeling of looking at a film or yourself on the big screen’, she adds, “The way events have unfolded in the last year, the game has completely changed for the better.” Hydari agrees. “It is about feelings and stories at the end of the day.

13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Sabyasachi: Back at Bergdorfs||Most people may not even have bought new calendars yet, but Sabyasachi Mukherjee has already had a busy five weeks. The brand and designer entered a 51% strategic partnership with Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited (ABFRL), and fulfilled one of his oldest dreams to sell a full collection at Bergdorf Goodman. His pop-up store at New York’s pre-eminent luxury department store runs between February 18 and March 20. Previously having designed collections for Pottery Barn, Thomas Goode & Co, Christian Louboutin, and the yet-to-be-released H&M, he is no stranger to international fascination. This would be his second innings at Bergdorf Goodman. Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, Mukherjee launched his jewellery line at the New York store. It was a regal fest, as far as the designs are concerned. None of those diffusion or prêt adjustments to suit an international audience. “My new line for Bergdorf is a historic moment. Not only are they acknowledging an Indian designer, but they are acknowledging the Indian consumer,” he says. This, because for the first time, Bergdorf Goodman will be selling saris and lehengas among others, right next to international luxury brands. It is the first time an Indian designer has been invited to sell Indian clothes and not just its sensibility. The timing is particularly sweet to him, as “US Vice President Kamala Harris just broke the glass ceiling, and there are so many Indians on US President Joe Biden’s cabinet”. Having returned disillusioned from NYC as a young designer (“everybody wanted a piece of India as long as it wasn’t too Indian”), he had promised himself that he would return to the city only on his own terms. Bergdorf is the biggest seal of approval for any designer. While his own NYC store launches in 2022, this move is a strong opening statement.  Blue hair and silk trench coats The collection and campaign imagery are in his signature palette and is one of his youngest and breeziest iterations yet. The clothes could easily be gender agnostic (he echoes this generation’s voice — conversations on sexuality and gender are no longer debates and should be beyond controversy). One of the models sports blue hair, a departure from his preference towards slicked back hair or big bouffant styles for the bridal campaigns. In a true celebration of Indian crafts and heritage, quilted silk trench coats in solid colours and loungewear (approx Rs. 48,000 to Rs. 1.77 lakh), his signature mixed-media printed kaftans, pashmina scarves (approx Rs. 73,000 to Rs. 6.99 lakh) and 24K gold Benarsi saris (Rs. 3.97 lakh) make the collection. There is also a new fine jewellery edit (Rs. 3.61 lakh to Rs. 2.5 crore). Not bad, keeping in mind that he turned the collection around in a record 60 days. Bergdorf’s will also mark the global launch of the Sabyasachi handbag collection, featuring embroidery and unique motifs, ranging from approximately Rs. 17,000 to Rs. 1.3 lakh.  Enough with the memes What does he have to say about ABFRL’s acquisition in the Sabyaschi brand, reportedly worth Rs. 398 crore? “A lot of designers enter partnerships as distress sales. Our brand is a profit-making company,” is his response. Mukherjee, who turns 47 this month, wants to use the next decade or so to build the company and choose a successor to last beyond his years. He is well aware of the rumours and jokes, though. “People have been asking if I am going to be available at Pantaloons now.” He makes it clear he is a couture brand and that partnerships are back-end strategies to grow businesses. “Mr Birla and I have immense respect for how the other has built their business. We are clear on wanting to grow the brand together from strength to strength. Value systems cannot be replaced by money.” He feels responsible for the people who have worked with him for years and their families — in part, why he entered the strategic partnership with ABFRL.  An inclusive manifesto While Mukherjee is known to be an astute businessman, he is also sentimental. “The brand belongs to the people now,” he says.. And of course, there are plans to introduce more products with accessible price points within accessories, and venture into beauty and wellness. His on-hold H&M collection would have been that thought in motion. “As a middle-class boy, I could never go to a disco or visit malls. I couldn’t afford it. I know what it feels to be excluded. H&M was my great moment of joy, to be able to engage with a larger audience.” He is under an NDA, but hints that the collection will come back. But first, India “It is time for the world to realise that India is not only a back-end service centre for global luxury brands,” Mukherjee observes, adding that it irks him when people say India cannot deliver quality. “The only thing India hasn’t been able to do is stand up for itself and market itself well!” The pandemic has shifted our value systems, that is evident. The focus is on karigari , and products that carry history. To a discerning shopper who can look beyond marketed luxury, India is at the forefront. For brand Sabyasachi though, an India-first manifesto has been its North star from the beginning. Beyond the glam campaigns and shows, his clothes are simple. There’s a sherwani or bundi jacket for a man, and a lehenga , a sari or salwar kameez for the woman; no unrealistic trails or power shoulders. The clothes don’t confuse you, and they’ll last you a lifetime — that is his true gift to India, and now the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sabyasachi-back-at-bergdorfs/article33826291.ece

13 February 2021||CHANDIGARH,||AAP is an outsider in Punjab, says CM||Ahead of the municipal elections in Punjab, slated for February 14, while the main Opposition Aam Aadmi Party had been cornering the Congress over the deteriorating law and order in the State, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said AAP could not even find a face from the State to campaign in the civic elections. “With just a year to go for the Assembly polls, AAP could not find a face from Punjab to campaign in the municipal election and had to drag in non-entities from Delhi for electioneering! And now they claim they’ll find a CM face that will be the pride of Punjab,” said Capt. Amarinder. He said AAP continues to blunder its way through the State, with absolutely no understanding or concern about the problems of its people. “All they see here is another State to rule, another seat of power,” said Capt. Amarinder. He added that AAP was an outsider in Punjab and will remain so as long as it continues to be disconnected from the State’s ground realities. The exodus of AAP leaders and members from the party’s Punjab unit over the past two to three years is just the tip of the iceberg, the fact is that they have no roots here, said the Chief Minister. “Arvind Kejriwal’s party has no existence outside Delhi, and will soon be wiped out from there too, given their shameless collusion with the BJP, at whose behest they have been trying to befool the lakhs of farmers camping outside their city for more than two months now,” he added. ‘CM should resign’ Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition and AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema accused the State government of ruining the law and order situation and demanded the resignation of the Chief Minister. “AAP had raised the issue multiple times and said that the Congress could resort to violence through its goons to loot the municipal elections,” said Mr. Cheema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-is-an-outsider-in-punjab-says-cm/article33826176.ece
13 February 2021||February 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Wong welcomes the ox||Chef Andrew Wong does not dodge uncomfortable questions. “I am not politically tone deaf,” he tells me on a call from London, where his much-vaunted Pimlico restaurant, A Wong, has just won a second Michelin star, becoming the only Chinese restaurant outside China with two stars. We are talking about the backlash against the Chinese community and its culture in our pandemic-hit world, and whether restaurants such as his are affected. Wong says that initially diners in London did drop off. “But when restaurants reopened after the second lockdown, people came back. I realised how strongly Chinese cuisine is integrated into the mainstream in the U.K., as it is in India,” he adds. Nevertheless, because he realises that “no one else in the world [other than the Chinese] will be celebrating the New Year of the Ox [starts on February 12] this year”, he is doing his own bit of reaching out and building bridges. Even as I write this, the restaurant is being wrapped in a vinyl mural created by multimedia artist Gordon Cheung. The installation, titled ‘The Year of the Ox’, is an outcome of an exchange between the chef and the artist on their knowledge and nostalgia about their shared heritage — “so that even people passing by can partake of it”. Before he turned to his family business of restaurants, Wong studied anthropology at the London School of Economics. It is perhaps this background that roots his inventiveness in the past. This approach to food is most visible in how he has transformed the classical dim sum. In New Delhi, at the terrace of The Oberoi, Baoshuan — sister to A Wong and a restaurant of which he is designated “chef-patron” — faces the greens of the Delhi Golf Club. Once upon a time, this space, then Taipan, had tried to replicate a traditional tea house with yum cha trolleys and endless helpings of traditional dumplings. Glitzy Delhi society had turned it into a power brunch of sorts. When Wong was invited to conceive a restaurant here in 2018, he undid the former trappings of power and glory. The dim sum at Boashuan’s newly-introduced Infinity Brunch (Rs. 3,250++, per head) have a zingy freshness only faintly reminiscent of the classical. Among the hot new entrants are a hedgehog bao and a runny 63 degree egg, baked with a pot-sticker, all of which come individually plated but in a service style that seems to have got much lighter than in the restaurant’s initial days, perhaps in keeping with 2021’s casual-is-in sensibilities. Wong’s signature reworking of the classics is evident in the Shanghai dumpling, injected with an acidic burst of ginger-vinegar, and topped with pickled tapioca. “It took me 10 years to perfect this dim sum,” he says. The hargao is transformed with a foam of vinegar. “Historically, there were 2,000-3,000 dim sum, though the world is fixated on just 50 items on every menu,” says Wong, who travelled through China researching its regional traditions. Dim sum were not just dumplings, but any small plates, including pickles and soups, and many references to their incredible variety are found in classical poetry and art. It is this tradition of inventiveness that he follows at his restaurants in London and New Delhi; a tradition that will evolve in the Year of the Ox, “not in terms of actual deliciousness perhaps but because eating dim sum is about sharing and friendships”. In a new year as the world puts behind its isolation, newer ways to connect will emerge. Through food, art, or food as art.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/wong-welcomes-the-ox/article33826170.ece
13 February 2021||New Delhi,||HC issues notice to Manipur govt., NHRC in extra-judicial killing case||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought response of the Manipur government and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on a plea alleging that the commission has “failed” to enforce its direction to the State to pay compensation to the kin of two victims of extra-judicial killings. Justice Prathiba M. Singh impleaded the State of Manipur as a party in the matter and issued notice to it and NHRC seeking their stand on the plea by human rights activist Suhas Chakma. The court asked the State government to indicate in its response the steps taken by it to implement the NHRC’s March 5, 2020 direction to pay Rs. 5 lakh to the victims next of kin. Human rights violations Mr. Chakma, who runs an NGO —National Campaign for Prevention of Torture — , which was established to address human rights violations in and around the country, has moved the court against the NHRC’s September 8, 2020 order. The order said if the State does not comply with the March 5, 2020 direction the next of kin can approach the competent court of law to claim the compensation amount. Advocate Nitesh Kumar Singh, appearing for Mr. Chakma, told the court that the NHRC has ample powers to ensure its directions are implemented and it ought not to have asked the next of kin to approach the competent court of law for implementation of the compensation order. Mr. Singh told the court that the NHRC’s decision to close the case by way of the September 8, 2020 order was “unreasonable and unjustified”. The petition has claimed that NHRC has “failed to discharge its basic function as a statutory body established for better protection of human rights and wrongly directed the next of kin of victims of extra-judicial killing to approach the competent court of Law for claiming the relief as was granted by it”. The NHRC order had come on a complaint filed in January 2009 by Mr. Chakma alleging extra-judicial killing of two persons —Ningthoujam Anand Singh and Palungbam Kunjabihari alias Bose — by a combined force of Manipur Police commandos and 16th Assam Rifles at Kanglatombi Makhan road in Imphal on January 21, 2009. Thereater, in February 2019 after considering all the submissions/reports including Magisterial Inquiry Report, the NHRC held that the two deceased were killed by the combined force of Manipur Police Commandos and 16th Assam Rifles in an extra judicial manner and their right to life was violated, the petition has said.  On March 5, 2020, the NHRC rejected Manipur government’s claim that the encounter was real and directed it to submit a report within six weeks indicating it has complied with the recommendation to pay the compensation. However, on September 8 last, the commission closed the case and said the next of kin can approach the court of law for seeking the relief awarded by NHRC. Mr. Chakmahas sought setting aside of the September 8, 2020 order and directions to NHRC to take coercive measures against the State government to ensure implementation of its order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-issues-notice-to-manipur-govt-nhrc-in-extra-judicial-killing-case/article33826180.ece
13 February 2021||New Delhi,||North Mayor made fake documents to occupy govt. land, alleges AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party on Friday alleged that North Mayor Jai Prakash has made “fake” documents to occupy government land and demanded that he resign from his post. “Yesterday [Thursday] on behalf of AAP, I exposed Mr. Prakash. We exposed how the BJP Mayor has illegally occupied land of the DUSIB. I also presented various proves regarding how the local SHO and the DUSIB have repeatedly requested the civic body to stop this illegal construction but it did not happen. After the press conference, Mr. Prakash came up with some documents, which were fraudulent,” said AAP leader Durgesh Pathak. “Today, I want to ask questions to Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and Siddharthan — who look after the organisation — their reaction on these fraud documents. The BJP leadership must clarify whether they believe that in their organisation such fraud is accepted or not. The Delhi BJP leadership should come clean,” Mr. Pathak said. He said AAP has also decided to not participate in any proceeding of the NDMC till the Mayor resigns. The party also demanded the Congress to make their stand on the issue clear.  BJP refutes allegations Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said it was shocking that when all its efforts to politically malign civic bodies failed, AAP was trying to malign BJP leaders by raising their personal property matters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/north-mayor-made-fake-documents-to-occupy-govt-land-alleges-aap/article33826183.ece

A Bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and A J Bhambhani directed the Social Welfare Department of the Delhi government to file a detailed status report regarding steps taken by them and listed the matter for hearing on February 18. The Bench said the report shall include photographs and videography of the centre as it exists currently as well as subsequent to the remedial steps taken by the department. The direction was issued by the court after perusing a report submitted by an Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) who was deputed on orders of the high court to visit the detention centre and carry out an inspection of the conditions prevailing there. According to the report filed by the ASJ, the conditions were deplorable at the centre. The court on November 9 last had issued directions for inspection of the centre by a judicial officer while hearing a plea by an Indian woman, whose husband, alleged to be a Pakistani national, has been lodged at Lampur after completing his jail sentence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/remedy-pathetic-conditions-at-lampur-detention-centre/article33826178.ece

Mr. Bidhuri accused Mr. Bhardwaj of “twisting facts and telling lies” stating that the land in question was only 809 square meters and not two acres as was being alleged by AAP spokesperson. “Two AAP party MLAs were members of the DDA [which was part of the process to allot the land to the BJP] and the party should rather ask its own legislators whether this allegation is true or being made of frustration,” he added. According to Mr. Bidhuri, the BJP had applied for land for its Delhi office in 2001 and the cost of the land was deposited in 2002. It was on May 12, 2010, he said, that the land was allotted by the DDA when the UPA II government led by Dr. Manmohan Singh was in power. “Arvind Kejriwal should immediately remove Mr. Bhardwaj from the post and apologise to the BJP and its leadership,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lop-demands-removal-of-aap-spokesperson/article33826182.ece
