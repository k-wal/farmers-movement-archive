G.V. Prasad, co-chairman and managing director, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, said in a joint statement with RDIF: “We are pleased to partner with RDIF to bring the vaccine to India. The Phase 1 and 2 results have shown promise, and we will be conducting Phase 3 trials in India to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators. Sputnik V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against COVID-19 in India.” The RDIF said in the statement, “The Sputnik V vaccine, which is based on well-studied human adenoviral vector platform with proven safety, is undergoing clinical trials for the coronavirus pandemic. Deliveries could potentially begin in late 2020 subject to completion of successful trials and registration of the vaccine by regulatory authorities in India.” The agreement does not include manufacturing the vaccine in India. An RDIF spokesperson said the organisation was still looking for manufacturers. The Dr. Reddy’s-RDIF agreement constitutes the second major international deal for supplying a potential vaccine after the agreement between British company AstraZeneca and the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/russia-inks-pact-to-test-supply-sputnik-v-vaccine-to-india/article32625279.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||China rebuts Rajnath, says India violated agreements||China on Wednesday blamed India for “violating” border agreements and said India bore responsibility for the recent tensions, a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament that China had, by amassing troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) this summer, violated the 1993 and 1996 boundary agreements that have helped keep the peace along the border for years. “The responsibility for the current situation does not lie with China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press briefing, in response to a question on Mr. Singh’s statement. Asked why China had not yet disengaged and withdrawn its troops to the status quo as of April, prior to its transgressions, Mr. Wang said: “The most urgent and important task is for the Indian side to immediately correct its wrong course of action, disengage on the ground as soon as possible, and take concrete actions to promote easing of the situation.” “It is the Indian side that has violated the agreements, first trespassed, and first fired shots to threaten the safety of the Chinese border troops,” he said. On the “five point consensus” reached on September 10 by the two Foreign Ministers in Moscow, he said China “hopes India will work with China to follow through on the agreement and other previously reached agreements, and put the border issue in an appropriate position in the bigger picture of China-India relations”. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported Chinese troops had last week “raised their combat readiness to the second-highest possible” level after the firing of warning shots on September 7 near the south bank of Pangong Lake. The newspaper said “the alert was lowered after a meeting of the nations’ foreign ministers” in Moscow three days later.

17 September 2020||CHENNAI,||Discrepancies in T.N.’s COVID-19 data||A part of an internal report compiled by the Health and Family Welfare (HFW) Department in Tamil Nadu to present to officials at the highest level has shown data that is different from the COVID-19 data publicly reported by the State in its bulletins every day. The report available with The Hindu had data till September 7. Compared with the media bulletin released for the same day, this data showed a difference of 26,224 additional COVID-19 cases admitted till then to different types of institutions (including home quarantine), and 414 more in the total deaths. The deviation was in one page, which was the part of the report capturing the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals, COVID Health Centres (CHCs), COVID Care Centres (CCCs), and those in home isolation. This category-wise data is not part of the State’s daily media bulletin. It instead gives the total number of people under treatment in all different facilities combined, which is always in sync with the total number of active cases given in the bulletin. As per this specific data in the internal report, TN had a total of 4,95,480 COVID-19 positive admissions in various facilities and 8,339 deaths till September 7. However, the publicly released bulletin had only 4,69,256 cases and 7,925 deaths till that day. Interestingly, while the total number of cases and deaths was higher, the number of active cases on September 7 as per this data was only 44,067, which was 7,148 cases lesser than the data in the media bulletin (51,215). Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan attributed the mismatch to possible duplications or other minor inconsistencies that might have crept into the data collected in the particular format. The same data on admissions collated by the department on September 11 (also available with The Hindu ), had a mismatch of 24,336 more in total cases, 450 more in deaths, and 6,847 lesser in active cases.T. Jacob John, renowned virologist and retired Professor of Clinical Virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said that while the inconsistency cannot be immediately attributed to any underreporting of data or lack of transparency, it clearly showed the inefficiencies in collection of data when it came to public health. “We have long neglected data in our health management system. For instance, we have never counted tuberculosis or diphtheria properly. The exception was polio as we had a goal of zero,” he said, adding that COVID-19 has once again stressed the importance to be given to data. J. Radhakrishnan, Health Secretary, ruled out underreporting or staggered reporting of COVID-19 data. By way of explanation, he attributed the mismatch to possible duplications or other minor inconsistencies that might have crept into the data collected in the particular format. The control room run by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine is the nerve centre, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/discrepancies-in-tns-covid-19-data/article32625281.ece

17 September 2020||TIRUPATI,||Tirupati MP Durgaprasad dies in Chennai hospital||Balli Durgaprasad Rao, Member of Parliament representing the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha constituency, died while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Chennai on Wednesday. Mr. Durgaprasad, 64, a native of Venkatagiri town, was earlier with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and jumped on to the YSR Congress PARty bandwagon just ahead of the elections. Earlier, he had won from the Gudur Assembly seat on TDP ticket. He made eyebrows raise when the YSRCP chose him for Tirupati Parliamentary seat, as he was then considered a total stranger to the temple city, as more than half of the parliamentary constituency spread over to the adjoining SPSR Nellore district. Braving the odds, he emerged triumphant, thanks to the Jagan wave that was sweeping the state, by defeating his nearest rival and former union minister Panabaka Lakshmi, who had jumped around the same time from the Congress to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Senior politicians from the district, especially from the ruling YSRCP, expressed their shock over the demise of the senior politician. YSRC regional in-charge and TTD trust board Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy condoled the death of the three-time MLA and now MP and his sincere efforts to reach out to the public. Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family members of the departed leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tirupati-mp-durgaprasad-dead/article32625217.ece

17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Chargesheet filed in Delhi riots case||The Delhi Police Special Cell investigating the “larger conspiracy” behind the riots in north-east Delhi submitted a chargesheet at the Karkardoma Court in east Delhi on Wednesday. “The chargesheet includes the names of 15 persons who were charged under the stringent UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act] and other serious charges like murder, rioting and attempt to murder. The persons named in the chargesheet were found instigating people gathered at anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protest sites,” said a police officer. “It took 195 days to complete the first phase of investigation. During this period, 747 witnesses have been examined and approximately 75 electronic devices have been seized as part of the investigation. Based upon scientific, documentary and testimonial evidence, a total number of 15 accused have now been chargesheeted out of the 21 persons arrested so far,” the Delhi police said in a statement. The remaining six persons are expected to be chargesheeted in due course, after collecting sufficient evidence and completing statutory and procedural requirements, added the statement. The chargesheet submitted on Wednesday runs to 11 volumes, totalling over 17,000 pages. A senior police officer said that the protesters blocked roads at 25 places and that blocking a road was undemocratic. Out of 747 witnesses, 95 recorded their statement before a magistrate in a court. A WhatsApp group created in the name of a Delhi protest support group was the main platform where violence was planned on the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump in Delhi, the officer said. In a chat, a man gave the instruction to evacuate the protest site the moment violence began, he added. The remaining six Police said that they had filed a chargesheet against 15 people, and for the remaining six — Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid, Mohammad Illyas, Mohammad Pervez Ahmad, Danish and one more — a supplementary chargesheet would be submitted. The riots that broke out in parts of north-east Delhi in February 2020 claimed 53 lives, 583 persons were injured, and there was destruction and damage of both government as well as private properties on a huge scale, the police said. Claims amounting to more than Rs. 20 crore to compensate for the loss of property had been filed before the Delhi government, which indicated the scale and immense cost of the tragedy, added the police. Over 16,000 Police Control Room calls were received and a total of 751 cases were registered by Delhi police in connection with the riots. Fifty-nine cases were assigned to a Special Investigation Team constituted in the Crime Branch; 691 cases were investigated by the district police; and one case, registered on March 6 to investigate the larger conspiracy behind the riots, was assigned to the Special Cell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chargesheet-filed-in-delhi-riots-case/article32625249.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘India’s presence at Afghan talks vital’||The Intra-Afghan Negotiations (IAN) under way in Doha are an “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned” process at last, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said, calling India’s decision to take part in the event involving the Taliban an “important step”. However, he said neither the U.S. nor India can ‘impose’ what political system Afghan representatives choose to adopt after the talks, nor is it yet certain that the start of talks will see the declaration of a ceasefire soon. “India has always said there should be an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process and [External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar] repeated that stand,” Mr. Khalilzad said in an exclusive interview to The Hindu , shortly after his visit to Delhi on Tuesday. “You could say that before it was an American-led Afghan process...but now it is an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process, with the delegations sitting across the table from each other, without a foreigner sitting in the room, for the first time. These groups, or warring parties, are now talking with each other to negotiate a roadmap for the future of their country,” he said. During his brief visit, Mr. Khalilzad and his U.S. delegation met Mr. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval for a 90-minute discussion on the IAN process. While he welcomed India’s decision to join the event and to send a senior level delegation there, Mr. Khalilzad declined to comment on whether India has now decided to open talks with the Taliban directly and whether this was discussed. Keeping the momentum In his speech at the IAN, Mr. Jaishankar had urged the negotiators not to lose the ‘progress’ that Afghanistan has made in the last two decades after the fall of the Taliban and the establishment of a democratic country. When asked, however, the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan Reconciliation said it was up to the Afghan negotiating teams to decide. “We obviously are not seeking to impose our political system on the Afghans, they have to decide that through negotiations, whether it is for an electoral democracy or some other formula,” Mr. Khalilzad said on concerns that the Taliban will seek to impose Islamic Sharia code and dismiss the democratic process as they did from 1996 to 2001. “But there are universal values that we will watch, and we hope they will include, including the freedoms for minorities, women, rule of law, ending corruption, democracy, elections and a free press. We will see what they do...If they don’t respect those values, we will have to reassess at that juncture,” he said. Mr. Khalilzad’s comments run counter to a statement by Afghanistan’s First Vice President Amrullah Saleh that there would be no compromise on the “political framework” of Afghanistan. “If [Taliban] want to violate the framework, it will harm them and their supporters,” Mr. Saleh was quoted as saying on Monday, adding that he had been assured of that by the U.S. delegation which includes Mr. Khalilzad and U.S. National Security Senior Director Lisa Curtis. The differences underline Mr. Khalilzad’s task in the next few weeks as he continues to shuttle between Doha, where the Taliban negotiators are based, Kabul where he is speaking with the Ghani government, and Islamabad where he reportedly sought the Pakistan Army chief’s assistance in ensuring flexibility from the Taliban leadership based there on ensuring a reduction of violence, during a visit on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indias-presence-at-afghan-talks-vital/article32625268.ece

In its communication, the DCGI has instructed the company to take extra care during screening, providing additional information in informed consent and close monitoring for adverse events during a follow-up of the study. The SII has also been asked to submit to the DCGI’s office details of medication used in accordance with the protocol for the management of adverse events. This past Saturday, British-Swedish biopharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford said clinical trials for their vaccine candidate had resumed in the U.K. after the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority confirmed that the trials were safe. SII had earlier this week submitted the recommendations of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), U.K. and DSMB, India, and requested permission to restart enrolment in the clinical trial.

17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||MSP is here to stay, asserts Nadda||With long term ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) opposing three Bills related to agriculture, including the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, cleared by the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, BJP president J.P. Nadda hastened to dispel misgivings, saying the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) shall remain despite the Bills that seek to deregulate the sector. “The three Bills related to agriculture introduced by the Modi government in Parliament will boost production and help farmers get better prices for the produce,“ Mr. Nadda said at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi on Wednesday. Underlining that farmers were at the core of the government’s policies, he said that all the three farm sector Bills were far-sighted and would boost agriculture production. When asked about the MSP, he asserted that it would continue to stay. The government on Monday introduced ‘The Farmers’ Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill’, ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill’, and ‘The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill’ to replace the ordinances promulgated earlier. “These Bills will help farmers get betters price for their produce through a transparent system,” Mr. Nadda said. Taking on the Congress, he said its opposition to the Bills was nothing but politics. The BJP was doing what the Opposition party had promised in its manifesto, he added. Farmers’ groups in Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against the Bills, saying there is no adequate safety net for small and marginal farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/msp-is-here-to-stay-asserts-nadda/article32625235.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC seeks response to plea on airports||The Supreme Court asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to respond to a plea that there was a “deliberate omission” for years to install a fail-safe system to stop aircraft from overshooting runways at vulnerable airports such as Mangaluru and Kozhikode. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Ministry and the DGCA on a writ petition filed by Delhi resident Rajen Mehta, represented by advocate Shohit Chaudhry. Mr. Mehta sought the installation of the Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) in at-risk airports across the country, especially Kozhikode and Mangaluru. He said the EMAS could have averted the tragic Mangaluru air crash of 2010 and the recent one in Kozhikode. Timely installation could have saved lives and crores of rupees in aircraft loss. “The existence of EMAS was brought to the knowledge of Air Authority of India (AAI) and the respondents [DGCA and Civil Aviation Ministry) in 2008. However, for no plausible reason, it has not been installed till date. During this time, the aviation industry has seen two horrific incidents at Mangalore and Calicut causing loss of hundreds of lives, which could have been saved by the timely action of the respondents,” the petition said. EMAS was installed in approximately 125 airports across the world, it pointed out. Mr. Mehta also sought an Inquiry into the delay in installing EMAS despite specific knowledge about the vulnerability of the Mangaluru and Kozhikode airports. He said criminal action should be initiated against the officials responsible for the delay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-seeks-response-to-plea-on-airports/article32625212.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||‘Govt. was slow to react on COVID-19’||In the first discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic in Parliament, Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha accused the government of being slow to react because of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit and imposing an all-round lockdown without due preparations. Congress’s deputy leader in the House Anand Sharma opened the debate by questioning the government’s claim that the lockdown imposed on March 26 saved the spread of COVID-19 to 14-29 lakh persons. “The House must be informed as to what is the scientific basis on which we have reached this conclusion that but for the sudden lockdown, the number of cases could have risen by 29 lakh. The day the lockdown was imposed, there were 600 cases. But, as we are discussing this subject, there are 50 lakh cases and almost 82,000 deaths. This is the true picture,” he said. The government’s claim that the death rate was one of the lowest in the world was also false, as neighbouring countries Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka had reported fewer deaths. The abiding image of migrant workers trudging back to their homes on highways was what the world saw, he stated. Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said there was a need to understand the chronology of events. The first COVID-19 case was found in India on January 30. “What was happening on February 24? Donald Trump was visiting India and was being hosted,” he recalled. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva, too, charged the government with a delay in imposing the lockdown because of Mr. Trump’s visit. Samajwadi Party’s Ravi Prakash Verma said Indian airports were not closed just to oblige Mr. Trump. He alleged that wherever Mr. Trump’s entourage went in Delhi, Ahmedabad and Agra, the places became a hotspot. Congress Chief Whip Jairam Ramesh expressed his disappointment in a tweet, “Deeply disappointing that Members were not allowed to speak fully on the COVID-19 situation. What is the point of having this session and MPs coming from all over the country, if MPs have severe time restrictions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-was-slow-to-react-on-covid-19/article32625240.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||97 people died onboard Shramik Specials, says govt.||Ninty-seven people lost their lives while travelling in the Shramik Special trains, which were run to help migrant workers stranded due to the nationwide lockdown to reach their home State, the government on Wednesday told Parliament. The statement comes two days after the government had told Parliament that it did not have any data on the workers who had lost their jobs and lives during the pandemic. In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said, “Based on the data provided by the State police, 97 persons were reported to have passed away till 09.09.2020 while travelling on board Shramik Special trains during COVID-19.” He said the State police had sent the bodies for post-mortem in 87 cases. “51 post-mortem reports have been received from respective State police so far, in which reasons for deaths have been shown as cardiac arrest/heart disease/brain haemorrhage/pre-existing chronic disease/chronic lung disease/chronic liver disease etc,” he said. The Minister said policing on the Railways is a State subject and prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law and order on the Railway premises and running trains are the statutory responsibility of the States. They discharge these duties through the Government Railway Police /District Police and Railway Protection Force supplement the efforts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/97-people-died-onboard-shramik-specials-says-govt/article32625253.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||New Parliament project: Tata’s Rs. 861 cr. bid is lowest||Tata Projects Limited’s financial bid of Rs. 861.9 crore for the construction and five-year maintenance contract of a new Parliament building was the lowest of the two bids opened by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on Wednesday, according to the bid documents. After seeking pre-qualification bids, in which seven companies applied, the CPWD, in June, narrowed the field to three potential bidders and gave them till 3 p.m. on Wednesday to submit their bids. While the Tata’s bid was 8.4% less than the CPWD’s estimated cost of Rs. 940 crore, Larsen and Toubro Limited submitted a bid of Rs. 865 crore, which was 8.07% less than the estimated cost. The third bidder, Shapoorji Pallonji and Co. Ltd., did not submit its bid by the deadline, an official of the Housing and Urban Affairs (HUA) Ministry said. An official spokesperson of Tata Projects Limited confirmed it was the lowest bidder and said it was likely to win the contract. Citing security concerns and the nature of the project, the CPWD had opted for pre-qualification of potential bidders before inviting financial and technical bids. The project, which is a part of the HUA Ministry’s larger Central Vista redevelopment plan announced last year, is scheduled to be completed in 21 months from the start of construction, according to the CPWD’s invitation for bids.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-parliament-project-tatas-rs-861-cr-bid-is-lowest/article32625262.ece
17 September 2020||Bengaluru,||Drug probe: actors quizzed||Central Crime Branch (CCB) officials on Wednesday questioned actor-couple Aindrita Ray and Diganth Manchale for over four hours to ascertain their possible roles in the drug racket involving the Kannada film industry. Their names cropped up during the course of the investigation with alleged links to Sheikh Faazil, one of the accused who is absconding, said the police. CCB officials questioned the star couple separately and recorded their statements before allowing them to leave. The police have seized two mobile phones from the couple. “The devices have been sent to the forensic science laboratory. We have reason to believe that messages crucial to the investigation were deleted from the phones,” said a senior police official. “We have questioned them in detail, but they will be summoned for further enquiry at a later date,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). Faazil has been accused of organising gambling parties at a casino in Sri Lanka and also in India, where drugs were sold. The CCB questioned the couple about their affiliations with him and other accused, and if they attended the parties. “Call record details show that Aindrita had attended parties hosted by Sheikh Faazil in India and even in Sri Lanka. They were at the same parties that Aditya Alva attended,” said a senior CCB official. Sources in the department said that the couple denied having anything to do with the drug racket but acknowledged that they are friends with some of the accused and used to chat and communicate with them regularly. “They also admitted to attending some of the parties, but denied having knowledge of drug use,” the official added. Aindrita and Diganth have close ties with actress Ragini Dwivedi, who is currently in judicial custody, and also allegedly with the prime accused Shiva Prakash and Ravi Shankar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drug-probe-actors-quizzed/article32625224.ece
17 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala govt. eases norms for migrants||Migrant workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 but are asymptomatic can be allowed to work by adopting precautionary measures, according to a September 14 order issued by the Kerala government outlining quarantine measures for workers from other States. “Migrant workers found positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be segregated. If they are asymptomatic positive then they may work in the areas exclusively marked by taking all precautions. They shall not mix with any other worker or officer,” says the order on quarantine norms and standard operating procedures (SOP) for the registration of guest/specialised/essential workers from other States on the covid19jagratha portal. If the workers develop any symptom, they should immediately be referred to a COVID-19 hospital. DISHA (1056) also should be informed, says the order. The State government had issued a set of guidelines pertaining to migrant workers on August 24 after the Additional Chief Secretary (Industries), in a June 9 letter, sought relaxations in the quarantine norms on the grounds that they were ‘delaying infrastructure projects in the State.’ The September 14 order complements the guidelines. Workers who arrive in Kerala should undergo the 14-day quarantine. The contractor should provide individual rooms which are safe and hygienic. Workers who arrive in the State without the COVID-19 test certificate will have to undergo an antigen test on the fifth day. The contractor should bear the cost of the test. Follow protocol Workers who test negative should follow the COVID-19 protocol. They should not mix with the public and should remain confined to the work site and place of accommodation. All guest/specialised/essential workers entering the State should register on the covid19jagratha portal well in advance and obtain clearance before they reach the entry points to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-govt-eases-norms-for-migrants/article32625220.ece

Acting on the report of two expert committees headed by former Chief Secretary K.M. Abraham and Director, Centre for Development Studies, Sunil Mani, the Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, on Wednesday decided to deposit the six-day salaries of the government employees and teachers, deducted for five months from April this year, in the Provident Fund on April 1, 2021. “The amount can be withdrawn by the employees from June 1, 2021 and will be given 9% annual interest till it is deposited in the PF on April 1. This is to avoid the Rs. 2,500-crore additional burden to the exchequer if the deducted amount is returned now,” a communication from the Chief Minister’s Office said. The Cabinet decided to extend the salary cut for another six months from September after holding discussions with recognised unions of government employees and teachers. The initiative will be known as COVID-19 Income Support Scheme. It will also attract 9% annual interest till it is merged in PF. Leave surrender For pensioners without PF, the deducted money will be returned after June 2021 in equal monthly instalments.

17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||LS nod to amend banking Act||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which will bring cooperative banks under the direct supervision of the RBI and bring them under some of the same governance norms as commercial banks. It will also allow the RBI to amalgamate or reconstruct a stressed cooperative bank without first imposing a moratorium, thus protecting the interests of the depositors, said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, moving the Amendment Bill in the House. The Bill replaces an ordinance to the same effect promulgated on June 26. Debate on control Replying to the debate on the Bill, Ms. Sitharaman sought to refute accusations from Opposition MPs that the Central government was taking over control of the cooperative banks. “We were concerned that the pandemic would further stress the financial health of more cooperatives, so we took steps to safeguard the interests of the depositors,” she said. Addressing concerns that the RBI has failed to curb crisis situations among commercial banks as well, the Finance Minister noted that 430 cooperative banks had been delicensed and liquidated over the last two decades, while not a single commercial bank has gone into liquidation under the oversight of the RBI. Congress MP Manish Tewari said the RBI was a conflicted body as it carried out multiple roles and urged that banking reform begin with spinning off its other responsibilities as the Central government’s banker so that it can fulfil its primary role as a banking regulator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ls-nod-to-amend-banking-act/article32625237.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||Kapila Vatsyayan, matriarch of cultural research, dies||Kapila Vatsyayan, the grand matriarch of cultural research, passed away at her Gulmohar Enclave residence in Delhi on Wednesday morning. Her brother S.C. Malik said she passed away peacefully because of age-related issues. Born into a Punjabi Arya Samaji family on December 25, 1928, the fiercely independent and multi-faceted personality effortlessly combined theoretical knowledge with rigorous practice and brought a multidisciplinary approach to understanding Indian culture. Her holistic approach broke new ground in the study of Indian dance forms and not only positioned them on the cultural map of the world but also led to extensive research work, opening new vistas. Having imbibed the rich cultural values of Oriental dance during her stay at Shantiniketan, she went on to learn Kathak from Achhan Maharaj, Manipuri from Guru Amobi Singh, and Bharatanatyam from guru Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai. She performed a Kathak recital at the first Dance Festival held at the Feroz Shah Kotla Grounds in 1945. Over the years, Ms. Vatsyayan, a Padma Vibhushan awardee, engaged extensively with western dance forms as well, and maintained that while the Indian tradition is in dialogue with the earth, the West aspires to be free from it. “But never manages to,” she would assert. Blending tangible with the intangible and finding connections between the arts and the sciences, she wrote extensively on the geometrical body stances in Indian dance forms and complex rhythmic patterns that reflect mathematical flourishes in the Indian cultural firmament. Not against change, the former representative of India to UNESCO’s executive board would often underline that any experiment should be to augment Indian classical forms, not to dilute or distract the new generation from its essence. Her canvas was not limited to dance, though. This is evident in her vast corpus of writings, such as Plural Cultures and Monolithic Structures: Comprehending India, Dance in Indian Painting and The Indian Arts, Their Ideational Background and Principles of Forms .    During the decades of the Nehru-Gandhi rule, Vatsyayan was the go-to person for showcasing Indian culture to the world. She helped legends like Birju Maharaj and Balasaraswati find a global audience. From taking troupes of artistes all over the world as part of Jawaharlal Nehru’s cultural diplomacy to borrowing Chola bronzes at the National Museum for the Non-Aligned Movement Conference in 1983 from south Indian temples, she did it all, cutting a lot of red tape along the way. She was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2006 but had to vacate her seat following the office of profit controversy. In April 2007, she was renominated. She was married to Hindi writer S.H. Vatsyayan ‘Ageya’. The two heavyweights from their respective fields separated in 1969.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kapila-vatsyayan-matriarch-of-cultural-research-dies/article32625258.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||32 Army, 3 IAF staff died of COVID-19||Thirty-five military personnel — 32 from the Army and three from the Air Force — had died of COVID-19, Parliament was informed on Wednesday. To a separate question, the government informed that there were 1,123 suicide cases in the armed forces from 2010 to 2019. “The number of COVID-19 cases in the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are 16,758, 1,365 and 1,716, respectively,” Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha. Of the 1,123 suicides reported from 2010 to 2019, 901 were from the Army, 40 from the Navy and 182 from the IAF. “The Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR), after conducting a number of studies since 2006, has, inter alia, listed domestic and personal problems, marital discord, stress and financial problems as the major causes of suicides by armed forces personnel,” Mr. Naik said. From the Army, the years 2010, 2011 and 2016 recorded over 100 suicides with the highest being 116 in 2010. Elaborating on the steps taken, Mr. Naik said the government had taken several steps towards stress amelioration among troops, which include deployment of trained psychological counsellors, improvement in the quality of food and clothing, training in stress management, provision of recreational facilities, buddy system, leave concessions, approachability of seniors, facilities for movement of troops from border areas and establishing a grievance redress mechanism at various levels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/32-army-3-iaf-staff-died-of-covid-19/article32625246.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||Congress faults govt. for taking loan from China-linked bank||The much-touted policy of the Modi government to crack down on Chinese business relationships with India stands exposed, the Congress said at a press conference here on Wednesday. The party said that by the government’s own admission in Parliament, India took two loans amounting to Rs. 9,202 crore from the Beijing-based multilateral development bank called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is now abroad, accompanying his mother Sonia Gandhi for her treatment, tweeted, “Understand the chronology: PM said- no one crossed the border. Then, took a huge loan from a China-based bank. Then, Defence Minister said- China occupied our land. Now, MOS Home says- there’s no infiltration. Is Modi Govt with Indian Army or with China? Modi ji, why are you so scared?” At a press conference addressed by Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera and Rajya Sabha MP Syed Nassir Hussain, the party said that the government’s double speak and hypocrisy on the issue of the ongoing border tensions with China on the eastern border in areas such as South Pangong, Razun La and the finger area is clear. The government informed the Parliament on Tuesday that India took two loans amounting Rs. 9,202 crore from AIIB. Mr. Khera pointed out that the AIIB was formed in 2016, is headquartered in Beijing, and with 26.6% voting share, China is the largest shareholder of the bank. “The first loan of $500 million was taken on May 8, amidst reports of Chinese incursions at multiple points in eastern Ladakh, including the Pangong lake. The second loan of $750 million was taken on June 19, four days after the Galwan massacre where we lost 20 of our bravehearts. Incidentally, it was also the same day when Prime Minister Modi lied to the country by saying that no one had entered our territory,” Mr. Khera added. App ban All this, Mr Khera said, was being done when the government has banned Chinese-owned mobile applications in the name of cracking down on Chinese-run business establishments. “The nation is shocked at such brazen duplicity of the Modi government in handling China’s territorial aggression,” he added. The Congress also flagged an answer by Minister of State for Home Affairs (MoS) Nityanand Rai to an unstarred question, in which he categorically denied any infiltration by China during the last six months. Mr. Khera said that this was a “shameless insult to the martyrdom of our brave soldiers on the night of June 15 in the Galwan valley”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-faults-govt-for-taking-loan-from-china-linked-bank/article32625250.ece
17 September 2020||Mumbai,||No evidence against Rhea: rights panel||In what may come as some relief to actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is lodged in the Byculla jail, the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission on Wednesday held that “there is no evidence showing that Rhea is entering the morgue or the post-mortem room.” Commission chairman M.A. Sayeed told The Hindu , “The Commission has received explanations and responses from the Mumbai Police and Cooper Hospital along with some documents. There was no breach of rules from either the police or the hospital. Therefore, no case for intervention is made out by the Commission.” Mr. Sayeed said, “Relying on the rules and guidelines placed on record which virtually prohibit entry of any stranger except the official in the post-mortem room or morgue or in the storage room. We did not find any evidence, showing that the lady (Rhea) is entering the morgue or the post- mortem room.” ‘Only a TV clip’ “Except for just a channel (televison) clipping, there was no evidence showing that the lady (Rhea) is entering the morgue. It only shows that she was coming out of the mortuary premises and does not show that she was coming out of the post-mortem room,” he said “As per the Cooper Hospital Dean’s report she might have been present in the waiting area and then paid her homages to the departed soul when the body was brought for delivery to his (Sushant) sister,” Mr. Sayeed added. On August 26, the Commission sent show-cause notices to the police and the hospital for ‘allowing’ Ms. Chakraborty to enter the hospital’s mortuary when Sushant’s post-mortem was being conducted. A huge controversy broke out after a video clip showed Ms Chakraborty, along with three others, was seen at the hospital for 45 minutes on June 15 a day after Sushant died.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-evidence-against-rhea-rights-panel/article32625266.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||Sushant case media coverage heartless, says Trinamool MP||Trinamool Congress MP Pratima Mandal said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that media outlets had sunk to the “lowest of the low” in its coverage of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June. Speaking during Zero Hour, Ms. Mandal said the way the incident was covered was “heartless”. “The young actor was very well liked and the way his death was covered was heartless and intrusive,” she said. “Many young people looked up to him and a young person also died by suicide following the actor’s death.” The World Health Organisation had come up with some guidelines on how to report on suicides and the Indian media should evolve some guidelines for itself, she said. This is the third day of the monsoon session of Parliament that the actor’s death has featured during Zero Hour. On Monday actor-MP Ravi Kishan raised the issue of proliferation of drugs in the film industry (an angle being probed in the Sushant case), while on Tuesday, actor-MP Jaya Bachchan said in response there was no basis to paint the entire film industry as delinquent because of one case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sushant-case-media-coverage-heartless-says-trinamool-mp/article32625233.ece
17 September 2020||GUWAHATI,||Anti-graft group seeks Nagaland Governor’s help to end ‘taxation’||An anti-graft group has sought Nagaland Governor R.N. Ravi’s intervention in checking unabated ‘taxation’ by extremist groups and corruption in the State. The Against Corruption and Unabated Taxation (ACAUT), a collective of community leaders, students, traders and former bureaucrats, was formed in 2013 to end the culture of “taxation”, a euphemism for extortion or donation. It had annoyed the “Naga political groups”, primarily the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (I-M), with a series of rallies and protests asking all the outfits to come up with a common mechanism for sparing the people from paying “multiple taxes to multiple groups”. In a letter to the Governor on September 15, ACAUT leaders Tia Longchar, Simon Kelio and Hetoi Chishi said the government had turned a blind eye to the illegal taxation. Their grievance has assumed significance after the Governor’s June 16 letter to Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, stating that “armed gangs” were running parallel governments and extorting people at gunpoint. Most groups protested being labelled as “gangs”. The NSCN (I-M) took offence and demanded the ouster of Mr. Ravi. The ACAUT said unscrupulous people in transport unions were hand-in-glove with some members of the Naga political groups that want such taxation to continue. “Orders and diktats are issued by these groups to ensure only certain transports can carry particular goods and items at rates far above the prescribed ones. Those not complying with are harassed and end up paying heavy fines,” it stated. Business houses and shopkeepers have been compelled to pay charges due to the illegal syndicates. “This has only resulted in upward spiral of prices of essential commodities,” it pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anti-graft-group-seeks-nagaland-governors-help-to-end-taxation/article32625734.ece
17 September 2020||Kozhikode,||Science activists face wrath||Popular science activists and rationalist speakers are found to be targeted on social media with a section of homoeopathy and AYUSH practitioners up in arms against Facebook pages that question the scientific validity of these branches of medicine. It began with a WhatsApp message, purportedly originated from AYUSH and homoeopathy students’ groups. Addressing the students, the message says that misleading campaigns against homoeopathy and AYUSH branches of medicine were found to be run on the social media by certain “allopathy doctors and people fashioning themselves as atheist orators.” “…We are left with only one option: to organise our doctors and students, mass report these social media pages, and close them down.” The message then lists a number of Facebook pages and profiles, such as EssenseTrivandrum, Kolambiatheistchannel, scientificthinkers2.0, essenseglobal, CAPSULE, Ravichandran, Vaisakhan Thampi etc. Following this, the Facebook page of CAPSULE or the Campaign Against Pseudoscience Using Law and Ethics, a platform launched by the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad, was found to be taken down for some time. Science writer and rationalist speaker Vaisakhan Thampi claimed that people like him were only trying to highlight what they termed the unscientific nature of medical practices such as homoeopathy. “We are right now facing a global pandemic. Coming up with immunity boosters will give a false sense of security to the people. It could be dangerous as some people may claim that they won’t get infected as they already had consumed the immunity boosters,” Mr. Thampi said. Attempts to close down the pages can only be seen as the last resort by “pseudo-science practitioners” who have no answer to the arguments raised above, he added. M.P. Anil Kumar, functionary of CAPSULE Kerala, said “spokespersons of pseudo science” were resorting to false claims now. He recalled that when a man from Ernakulam claimed to have developed a medicine to cure AIDS, it was through constant debates and arguments that the hollowness of the claim was established.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/science-activists-face-wrath/article32625790.ece

17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,||TS govt. justifies abrupt end to session||The State government has justified the abrupt end to the monsoon session of Legislature saying it was a decision taken by Assembly Speaker and Legislative Council Chairman after taking the view of members. Nonetheless, the Congress and Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen members got an opportunity to air their views in the Assembly on par with the ruling TRS, Legislative Affairs Minister V. Prashant Reddy said at a press conference after the House adjourned sine die. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao spoke in the Assembly for four hours and thirty-two minutes but, on the other hand, the Congress and MIM leaders were together given five hours and four minutes. This shows the liberal attitude of the government towards Opposition. Many of the ruling party members did not get an opportunity to speak because of time constraints.  Bhatti faults govt. Meanwhile, Congress legislature party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka has accused the State government of running the session of the Legislature with the sole objective to ensure passage of the Bill to amend Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management law to access higher loans. Reacting to the abrupt closure of the Assembly session, Mr. Vikramarka and three other Congress MLAs G. Anasuya, D. Sridhar Babu and T. Jayaprakash Reddy said at a press conference that the House failed to debate the burning issue of diversion of Krishna river water by Andhra Pradesh government despite an agreement at the Business Advisory Committee meeting of the Assembly to take it up. By trying to tap eleven tmcft water per day, the AP government is as good as diverting a river, he said. Mr. Vikramarka said the government went back on its promise to extend the session beyond September 28, the last day, to discuss all issues agreed at the BAC. The Congress had listed out several issues but none of them had come up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ts-govt-justifies-abrupt-end-to-session/article32625740.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC for quick trial in cases against politicians||The Supreme Court on Wednesday resolved to ensure that pending criminal trials against sitting and former legislators, which run to over 4,000 across the country, will be completed in a time-bound manner. “Are you serious about completing these trials in a time-bound manner?” a three-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre. “We are 100% serious,” Mr. Mehta replied emphatically. There are over 2,500 criminal cases pending against sitting legislators. The Bench specifically asked about the status of cases registered by the Central agencies such as the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate against politicians. Cases range from corruption to money laundering.  Amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria and advocate Sneha Kalita replied that some of these cases were stuck at the stage of framing of charges. In his latest report to the apex court, Mr. Hansaria suggested the setting up of one special court in each district to exclusively try politicians. He recommended that chief justices of each high court be requested to furnish an action plan for expeditious disposal of these cases within a year. He said corruption cases should be given “topmost priority.” Mr. Mehta recommended various measures such as expiration of any stay orders within one month, appointment of more special court judges, infrastructure, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-for-quick-trial-in-cases-against-politicians/article32625247.ece
17 September 2020||N. RahulHYDERABAD,||Gates of all projects on Godavari opened||The gates of all the irrigation projects on Godavari and two of its tributaries were lifted on Wednesday following heavy rains in the catchment and the upper reaches of the river right up to Jaikwadi project in Maharashtra. Starting from Sriramsagar (SRSP) project at Pochampad, then Yellampally and further down to barrages of Kaleswaram project at Sundilla, Annaram and Medigadda, the gates were kept open to discharge lakhs of cusecs of water into the river as it flowed menacingly. Forty gates of Sriramsagar were lifted in the morning, but fourteen of them were shut down as the flow of water slowed down later. The Chief Engineer of SRSP B. Shanker told The Hindu that there was no respite in flooding at SRSP as the gates of projects on the Godavari in Maharashtra at Babli and further up at Balegaon, Nanded, Madalgaon and Jaikwadi were open. The gates of Babli were in any case supposed to be kept open till October 28 every year as per Supreme Court directions. The SRSP was full to its capacity at 1,091 ft and a storage of 90 tmc ft on Wednesday. Parallelly, the gates of projects on tributaries of Godavari, namely Kaddam and Manair, were also lifted due to heavy rains. All gates of Kaddam were lifted to release 1.52 lakh cusecs of water to Yellampally. In turn, twenty-five gates of Yellampally were also lifted to discharge water to barrages of Kaleswaram. The gates of three barrages at Sundilla, Annaram and Madigadda were also lifted. The scene in Manair river which is a confluence of Mulavagu on one side and Mohidummedavagu on the other near Karimnagar town was a rare spectacle to people. Twenty gates of Lower Manair Dam in the town were lifted to release water into Manair river. Six gates of mid-Manair dam which was on the upper contours of LMD were lifted while the water jumped weir further up at Upper Manair Dam at Narmala. Two other tributaries of the Godavari, namely Manjeera and Singur, were, however, yet to fill their respective projects. Water was let out through all the five canals of SRSP which originated at Pochampad. The flood-flow canal, particularly, carried the major share of water in the canal network.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gates-of-all-projects-on-godavari-tributaries-opened/article32625773.ece

The newspaper said “the alert was lowered after a meeting of the nations’ foreign ministers” in Moscow three days later. The second-highest of four levels of readiness prompts for increased deployments of troops to forward areas and stepping up of training exercises. The highest threat level is only for armed conflict. The newspaper said this was the first time the threat level had been raised to two along the border since 1987, during a stand-off in Sumdorong Chu. “Since the combat readiness level was raised, commanders, officers and soldiers have been working around the clock, carrying out extra training and drills,” a military source told the newspaper. “The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) mobilised more troops and weapons systems to the Line of Actual Control in preparation for the worst.” While the alert level had now been lowered, the source told the paper “it could be reinstated if circumstances changed”. “The level can be decided by troops on the border, as happened before the 1987 skirmish, when it was adjusted several times,” the newspaper reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-rebuts-rajnath-says-india-violated-pacts/article32625226.ece

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Discrepancies in two sets of COVID-19 data in T.N.||As per this specific data in the internal report, Tamil Nadu had a total of 4,95,480 COVID-19 positive admissions in various facilities and 8,339 deaths till September 7. However, the publicly released bulletin had only 4,69,256 cases and 7,925 deaths till that day. Interestingly, while the total number of cases and deaths was higher, the number of active cases on September 7 as per this data was only 44,067, which was 7,148 cases lesser than the data in the media bulletin (51,215). Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan attributed the mismatch to possible duplications or other minor inconsistencies that might have crept into the data collected in the particular format. The same data on admissions collated by the department on September 11 (also available with The Hindu ), had a mismatch of 24,336 more in total cases, 450 more in deaths, and 6,847 lesser in active cases. T. Jacob John, renowned virologist and retired Professor of Clinical Virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said that while the inconsistency cannot be immediately attributed to any underreporting of data or lack of transparency, it clearly showed the inefficiencies in collection of data when it came to public health. “We have long neglected data in our health management system. For instance, we have never counted tuberculosis or diphtheria properly. The exception was polio as we had a goal of zero,” he said, adding that COVID-19 has once again stressed the importance to be given to data. Health Secretary Radhakrishnan ruled out underreporting or staggered reporting of COVID-19 data. By way of explanation, he attributed the mismatch to possible duplications or other minor inconsistencies that might have crept into the data collected in the particular format. The control room run by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (DPH) is the nerve centre when it came to notifiable diseases, he said, adding that it collected data at the patient-level directly from labs and through proper reporting channels from hospitals and other institutions. This was further cross-checked at multiple levels to remove duplications, he explained. Pointing out that this was the sacrosanct and accurate data, he said that the [contentious] numbers on admissions on the other hand, available in the internal report, are not collected at the patient-level, but as total numbers. He said the internal report was basically prepared for decision-makers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/discrepancies-in-two-sets-of-covid-19-data-in-tn/article32625229.ece

The FIR is based on a YouTube broadcast of Mr. Dua allegedly blaming the government about its COVID-19 preparedness and making personal allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A Bench, led by Justice U.U. Lalit, raised questions about the claim made by the police that the broadcast led to mass migration in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The court asked why an FIR was registered in Himachal Pradesh for reported migration in U.P. and Bihar. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said electronic media was a potent medium with widespread viewership. People were alarmed, panic stricken. Journalistic freedom is sacrosanct, but it should not be abused, he said. Earlier, Mr. Dua, represented by senior advocate Vikas Singh, had contended that criticism of the government did not amount to sedition.

17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Why publish details of couples who want to wed?’||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked for the government’s response to a plea that wide publication of the personal details of a couple who want to wed under the Special Marriage Act is a violation of their privacy. The details being publicised include their names, date of birth, age, occupation, parents’ names and details, addresses, pin codes, identity information and phone numbers. This was a peculiar requirement of the Act, intended to help consenting adults, especially those who belong to different religions or castes, to marry. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the government on the writ petition filed by Nandini Praveen, a law student from Kerala, who is represented by advocates Kaleeswaram Raj and Nishe Rajen Shonker. However, Chief Justice Bobde expressed certain prima facie reservations about the plea to do away with the publication of details. “You don’t understand the purpose of the law [Special Marriage Act]... Normally they [people who want to marry under the Act] do not belong to the same community... You are saying ‘privacy,’ that the whole world will come to know... But what if somebody runs away with somebody’s wife or daughter... Why should they [the husband or father] not come to know? The people for whose benefit this is enacted will suffer the moment it is deleted,” Chief Justice Bobde remarked orally. Chilling effect Mr. Raj, however, responded that the publication of confidential details through a public notice has a chilling effect on the right to marry, particularly in the backdrop of honour killings and violence committed against those who enter into inter-caste and inter-religious marriages. “In other words, couples are asked to waive the right to privacy to exercise the right to marry,” he pointed out. The senior lawyer said the petition was not challenging the authority of the Marriage Officer to conduct an enquiry into a couple’s antecedents. “But why publish the confidential details? We are only challenging the notification of these details, which certainly violates privacy... The publication is reminiscent of the Victorian age and morality... It has a whiff of the canonical to it,” Mr. Raj submitted. Ms. Praveen, in the petition, said the publication of intimate details “infringes the rights of autonomy, dignity and the right to marry.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-publish-details-of-couples-who-want-to-wed/article32625264.ece

The Bill sought to enact the Tamil Nadu Puratchi Thalaivi Dr. J. Jayalalithaa Memorial Foundation Act, 2020, and establish a Puratchi Thalaivi Dr. J. Jayalalithaa Memorial Foundation. It would have the powers to acquire and maintain the movable and immovable properties. Kadambur Raju, Minister for Information and Publicity, who tabled the Bill, said the land and the building of Veda Nilayam, at Poes Garden, and movable items. such as furniture and books, had been in a state of disuse for over three years, and it was important to prevent them from being ruined due to a lack of maintenance. The foundation will take measures to maintain the immovable and movable properties in the three-storeyed building and prepare an action plan to convert Veda Nilayam into a memorial, in remembrance of Jayalalithaa’s achievements. CM as chairperson With the Chief Minister as its chairperson, it will comprise members like the Deputy Chief Minister, the Minister for Information and Publicity and the Chief Secretary. It will also have six members nominated from the AIADMK, with a tenure of three years. The government will also appoint a claims commissioner to decide on the claims over the 32,721 movable properties. The Bill seeks to replace the Ordinance promulgated earlier this year, temporarily transferring the properties in Veda Nilayam. With the land and the building acquired by the State government now, the ordinance has been repealed. This follows Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement in August 2017 that Veda Nilayam would be converted into a memorial. Notice ordered on plea The Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notice to the State government on a writ petition filed by Jayalalithaa’s nephew J. Deepak, challenging the Ordinance promulgated by the government to acquire movable properties in Veda Nilayam. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy ordered notice, returnable by six weeks, after recording the submission of Advocate General Vijay Narayan that the government had on Wednesday tabled a Bill in the Assembly so that the Ordinance could be replaced with an Act. The judges told the petitioner’s counsel, S.L. Sudarsanam, that he may have to file a fresh case challenging the Act, if the present writ petition becomes infructuous in due course of time. Nevertheless, since the petition had been numbered and listed for admission before them, the judges ordered notice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bill-to-convert-veda-nilayam-into-memorial-tabled-in-assembly/article32625405.ece

17 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NEP: Stalin for special Assembly session||Opposition leader and Dravida Muttera Kazhagam president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday urged the State government to convene a special session of the Assembly to adopt a resolution against the National Education Policy (NEP 2020), which he said was against social justice, federalism and equality. Wondering about the reason behind inclusion of Hindi in the policy note of the Health Department, he wanted to know whether it was to express the government's support to the proposed three-language policy in the NEP. Participating in a debate in the Assembly, he said Tamil and English were vital to the two-language policy of Tamil Nadu and the three-language policy was against the language policy evolved by late Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai. “The priority accorded to Sanskrit was not given to Tamil and other languages in the NEP 2020,” he alleged. Recalling the Chief Minister’s assertion that the two-language policy would continue to be implemented, Mr. Stalin said the State government should take into consideration the view of the Chief Minister on the issue. Mr. Stalin also wanted the government to expand the committees to study the NEP 2020. The DMK leader said the proposed common examination for third, fifth and eighth class students of Classes III, V and VIII would undermine the existing education policy in the State while the thrust on vocational course was actually “a reincarnation” of family vocation. “[The proposed] Entrance tests to admission in arts and science colleges, permission for foreign universities and evolving the syllabus for the States at the national level are dangerous,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-wants-special-assembly-session-against-nep-2020/article32625386.ece

17 September 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Lankan gangster died of heart attack’||Sri Lankan fugitive gangster Maddumage Lasantha Chandana Perera alias Angoda Lokka had died of heart attack in Coimbatore and no foul play was involved in his death, a senior officer of the CB-CID said on Wednesday based on the findings of the post-mortem, chemical examination and histopathology reports. K. Shankar, Inspector General of Police, CB-CID, told The Hindu the three reports did not have any finding related to unnatural death. “There was no finding of poisoning or other suspected aspects in the reports,” he said. As per the initial statement given by a Sri Lankan woman named Amani Thanji, who lived with Lokka in a rented house at Balaji Nagar near Cheran Ma Nagar in Coimbatore, he suffered chest pain on the night of July 3 and was declared dead by doctors of a private hospital where she took him with the help of two neighbours. The body was later shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH). Lokka lived in Coimbatore under the assumed identity of Pradeep Sigh for around two years. He possessed an Aadhaar card in the name of Pradeep Singh which he managed to obtain with the help of two persons D. Sivakamasundari, an advocate of Madurai, and her friend S. Dyaneswaran from Erode. Sivakamasundari, Dyaneswaran and Thanji had taken Lokka’s body to Madurai after post-mortem at CMCH on July 5 and cremated it there. The Coimbatore City Police later found that the Aadhaar card, a copy of which was produced by Sivakamasundari at the Peelamedu police station, was obtained using forged documents. The police arrested the three persons on August 2. The CB-CID later took over the case and registered two separate cases – one related to the death of Lokka and the other against the three on various charges, including furnishing false documents, harbouring offender, criminal conspiracy and forgery of records. With suspected foul play in the death of Lokka ruled out, CB-CID will now concentrate on the second case, added Mr. Shankar. CB-CID investigation had also found that Lokka had a pistol which the accused handed over to a Sri Lankan national in Madurai after his death. Efforts to trace the Sri Lankan man were under way.  There was no finding of poisoning or other suspected aspects in the three reports K.

17 September 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Mobile booths to collect swab samples at doorstep||Coimbatore Corporation will soon deploy 20 mobile COVID-19 testing booths to collect swab samples at people’s doorstep. The decision in this regard was taken at a meeting chaired by Commissioner of Municipal Administration K. Baskaran a few days ago at the Corporation, said Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian. The Corporation was customising the vehicles for the purpose at a vehicle body-building unit in Coimbatore and they would be ready for deployment in a day or two, said sources. The mobile testing booths would have seating space for two lab technicians, who would stretch their arms through holes on the vehicles’ sides to collect samples from members of the public. They would also announce their arrival to residents at every locality using an in-built public address system, the sources said. The mobile booths would help people aged more than 50, with pre-existing health conditions, and did not want to stand in queues to give samples for fear of contracting COVID-19. In a related development, M. Edwin of Footloose, a dance academy, with support from Cura Pharma had donated a similar sample collection vehicle to the Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mobile-booths-to-collect-swab-samples-at-doorstep/article32625696.ece

17 September 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||P. R. Krishnakumar, doyen of Ayurveda, dies of COVID-19||P.R. Krishnakumar, Chancellor of Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women, Coimbatore, and the managing director of the Arya Vaidya Pharmacy (Coimbatore) Limited, died of COVID-19 in Coimbatore late on Wednesday. He was 69. A recipient of Padma Shri, who played a major role in the preparation of the Ayush protocol, Krishnakumar was undergoing treatment for COVID-19 in a private hospital in Coimbatore for over a week. His death came around 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday. A spokesperson from AVP said that he had undergone below knee amputation for the right leg due to diabetic foot ulcer in another private hospital in Coimbatore recently. During the initial stages of the nationwide lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a video conference with Krishnakumar to discuss the prospects of Ayurveda in COVID-19 management. Born on September 23, 1951 to Arya Vaidyan P. V. Rama Varier, founder of Arya Vaidya Pharmacy, and Pankajam Rama Varier, Krishnakumar studied Ayurveda from Shoranur Ayurveda College, Kerala. Krishnakumar initiated the first ever clinical research in traditional medicines under WHO and ICMR partnership in 1977 to study the efficacy of Ayurvedic treatment on Rheumatoid arthritis. The Government of India had honoured him with ‘Dhanwanthari Puraskar’ for his contributions in the field of Ayurveda Education, Health and Community Services in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/p-r-krishnakumar-doyen-of-ayurveda-dies-of-covid-19/article32625441.ece
17 September 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Labs told to return results of swab samples within 24 hours||Coimbatore Corporation has asked private labs in the city to return within 24 hours the results of the swab samples sent to them, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said. In the last couple of days, there was an increase of 50 to 60 COVID-19 positive cases a day in the city and the numbers had nothing to do with the current reality as the labs had returned results of samples that the civic body had sent over 10 days ago. The spike in the number of COVID-19 cases, because of the delay on the part of the labs, sent out a wrong signal as if the city saw no decline in the cases. The reality was different though. Wednesday’s result too would reflect an inflated figure and by Thursday the city would get to see the real picture as by then the labs would have cleared testing and declaring results of pending samples, the Commissioner added. On Tuesday, the city saw 451 person testing positive for the disease. In a related development, Collector K. Rajamani had on Tuesday conducted a meeting with representatives of private labs asking them to return test results without delay. He had also asked them to charge only the fee fixed by the State Government. As part of its efforts to contain the COVID-19 spread, the Corporation had distributed awareness stickers to be pasted in front of all commercial establishments. Further, the Corporation had also increased the number of persons it had deployed to complete the door-to-door survey. Until recently, the Corporation had sent out around 1,200 persons and now it had added another 200.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/labs-told-to-return-results-of-swab-samples-within-24-hours/article32625697.ece

17 September 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||No e-pass for tourists travelling in govt. buses||Tourists travelling to Kodaikanal in government buses need not apply for e-pass and the order comes into immediate effect, said officials on Wednesday. Public travelling to the hill station on their own vehicles or in tourist vehicles have to apply for e-pass through the ‘tourist’ category online from the district administration. Following requests and appeals from various stakeholders in the hill station, Collector M Vijayalakshmi assured last week that they would take it forward to the government. After the State government relaxed the guidelines since September 1 on the e-pass system, which were imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic, the hill stations including Kodaikanal, Yercaud and Nilgris were not given the same treatment. Tourists were told to take e-pass. Therefore, tourist operators and hoteliers urged the government to withdraw the decision as it was a hindrance. Kodaikanal Sub-Collector Sivaguru Prabakaran said that public cooperation was very essential in fighting COVID-19, especially in hill stations like Kodaikanal. He said that more and more tourism spots would be thrown open to visitors after a review in a phased manner. A senior official in the TNSTC (Dindigul division) said that they would operate more buses to Kodaikanal from Dindigul and Theni districts.  1000 e passes issued An official at the Collectorate said that they had issued e-passes to at least 1000 applicants from various destinations under the ‘tourist’ category on Wednesday. This was being done so that the visitors were not fleeced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-e-pass-for-tourists-travelling-in-govt-buses/article32625865.ece
17 September 2020||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||785 works taken up in Dindigul||Collector M Vijayalakshmi on Tuesday said that 785 works were taken up at a cost of Rs. 50.12 crore under the Chief Minister’s ‘kudimaramathu’ project. Speaking to reporters, she said that the PWD, through its WRO (water resources organisation), examined tanks and ooranis following requests from farmers and water users’ associations. Since the works were carried out with contribution from beneficiaries either in the form of about 10 % of the total cost of the project or by means of supplying workforce, the kudimaramathu programme would help in recharge of groundwater and facilitate in conservation of more water for irrigation and drinking purposes. Out of 46 works, 40 tanks and six channels were taken up in Palani. Likewise, works were completed or nearing completion in Oddanchatram, Natham, Athur, Nilakottai, Vedasandur, Ms. Vijayalakshmi said and added that under the District Rural Development Agency, in 2019-20, projects worth Rs. 12.17 crore including desilting of 380 ooranis and 291 minor irrigation tanks were taken up. Similarly, with subsidy component from State Finance Commission, works worth Rs. 24.17 crore were taken up.

17 September 2020||KRISHNNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||A pleasant surprise for woman constable||In a heart-warming gesture, the All Women’s Police Station, Bargur, organised a bangle ceremony for a police constable of the station, whose parents were unable to travel to celebrate the conception of their daughter. Meera, the police constable at the All Women’s Police Station. was in for a surprise, when the police team led by Inspector Karpagam organised the ceremonial Valaikaappu , a tradition celebrating a would-be mother by the maternal family. Meera and her husband Vijayakumar, a government school teacher, had been married since 2011. The couple had conceived now during COVID-19. However, Meera’s maternal family in Tiruchi was unable to travel and attend the ceremony for their daughter and take her back to their home. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Karpagam narrated the thought behind the gesture that had stolen many a heart. “Meera is a head constable. She despite her pregnancy has been very active and cheerful. But over the past two week, I noticed her looking sullen.” When Karpagam had asked Meera if all was well, Meera had opened up on her despair at not having her parents around to organise the traditional bangle ceremony.” Moved by Meera’s yearning, Ms. Karpagam had planned the Valaikaappu . “I discussed with the other women in the station. We decided we are her maternal home and so we will organise a ceremony just the same way as her parents would have done for her.” They pooled in funds and organised the ceremony with a platter of five different rice varieties, sweets and other goodies that go with the rituals. “We also invited Meera’s husband and celebrated with great joy,” Ms. Karpagam said. The AWPS, Bargur, led by Ms. Karpagam brought the cheer back for Meera.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-pleasant-surprise-for-woman-constable/article32625700.ece
17 September 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Back on their feet after seven-month inaction||Some of the transgenders who have integrated themselves into the mainstream by becoming entrepreneurs say the seven-month lockdown had affected them both mentally and financially. With new lessons learnt, their businesses are finally picking up. T. Jeyachitra, a caterer from Ulaganeri who used to earlier supply food for weddings, festivals, baby showers and to old-age homes, says she was running a successful business when the orders stopped all of a sudden. With 15 other transwomen in her house dependent on income through the catering business, Ms. Jeyachitra says the lockdown was nothing short of a nightmare. “We rear cattle, goat and chicken and raise paddy on a patch of land. We survived the six months on the in-house meat. We struggled and hoped for the lockdown to end,” she says. After the State government’s ‘unlock,’ she has received two orders. “We hope to keep it going,” she says. R. Jason Joshua who opened a soup stall in Palanganatham about two months ago says the months leading up to the ‘unlock’ were traumatic for him and his wife. “We left our houses one-and-a-half years ago, hoping to find a job and live off our own income. I did odd jobs in the beginning to survive but all sources of income stopped. My wife and I planned to open a tiffin centre but the lockdown spoilt our plan. We kept accumulating debts. It was a dark phase for both of us,” he says.Since September a small stream of customers is arriving every day, providing him regular income. Transwoman physiotherapist Solu says she is one of the handful from the transgender community who survived the lockdown without much of a trouble. “Since I work in a government school and get consolidated pay, I received half my salary from April to July and full salary from August onwards. Much of my income went to supporting those who had completely lost their income as many engaged either in begging or sex work. Their struggle became my own and it was a difficult time for the community,” she says. She added that if more transgender people are recruited in government and private sector, the community will not struggle as much. “We need more job opportunities,” she says. ‘Set aside some money’ Ms. Jeyachitra says a valuable lesson she learnt during the lockdown was to save specifically for medical expenses and set aside a portion of income for general expenses.  We have enough money for our meals and to pay back our debts. We are hopeful of survival R.

17 September 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Use technology to increase farm yield: NABARD chief||Technological development must be integrated with agriculture to increase farm productivity and profit earned by farmers, said National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) Chairman G.R. Chintala at Agricultural College and Research Institute here on Wednesday. He was speaking after inaugurating the administrative building of Madurai Agri-business Incubation Forum (MABIF), an initiative of NABARD and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). He also laid foundation stone for an industrial shed on the college premises. Speaking about the incubator, Mr. Chintala said the centre planned to increase the agricultural productivity of farmers and thereby improving their income. He said the role of incubators was to transform and commercialise innovative ideas. “The agri business incubator will integrate farmers with technological development. Ultimately, it will improve the income of small and marginal farmers,” he said. Mr. Chintala said that the NABARD had set up and supported five Agri Business Incubation Centre (ABICs) across the country to promote and nurture agri entrepreneurs and startups. The NABARD had set up a Catalytic Capital Fund to support agri startups. Despite the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Farmer Producer Organisations across the country supplied vegetables and groceries at the doorstep of residents during the lockdown period, he said. Vice-Chancellor of TNAU N. Kumar said students of the university were motivated to become entrepreneurs and were given assistance by the incubator. A project and a course on block chain, which was developed by an incubatee of MABIF, was launched during the event. The products of various incubatees of MABIF were also launched. S.

17 September 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Lender’s plea against BHEL employee’s retirement rejected||Coming across an unusual petition that sought a direction to not allow an employee of BHEL, Tiruchi, to retire from service till he repays a loan obtained from the petitioner, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has wondered how such a petition was filed. The court was hearing the petition filed by R. Marimuthu, who sought a direction to BHEL, Tiruchi, to not allow K. Dhandapani to retire from service till he repaid Rs. 6 lakh he borrowed from the petitioner. The petitioner apprehended that if Mr. Dhandapani was allowed to retire on September 24, he would vacate the BHEL Quarters residence and it would be difficult to recover the money from him. No steps were taken by the police on the complaint lodged by him, he said. Hearing the petition, Justice R. Suresh Kumar wondered how such a petition was filed without even understanding the jurisdiction of the court, that too before a service portfolio when no service-related dispute was involved in the matter. The petitioner could have filed a suit for recovery of the money or followed up on the police complaint by approaching the Superintendent of Police or the Commissioner of Police or approach the magistrate court concerned seeking a direction to the police to investigate the case. When these types of issues came to the knowledge of advocates, they must properly advise the litigants to proceed further. Some advocates without even verifying the remedy available to litigants straightaway approach the High Court, the judge said. Dismissing the petition, the judge observed that since judicial time of the court was consumed by the unwarranted litigation, cost could have been imposed on the petitioner. However, the court would not do so as the petitioner had already lost his money in the transaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lenders-plea-against-bhel-employees-retirement-rejected/article32625882.ece
17 September 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Now, ‘good conduct’ bonds to restrain habitual offenders||Madurai City Police have been successful in restraining habitual offenders who pose threat to the maintenance of law and order, and indulge in property crime cases, by extracting bonds from them, using provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The city has over 700 gangsters, and scores of habitual chain-snatchers. The police have been closely following their movements. “These men indulge in criminal activities such as murders and robberies. Repeated warnings often do not deter them from carrying on with their criminal activities,” Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order) R. Shiva Prasad said. So the police have made the habitual offenders to give an undertaking in writing that they would ensure good behaviour for a period of time. “Though we can get the bonds for up to three years, usually we get them for a period of one year for good behaviour,” Mr. Shiva Prasad said. Under the provision, the person has to produce two sureties for Rs. 1 lakh each. “We ensure that only close family members like fathers or brothers produce the surety, as they would be able to effectively keep a check on their behaviour,” he said. Jail for violation Violation of the bond condition would invite jail term for the remaining period of the bond. “If he violates the bond condition in the second month of execution, he will spend the remaining period of 10 months in jail. This acts as a good deterrent to restrain such offenders,” he said. In the city, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) has the power to hold hearings and make criminals execute bonds. “Though the hearings are held on Tuesdays and Fridays, we can have it on any day depending on the situation,” he said. If the police official is able to convince the DC about the impending danger due to any anti-social element, the DC can make them execute the bond. “Even the Railway Police and Civil Supplies – Criminal Investigation Department officials come to the city police for binding over habitual offenders in their area,” he added. Stating that this mechanism has been very effective, Mr. Shiva Prasad said that only 78 out of the 1,358 persons who had executed bonds in 2019 had violated the bond conditions. Similarly, in 2020, out of 953 bonds issued till September 7, only 69 were violated. The city police have bound over 222 persons in the last two months alone, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-good-conduct-bonds-to-restrain-habitual-offenders/article32625876.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam ordered notice to the State and sought a response in the petition filed by advocate S.P. Hariharasudhan from Theni. He sought to quash the government order. In his petition, Mr. Hariharasudhan said as per the guidelines issued by the Centre for Unlock 4.0 relaxation, it was specifically mentioned that the States must not restrict inter- and intra-State movements, and no separate permission was required for such movement. However, Tamil Nadu had made e-passes mandatory for people coming from other States and this was arbitrary, as it was not in consonance with the guidelines issued by the Centre, he said and sought to quash the order. He pointed out that the main purpose of introducing the e-pass was to regulate travel during the curfew. Continuing it after allowing free movement was creating chaos among the public, he said. The case was adjourned to October 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-notice-to-state-in-pil-plea-challenging-e-pass-system/article32625382.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P.

This had resulted in encroachers having a field day, the court said.

The court also took note of Advocate Commissioner Arun Swaminathan’s submission that the entire town needed to be surveyed to identify ownership.

Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that if Tasmac does take such a decision, it would not mean that all contractual or temporary employees would be entitled to seek job extension up to 59 years of age. The court said that Tasmac could consider each individual or deserving employee and on a need basis extend the contracts of those who have completed 58 years. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by Tasmac employees, who cited a G.O. which said the age of superannuation of government servants who were in regular service as on May 31, 2020, would be increased from 58 years to 59 years. The Tasmac clarified that the G.O. was applicable to those employees who were in regular service and not on contractual basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consider-raising-age-limit-for-retirement/article32625518.ece

In a press release, its secretary R. Murali said the university would be sending question papers thorugh email or WhatsApp to Principals of affiliated colleges. They will in turn send the questions to students who will write a three-hour unsupervised exam. “The exam is conducted just for namesake. There is no real need to hold it right away. Even if they do want to conduct it, it could be held in a manner which ensures social distancing, as not more than 300 students will be writing the exams,” he said. If the exams need to be conducted online, the colleges must have a system in place to facilitate a transparent exchange between the university and students, Mr. Murali said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/online-exams-a-mockery/article32625519.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and P. Rajamanickam ordered notice to the State on the PIL petition filed by advocate S.P. Hariharasudhan from Theni. The petition said as per the guidelines issued by the Centre for unlock 4.0 relaxations, it was specifically mentioned that States must not restrict inter and intra-State movements and no separate permission was required for such movements. However, Tamil Nadu had made e-pass mandatory for people coming from other States and this was arbitrary, he said, and sought quashing of the order. The e-pass was meant to regulate travel during the curfew. Continuing it after allowing free movement was creating chaos, he said. The case was adjourned to October 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/e-pass-system-challenged/article32625883.ece

17 September 2020||P.A. NarayaniMadurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Reverse migration helped in keeping agriculture sector afloat’||G.R. Chintala, Chairman, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), discussed the challenges and opportunities for the agricultural sector and rural economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excerpts from the interview:   Question: What were the major challenges faced by the agricultural sector during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Reply: When the nation-wide lockdown was announced, the rabi harvest was taking place across the country. At a time when everyone was wondering how agricultural activities would continue, the Central government announced several relaxations for the agricultural sector. Every grain that was produced in the country was procured by the government during the pandemic. Another presumption was that new agricultural activities would not start during the pandemic, which turned out to be wrong. There was a mass reverse migration of workers to villages during the pandemic and all these workers took to agriculture, increasing agricultural operations across the country. With the southwest monsoon almost coming to an end, we are expecting a bumper harvest. So, crossing 300 million tonnes of food grains is not going to be a big challenge. During the pandemic, the Union government ensured that credit was accessible to farmers. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund announced by the government has created enormous opportunities for improving the economy. All these measures ensured that agriculture and allied activities were not affected during the pandemic.  Q: What will be the focus areas to revive the livelihood of thousands of workers who have reverse migrated to their villages?  R: A lot of people hailing from States such as Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, migrated from the cities to their villages. The government tried to provide employment opportunities through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, but the migrant workers were equipped with better skills. So, the NABARD has recently sanctioned projects to train close to 15,000 people in various skills. In addition to it, bank loans are given to them. This will create more entrepreneurs in rural areas, who will not need to migrate back to the cities.  Q: An estimate of Rs. 110 crore was fraudulently credited to the bank accounts of 5.5 lakh ineligible people in Tamil Nadu under the PM KISAN scheme ....  R: The positive aspect is that the problem has been identified and the recovery from the fraudulent accounts are under way. PM-KISAN scheme is one such scheme where the money disbursed by the government completely reaches the bank accounts of farmers. The current scam has alerted the officials to have more safeguards while disbursing funds to the bank accounts of the farmers.  Q: What are the plans to revive the rural livelihoods severely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic?  R: Women constitute a significant portion of the rural population. Today, the rural women have contributed remarkably through self-help groups and microfinance. An intense focus on these areas would continue for the revival of the rural livelihoods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reverse-migration-helped-in-keeping-agriculture-sector-afloat/article32625884.ece
17 September 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Don’t be narrow minded in giving credit’||Expressing displeasure over the assertion made by “certain people” that the Union Territory was able to bring down the COVID-19 positivity rate because of the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday said such statements reflected the “narrow mindedness” of such people. “The ICMR gives guidelines to all States and Union Territories. That is because they are medical experts and their advice has to be followed. And all have to follow the guidelines. If we were able to bring down the positivity rate, it is because of the joint efforts of everyone. The Lt.Governor, Health Minister, legislators, our doctors and para medical staff have all contributed. We should not do politics over the issue and have a broad-minded approach,” the Chief Minister said while addressing a press conference through live streaming. The health department was able to scale up the testing per day to 5,700. In the last 24 hours (from Tuesday 10 a.m. to Wednesday 10 a.m., the department conducted 5,709 tests. Of them, 518 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Efforts taken by the government had helped bring down the positivity rate to around 9%,. The recovery rate has gone up to 75%, he said. The government wanted to scale up the testing to more than 6,000 per day. The health department was trying to increase bed capacity at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute, he said. “We cannot accept the credit being given to one person or organisation,” he said.

17 September 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Intensify focus on non-containment areas, MHA tells Puducherry||While acknowledging Puducherry’s success in bringing down the positivity rate from nearly 40% to around 7% through scaled-up testing, contact tracing and containment measures, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has instructed the authorities to intensify focus on areas outside the COVID-19 containment zones, which account for 65% of the fresh cases. At a review meeting held for Puducherry and the Union Territory of Chandigarh, the MHA recommended that areas outside the existing containment zones be “monitored with equal diligence”, as two-thirds of new infections were being reported from the non-containment areas. The MHA’s three-pronged plan also includes putting in place a robust mechanism for early detection and treatment of cases and carrying out physical visits for surveillance of home quarantine/isolation patients, in addition to IVRS oversight. The Ministry has called for sustaining a testing level of 5,000 per day. Treatment protocols would soon be framed to bring down the case fatality rate based on the death analysis report and the recommendations of experts from ICMR. According to mortality analysis data, 50% of deaths were occurring within 48 hours of admission, indicating either poor early detection and delayed arrival or poor treatment. With the festive season around the corner, the formation of a COVID enforcement team, comprising police, revenue and municipality personnel, is being mooted to prevent violations of safety norms in public places, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi said.   Two-thirds of fresh infections are being reported from such places||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intensify-focus-on-non-containment-areas-mha-tells-puducherry/article32625413.ece

In a letter to the Collector, the Kerala Cardamom Growers Union president TKSM. Udhayakuma and secretary C Sadhasivasubramaniam said that the acute labour shortage in Kerala was being balanced to an extent by workers from Theni district, who travelled in vehicles to the estates. However, this practice had come to a halt due to COVID-19. With the cardamom plantations being labour intensive, the district administration should permit workers to travel from Tamil Nadu borders to Idukki. As winds had damaged crops to a great extent, regular works could not be carried out in the plantations. Fallen trees were not removed and some areas were fully covered with weeds. Major threat to plants was the Azhukkal disease, which required anti-fungal treatment and presence of workers was very essential, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-tn-workers-to-enter-kerala/article32625894.ece
17 September 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Private bus operators resume services||Private bus operators have decided to resume services across the State, and some buses started plying on both mofussil and city routes in Tiruchi on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the Federation of Bus Operators Associations of Tamil Nadu had said that the operators would not be able to resume services until buses were allowed to operate to full seating capacity. Private buses remained off the roads even after the government allowed inter-district operations from September 7. “We have decided to start operations gradually from Wednesday, and some of the buses have begun plying in Tiruchi and other places,” D.R. Dharmaraj, secretary of the federation, told The Hindu . About 4,500 private buses, all stage carriers, have permits to operate on mofussil and city routes across the State, except in a few districts such as Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. “Our buses have been off the roads for five-and-a-half months. The moratorium period (on repayment of loans) has come to an end and we will have to pay the EMIs from this month and we need revenue. The crew have also been without jobs,” he explained. Mr. Dharmaraj said private buses would start hitting the roads upon obtaining a certification from the Regional Transport Offices for the “laid-up period” so that the validity of insurance of the vehicles could be extended for the duration when they were not in operation. “The RTOs have begun certifying the stoppage forms we had filed with them for this purpose. Once the certificates are issued, the vehicles will be back on roads,” he added. Mr. Dharmaraj said as of now, buses would be operated with 60% occupancy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-bus-operators-resume-services/article32625380.ece

17 September 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||District administration outwitted?||A day ahead of Mahalaya Amavasya , a large number of people on Wednesday thronged the Amma Mandapam bathing ghat in Srirangam to perform rituals in memory of their ancestors. The bathing ghats in the city were to be closed on Thursday as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19. Rows of people and purohits were seen seated along the Amma Mandapam bathing ghat on Wednesday morning as they gathered to perform the rituals. Many were seen violating personal distance norms, while some did not have masks, onlookers said. A large number of people come to bathing ghats along the Cauvery and Kollidam in the city on Mahalaya Amavasya every year to propitiate their forefathers. This year, however, Collector S. Sivarasu banned performance of rituals due to the pandemic and requested the public not to visit the ghats on Thursday. S. Mahalingam, who was at the ghat to perform rituals, said it was important to him to pray for his ancestors. “We decided to go a day in advance so that we could avoid the crowds. We did not expect such a gathering of people.” Some felt special arrangements should have been made at the bathing ghats to regulate the crow for Mahalaya Amavasya. “The district administration should have managed the crowd instead of banning people’s entry. It is a tradition to offer prayers here, and banning it only causes further overcrowding,” another visitor said. Meanwhile, T. M. Ranganathan, a resident of Srirangam, said rituals and prayers could be offered for a period of 15 days and people need not throng the bathing ghats. “ Mahalaya Amavasya is the first day of a fortnight of prayers for the wellbeing of ancestors. This year, many have performed the rituals in a small way at their homes due to COVID-19. Those who feel the need to take the holy dip can do it from Friday,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/district-administration-outwitted/article32626026.ece
17 September 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Government nod awaited to resume bookings for Yatri Nivas||Yatri Nivas, the guest house for devotees situated on the Kollidam river bank, is likely to be kept out of bound for devotees for a few more months. The facility, owned by Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, was closed for booking from the third week of March following the imposition of a nationwide lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19 virus. The advanced bookings were also cancelled as the temple too was closed. Yatri Nivas, which has 612 single rooms, 98 double rooms and 24 family cottages, can accommodate 1,000 devotees. It was built and opened in 2014 to provide budget accommodation to devotees. The facility was used to quarantine primary contacts of COVID-19 positive patients in June. However, only the dormitory block was allowed for the purpose. Family cottages and deluxe rooms were kept closed. Those quarantined at the facility were subsequently screened for the virus and those requiring treatment were sent to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. Asymptomatic patients were transferred to the COVID care centre at Khajamalai campus of Bharathidasan University. However, there has been a decline in the number of cases for the last few weeks in Tiruchi district. But, it is learnt that the district administration is inclined to keep the facilities under its control for a few more months. Officials are of the view that the facilities are very much needed to quarantine asymptomatic patients if there is a surge in cases. Ranganathaswamy Temple was reopened to public darshan on September 1. However, it has not yet resumed booking for Yatri Nivas. Though the premises has been cleaned fully, authorities are awaiting the State government’s permission to reopen the facility. Joint Commissioner cum Executive Officer of the Temple P. Jayaraman toldThe Hinduthat only a limited number of devotees were allowed to visit the temple. The situation was being closely monitored. Moreover, the government had not given permission to reopen accommodation facilities in temples across the State. Yatri Nivas would be opened only after getting the permission of the Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-nod-awaited-to-resume-bookings-for-yatri-nivas/article32626014.ece

The underpass is expected to be completed within a year. At present, work is underway to widen and build drains along the service lanes on both sides of the highway so that traffic could be diverted through them to facilitate construction of the underpass. The underpass was sanctioned in 2015 after a public outcry over a spate of accidents at the spot and an inspection by former Union Minister of State Pon. Radhakrishnan. The underpass and the seven minor bridges were sanctioned at a total cost of about Rs. 30.8 crore. Accidents have been frequent at Kondayampettai intersection ever since the bypass road was made a four-lane highway by NHAI. Hundreds of vehicles, including lorries and buses, cross the highway at the intersection from either side, creating chaos. Police have been forced to place multiple barricades to regulate vehicles.

17 September 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Private buses resume operation||Private operators started operating their buses to mofussil destinations on Wednesday since the State Government, while relaxing the lockdown norms for allowing public transport, made it clear that each bus should carry only 50% of its total capacity to ensure physical distancing among commuters. Even as the government buses started the operation, private buses were off the road as operators said they would incur huge loss if they had to operate the buses with 50% of passengers. Some private bus companies here resumed their bus services after a lot of pondering. They have decided to operate buses to mofussil destinations from Tirunelveli while abstaining from operating city buses. Of 174 private buses being operated in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts, only 60 buses hit the road on Wednesday. Though private bus crew carried only the permissible number of passengers even as they leave the bus terminus, fearing possible registration of cases against them for carrying more passengers, the norms were thrown to the winds when they crossed the city limits. “The TNSTC buses are being operated with more passengers as the number of government buses being operated does not meet the demand. So, we’re also allowing more passengers to board our buses as operating buses with just 50% of passengers will cause hefty loss as diesel price is going up everyday,” said conductor of a private bus company. The private bus crew expressed the hope that more number of private buses would be operated next week if they are allowed to take in more number of passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-buses-resume-operation/article32625871.ece
17 September 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Need to protect desilted tank||The Vaeinthaankulam tank surrounding the new bus-stand here, which was desilted a year ago with the public contribution of Rs. 12 lakh, is all set to become a ‘sewage tank’ once again as drainage discharged by shops in the bus terminus has started flowing into the tank. After a portion of Vaeinthaankulam, a rain-fed, non-irrigation tank, spread over nearly 20 acres, was filled with soil, it led to birth of a new bus-stand, the terminus for far off buses being operated by the State Express Transport Corporation and mofussil buses of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation. Though this water body was recharging the groundwater table, sewage generated in the bus stand was discharged into the tank. When Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish wanted desilting with public participation even as a good number of irrigation tanks was being desilted under the State-funded ‘kudimaramaththu’ scheme last year, a group of retired government officials, teachers and businessmen from Perumalpuram and NGO Colony areas joined hands together to revive the project. Within a few weeks, the ‘Nam Tamirabharani Iyakkam’, which was coordinating the desilting of Vaeinthaankulam tank and the NGO Colony Periyakulam, collected Rs. 12 lakh and executed it before the onset of monsoon. The Corporation, which is managing the Vaeinthaankulam bus-stand, was told to plug all pipes through which sewage was flowing into the tank. A good number of birds had nests inside the water body that was holding water till July this year. “Now, all our efforts are being threatened as sewage from the bus stand is flowing again even as this bus terminus is undergoing makeover under the ‘Smart City’ programme. If it continues, Vaeinthaankulam will become a pool of sewage again,” said Nallaperumal of ‘Nam Tamirabharani Iyakkam’. Assistant Executive Engineer, Melapalayam Zone, Lenin, assured that the sewage would not be discharged into the tank as steps had been taken to connect the drainage pipes with the underground drainage system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-to-protect-desilted-tank/article32625875.ece
17 September 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Workers oppose move to privatise Tangedco||Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) workers staged a demonstration here on Wednesday condemning the move to privatise TANGEDCO and “autocratic functioning” of two top officials. Addressing the protestors, K.K. Perumalsamy, district secretary, Joint Action Committee of TANGEDCO Trade Unions, said the Chairman and Managing Director of TANGEDCO and Joint Managing Director were taking unilateral decisions, which were posing more threat to workers and the organisation than the pandemic. Even as the workers were working round the clock to ensure uninterrupted power supply to consumers in the midst of COVID-19, these two officials had unilaterally decided to give on lease to private players the sub-stations at Sankarapuram in Villpuram district and Samayanallur in Madurai district. After freezing the ‘leave surrender’ benefits citing financial crunch, all norms pertaining to promotions and transfers were being violated blatantly and the works of TANGEDCO were being outsourced to pave way for entry of private firms into these operations, even as trade unions were fighting against it. “Even though all these anti-worker and anti-TANGEDCO issues were taken up with the Minister for Power, steps to privatise government property are being taken up more vigorously, which will destroy the organisation,” Mr. Perumalsamy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/workers-oppose-move-to-privatise-tangedco/article32625893.ece

17 September 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||A giant bond with humans||The bond between a Malabar giant squirrel and the shopkeepers around the Sims Park in Coonoor has become a source of great interest among locals as well as visiting tourists. The squirrel, which has been visiting the fruit shops around the park for the last two years, has become a much-loved visitor among local residents, who have gotten accustomed to seeing it in close quarters. S. Vidhyashree, a local Coonoor resident, said that she had first seen the animal collecting fruits from the shopkeepers around the park. “Since then, I have seen it a few more times, right next to the fruit shops, and many people now come to the Sims Park to catch a sight of the animal,” she said. Nazeema, a local shopkeeper who sells fruits around the Sims Park, said that she used to hand-feed the animal. “However, it was explained to me that I should not be encouraging this behaviour and so I have stopped,” said Ms. Nazeema, who had to close her fruit shop for the last six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “As there were no tourists coming to the park, and all the shops had closed down, I thought that the squirrel would have moved somewhere else or would not recognise the shopkeepers. To our surprise, the animal returned the very first day it saw us,” said Ms. Nazeema, adding that shopkeepers no longer actively feed the animal any fruits to discourage it from getting close to humans. “Even though we have stopped feeding it, the squirrel still seems to like to hang around the shops, and we are extremely pleased to see it every day and know that it is safe,” she said. Forest officials said that it was uncommon for the Malabar giant squirrel, which usually inhabits pockets of Shola forests in the Nilgiris and are known to be shy and reclusive, to strike up such a close bond with humans. They said that they are actively discouraging the shopkeepers from encouraging the animal to stray out of its habitat. “The problem with encouraging this kind of behaviour is that the animal might get too close to humans and come to harm as it becomes an easy target for poachers or even for stray dogs,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-giant-bond-with-humans/article32625436.ece

The house-warming ceremony was held on Wednesday. As many as 25 families live in the settlement, which is around 5 km away from Alamaramedu on Coimbatore - Anaikatty road. The existing houses in the settlement were constructed around 30 years ago under a government scheme. Walls and roofs of most of those houses had developed cracks. Cement plasters came off the roofs of many houses during the heavy rains last year and residents were sheltered at the Panachayat Union Middle School at Kondanur tribal settlement, around 2 km away. Following this, District Collector K. Rajamani and officials of the District Rural Development Authority (DRDA) visited the settlement. Orders were issued for the construction of 13 houses under the Green House project. As the government fund of Rs. 2.10 lakh for a green house with a solar energy unit was insufficient for construction, additional funds were mobilised under Joshua G.P.N., a social worker from the region. With construction of five houses completed and handed over to the families, other residents in the settlement have requested district administration and DRDA to sanction funds for similar houses for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tribal-families-get-new-houses-under-green-house-project/article32625431.ece

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Construction of six minor bridges nearing completion on Bypass Road||Construction of six minor bridges across canals and drains on service lanes along Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road is expected to be completed within the next 10 days. Lack of continuity of service lanes along the city stretch of the bypass road has been posing a threat to travellers ever since the road was upgraded as a four-lane highway by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). As the service lanes do not run across canals or drains, wrong side driving is rampant as motorists are forced to move to the main carriageway of the highway. The problem has been acutely felt near Kumbakonathan Salai-Chennai Bypass Road intersection, Sanjeevi Nagar and Oyamari Road intersection. Often, motorists have to sneak in the wrong direction across the main carriageway at the spots, risking their lives and limbs against speeding traffic coming from the opposite direction. There has been persistent demands from city residents for construction of minor bridges to link the service lanes. Construction of seven minor bridges across canals near Thiruvanaikovil, Sanjeevi Nagar and near Ariyamangalam road overbridge close to Palpannai and Senthaneerpuram was sanctioned a few years ago and the works began in mid-2019. “Work on six minor bridges is nearing completion and blacktopping will be done within a week to 10 days after which they will be opened for traffic,” a NHAI official toldThe Hindu. Construction of the bridges has come as a big relief to motorists. “It will be a big relief for those who commute on the road. It is essential to enforce left side driving on the two-way service lanes from now on,” said M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Services Organisation, who had been lobbying for linking the service lanes. Mr. Sekaran, who is also a member of the District Road Safety Council, says NHAI must complete linking of the service lane across the Uyyakondan near Senthaneerpuram on the western side too at the earliest. Work on this side has been held up pending the shifting of drinking water pipelines of Tiruchi Corporation. The work will be executed here once the pipelines are shifted, the NHAI official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/construction-of-six-minor-bridges-nearing-completion-on-bypass-road/article32626019.ece

The administration said, a total of 8,408 ineligible accounts were found to have been opened to avail the income support under the scheme meant for farmers. The accounts of non-farmers were credited with cash in instalments. The investigation was still under way. There were remaining 4,741 ineligible accounts that have come to the notice of the authorities. Joint efforts by the departments of revenue, horticulture, and agriculture were under way to recover the remaining funds that were credited to those accounts. Similarly, a complaint has also been lodged with the CB-CID police investigating the inter-district scam, against computer centres, their owners and other people, who had aided and abetted in scamming the government by creating ineligible accounts to siphon off the funds that were meant for the farmers here in Krishnagiri. Up to September 15, 2020, funds were recovered in full from 3,667 ineligible accounts. The scheme had run into troubled waters after it had come to fore that thousands of ineligible accounts were created by hacking into the password of an agriculture department official and the same was used to siphon off government funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-kisan-scam-rs-143-cr-recovered-from-3667-accounts-in-krishnagiri/article32625427.ece

Consequently, five Anna Universities of Technology, in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchi and Tirunelveli, were merged with Anna University. It was also under Jayalalithaa’s regime of 2001-06 that the unitary Anna University was first converted into an affiliating-type institution, bringing all engineering colleges under its ambit, after de-affiliating them from regional arts and science universities. Former Anna University Vice-Chancellor M. Anandakrishnan described the bifurcation as “a very unfortunate development”. He told The Hindu, “ They are looking at the wrong end of the problem. What they should be concentrating on is how to bring out the quality of teaching and learning and make students employable.” Questions were being raised on the employability of students, he said, adding that graduates’ entrepreneurial skills were very low. The State government had never been capable of providing funds to Anna University, he said, pointing to other sources of funding from various agencies and the examination fees. Mr. Anandakrishnan said the decision would affect colleges and students, who would not benefit from the expertise of [the original] Anna University. University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa said ATRU would be drained of funds. “The university was obtaining funds by conducting exams and through the affiliation process. Education is the State’s responsibility. They have to educate, train and provide human resources,” he said. “The alternative is to allow us to hike fees,” he added. Earlier, in the Assembly, former Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi (DMK) pointed out that the same AIADMK government had merged the AUTs established by the DMK regime with similar intentions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-anna-varsity-for-affiliating-engg-colleges/article32625396.ece

17 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Prices shoot up as onion crop is destroyed by heavy rain||Widespread losses of onion crop, poor quality of available produce caused by heavy rains, and reduced productivity has pushed up onion prices over the last fortnight. Onion growers, who were affected by poor rains in the start of the season, are now faced with the problem of heavy rains that has increased the moisture level in the soil resulting in crop losses or poor quality crop. The Centre has notified ban on onion exports as domestic price of onion has been going up steadily. May breach Rs. 40 mark For example, the wholesale price of good quality onions from Karnataka being traded in Bengaluru that was hovering between Rs. 20 and Rs. 22 a kg last week is now between Rs. 26 and Rs. 28 a kg, while the old onions from Maharashtra that cost around Rs. 22 a kg last week has touched Rs. 30 a kg now. Traders here are expecting the price to breach Rs. 40 per kg mark soon if the supply of quality onion is poor. According to Karisiddappa of Sri Jenukal Siddeshwara Traders here, fresh onion supplies from the State is currently from areas around Chitradurga, parts of Tumakuru and Chikkamagaluru, and that the quality was a concern since these harvested onions had high moisture content. “Onion supply from Maharashtra had declined and crops in North Karnataka have been affected by rains. Crops on Andhra Pradesh have been affected as well. We are expecting the price to go beyond Rs. 40 in the near future,” he added. The high soil moisture has led to the onion crop being affected by bulb rot disease in several districts, and there have been at least two instances of farmers destroying the crop affected by the disease in Ballari and Davangere districts. According to the farm scientists in Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Kalaburagi, over moisture in the soil during crop-maturity period led to many diseases and abnormal growth in onion crop such as basal rot, bulb and stem bending, imbalanced and uneven growth and tip burning and inflicted irreversible damages. The problem is widespread with most of the kharif onion cultivated on 1.52 lakh hectares in the State, especially the crop in black soil, in a similar condition. The crop which was supposed to be harvested and brought to the market by the first week of September is still struggling to survive on the wet soil. “The onion supply from Maharashtra and Telangana to the State has diminished due to extensive crop damage in the rains. It is very much that the dropped yield in the State, coupled with the diminished supply from outside, would widen the gap between demand and supply and lead to shooting up in prices in the days to come,” P. Vasudev Naik, a horticulture scientist at Kalaburagi KVK, told The Hindu . The rains have also had an adverse impact on the rabi onion expected to be cultivated on more than 4 lakh hectares in the State by delay in sowing. The sowing should have been completed in August and the crop is supposed to be harvested in January. “The rains have, however, pushed the sowing by a couple of months. It is likely that the rabi onion harvest would be in February or March next year and the lack of moisture content in the soil and dry weather during the maturity time would risk the crop to purple blotch disease and fall in the yield,” Zaheer Ahamed, plant pathologist from Kalaburagi KVK, said.

The family had to call the BBMP helpline requesting admission.  This is not an isolated case. Volunteer doctors assisting the BBMP in triaging positive patients said they are getting at least 10 to 15 calls a day seeking admission from patients who had earlier refused hospitalisation. This apart, many are going to private hospitals directly after their symptoms worsened following five to six days of home isolation. “When we call the patients after their reports turn positive, most go out of the way to explain that they have as many rooms as the number of cases in the family. Last week, a family of seven tested positive and they said they have seven rooms. It is unfortunate that patients are not honest when we do a tele-assessment of their symptoms and hide several facts,” said Nihad Niloufer, a volunteer doctor from StepOne, a group assisting the BBMP. Poornima S., another doctor from the group, said a 69-year-old obese patient from Kanakapura road, who has been on continuous positive airway pressure therapy machine for sleep apnea for the last 10 years, did not reveal this during the tele-consultation. “After three days, his son called saying the patient had developed severe breathing problems,” she said. Mohammed Rafiuddin Rashid, COVID care consultant at HBS Hospital in the city, said in the last one week, he had seen at least 60 patients whose conditions deteriorated a few days into home isolation. Attributing it to negligence on the part of the patients, Dr. Rashid said: “It is unfortunate that people don’t realise that oxygen is not the only treatment needed for COVID-19 patients. People can develop heart and neurological complications, which can turn fatal. I have seen three home isolation patients die in our casualty last week due to cardiac and other complications.” Ameen Muddasar, volunteer from Emergency Response Team, a group that helps and guides COVID-19 patients to get admission, said: “We have been getting several calls from home isolated patients seeking admission. It is unfortunate that some are not taking the home isolation concept seriously.” C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said the viral load in some patients can increase after the fifth day and that is the reason for some under home isolation turning critical. “We are seeing many low-risk patients crossing over to high risk. People should watch out for breathlessness and fatigue, apart from saturation and heart rate,” he said. Risk assessment “It is important that the risk assessment of all patients who choose home isolation is done in detail. Even mildly symptomatic patients can have hidden complications. Soon after they test positive, patients should undergo a chest X-ray. Their inflammatory markers such as D-dimer and C-reactive Protein should be tested based on which a decision on home isolation or hospitalisation should be taken,” Dr. Manjunath said. During home isolation, patients should regularly monitor pulse rate and heart rate. “If the heart rate is more than 110-120 along with low oxygen saturation, it is a matter of concern,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-home-isolation-patients-reporting-to-hospitals-after-symptoms-worsen/article32625347.ece
17 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Work on Kaggadasapura lake STP to begin soon||Kaggadasapura lake in east Bengaluru, which is prone to frothing much like Bellandur and Varthur lakes, will get some respite. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) will soon begin construction of a 5 MLD capacity Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) near the lake. The groundbreaking ceremony of the STP is slated to be held on Thursday. Residents attribute the frothing to two drains, which they say, let untreated sewage into the lake. “The project, which has a budget of Rs. 26.38 crore, will take 18 months to complete. Once the STP is completed and commissioned, the health and ecology of the lake will automatically improve,” said Gangadhar B.C., chief engineer (wastewater management), BWSSB. Meanwhile, work order for construction of a 7 MLD STP at Puttenahalli lake in Hebbal valley was issued recently. “Both these projects – STPs at Kaggadasapura and Puttenahalli lakes – were proposed under the guidance of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,” he said. But for the lake to be rejuvenated, residents in and around the area said the authorities simultaneously need to crack down on indiscriminate dumping of construction and demolition waste. S. Raghu., MLA, C.V. Raman Assembly constituency, said that it was a long-standing demand of citizens and activists. “Along with construction of STP, we will also begin rejuvenation of the lake. Rs. 8.6 crore has been sanctioned in this regard,” he said. According to Mr. Gangadhar, the STP will help in the rejuvenation, maintenance and protection of not just of Kaggadasapura lake but also Bellandur and Varthur lakes as all three fall under the K.C. Valley system. Another senior BWSSB official said that three STPs linked to Bellandur and Varthur lakes – 5 MLD STP at Sarakki, 10 MLD STP at Hulimavu and 35 MLD STP at Agaram – have been commissioned. “Five MLD STP at Chikkabeguru is completed and will be commissioned by the end of September. The wastewater wet well of 32.5 MLD near the premises of the 90 MLD Bellandur Amanikere STP will be completed by March 2021,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/work-on-kaggadasapura-lake-stp-to-begin-soon/article32625315.ece
17 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Probe failure of police as well in D.J. Halli violence’||Urging the State government to expand the scope of inquiry into the recent violence at D.J. Halli and K.J. Halli, a fact-finding team comprising civil society groups wants the probe to include alleged police failure in handling the violence. The report that was released on Wednesday said the police had failed in taking action against P. Naveen Kumar, who had put up an inflammatory post on Facebook that had triggered the violence, and also taking adequate measures to prevent escalation of violence. The intelligence wing of the police should be probed for its failure to anticipate trouble, the report said. As many as four persons were killed in police action on August 11 as violence broke out in K.J. Halli and D.G. Halli police limits following an inflammatory post against Islam put up on Facebook by Naveen Kumar, the nephew of Pulikeshinagar legislator Akhanda Srinivasmurthy. Some of the steps taken post violence, the report said, amounted to human rights violation, and pointed out that the government had appointed a Claims Commissioner to recover cost even before the enquiry is completed. This comes at a time when the government has decided to drop criminal cases against 62 elected representatives/leaders belonging to the BJP, the report stated. The violence seems to be not pre-planned nor communally instigated, since there was not enough evidence to prove these, the report said, adding that it appeared like the mob did not have leadership. It, however, said that there have been attempts to use the violence for political gains by the BJP and its affiliates. The fact-finding team has urged the government to withdraw cases against the accused under the UAP Act. The government should also start a socio economic survey of the violence-hit areas to understand the impact of COVID-19 that has resulted in loss of livelihood and health issues, the report urged. The 23-member panel, which included child rights activist Neena Nayak, was the fourth fact-finding committee, after those formed by the Congress, the BJP, and another by a group called Citizens for Democracy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/probe-failure-of-police-as-well-in-dj-halli-violence/article32625322.ece

17 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Scholarship offered to degree students for optional languages withdrawn by govt.||The State government has withdrawn the scholarship offered to students who choose optional languages as a subject in degree colleges. This will come into effect from the 2020-21 academic year, The Department of Collegiate Education (DCE) was providing a monthly stipend of Rs. 50 to students in government and aided colleges if they chose Kannada, English or Sanskrit. This scholarship was offered to encourage more students to take up languages as a subject. Teachers and students feel that this decision will not only adversely affect the number of students who choose optional languages henceforth, but also have an impact on the growth of these languages. “In today’s competitive scenario, people are choosing professional courses and there are hardly any takers for languages. Small incentives like this would help us get at least a few students. We are sure that the numbers will dwindle further with this move,” said a principal of a first grade degree college in Bengaluru. Amaresh Kadagada, State president, Students’ Federation of India, said that the State government was cutting down on several incentives for students. “The first budgetary cut at a time of financial crisis is always done for students as the government considers us an easy target. Cutting such scholarships will affect students from low socio-economic backgrounds,” he said. Sources in the Department of Collegiate Education said that the decision was taken by the Finance Department and they are forced to comply with it.   Another student said that this decision reflected the government’s attitude towards the development of languages. “The State government claims to be fighting to protect Kannada. But by cancelling the scholarship, it shows that they are not concerned about languages,” said the student, echoing the views of many of his peers. The Kannada Development Authority (KDA) has sought a report from the government, but has yet to receive a response. “We will write a letter again and ask for a report. Based on the report, we will then decide on the course of action,” said T.S. Nagabharana, chairperson, KDA.  The State government claims to be fighting to protect Kannada. But by cancelling the scholarship, it shows that they are not concerned about languages.

17 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rules for KSPCB appointments to be modified||The State government on Wednesday agreed to modify the guidelines for selection of candidates to posts of chairperson, member-secretary and members to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) following a suggestion made by the Karnataka High Court. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi, after going through the guidelines notified in June 2020, suggested to the State Advocate-General that it is better to modify the guidelines to avoid future litigation on appointments to be made to these posts based on the present guidelines. Noticing that there are discrepancies in the guidelines on eligibility and qualification to be followed not only for selecting chairperson but also for the member-secretary and other members to the board, the Bench said that the present guideline requires modification to incorporate the observations made by the apex court as well as provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The Bench was hearing PIL petitions, which have questioned the guidelines framed in June as well as the appointment of the present member-secretary to the board. The Bench, during the previous hearing, had already directed the government not to finalise the candidate to the post of board’s chairperson till the order of the court in view of variation in the qualification fixed in the guideline and the Water Act. As A-G Prabhuling K. Navadgi said that the draft of the modified guidelines would be placed before the court on Monday, the Bench adjourned further hearing till September 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rules-for-kspcb-appointments-to-be-modified/article32625335.ece
17 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC: Examine if there are delays in completing probes in atrocity cases||The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday asked the State government to examine whether there are delays in completion of investigations in cases registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, as the law mandates completion of probe in 60 days. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi posed this question after perusing the data submitted by the government on number of FIRs registered, number of cases of charges sheets filed, closure of investigation, cases under investigation, pending trial, number of convictions, and acquittals. The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by Parishishta Jathi/Parishishta Pangadagala Melvicharane Mattu Balavardhana Sangha, Bengaluru, complaining about effective implementation of SC and ST (PoA) Act. As per data submitted by the government, investigation of 1,284 cases were pending as during 2019 of the total 2,491 cases, which included some of the cases carried forward from the previous year. The data also pointed out that of the 9,448 cases pending trial in 2019, only 23 cases ended in conviction, in 549 cases the accused were acquitted, and 8,876 cases remained pending in courts at the end of the year. As Senior Counsel Jayna Kothari, appearing foe the petitioner, pointed out low rate of conviction, the Bench said it is a complex issue involving analysis of evidences while asking the government to provide details of the review meetings held by the committees constituted as per apex court’s direction for reviewing the cases ended in acquittals.   The government also told the court that an average of 2.25 lakh criminal cases are reported in a year, including under IPC and other laws. Of these, 1.2 lakh cases are registered under the IPC alone in a year and cases under the SC and ST (PoA) Act are around 2,000 a year, which constitutes 1.5% of the total criminal cases. The Bench directed the Registrar-General of the High Court to file a report on vacancy in the post of judicial officers as the government said that it has requested the High Court to set up 12 more special courts in addition to the existing eight to try the cases registered under the Act. Though the government said the police officers are being sensitised at the State Police Academy on conducting probe under this Act, the Bench said that training can be provided to police at the Karnataka Judicial Academy if the government found it necessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-examine-if-there-are-delays-in-completing-probes-in-atrocity-cases/article32625343.ece

17 September 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||CBI questions Cong. leader in Yogeeshgouda murder case||Close on the heels of questioning Vijay Kulkarni, younger brother of the former Minister Vinay Kulkarni in Bengaluru two days ago, officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation questioned another Congress leader Hanumanth Koravar in Dharwad on Wednesday in connection with the investigation of the murder of BJP leader Yogeeshgouda Goudar. According to sources, CBI sleuths questioned Mr. Koravar at the Dharwad Suburban Police Station here for close to three hours. Subsequently, the sleuths approached a local court and filed an application under Section 195A of Cr.PC, which is required to seek permission to file a separate FIR. It is learnt that the CBI is likely to file the separate FIR containing the charge of issuing a threat and tampering with evidence against a few persons in connection with the case. Following a plea by the elder brother of Yogeeshgouda Goudar, Gurunathgouda, the case was handed over to the CBI for investigation. Mr. Gurunathgouda has made several allegations against top officials and a former Minister saying that they met him seeking a truce and even issued a threat to him. He had also alleged that a few persons had tampered with evidence connected to the case. Yogeeshgouda Goudar, then a zilla panchayat member from the BJP, was hacked to death in his gymnasium in Dharwad in June 2016. BJP leaders had demanded a CBI inquiry then alleging the involvement of Congress leaders, including Mr. Vinay Kulkarni. While the then Congress government declined to hand it over to the CBI, the BJP government handed the case over to the CBI after coming to power.  The CBI filed in a local court an application under Section 195A of Cr.PC seeking permission to file a separate FIR containing the charge of issuing a threat and tampering with evidence against a few persons||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cbi-questions-cong-leader-in-yogeeshgouda-murder-case/article32625446.ece

Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Pattedar demanded that the government abrogate the special status accorded to the region and sought statehood for the region comprising six districts of Kalyana Karnataka. Mr. Pattedar said that even after eight years, the purpose of the amendment, Article 371(J), to the Constitution according special status to the region had not been served. Though the government was releasing large amount of funds for the inclusive development of the six districts of Kalyana Karnataka, the infrastructure gaps and lack of basic amenities are still plaguing the region, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/statehood-sought-for-kalyana-karnataka-region/article32625451.ece

Patil has said. Addressing a press conference in Kalaburagi on Wednesday, he said the the initiative will be introduced in Koppal district. “Standing crops often get infected and farmers normally don’t know what measures are to be taken. To address this issue, we are going to introduce mobile laboratories. A toll-free number will be introduces and any farmer can call it and summon the laboratory to the field. Our staff will examine the affected crop and suggest remedies on the spot. We are going to start it shortly with 20 vans in Koppal and later expand it to the entire State,” he said. He added that the project of issuing identity cards to every farmer will also be undertaken from Koppal as a pilot project. Mr. Patil also indicated that his government was thinking of setting up a soil testing laboratory in each gram panchayat. “Soil testing is a method to know what supplement the soil exactly needs. Presently, the soil-testing laboratories are largely inaccessible to the farmers for many reasons. We are exploring the ways to realise our Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for establishing such centres in each GP and rationalising the pricing so as to make it affordable,” he said. Asked about the cancellation of entrance test for BSc. Agriculture courses and resultant inconvenience to the students with agricultural backgrounds, Mr. Patil clarified that the cancellation because of COVID-19 would, in no way, affect their prospects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-to-introduce-mobile-labs-to-examine-health-of-standing-crops/article32625351.ece

17 September 2020||Kumar Buradikatti,KARNATAKA||Name change brings little else to Kalyana Karnataka||Renaming Hyderabad Karnataka – the region comprising six north-eastern districts of the State – as Kalyana Karnataka a year ago is often projected as a milestone in the region’s history. It is also used by the BJP as a counterweight to the fact that it was during the Congress regime that the region got Special Status with the insertion of Article 371(J) of the Constitution in 2002. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa did not only proclaimed the region as Kalyana Karnataka on September 17, 2019, on Kalyana Karnataka Utsav Day (which was earlier celebrated as Hyderabad Karnataka Liberation Day), he also made several promises as a gesture of his government’s commitment to the development of the region. “I will establish a separate secretariat for the effective implementation of Article 371(J) of the Constitution. I will open a branch office of the Hyderabad Karnataka Special Cell in Kalaburagi. I will increase the special grants to KKRDB [Kalyana Karnataka Regional Development Board] in the next budget. I will take measures to fill the 10,748 posts lying vacant in the region so that the local unemployed youth can get the job,” Mr. Yediyurappa had then said. Now, one year down the line, none of the promises are fulfilled, while he is set to hoist the national flag in Kalaburagi to mark the Kalyana Karnataka Utsav on Thursday. The government has not allocated the additional funds for the project that is estimated to cost around Rs. 200 crore but asked the KKRDB to use money from the special grants allocated for the implementation special status under Article 371(J) of the Constitution. According to the Chittapur MLA and former Minister Priyank Kharge, “The BJP government is systematically undermining the existing systems in place for the region. For example, the post of KKRDB chairman was earlier meant for only the Cabinet Minister from the region and is now downgraded to be assumed by MLA or party worker. BJP had promised to increase the special grants for the region from Rs. 1,500 crore to Rs. 2,000 crore. But, now it has directed KKRDB to prepare action plans only for around Rs. 1100 crore. The government has Rs. 120 crore to build Kannada Bhavan in Delhi and Rs. 200 crore to build a community hall in Tirupati, but it doesn’t have money for the development of Kalyana Karnataka,” he said.  ‘No moral right’  Razak Ustaad, an activist from Raichur who was in the forefront of the mass agitations for the Article 371(J), said that Mr. Yediyurappa had no moral right to hoist the national flag to mark Kalyana Karnataka Ustav Day as he did not fulfil even a single promise he had made a year ago.  The BJP government is systematically undermining the existing systems in place for the region...

Speaking after inspecting several areas affected by sea erosion and also those where preventive works have been taken up in Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Mohan said that the permanent solution would be arrived at using the latest technology. One such work was taken up at Ullal-Mukkacheri recently and it has helped arrest sea erosion, he noted. Mr. Mohain inspected a Rs. 18-crore project comprising a 635-m-long and 10-m-tall protection wall at Mukkacheri. Such protection walls, the officer said, could help prevent sea erosion. The government would be urged to opt for permanent protection walls in areas prone to sea erosion in the coming days. Giving the example of the Someshwara stretch that has been witnessing large-scale sea erosion, Mr. Mohan asked officials concerned to submit a comprehensive report in consultation with the local people to plan for a permanent solution.

17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,KARNATAKA||‘NLAT questions leaked soon after test started’||Petitioners and students complained to the Supreme Court on Wednesday that questions in the National Law Admission Test (NLAT) 2020, conducted by the National Law School India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, were leaked within several minutes of the commencement of the exam. “The NLAT started at noon, and by 12.52 p.m., the paper was leaked,” senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan submitted before a three-judge Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan. Senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta, for the petitioners, said the NLSIU should have not held the NLAT while still being part of the consortium. The university should have adhered to the bylaws of the consortium. The Common Law Admission Test was postponed owing to the pandemic like any other exam. The Consortium of National Law Universities has expressed its concern about the “mass cheating” and leaking of questions reported during the NLAT. However, NLSIU has explained that NLAT complied with the “triple test” of being fair, transparent, and non-exploitative. It has, in turn, urged the court to permit it to release the NLAT results. On September 11, the Bench allowed the conduct of NLAT, but restrained NLSIU from declaring the results till further orders. The NLAT, held on September 12, was plagued by reports of cheating and technical errors. The question paper was leaked during the re-examination held on September 14. The former NLSIU Vice-Chancellor Venkat Rao, who challenged NLAT in the SC, said “there has never been a leak of this magnitude ever reported in any of the earlier law entrance examinations held by the consortium”. “Respondent No. 1 (NLSIU) has miserably failed in conducting the NLAT exam and has made a large number of candidates suffer. The examination and its procedure lack transparency and cannot be termed as a success by the widest stretch of imagination,” Mr. Rao submitted. The consortium, through its secretary and NALSAR Vice-Chancellor Faizan Mustafa, has accused NLSIU of adopting a “cavalier attitude” jeopardising the lives of students. The NLSIU has defended its authority to stray from the consortium and conduct its own separate admission test. NLSIU said it was within statutory powers to do so. It was not constrained by judicial directions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nlat-questions-leaked-soon-after-test-started/article32625353.ece

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BMTC should reduce its bus fare for shorter distances, says IISc. study||Will lower fares, especially for short distances, encourage people to use public transport? While people are currently steering clear of buses and other modes of public transport during the pandemic, this will not be the case in the long run. A study conducted by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) on sustainable urban transport policies to improve the public transportation system with a focus on city bus services has recommended that the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) reduce fares for short distance travel. It also advocated the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (dedicated lanes) to decongest the city’s roads. The study observes that the existing fare structure of the Corporation starts with a low fare, but the rates increase rapidly for short distances, followed by a very small and steady growth for medium and long distance travel. At present, the BMTC charges Rs. 5 for the first stage (2 km), but for 4 km, the fare doubles to Rs. 10. A 6-km commute is priced around Rs. 15. “Such a fare structure seems to be promoting the usage of buses for longer distances than short ones. Today, with Bengaluru having a mass rapid transit system, i.e. metro service, in place, the BMTC buses should be used more for short trips, cheaper mode or as a last-mile connecting feeder system instead of a long trip provider,” said the researchers in the study. Associate Professor of Transportation System Engineering (IISc.) Ashish Verma, who is one of the authors of the study, said that higher fares for shorter trips is a disadvantage. “The proposed fare structure based on the finding will help BMTC to restructure its fares to attract more ridership and revenue. At present, due to the high fares for shorter distances, people are using private modes of transport, such as two-wheelers. On the other hand, implementing BRT on major roads will help efficiency of public transport.” The study recommends a reduction in the rate of increment of bus fares for small and small-medium distances: Rs. 7 for the first 2 km, then Rs. 8 till 4 km, followed by Rs. 10 for 6 km, Rs. 12 till 8 km and Rs. 15 for 10 km. Thereafter, the rate can increase by Rs. 2 per stage.  Prioritise bus lanes  In another major recommendation, the study proposes Bus Rapid Transit be given prominence. At present, a priority lane has been provided on Outer Ring Road. There is a proposal to introduce such lanes on other major roads in the city. The study found that BRT will increase the ridership of BMTC by more than 4% and will also improve the revenue by almost 23% along with drastically reducing vehicular emission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmtc-should-reduce-its-bus-fare-for-shorter-distances-says-iisc-study/article32625332.ece

Kumaraswamy on Wednesday demanded to know why the Union government had not included women or an expert in Dravidian culture in the committee tasked to study Indian culture for the past 12,000 years. He expressed doubts about the objectiveness of the proposed study as the committee is “full of those who are appearing to have prejudices over culture, history, and heritage, besides being fully occupied by North Indians.” He said there was a dire need to reconstitute the committee.   “The Centre constituted a 16-member expert committee to study Indian culture for the past 12,000 years. It is very unfortunate that the panel does not have any Kannadigas or South Indians who know Dravidian culture. It does not even have a woman member!” Mr. Kumaraswamy tweeted. Kannadiga representation “Is it possible to conduct a fair and unbiased study of Karnataka’s culture and heritage without having Kannadiga representatives in the committee? How can we think of studying the history and culture of the country by keeping South Indians out?” Mr. Kumaraswamy asked. In another tweet, he sought to know how the expert committee to “study the culture of a country that worships women does not have place for any woman”.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Manufacturer replaces malfunctioning TV set||Kalpana, a resident of Mandya, went through a lot of mental agony after a 65-inch OLED television set she purchased from a consumer durable store in the town by paying Rs. 3.49 lakh malfunctioned within a week of its purchase in September 2017. When the store management and the manufacturer failed to honour the warranty and replace the defective product despite her repeated pleas, she approached the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Mandya, for relief. Eventually, she got justice earlier this month – exactly three years after she purchased the television set. The manufacturer from Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh not only replaced the malfunctioning television set, but also coughed up a penalty of Rs. 60,000. After hearing the complainant, Forum President Ramachandra M.S. and member Vasanthkumara, in an order dated March 21, 2020, directed the opposite parties – store management and the television manufacturer – to deliver a new television set of the same model to the complainant within 60 days of the date of the order failing which they would be liable to pay Rs. 500 per day from the date of the order till the direction is complied with. Mental agony The Forum also directed the opposite parties to pay Rs. 25,000 towards deficiency of service and Rs. 5,000 towards mental agony of the complainant within 60 days. When the directions were not complied with, the complainant moved an execution petition in the Forum. On August 27, 2020, a representative of the opposite party appeared before the Forum and said they were unable to comply with the orders in view of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. They filed an application seeking exemption from paying Rs. 500 per day that the Forum had ordered the opposite parties to pay till the orders were complied. After the Forum waived the Rs. 500 per day penalty, the opposite parties and the complainant came to an understanding that the latter will withdraw her execution petition after receiving a new television set of the same model, besides Rs. 60,000 as penalty from the manufacturer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/manufacturer-replaces-malfunctioning-tv-set/article32625327.ece

17 September 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||Case against local body chiefs on farmers’ plaint||The police have filed a case against the presidents of the Ayyappancoil and Kanchiyar grama panchayats and others on complaints that they had collected money from farmers on the promise that they would be given title deeds in the three chain areas of the ten chain area near the Idukki reservoir. One chain area is equal to 66 ft and the government has already decided to give title deeds to those residing in the ten chain area. A senior police officer told The Hindu on Tuesday that a case was filed and inquiry was on. The case was registered against Ten Chain Title Deed Council (Pathuchain Pattya Samithi) chairman and Ayyaoppancoil grama panchayat president A.L. Babu, its convener and Kanchiyar grama panchayat president V.R. Sasi, secretary K.J. Joseph and treasurer T.N. Gopinathapillai. It was alleged that they had collected money from the farmers in the three chain area of the two panchayats on the promise that they would be given title deeds. It is alleged that they had collected Rs. 500 to Rs. 12,000 from around 2,500 farmers depending on the area under them. About 190 farmers filed a complaint with the Chief Minister and an inquiry had been ordered on its basis, said the police officer. According to the complaint, a meeting attended by E.S.

Speaking after inaugurating the protest, P.M. Joy, chairman, KPS, said that the Ministry had issued similar notifications to declare eco-sensitive zones in the six of the 18 wildlife sanctuaries in the State. Mr. Joy said according to the draft notification issued on August 5, the eco-sensitive zone will be to an extent of up to 1 km around the boundary of the sanctuaries. “If the draft is implemented, it will adversely affect the lives of close to 50,000 farmers living on the fringes of the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary which is spread over 13 villages,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-stage-protest-against-eco-sensitive-zones/article32625802.ece

17 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||It’s boom time for healthtech start-ups||Healthtech start-ups seems to be thriving in the State in the wake of COVID-19 with the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) registering a growth of 15% to 20% in their numbers in the last six months. A total of 126 healthtech start-ups are now operational across the State, collectively attracting government grants of Rs. 5 crore for their innovations to fight the challenge posed by the pandemic. The products and solutions thrown up by these start-ups include a dedicated app for the State government for real-time dissemination of information and alerts on COVID-19, comprehensive telemedicine solutions, access control solutions, robot for serving food and other consumables in isolation wards, N95 masks, automatic mask disposal machine, portable ventilator, social distancing turnstiles, etc. Hand-holding KSUM authorities say that it has evolved a protocol for the proper hand-holding of these start-ups by serving as a facilitator, bringing together multiple stakeholders for testing and validation of products. The Kalamasserry-based hardware technology incubator Maker Village has added around six new healthtech start-ups since the pandemic in addition to the eight to 10 existing ones. “While the sector offers tremendous growth potential, the challenge is in facilitating clinical tests and validation. This calls for strengthening tie-ups with health-care industry players and sensitising them to the fact that the association offered a win-win situation,” says Prasad Balakrishnan Nair, CEO, Maker Village. Support system Efforts are on to set up a structured institutional mechanism in association with the reputed health-care industry players from within the State and outside. Technology and design experts insist that offering a low-cost version of existing medical equipment is not always the right way to look at innovations in the field. “Proof of Concept, prototype, and pilot stages in product development, especially in medtech area, need to be well understood. Proof of Concept can use the standard equipment in the lab and need not be in the final form or fit of the product, said K.R. Suresh Nair, founder CEO of Design Alpha, an initiative of Tata Trust, operating out of the Infopark. “Though in the conventional product development cycle, the next phase is proto design, in Medtech, we always recommend a few more stages for Proof of Concept,” Mr. Nair said. Design for manufacturability, regulatory compliance, reliability requirements cannot be an afterthought and that offers complete hand-holding from the concept to the product stage, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-boom-time-for-healthtech-start-ups/article32625842.ece

The consortiums are Zonta Infratech Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru; Zonta Bauer Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, Bauer GmbH, Germany; CNIM Martin Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, and Tholani Clean Energy Pvt. Ltd., Kochi, Aban Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., Chennai; Greensol Systems Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, Hangzhou Boiler Group Co Ltd., China. The evaluation of the bids is expected to be completed by October-end, according to senior officials of the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC). The committee entrusted with the evaluation of technical bids will check whether the consortiums meet the minimum eligibility requirements as prescribed in the request for proposal issued by the KSIDC. The plant will be set up based on Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer mode for the Ernakulam cluster of local bodies. The cluster includes the Kochi Corporation and the municipalities of Thrikkakara, Thripunithura, Kalamassery, Eloor, Maradu, Aluva, Perumbavoor, Angamaly, North Paravur, Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam, Piravom, and Koothattukulam. The firm to be chosen for the execution of the project in 20 acres at Brahmapuram will have powers to mortgage the leasehold rights over the said area for raising funds for the initiative. The government had already asked the Secretary, Kochi Corporation, to hand over land to the KSIDC on lease basis. The KSIDC will sub-lease the land to the firm for 27 years, with permission to mortgage the leasehold rights for raising funds only for the project. The government had invited fresh tenders for the project after it cancelled the approval granted to G.J. Nature Care Consortium on April 30 this year. It had said that the consortium had failed to achieve financial closure of the project even after 1,400 days of signing the agreement. The project report submitted by the firm was approved by the government on January 4, 2016. The company had termed the cancellation as “unfair” while holding the government responsible for the inordinate delay in issuing permit clearances for the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-consortiums-submit-bid-for-wte-project-at-brahmapuram/article32625810.ece

The Nedumbassery police have registered a case invoking the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 225B (Resistance or obstruction to lawful apprehension, or escape or rescue in cases not otherwise provided for) and for violation of the COVID protocol under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance. A resident of Kuttampuzha, the accused was arrested by the local police under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on September 9 before being moved into the FLTC on testing positive. “He lives on the fringes of the forest near a tribal hamlet along the Adimali border. We checked the area after receiving a tip-off that he was back home. However, we could not find him,” said Mahesh Kumar, Inspector, Kuttampuzha. He had escaped from the FLTC with the mobile phone of a nurse on Tuesday. Though police personnel were deployed at the FLTC where four other accused were also kept, their lodging was some 250 metres away to maintain physical distancing.

The proposal, if implemented, will enable hundreds of families in Chellanam and parts of neighbouring Fort Kochi to live in peace, besides saving the government substantial amount of money now being spent on periodic support extended to the villagers, said Shaji George of KRLCC. The proposal is for building breakwaters, widening and cleaning up the storm water drainage system as well as depositing dredged material from the port area in Chellanam to help reduce the rate of sea erosion. Breakwaters, extending up to 1.2 km into the sea from the shore, can prevent sea erosion. The cost of building breakwaters will be around Rs. 400 crore, said the proposal submitted to the government. The proposal was drawn up after wide consultations with local residents as well as experts on the character of sea erosion and coast formation, said T.A. Dalphine of Coastal Area Protection Society for West Kochi. Along with measures to protect the coast, there is also a suggestion to improve the storm water drainage system in Chellanam, so that even if the village is flooded, water will be easily drained off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rs-420-cr-project-proposed-to-protect-coast/article32625805.ece
17 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||New movement all set for electoral fray in Kochi||V4 Kochi, a new organisation claiming to be a people’s movement aimed at dislodging mainstream political parties, which it allege are mired in corruption, has thrown its hat in the electoral ring by proposing to field candidates in all 74 divisions in the Kochi Corporation in the forthcoming local body polls. Announcing this at a press conference here on Wednesday, the V4 Kochi team said taking the benefits of direct democracy to the people in a transparent manner using technology remained its solution to end the deep-rooted corruption and vested interests of political outfits. Nipun Cherian, an engineering graduate and campaign controller of the organisation, however, distanced the outfit from the apolitical corporate-backed charity outfit, Twenty20, which swept into power at Kizhakkambalam at the expense of mainstream political parties. “We are not apolitical, and our structure is way different from Twenty20, though we are keeping a close watch on its people-friendly services. Our political ideology is rooted in ‘connectivity’, and we propose to transfer power to people through value-based politics. We have a clear idea of how society should work and how to ensure it, which, in our view, are the two core aspects of any ideology,” he said. He added that the core team of the organisation was made up of people who had been active in the various social causes in the city. Admitting that finding candidates for all the 74 divisions remained a challenge, Mr. Cherian said the organisation was open to public-spirited people, genuine independent candidates, and even those who had left political parties frustrated by their ways. “Professionals with an assured income will be our candidates, while none pursuing politics and social service as their sole objectives would be fielded. Our campaign expenses will be mobilised from people through bank accounts, and not a penny more than the Election Commission-permitted campaign fund will either be mobilised or spent,” Mr. Cherian claimed. Implementing universal basic income, live streaming of ward sabha meetings, shutting down the Brahmapuram solid waste treatment plant and converting it into a wetland park, implementation of Kochi e-governance system, and publication of all public data in compliance with the Right to Information Act are among the organisation’s governance plans if voted to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-movement-all-set-for-electoral-fray-in-kochi/article32625806.ece
17 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Pandemic-hit find a saviour in ration shops||Manoj Kumar, a private company executive living with his family at an apartment near Palarivattom, never felt the need for a ration card. In fact, being a member of the once thriving middle class community with a stable income, queuing up before a Public Distribution System (PDS) outlet even appeared a bit infra dig. Then the pandemic broke out, and the SARS-COV-2 virus in its wake took away half his salary. Suddenly, a ration card seemed not such a bad idea after all. “It was not the kits of essential items distributed by the government through PDS shops alone but the quality of those items vouched for by my friends who bought them that prompted me to apply for ration card,” said Mr. Kumar. And, going by the rush at rations shops across the city, he seems but just a member of a new tribe who has woken up to the utility of a ration card. Figures maintained by the District Supply Office on offtake of food grain from ration shops also suggest this newfound love. From 9,072.978 metric tonnes of food grain, including rice and wheat, supplied through ration shops in September last year, the volume registered more than two-fold rise to 17,041 metric tonnes last month. In fact, the offtake has consistently hit five-digit volume since the pandemic, with April recording the biggest spike of nearly 20,000 metric tones. Jyothi Krishna, District Supply Officer, said even after discounting the special allocation of food grain by both the Central and State governments, there was a perceptible surge in offtake through ration shops. The number of ration card holders also seems set to increase from the existing 8.50 lakh in the district, going by the renewed interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-hit-find-a-saviour-in-ration-shops/article32625808.ece

Justice V.G. Arun, while issuing the directive, kept in abeyance the State Police Chief's circular directing all police stations not to register First Information Reports (FIRs) based on individual complaints received from investors and asking to transfer complaints to the Konni police station. The court directed the Station House Officers to register separate cases and FIRs on receipt of such complaints. Directive to Centre The court directed the Centre to take a decision on the request of the State government for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the cases expeditiously. If the Centre decided to entrust the probe to the CBI, a special investigation team consisting of officers having experience and expertise in investigating economic offences should be constituted by the CBI, the court ordered. The court passed the order on a batch of petitions seeking a CBI probe in the cheating case and invocation of the provisions of the KPID Act. According to the petitioners, a CBI probe was essential as the directors of the Konni-based non-banking finance firm had swindled depositors to the tune of around Rs. 2,000 crore. They also challenged the refusal of the police to register separate FIRs on individual complaints.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-orders-closure-of-all-popular-finance-branches/article32625497.ece

The CCI, which issued an order on March 24, 2017, based on Mr. Vinayan’s complaint, imposed a penalty of 11.25 lakh on FEFKA, Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA), and its representatives for violation of the provisions under the Competition Act, 2002.

A project integrating biosaline agriculture and cage aquaculture developed by the International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming (IRTCBSF), Kuttanad, will help them in protecting their crops from the adverse effects of environmental degradation. “Earlier, we used to cultivate rice and coconut in abundance, but with the salinity levels going up all those farms are lying idle. Fish farmers are also suffering as there is a considerable dip in the catch from Ashtamudi Lake. This project, funded by the Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, has been conceived as a measure to survive environment-related issues and improve the ecology of the island,” says Munroe Thuruthu grama panchayat president Binu Karunakaran. The project aims to introduce a sustainable and innovative land use model by implementing multi-commodity farming and the first model farm at Peringalam will be inaugurated on Saturday. A Kuttanad touch Rice varieties such as pokkali with high salinity tolerance will be used for farming while fish and duck will be raised along, emulating a method in Kuttanad polders. “The polders and ponds will be protected by a thick bio-belt of mangroves, which will also help in shoreline protection and soil stabilisation. Residents were cooperative when we put forward the idea of a bio-wall and fence farming will be done in some parts. It is a comprehensive project of adaptive farming as some of the dykes will also be used for rainwater harvesting,” says K.G. Padmakumar, principal investigator of the project. Since Munroe Thuruthu is a wetland strewn with lagoons and canals, it is an ideal location for aquaculture. Open water-cage farming will be carried out and the fish will be fed with commercial pellets instead of the traditional methods as part of the project. “Munroe Thuruthu residents are the first set of climate refugees from our land and since land is a scarce resource on the island, the focus will be more on aquaculture. Due to its high commercial value, pearl spot will be raised in designated areas in the backwater adjoining the island. Seeds of Kanjirottu kaayal karimeen, the most-relished pearl spot variety, will be ranched,” says Mr.Padmakumar. Fisher self-help groups in the ward will be responsible for cage maintenance, feeding, marketing, and monitoring the environment under the guidance of experts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-salinity-spikes-munroe-thuruthu-switches-gear/article32625820.ece

Mr. Rao said that steps had been taken for home isolation treatment for infected persons if there is a peak in their numbers. However, people would be given a choice and those aged above 50 and suffering from other diseases would be compulsorily shifted to first-line treatment centres or COVID hospitals.

17 September 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Uproar in corpn. council over renewal of contracts||The renewal of contract with two private agencies for two different projects was a major point of discussion and matter of unrest in the Kozhikode Corporation council meeting on Wednesday. The renewal of contract with Rishwan Advertising company for construction and maintenance of 11 bus shelters in the city and with Solus Ad Solutions for advertising on the median of beach road drew a lot of flak from opposition parties that claimed that the conduct of both the companies had been far from flawless so far and hence the contract should not be renewed. Congress councillor Vidya Balakrishnan said that Rishwan Advertising had been maintaining several bus shelters in the city for the past 15 years and that the condition of some of them was deplorable. Deputy Mayor Meera Darshak said that the company had paid the fine for its errors. In the other case, Solus Ad Solutions was granted four-year extension in the contract to set up poles for advertising on the median of Beach Road from beach open stage to Beach Hotel. Congress councillor P.M. Niyas said that the agency was entrusted with the project since 2006 and had defaulted many times. He said the agency had changed the size of the advertisement boards and the number of poles without the corporation’s consent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/uproar-in-corpn-council-over-renewal-of-contracts/article32625815.ece
17 September 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Twitterati sways to the mellifluous voice of ‘Little Rafi’||Saurav Kishan should have been in China now, doing his final year medicine at Xinjiang. But COVID-19 forced him to extend his stay at home in Kozhikode, giving him plenty of time to devote to his passion, music. He did not quite imagine though that his rendition of a popular Mohammed Rafi song would turn him into an overnight sensation on the Internet. The video of him singing Teri aankhon ke siva... , the incredibly sweet melody tuned by Madan Mohan for the 1969 Hindi film Chirag , has been watched by more than 1.3 million times, within five days after it was posted on Twitter by a music lover from Hyderabad. Retweets It became viral after it was retweeted by entrepreneur Anand Mahindra. It was then posted, among others, by Shankar Mahadevan, one of India's leading playback singers, Bollywood actress Raveena Tandon and cricketer-turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar, who loves to hum Kishore Kumar songs. Saurav, who sounds like Rafi and whose Hindi diction is pretty good, finds everything a bit surreal. “Shankar Mahadevan is a singer I admire a lot, so I was delighted to find that he had good words to say about my singing,” he says. “Though I have been performing since the age of three, this kind of recognition is something I could not have anticipated,” he adds. How it all began It all began when somebody from a WhatsApp group requested him to sing Teri aankhon ke siva.. . “It is one of my favourite Rafi songs, so I was happy to record it from the studio at my home. Then it was posted on Twitter by someone named Judish Raj,” he says. Saurav has grown up listening to Rafi and his songs at shows. “I can sing some 800 songs of Rafi without having to look at the lyrics,” he says. Mumbai plans Saurav, who still cherishes the memories of being called ‘Little Rafi’ by legendary composer Johnson during a reality show for junior singers years ago, is looking forward to reaching out to even more people through a popular Hindi talk show he has been invited to. “I will have to travel to Mumbai for that,” he says. “There have been some offers to record my songs too, but that would happen only later, because of the COVID-19.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/twitterati-sways-to-the-mellifluous-voice-of-little-rafi/article32625818.ece

The police resorted to a lathicharge when BJYM workers took out a march to the collectorate and tried to break open the police barricade. The march was in protest against Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel. The protesters demanded that Mr. Jaleel step down from the post. BJP spokesperson Sandeep Warier inaugurated the march. Yuva Morcha district president Sajesh Elayil presided. BJP district president Ravi Thelath spoke. The police had to use force to arrest and remove the protesters. They were later released on bail. BJP leaders challenged Mr. Jaleel to swear by the Quran that he had no connection with the gold smuggling racket. They said Mr. Jaleel was using religion as a shield to escape from his wrongdoings. They said the State had never seen such a communal-minded Minister as Mr. Jaleel. According to them, Mr. Jaleel was serving as a bridge between the CPI(M) and some religious extremist groups. In a separate statement here, BJP Palakkad zone vice president K.K. Surendran said that the party would confront the “police raj” by fielding its cadres. Criticising the police action on BJP leaders here, Mr. Surendran said that the police were behaving like a sister organisation of the CPI(M).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjym-activists-clash-with-police-in-malappuram/article32625811.ece

17 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||With 675 cases, no let-up in capital||Thiruvananthapuram reported 675 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, which marked the highest single-day spike in the district and the second consecutive day when the daily caseload crossed the 600-mark. Active cases as on Wednesday stood at 5,760. The death toll has risen to 155 with one more recent death - that of a 61-year-old man from Pappanamcode who died on September 9 - attributed to the disease. Local transmission accounted for 542 cases, while the source of infection remains uncertain in 99 cases. Cases have been reported from across the district. More than a 100 employees of a factory in Manvila have tested positive over the past three days. Fourteen cases were reported from Vattiyoorkavu, 13 from Manacaud, eleven from Vettucaud and ten from Parassala. In recent days, the challenges faced by health officials in tackling the virus have assumed a more complex character. Contact tracing has become a difficult proposition. A scrutiny of daily caseload data reveals that the number of cases where the infection source remains vague has steadily risen from the single digits reported in the early days of the outbreak in Thiruvananthapuram. The alarming rise in the number of health workers getting diagnosed with the disease poses another stiff challenge. So far in September, 249 health workers have tested positive. According to health officials, the tracing of contacts of COVID-19 patients is being pursued actively. “'We have decentralised the process. It is now being done at the block panchayat and PHC level also,”' a senior district-level health official said. As many as 418 people tested negative on Wednesday. Meanwhile, 2,400 people were newly placed under disease surveillance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-675-cases-no-let-up-in-capital/article32626002.ece
17 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Land acquisition for NH work overcomes hurdles||The much-delayed four/six-laning of the National Highway-66 stretch from Talapady in Kasaragod to Kazhakuttam in Thiruvananthapuram has received a short in the arm with the issue of 3(D) notification under the National Highway Act of 1956 for the last stretch from Kazhakuttam to Kadambattukonam. With this notification in the gazette, the 54.46 hectares to be acquired for NH widening from 11 villages coming under Thiruvanananthapuram, Chirayinkeezhu, and Varkala taluks will “vest absolutely in the Central government free of encumberances.” The 3(D) notification is issued when the entire details of land to be acquired such as area, name of landowners, etc., are published after completing the survey. “The draft Detailed Project Report has been worked out by the consultant. The aim is to complete the tender process and award the work by March 2021,” a senior National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) official told The Hindu . The widening of the NH corridor from Kazhakuttam to Kadambattukonam has gained priority as the NHAI had completed the 26.7-km Reach I of the NH-66 bypass from Kazhakuttam to Mukkola and work is in full swing for the remaining 16.92 km up to Karode. The work on the 2.7-km flyover at Kazhakuttam along the NH-66 and the NH-66 Bypass is also on under the NHAI. The 3(A) notification was published on March 14 for the 29.83-km corridor that comes under the 172.8-km Cherthala-Kazhakuttam corridor of the NH-66 that is to be developed with a 45-metre right-of-way (ROW).  The process to award the compensation determined by the competent authority under 3(G) of the NH Act will also commence with the hearing from September 22 to November 19. Those losing the land and buildings from Kazhakuttam to Mamom had been asked to appear for hearing at the Office of the special tahsildar, LA ( NH), Kazhakuttam, and those from Mamom to Kadambattukonam at the Office of the Special Tahsildar, LA (NH) III, Attingal, with the documents.  Three taluks The NHAI needs 93.41 hectares in the Kazhakuttam-Kadambattukonam stretch and this comes under the three taluks. The 3(D) notification is to be issued for the remaining land once the acquisition of land from a temple along the proposed Attingal bypass is finalised, the official said. The compensation for those surrendering the land would be as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/land-acquisition-for-nh-work-overcomes-hurdles/article32626010.ece
17 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Chemmaruthy shows the way in e-governance||For the past four months, hardly anyone in Chemmaruthy, located in rural Thiruvananthapuram, had to visit the panchayat office. The residents here can now access all services offered by the panchayat from their homes. Early this year, the State government had chosen Chemmaruthy for the pilot run of its intelligent e-governance system through which more than 200 services can be accessed online. The software, Integrated Local e-governance Management System (ILGMS), developed by the Information Kerala Mission, will be deployed across 150 panchayats later this month. The services available include applications for various certificates, payment of taxes and raising of complaints and appeals.  No crowding “The difference is there for all to see. Now, there is hardly any rush at the panchayat office. Since we began using it, 1,537 requests have been received through it and all of them have been addressed. Earlier people working abroad used to take the help of a relative living here to submit an application and they had to make multiple visits to get things done. Now they can do it directly from anywhere. Due to the pandemic situation, some of the employees were working from home and they could take action on these files from home,” says A.H. Salim, Chemmaruthy grama panchayat president. The documents required for a particular application can be scanned and uploaded. In case of discrepancies, notifications will be sent online and as SMS. The software sets the time for processing for each application. The details regarding the delayed files will be available at the department head’s as well as the employee's dashboard. The applicants will thus have an option to track and raise complaints. Applications from permanent residents with all documents can be processed within a day. The IKM had as many as 12 different software for various services, some of which were not used as frequently due to lack of awareness among the public. An integrated system, offering almost all the services accessed by the public from a local body, is expected to change this situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chemmaruthy-shows-the-way-in-e-governance/article32626012.ece

The Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) had imparted training to 151 of the 765 who qualified for CMEDP, which is implemented through the Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC). Chairman and Managing Director, KFC, Tomin J. Thachankary said the scheme sought to provide financial aid for 1,000 units annually. It envisaged a maximum loan amount of Rs. 50 lakh or 90% of the project cost and 7% interest. Eligibility Although only new ventures were considered initially, the KFC decided to include start-ups that were 10 years old and MSME units that were 18 months old. At least two promoters in each application for CMEDP should be below 50 years of age. IT start-ups functioning from houses need not take new office buildings on lease. The CMD said the KFC would keep a tab on the activities of those availing themselves of the loan under the CMEDP and their bank dealings. NoRKs returning to the State would get loans at 4% interest. Besides, they will also get Rs. 3 lakh as backend subsidy (15% of the project cost).  Scheme seeks to provide financial aid for 1,000 units annually Tomin J.

17 September 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Chandy’s role in focus in the run-up to election||Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy is celebrating 50 years in public life as a legislator this month. With the Assembly elections due in mid-2021, the high-profile jubilee celebrations have triggered intense speculation in Kerala about Mr. Chandy’s role in State politics in the time ahead. The critical question appears to be whether Mr. Chandy, with his long experience in government, will position himself as a stable and skilful hand to lead the Congress into the electoral fray once more as its chief ministerial candidate in the 2021 Assembly elections. In a spate of interviews given to multiple media outlets in connection with the jubilee year, Mr. Chandy has responded to the question with sphinx-like answers. He has shied away from stating whether he will contest the Assembly election from his home turf at Puthuppally in Kottayam again in 2021. The constituency had sent Mr. Chandy to the Assembly for the first time in 1970 and has kept faith with him since. Mr. Chandy, to his credit, has also endorsed the capacity of other Congress veterans, including Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, to assume the mantle of parliamentary party leadership. To those trying to puzzle out whether he would lead again, Mr. Chandy has stated that the answer lay with the national leadership of the Congress. The party traditionally settles such issues after the elections, Mr. Chandy has stated time and again. He has recurrently maintained that he would play any role the party entrusts him. Some feel that the somewhat cryptic answers have left the door open for probabilities, conjectures, and political manoeuvring in the Congress in days to come. A second chance? By some accounts, Congress leaders close to Mr. Chandy feel the former Chief Minister deserves a second chance at the helm, given his popularity, seniority and experience. They feel he has unfinished business in government and a convincing win would help him start again with a clean slate. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will inaugurate the jubilee celebrations in Kottayam via video link on Thursday, a fact not lost on Mr. Chandy’s supporters. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi will be in attendance remotely. On Thursday, Congress Working Committee members A.K. Antony and K.C. Venugopal and Congress general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar will honour Mr. Chandy at a function here at the Congress State headquarters at Indira Bhavan here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chandys-role-in-focus-in-the-run-up-to-election/article32625824.ece
17 September 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Child marriages continue to be a shameful blot on the literate State||Despite relentless efforts by authorities, instances of child marriages have been reported across the State even during the lockdown. In the period from January 2019 to July this year, 220 child marriages were prevented by officials of the Women and Child Development Department. The number of complaints received during the period was 266. The highest number of child marriages prevented was in Malappuram district – 66. In Wayanad, officials managed to prevent 38 child marriages. There is no district in the State from where child marriages have not been reported during this period, though Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, and Ernakulam have the least – one case each. Injunction orders Injunction orders from court to check child marriages were received in 65 cases. Though the orders are many a time sufficient for families to step back, the parties concerned violated the orders in 13 cases. The maximum violations were reported from Thrissur district – seven. Officials depend on volunteers, anganwadi, ASHA, and Kudumbashree workers, members of the public, and children, including the brides, to get tip-offs about marriages fixed or about to be conducted. At times though, information trickles in only after the marriage ceremony is conducted. At Kanhangad in Kasaragod, for instance, when the officials reached the venue, they could find little evidence of the marriage or any witnesses. However, when the newlyweds were found living with the bride’s family, they pursued the matter again. The girl and her family said she was 18, though her school certificate and Aadhaar card contradicted the claim. Lack of evidence With the court requiring evidence or witnesses to intervene, the officials found their hands tied. They then informed the District Child Protection Officer and complained to the child welfare committee (CWC) seeking steps to remove the girl from the family after the police warnings went unheeded. For the 220 marriages averted by the authorities across the State, there could be many conducted secretly, officials surmise. Marriages have been conducted during the lockdown period too. In one case in Malappuram, the officials had received a tip-off that the marriage had been held. The family apparently wanted to take advantage of the reduced wedding expenses during the lockdown. However, when officials investigated, they tried to give the impression that only the wedding had been fixed, the ceremony had not been held. In this instance too, there was little evidence available, though the police also probed the matter. All that could be done was to counsel the girl and her family, and get the child development project officers of the ICDS project to follow up. In another instance, the family inadvertently admitted that though a marriage had been conducted, they cancelled it on realising the consequences. An FIR was registered in that case. In Kozhikode, sensing the possibility of a marriage, an injunction order was served on the family. However, food was arranged and served by them. Concerned, the officials made enquiries, only to be told the ceremony was not conducted. The girl, just short of her 18th birthday, too denied getting married. Officials then warned the family of strict action if they went ahead with the wedding. Lack of awareness Lack of awareness, financial difficulties, relationships among adolescents, and social vulnerability are some of the reasons that are cited by families for going ahead with the child marriages. The silver lining is that increasingly, children were reporting instances of child marriages owing to improved awareness levels. Only better networking at the grassroots and concerted action can help prevent child marriages in time, say officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/child-marriages-continue-to-be-a-shameful-blot-on-the-literate-state/article32625839.ece

Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Singh Thakur said this on Tuesday while responding to a question raised by Javed Ali Khan, MP, in the Rajya Saba on whether the Finance Ministry has received complaints of “financial corruption” in KIIFB. Mr. Thakur informed the Upper House that the ED had received a complaint against KIIFB and its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) that the board had parked Rs. 250 crore with Yes Bank. The ED had informed the Ministry that “enquiries have been initiated and any disclosure at this stage can impact the process”. ‘Documents received’ “We have received most of the documents related to the KIIFB’s transactions with the bank, which are being scrutinised. Some more information is being collected. Further action will be taken on the basis of the findings,” said an agency official in New Delhi . In the Yes Bank case, the ED has so far attached properties worth over Rs. 3,000 crore. In July, the ED ordered attachment of assets valued around Rs. 2,800 crore. They belonged to Rana Kapoor, the bank’s co-founder, and Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan, and the entities controlled by them. The ED is conducting a probe on the basis of two cases registered by the CBI in March. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had earlier alleged that KIIFB, a government-owned financial institution created to mobilize funds for infrastructure development, had parked Rs. 268 crore in YES Bank. Govt. refutes charges Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had said that the allegations of the Leader of the Opposition were untrue.

Certain sections of the media had reported that Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan and CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan were at odds with each other and both had sought the mediation of the Polit Bureau to settle their feuding. The CPI(M) said on Wednesday that the fake news was part of a broader propaganda war against the party leadership and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. The Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) were in cahoots with some sections of the media to eclipse the achievements of the Left Democratic Front government. On September 22 The CPI(M) will hold “people’s collectives” in districts on September 22 to isolate the forces intent on destabilising the LDF rule. These are part of a nationwide mustering of secular forces against the wrong economic and social policies of the Centrre. The CPI(M) demanded that the Centre urgently provide Rs. 7,500 for the next six months to the bank accounts of families outside the Income Tax net. The party demanded 10 kg of free rice for the needy families. The MGNREGS should guarantee a minimum of 200 workdays for beneficiaries of the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-rubbishes-reports-of-rift/article32625827.ece

The Central government had hired a private consultancy to measure the land. On Wednesday, union members of the CITU, INTUC and BMS at the Vijayamohini mills in Thiruvananthapuram prevented officials of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), a real estate consultancy, who had come for the land valuation process. The unions see this as yet another step towards shutting down or privatisation of the mills. The 23 spinning mills of the NTC (five in Kerala), under the Union Textile Ministry, have remained closed since March despite the Centre granting permission for factories and industries to open in May. The unions have been on an indefinite strike here for the past 21 days. The large pile of unsold yarn stock is being pointed out as a reason for the mills remaining closed. "The consultancy conducted land valuation in two mills — the Alagappa mill in Thrissur and the Kannur mill. The Centre has taken no step to reopen the mills. They have ordered one mill in south India — a mill in Tamil Nadu — to function, to create an impression that mills are not fully shut down. ," said T.S.

The party district general secretary D. Venkateswara Reddy in a statement here on Wednesday has warned of agitation if no action was initiated in the fraud committed in land acquisition for NTR Road 80-feet widening project that is going on for almost a decade now. This road connects the RTC Bus Station with the Gooty Road avoiding the thickly populated areas, but some of the “greedy” officials have not only connived to mislead the administration, but also cheated the public, he alleged. “Instead of doing justice to the original owners of the land and speaking with them, some of these officials made the municipal corporation make rounds of the courts increasing the value of the land abnormally, which is condemnable,” the BJP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-seeks-action-against-officials-in-land-scam-case/article32626034.ece

The youth, Saikiran, along with Yesupadam, a Siddha and Ayurveda practitioner in the neighbourhood, arrived at Satyavedu police Circle-Inspector’s office on Tuesday night. Saikiran told the police that vexed with the harassment, he fled the ashram. Saikiran was brought to the ashram at Rajula Kandriga village of Nagalapuram mandal some 14 years ago from a welfare home in Hyderabad. Saikiran told the police that in the initial years, he, along with the other boys in the ahsram, used to work in the kitchen and attending to the visitors and guests. He also studied Vedaparayanam and completed matriculation through open study module. “I had been subjected to ruthless beating and humiliation in the recent years. I was forced to work round the clock without rest. Vexed with the confinement and harassment, I fled the ashram,” Saikiran told the police. The youth said that he could not recollect from where he was brought to Nagalapuram. The police too are clueless about Saikiran’s background. On Wednesday morning, the Stayavedu police summoned the ashram head and inquired about the circumstances which forced the youth to flee. “The ashram head told us that Saikiran was frustrated after several of his colleagues had left the ashram. The ashram head also said that he had resorted to mild beating of the boy at times, but only to mend his ways. Of late, the youth showed signs of mental disturbance and fatigue. He expressed his unwillingness to stay in the ashram,” a police officer told The Hindu . Rehabilitation facility The police has admitted him to a rehabilitation facility for differently-abled being run by an NGO near Satyavedu for now. “I don’t have any hope of tracing my family connections. But, I will not give up,” said Saikiran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/youth-flees-ashram-alleges-harassment/article32626069.ece
17 September 2020||Guntur,ANDHRA PRADESH||Huge consignment of mobiles stolen from moving lorry||In a daredevil robbery on the highway, a container carrying mobile phones has been looted while it was on the move on the National Highway 16 in Guntur police limits. The incident took place in the early hours of Tuesday. According to Urban SP Ammireddy, thieves entered the moving lorry, which was carrying mobile phones from Sri City to Kolkata, and made away with three boxes of mobile phones estimated to cost Rs. 80 lakh. The driver came to know about the incident from another lorry driver following the vehicle. The police are going through CCTV footage to identify the culprits. No breakthrough in Chittoor case Chittoor Staff Reporter adds: The police are yet to achieve any breakthrough in the case of theft of mobile phones worth Rs. 6 crore from a truck near Nagari on Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border, despite forming special teams and sending teams to Maharashtra and West Bengal. An unidentified gang had hijacked a container lorry with high mobiles of Xiomi that set out from the factory outlet at Siriperuambudur in Tamil Nadu for Mumbai, on August 26 and decamped with the booty in another lorry. A senior police officer said special parties had left for Pune and Kolkata to track the elusive gang and returned a few days ago. The official said that though the visits did not fetch any major breakthrough, they had helped connect some leads. Meanwhile, the Guntur theft incident came as yet another shocker to the Chittoor police. A police official said that the latest theft could be seen as the handiwork of the same gang.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cellphones-stolen-from-moving-lorry/article32625214.ece
17 September 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP welcomes Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill||The YSR Congress Party, which backs the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, has opined that the cooperative banks, with the passage of the bill, will be able to raise capital through equity and unsecured debentures and bonds which will strengthen their balance sheet. Lavu Srikrishnadevarayulu, MP of Narasaraopet, said that the party welcomed the bill as it would give a fresh lease of life to the ailing cooperative banking sector. The MP said it was disheartening to hear the current distress in the cooperative banking sector and the Financial Stability Report of the RBI noted that their capital risk adequacy ratio declined from 13.5% to 9.8%. Cooperative institutions like PMC Bank where the depositors were hurt because the withdrawal limit was capped at Rs. 1,000 in September 2019 and Mapusa Cooperative Bank and CKP Cooperative Bank, the licences of which were cancelled by the RBI in 2020 because of poor management and bad performance were cited as some examples. “This could have happened because their Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) almost doubled in one financial year as the auditors did not do their job properly. With this Bill coming in, RBI will be able to supersede the Board of Directors who are not performing professionally. Reconstruction and amalgamation of the banks will be taken up without placing the bank under moratorium and that will be in the interests of depositors,” said the MP. He also sounded a note of caution and said that the government should take note of the scams and frauds taking place in PSBs where the total fraud value increased 134% year-on-year within a year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-welcomes-banking-regulation-amendment-bill/article32625287.ece
17 September 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||State will appeal against HC order in Supreme Court, says Sajjala||The interim order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court staying the investigation into and restraining publication of news with regard to the FIR No. 8/RCO-ACB-GNT/2020 is unprecedented, according to Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, Adviser (public affairs), Government of Andhra Pradesh. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the order could lead to a new precedent. “The State government will appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court order,” he added. “The order can lead to a perception that influential sections can get away with anything. Whether the action of the State government amounts to vengeance will be decided during the course of investigation. But the court’s order merely on an FIR filed in a criminal case creates a doubt in the minds of the common man. One can understand if the FIR impinges on personal privacy, or if it is defamatory in nature, but it relates to allegations of insider trading in a major project,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy observed. Stating that judicial institutions had often stood by the media in times of persecution by the Executive, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said it was rare that the court restrained the media from publishing news in matters of public importance. ‘Surprising’ “The FIR was filed by an independent investigative agency. Investigation is being carried out by another independent agency. The G.O. relating to constitution of a SIT was issued by an elected government. It is surprising that the court issued an order at 9.10 p.m. staying all investigation and restraining the media from publishing the news,” he said, and added that several leading advocates such as Prashant Bhushan had spoken against the order on the Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-will-appeal-against-hc-order-in-supreme-court-says-sajjala/article32626055.ece

Mr. Mithun Reddy further said that the “enforcement of law should be the same for the Prime Minister and the common man.” Apart from the YSRCP MP, eminent personalities from the media and the judiciary such as Prashanth Bhushan, Rahul Shivshankar, Rajdeep Sardesai, and Dhanya Rajendran took to the social media questioning the court order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mp-raises-hc-order-in-parliament/article32626053.ece

17 September 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Illegal installation of idols at Srikalahasti temple sparks row||The unauthorised consecration of two idols in front of the sanctum sanctorum of the Srikalahasti temple sparked a controversy as BJP leaders staged a demonstration in front of the shrine on Wednesday, demanding stringent action against those responsible. A Shiva linga and an idol of Nandi were allegedly installed by some ‘affluent persons’ a week ago. Even as the temple administration has filed a police complaint in this regard and it refused to comment on the incident. Temple trust board’s former chairman P.R. Mohan squarely blamed the Executive Officer and the officials for remaining tight-lipped over the incident. “People who installed the idols are known to the temple officials. They have been donating to the temple for quite some time,” alleged Mr. Mohan. BJP leader Kola Anand Kumar, who is also former Chairman of the temple trust board, said some people were tampering with the age-old norms of the shrine and demanded action against those responsible for the illegal installation of idols.

A dig at govt. “Burning of chariot at Antarvedi, desecration of idols and now illegal installation of idols at Srikalahasti temple.

Professors from IITs, NITs and State universities, the IT Adviser to the State government, the Executive Director of the AP State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC), and experts from multi-national companies have put their heads together to design the new curriculum. “We intend to implement it from this academic year (2020-21) for all B.Tech courses offered by the universities across the State,” Education Minister A. Suresh told The Hindu.  Besides regular B.Tech courses, there would be choices of B.Tech Honors and B.Tech Honors (with a Minor Degree). Under B.Tech Honors, students scoring a CGPA of 7.5 and above can opt for additional courses of up to 20 credits (four extra courses / subjects and two online courses through Massive Open Online Courses -MOOCS / National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning - NPTEL) The B.Tech Honors (with a Minor Degree) is for students who want to pursue a course of their interest other than the chosen discipline of engineering. Mandatory internship For instance, a student pursuing Mechanical Engineering can also opt for subjects from the Civil Engineering stream to secure a Major Degree in Mechanical Engineering along with a Minor Degree in Civil Engineering. Explaining the mandatory internship that aims at making the students industry-ready, Mr. Suresh said a student would dedicate 10 months for hands-on learning (two months after second year, two months after third year and six months in the final year-second semester). The two summer internships of two months duration at the end of the second and third years could be done at any of the local industry, a government organisation, construction agency, industrial estate, hydel and thermal power projects, or in a software company. The internship after the second year will be a community service project. Thrust on upskilling Pointing out that upskilling was a focus area, Mr. Suresh said, out of the five courses designed, two would be skill-oriented related to the domain area and would be completed in the second year. The remaining three would be soft skills. “A pool of inter-disciplinary job-oriented skill courses, prepared by a Joint Board of Studies, will be integrated into the curriculum of each branch of engineering from which a student can pick his choice,” said the Minister. The student would also have the option of choosing between skill advanced courses offered by the college and a certificate course offered by the industry, a professional body, the APSSDC, or any other accredited body, the Minister explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/choice-of-courses-gets-wider-for-engineering-students/article32626062.ece

17 September 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Do not trivialise Amaravati issue: Naidu||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday slammed the government for describing the Amaravati issue as a problem concerning a mere 29,000 farmers who had parted with their lands for construction of the capital city. “Any damage to Amaravati will cause severe loss and injustice to all sections of people in the State,” Mr. Naidu observed while addressing the media via a video link. “Andhra Pradesh is already suffering the consequences of the anti-people policies of the YSRCP government. Its plan, which borders on hate, to undermine Amaravati will not only hurt the capital region farmers but also adversely impact the entire State on the socio-economic and political fronts,” Mr. Naidu said. Asserting that the TDP government had conceived and started developing Amaravati with a view to creating a vibrant and potential capital city, Mr. Naidu said Amaravati would meet the aspirations of the people of the State. “The Chief Ministers of the combined State, after taking over the reins, continued the developmental projects initiated by the TDP. Former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy too never stalled the projects launched by the TDP. Projects such as the international airport, Outer Ring Road, Cyberabad, and Genome Valley had come up during the TDP term. Had these projects been stalled, Hyderabad would not have become a vibrant city,” Mr. Naidu said. ‘Why ill will?’ Seeking to know why Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was harbouring “ill will and hatred towards Amaravati,” Mr. Naidu said the Chief Minister had no right or authority to change the Capital as it was neither in the State list, nor the Central list, nor the Concurrent list. “Parliament alone has the authority to debate and take a final call on the issue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/do-not-trivialise-amaravati-issue-naidu/article32625313.ece

17 September 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP complains to Governor against ‘rising attacks’ on Hindu temples||A delegation of the BJP led by its State president Somu Veerraju submitted a memorandum to Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan here on Wednesday, seeking his intervention with regard to the attacks on Hindu temples and the arrests of those protesting against such acts of sacrilege. Mr. Veerraju informed the Governor that the recent burning down of the chariots of the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy and the Sri Prasanna Venkateswara Swamy temples at Antarvedi (East Godavari) and Bitragunta (Nellore) respectively, and the desecration of idols in a historic temple at Pithapuram in East Godavari, which were among 17 incidents, hurt the feelings of the Hindus. The State government had been negligent in investigating the incidents, and it callously attributed some of them to the acts of mentally retarded persons. A few incidents were not probed at all, he alleged. ‘Communal outlook’ Mr. Veerraju said the “communal outlook” of the government was evident from the alacrity with which it acted against stone-pelting on a church at Antarvedi. The police allegedly used this incident as an alibi to book cases on 37 Hindu activists who had staged a peaceful protest against the destruction of temple chariot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-complains-to-governor-against-rising-attacks-on-hindu-temples/article32626056.ece

17 September 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Key accused in Rs. 1,600-crore money laundering case held||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested one of the kingpins of the alleged money laundering case reported in Visakhapatnam in 2017. The accused, identified as Bhimendra Kumar Goyal alias B.K. Goyal alias Munna Goyal, had been a fugitive since long and he was arrested in Singapore a few days ago and lodged in the Tihar Jail. The ED has brought Goyal to Visakhapatnam after its plea seeking a custody for five days was granted. In 2017, income tax officials in Visakhapatnam suspected that certain companies in the State were indulging in heavy transactions of foreign exchange. A team led by then Joint Director (investigation) of I-T Department M.V.N. Seshu Bhavanarayana zeroed down on one Vaddi Mahesh. Investigations revealed that Mahesh, a person with fake identities, and eight others, were allegedly involved in the money laundering racket that operated in West Godavari, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam districts and Kolkata. The estimated money laundered was put at Rs. 1,600 crore. The case was transferred to the AP CID after an FIR was lodged at MVP police station. The ED took up the case after a request of the State government, as the allegations were related to transactions pan India and globe. Modus operandi “During questioning, Vaddi Mahesh admitted that he was acting on the instructions of Goyal. He was only the front of the global money laundering racket,” said Mr. Bhavanarayana. People with huge black money allegedly parked their funds with Goyal, who used people such as Mahesh to float shell companies in India and in countries such as Singapore and Honk Kong. He transferred huge sums to these firms in the guise of procuring customised software. But, neither had the companies existed nor the software in reality, said the officials. The money after reaching the companies were allegedly either channelled back or invested in other firms to re-route them to the people who had parked their funds with Goyal. Investigations revealed that Mahesh and his gang had opened 12 shell companies and were operating 30 fictitious accounts. They had laundered close to Rs. 1600 crore since 2013 by remitting to five companies— one in China, three in Singapore and one in Hong Kong. It is learnt that along with Goyal, one more kingpin Jain was arrested in August first week.  Suspicious transactions Investigation by the AP CID revealed that Rs. 800 crore was shipped out to foreign countries from one single account in a public sector bank in Kolkata in 2016 and Rs. 90 crore was deposited in the same account in a day. According to a senior officer of the AP CID, Mahesh, his father Vaddi Srinivas and two cousins Achanta Harish and Achanta Rajesh were allegedly running the show for Goyal in South India on a commission of 85 paisa for every US dollar. Sources in the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) said Goyal was also allegedly involved in smuggling and cheated the customs officials by under-valuing goods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/key-accused-in-rs-1600-crore-money-laundering-case-held/article32626070.ece

17 September 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vizag airport expansion work may be completed by Dec.||The expansion of the terminal building of Visakhapatnam International Airport, which was hit owing to the coronavirus pandemic, is likely to be completed by December, the authorities have said. The expansion project undertaken to enhance the traffic handling capacity at the airport was scheduled to be completed in May. As part of the project, a beautiful canopy, erected recently, welcomes the passengers to the terminal building. Around 70% of the expansion work has been completed. “Some equipment such as escalators, elevators and conveyor belts will be procured from abroad. Even as the orders have been placed, the restrictions imposed in the wake of the pandemic have delayed their arrival and erection. We (Airports Authority of India) have undertaken the construction of a wall and putting up illuminated boards near the National Highway for the benefit of passengers from the NAD Junction and Gajuwaka side. This work is expected to be completed in one-and-a-half-months,” says airport Director M. Raja Kishore. Additional space Once the expansion of the terminal building is completed, he says, an additional 10,000 sqm of space will be added to the existing 20,000 sqm. The additional space would be utilised exclusively for international arrivals and departures. The existing space, which is now being used for international arrivals and departures will be used to cater to the needs of the requirements of the domestic passengers, explains Mr. Raja Kishore. “The new terminal building has six parking bays and three aero-bridges. Six more are under construction. On completion, it will facilitate parking of 12 planes at a time. In one hour, 12 flights can land and take off which means handling over 3,000 passengers at the airport at a time. The expansion of the terminal building is expected to take care of that load. Though limited flights are being operated in view of the pandemic now, the extra space will help ensure social distancing,” he says. In addition to this, there are four parking bays at the apron near the old terminal building. These parking bays are now being used for the movements of non-scheduled aircraft and VIP planes. “The vehicle parking space has been enhanced to accommodate 100 cars more,” says Mr. Raja Kishore.  N 5 taxi track The airport Director says that the N 5 taxi track is ready for commissioning. “The safety and security clearances have already been obtained. A regional safety team from Chennai recently issued the clearances after inspection. A trial run has been proposed for familiarisation of the pilots with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on the new track,” says Mr. Raja Kishore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-airport-expansion-work-may-be-completed-by-dec/article32626065.ece

17 September 2020||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Nine temple chariots kept under CCTV watch||The Endowments Department in Vizianagaram district has taken special care to ensure the protection of nine chariots of various historic temples in the district. The move comes in the wake of the fire at the Antarvedi Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple of East Godavari district in which the chariot was gutted. The nine chariots are parked in public places due to lack of sheds, and the department has installed CCTV cameras at all nine locations to keep an eye on the chariots. Guards are also being appointed and construction of sheds will begin shortly to ensure safety of the chariots, according to Assistant Commissioner of Endowments Department G.V.S.S.R. Subramanyam. Among the chariots is the 110-year-old chariot of Jagannadh Swamy temple in Vizianagaram that has been parked on road in the absence of an exclusive shed. The height of the chariot is 19.5 feet and its width is nearly 12.5 feet. Jagannath Seva Samithi member Kapuganti Prakash said that the Samithi was trying to identify suitable land for protection of both old and new chariots. Sri Mannar Rajagopala Swamy temple of Vizianagaram, Sri Ramaswamy Vari Devasthnam of Ramateertham, Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple of Balijipeta, Sri Venugopala Swamy temple, Sri Jagannath Swamy temples located at Parvatipuram, Chinamerangi, Sibili Peddavalasa, Dasannapeta of Vizianagaram also have large four-wheeled chariots. BJP Mahila Morcha leader of Vizianagaram district, Uppalapati Nalini, asked the government to quickly construct sheds for the protection of the chariots in the backdrop of the Antarvedi incident. “Apart from the idols of the Gods, we respect chariots too. During annual festivals, every devotee tries to touch the chariot. They have a special sanctity in Hindu culture and tradition,” she said. The Endowments Department prepared a detailed note and sent it to the government for the construction of sheds as four temples do not have sheds. Some of them are in a dilapidated condition. Their renovation has also been proposed. “As soon as the approval comes from the government, we will begin work on the sheds. Meanwhile, temple authorities will monitor CCTV footage constantly to identify movements of suspicious persons in and around chariots,” Mr. Subramanyam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nine-temple-chariots-kept-under-cctv-watch/article32625286.ece

(TRICOR) has initiated a collaborative effort to promote entrepreneurship among tribal women in partnership with WE Hub, the Telangana government’s initiative for women entrepreneurs, in Bhadrachalam Agency. The TRICOR had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with WE Hub on the occasion of International Day of World’s Indigenous Peoples in Hyderabad, on August 9, to implement this collaborative initiative in the limits of the three Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDAs) in Bhadrachalam, Eturunagaram and Utnoor in the State, TRICOR sources said. Institutional finance The TRICOR has been tasked with identification and selection of entrepreneurs, leveraging the existing framework for institutional finance and extending logistic support. As per the MoU, We Hub will implement the key tasks such as capacity building of entrepreneurs, help them secure market linkages, engage sector-specific mentors and provide them exposure visits besides assisting the entrepreneurs in creating detailed project reports and securing credit linkages, sources added. Orientation session An orientation session was recently organised jointly by the TRICOR and the WE Hub in Bhadrachalam as part of this joint initiative. As many as 39 tribal women, including several prospective entrepreneurs and organisers of the self-employment units, participated in the interactive session. TRICOR deputy general manager K.

17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Regularisation fee based on land value’||The State government has decided to collect the regularisation fee relating to the recently announced Layout Regularisation Scheme based on land value at the time of registration by applicants. The development comes as a major relief to people who raised concerns over the scheme which envisaged collection of regularisation fee based on current registration price. Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao announced in the Legislative Assembly that the Government Order (GO Ms 131) related to the LRS would be amended accordingly in the interests of people. The government issued notification for implementation of LRS as a one-time measure in the State to put an end to unauthorised layouts. In the process, the government had issued orders banning registration of plots purchased in unauthorised layouts and it would consider regularisation of layouts/plots with registered sale or title deeds as on August 26 on payment of prescribed fee. Several ruling party members and those from opposition requested the Minister to revisit the order as collection of fee based on current registration value could impose undue burden on people. “We will make necessary amendments to the orders and fresh orders incorporating the changes will be issued in a day or two,” the Minister said. He made this announcement while participating in the discussion on the issue which came up during the short discussion on “civic works and other infrastructure facilities in the GHMC and its surrounding areas and also in other Municipalities” in the Assembly on Wednesday. Replying to queries, he said the decision to amend the guidelines meant reduction of regularisation fee by 50 to 60%. The last date for submitting applications was October 15 and there would still be six months before the process was completed. The Minister said the government was considering extending one-time opportunity for registration of properties under GO 59 and orders in this direction would be issued after obtaining consent of the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/regularisation-fee-based-on-land-value/article32625756.ece
17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Assembly adjourned abruptly amidst rising COVID-19 fears||The monsoon session of the State Legislature ended abruptly on Wednesday amidst concerns over the continuing increase in the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) positive cases. Legislative Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy has announced the adjournment of the House sine die. Council Chairman Gutha Sukhender Reddy followed suit in the Elder’s House this afternoon after passage of the Bills passed by the Assembly. The Business Advisory Committee of the Assembly has decided to continue the monsoon session for 18 working days till September 28, but the House was adjourned sine die after the proceedings of the eighth day were completed. The Assembly had passed 12 legislations, including the all-important Bills on revenue reforms during the eight days, and the Council too had passed the Bills without any amendments. The development follows the discussions held by the Assembly Speaker with the floor leaders of the parties since Tuesday after two MLAs, several of the security personnel accompanying the legislators, staff of the Legislature and media personnel covering the proceedings testing positive to the virus. More than 50 persons were reportedly tested COVID-19 positive during the tests conducted by the Health Department in the Legislature premises. “With more than 1,200 people coming to the Legislature premises daily, doubts have been raised by the members over the scope for spreading of the virus,” the Speaker said explaining the reasons for ending the proceedings abruptly. He said it is the responsibility of the Chair to protect the health of the members and the staff. Hence, a decision to adjourn the proceedings was taken going by the mood of the House. Opposition parties were however of the view that the House was adjourned as the ruling party was in no mood to run the proceedings after the passage of the legislations as well as the resolution against the Central government’s decision to amend the Electricity Act 2003. While debates like the steps taken to combat COVID-19 figured during the proceedings, some key issues like the dispute with the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh over Krishna water were yet to be discussed. Though the Congress had insisted on the discussion on Krishna water on Wednesday, the treasury benches did not give scope for it and instead allowed the MIM’s request for short discussion on the Greater Hyderabad related issues. Discussion on Krishna water could have landed the government in an embarrassing situation and hence, the decision to adjourn the proceedings after the government business was concluded, Congress members felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/assembly-adjourned-abruptly-amidst-rising-covid-19-fears/article32625769.ece
17 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Act as a cricket team to defeat TRS’||It was a lesson of cricket and that wins can be achieved only through team work rather than individual brilliance for Telangana Congress leaders in their first meeting with new AICC in-charge Manickam Tagore. The Congress MP from Virudhunagar in Tamil Nadu, who was appointed as the new AICC in-charge for Telangana, made it clear to leaders that defeating the TRS should be the sole aim of the party and that they need to have a winning combination in Telangana. “We have Sachins and Dhonis in our team. But we need to act as a team with discipline. You don’t see this as a tennis match, but as a cricket match, where every player needs to play a role,” he said in an interaction on Zoom with senior leaders. Mr. Tagore said it was unfortunate that the Congress could not win Telangana, a State for which Congress president Sonia Gandhi sacrificed another State (Andhra Pradesh) and also a major share of seats in Lok Sabha. “Let’s gift a win to her by defeating TRS in the next Assembly elections,” he said. During the three-hour meet, Mr. Tagore made it clear that the party would adopt a zero tolerance policy for indiscipline. He said he would visit Hyderabad in the first week of October after getting a brief from Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi after their return from abroad. Earlier, TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy introduced all the leaders to Mr. Tagore. He said that the main focus of the meeting was the membership drive, Dubbak by-elections, municipal elections in GHMC, Warangal and Khammam and MLC election from Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam Graduate Constituency. He said that the candidates for Dubbak by-elections would be finalised soon and a panel of leaders would be deployed full time for Dubbak by-polls. CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, MPs A. Reventh Reddy and Komatireddy Venkatreddy, MLAs Sridhar Babu, Jagga Reddy and Seethakka, MLC T. Jeevan Reddy, AICC secretaries N. Bose Raju, Srinivasan Krishnan, Vamshichand Reddy, A. Sampath Kumar, G. Chinna Reddy, Madhu Yashki Goud, TPCC working presidents Ponnam Prabhakar and J. Kusum Kumar, and senior leaders K. Jana Reddy, Mohammed Ali Shabbir, Damodar Rajanarasimha, V.

17 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||British mercenaries’ futile bid to keep Hyderabad independent||“Indian troops will enter Hyderabad tomorrow morning. The Nizam’s Army will surrender to General Chowdhry tomorrow evening at 5 p.m.,” these are the words of a New Delhi datelined report in The Hindu on September 17, 1948. The surrender ceremony took place at 4.30 p.m. and rung down the curtains of a dramatic period in the history of Indian union and Hyderabad. While India became free on August 15, 1947, Hyderabad, ruled by Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam, tried to remain independent using a number of diplomatic, legal, and military tricks. Aiding him in trying to remain free were a clutch of British mercenaries. The role of Razakars (volunteers or the militia of Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen), the Communist party workers and Congress leaders has been studied intensely. But the role of British mercenaries in helping the Nizam escaped scrutiny. Among the legal minds who helped the Nizam negotiate with India dodging commitment was Sir Walter Monckton. Sir Monckton was a legal advisor to Simon Commission as well as Edward VIII during the royal abdication crisis. The Nizam, with the immense wealth at his disposal, hired the legal genius to negotiate with India. The result was the Standstill Agreement signed on November 29, 1947, that gave the Nizam one year’s time to reach a bargaining position. Sidney Cotton was another brilliant mercenary who used his flying skills to help arm the Nizam’s land-locked forces. He earlier worked for MI6, much like James Bond during World War II. His nifty tricks gave birth to aerial reconnaissance. In the service of the Nizam, he flew about 20,000 .303 rifles among other weapons from Karachi to Hyderabad’s airbases at Bidar and Warangal. He also smuggled in British mercenaries to aid the Nizam’s army. In his memoirs, commander of Hyderabad Army Maj Gen El Edroos lays bare the plot: “At this time, at Army HQ at Hyderabad, several British officers were employed in various capacities…who had been imported from England and were trained as commandos. Some of them had been brought in by Sidney Cotton in his aircraft.” Cotton made some 60,000 pound sterling for his effort. Among the commandos who were instrumental in setting up a radio link between Karachi and Hyderabad was Fredrick Rowan. He was lured to come to Hyderabad and then to Bidar and was shot dead by a Hyderabad Army officer. Another mercenary who let down the Hyderabad Army was a Lieutenant T.T. Moore. The British commando was tasked with blowing up the bridge in Naldurg to halt the advance of Indian Army from the west. The Indian Army caught the commando as soon as they entered Nizam’s dominion with a vehicle full of dynamite sticks and orders to blow up bridges. The intelligence supplied by Brigadier Nepian was that Indian military operations would begin on September 15. Nepian was another British mercenary in the service of Hyderabad Army. The intelligence was wrong and the plot went awry. In the end, all these mercenaries could not help the Nizam ward off the inevitable. On September 18, at 4. 30 p.m., at the fifth milestone on the Sholapur-Hyderabad road, the commander of Indian forces Major General J.N. Chowdhry met Major General El Edroos of Hyderabad Army. “I have to ask you for the surrender of the Hyderabad army,” said Maj. Gen. Chowdhry. “I give you surrender of Hyderabad army”, replied Maj. Gen. Edroos. “You understand that it is unconditional?”—“Yes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/british-mercenaries-futile-bid-to-keep-hyderabad-independent/article32625754.ece
17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rs. 67,000 cr. spent on urban infra: KTR||The State government has incurred capital expenditure of over Rs. 67,000 crore during the last six years on developing various infrastructure projects. Close to half of the capital expenditure amounting to Rs. 32,532 crore was incurred for the projects taken up in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits. The expenditure incurred by the GHMC and other departments on projects in the GHMC limits was raised from the corporation’s own resources as well as funds raised through bonds and bank loans. The strategic road development plan envisaging an investment of Rs. 8,410 crore and the two bedroom housing scheme with an estimated Rs. 9,714 crore formed the chief components of spending in the GHMC limits while land acquisition for road infrastructure and nalas and underground drainage was expected to cost over Rs. 8,300 crore. Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao told the Assembly that several infrastructure projects like Durgam Cheruvu cable bridge were taken up for the development of Hyderabad as a world-class city. The government was spending around Rs. 24,000 crore for development of skyways with length of 137 km, 11 major road corridors spanning 166 km and other road development works for easing traffic congestion on the major roads. The expenditure was in addition to the metro rail project with an estimated cost of Rs. 17,290 crore of which the L&T’s share was Rs. 15,644 crore and Hyderabad Metro Rail contributing the balance Rs. 1,646 crore, he said. He was participating in the short discussion on “civic works and other infrastructure facilities in GHMC and its surrounding areas and also in other municipalities” that came up in the Assembly on Wednesday. The Minister rebutted Congress member Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka’s charge that the TRS government was appropriating credit of previous governments. He said the 10-year Congress rule saw a spending of Rs. 4,636 crore in GHMC area whereas the six-year TRS government had spent Rs. 32,532 crore in six years. He said he would convene a meeting with MIM MLAs on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rs-67000-cr-spent-on-urban-infra-ktr/article32625757.ece
17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Pushed to penury by dialysis, kidney patients seek pension||Mandatory visits to hospitals thrice a week to undergo dialysis despite the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 monthly expense for medicines, tests, and running between home and hospital. Apart from the discomfort caused by kidney failure, these are some of the issues that patients are forced to live with. Telangana Kidney Patients’ Welfare Association members have requested the State government to issue monthly pension so that they can bear the expenses and do not become a burden on their family. Nephrologists say that the reasons for kidney failure could be uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, hereditary, overuse of over-the- counter drugs like painkillers or unknown reasons. Patients include children as young as nine to people over 70 years. It is estimated that there are over 18,000 patients in the State suffering from Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and need dialysis. They need to undergo dialysis regularly if their kidneys are not transplanted. One session of dialysis lasts for four hours. The State government offers free dialysis under Aarogyasri or through other provisions. Bus passes are issued too. “With these mandatory visits, it becomes difficult to hold a regular job. Only a few patients hold a government job. So many of us don’t have a regular income. We get to undergo free dialysis because of the Aarogyasri scheme,” said Ch. Mohan, president of the Telangana Kidney Patients’ Welfare Association. He added that patients need regular doses of drugs for calcium, iron, and medicines for co-morbidities. “This comes to around Rs. 4,000 a month. And as a result, patients who don’t hold jobs run into debts,” Mr. Mohan said, who lost his job at a private firm around five years ago after it shut down. A 34-year-old woman, Ch Parvati, who undergoes dialysis, was detected with kidney failure around 14 years ago. She dropped out of Degree course, and is currently jobless. Now, she tries to earn some money by selling flowers near a temple in Vidyanagar. “We have to undergo dialysis three days a week. Who will give a job if we want to work for the remaining four days? Besides, on other days, we suffer from other complications associated with dialysis. It costs me around Rs. 3,000 for medicines,” Ms. Parvati said. Some of them rely on family members for their expenses, or small scale business that can be operated from home. “Our issues can be addressed and we can stop being a burden on our families if the government issues a monthly pension,” Mr. Mohan said.

17 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Commuters bear the brunt as traffic goes haywire||Rainfall that averaged between 10.9 cm in Bahadurpura to 6.8 cm near Charminar area in a span of a few hours sent evening commuter traffic haywire. Arterial roads were affected at Ayyappa Society, Tolichowki, Telugu Talli Jn, Errum Manzil area, Madhapur, A.S. Rao Nagar, Attapur, Begumpet and many other parts of the city. Among the worst affected areas was Tolichowki where water flowing down from Paramount Colony, Hakimpet and Jubilee Hills flooded the area. Scary visuals with floating two-wheelers and water reaching up to the windows of cars were shared on social media. Traffic police struggled to manage the traffic due to waterlogging as well as breakdown of vehicles. At Madhapur, police used hailers to dissuade drivers from using roads and guided them to alternative paths. “I started from Botanical Garden at 7.15 p.m. It is 9.35 p.m. and I am yet to reach home in Sainikpuri. Two cars broke down and that created a bottleneck,” said Monica, who had to change multiple routes to reach home. Trimulgherry, Secunderabad areas were not affected by traffic gridlocks. Traffic between Biodiversity Jn and Medhipatnam was affected due to flooding and breakdown of cars. Hyderabad and Cyberabad traffic police took to social media to announce traffic blocks and alternative routes for commuters. “Though there was no rain water, traffic between Masab Tank and Lakdi ka Pul was gridlocked,” said Sailaja, who travelled from Hyderguda to Tank Bund for a family event. By 10 p.m. traffic had cleared up in most stretches of road except between Shaikpet and Yousuf Tekri area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/commuters-bear-the-brunt-as-traffic-goes-haywire/article32625782.ece

17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Akbar seeks Rs. 10,000 cr. to develop old city||Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi has demanded that the government focus on the development of the old city which had more than 400-year-old history by taking steps to improve civic and other infrastructure. Participating in the short discussion on “civic infrastructure in GHMC and its surrounding areas and also other municipalities”, which came up in the Assembly on Wednesday, he demanded that the government announce Rs. 10,000-crore package exclusively for the old city. Several works launched for road widening were pending completion while the much-awaited Charminar pedestrianisation project was yet to take wing. He recalled how the MIM fought for metro rail in the city and Krishna water diversion for twin cities along with the then Congress member late P. Janardhan Reddy in the erstwhile united State. “Much of the Krishna water is diverted to other areas while the metro rail has not entered my constituency,” he lamented. He expressed concern that no footpaths were sanctioned to old city while there was no mention of bus bays or footover bridges. The apathy shown towards old city could be seen from the fact that 3,000 houses constructed under the JNNURM project remained unallotted as on date. “There appears to be a step-motherly attitude towards old city. We urge the government to take care of these areas too,” he said. Development of the old city would increase tourist footfall. Congress member Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka alleged that the assurances given by the TRS government on development of the city remained on paper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/akbar-seeks-rs-10000-cr-to-develop-old-city/article32625758.ece

17 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Action sought against TRS corporator||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) Treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy has asked the State government to prove that law was equal to all, by taking stern action against TRS corporator from Serilingampally Ragam Nagender Yadav who allegedly assaulted a young girl in Lingampalli. In a media statement on Wednesday, he said the corportor assaulted the girl, Ananya Kurikala, over parking row. “It is clearly evident from the video, which has gone viral, that the TRS corporator used offensive language and threatened her using his official position. He intimidated a young girl with dire consequences with criminal intent just because she opposed a wrong doing by the ruling party corporator,” he said. Mr. Reddy said TRS leaders attacking people using their positions had become a norm and said TRS corporator Anjali Devi's husband Sridhar Goud and his henchmen had allegedly attacked a man and his family in Narapally area in July this year over a land dispute. “While KTR tweets about almost everything under the sky, he never reacts to developments which exposes true face of TRS leaders,” he said.

17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP faults Chief Minister for opposing power reforms||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party has slammed Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for opposing the Centre’s power reforms “even before it was introduced in the Parliament and when the State’s power distribution companies are in financial trouble for not getting pending payments running into hundreds of crores.” Addressing a virtual press conference on Wednesday from New Delhi, State president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar objected to Mr. Rao’s remarks and claimed the Central government has sanctioned Rs. 9,000 crore with which the State had paid arrears to the Discoms to some extent. Just like the Centre has been providing funds for the domestic gas supply and consumption where consumers are getting direct benefit through their respective bank accounts, it planned to do the same for the power sector too but the Chief Minister is sending “wrong signals” in the minds of people, he said. The BJP leader wanted to know why the State government has been unable to pay the arrears to the Discoms when they were in financial doldrums. It was only because of the Centre’s initiative that the Government has been able to provide uninterrupted power supply. “How would Telangana lose jobs with power reforms? How are the proposed power reforms detrimental to the interests of the State,” he questioned. If the Chief Minister has real commitment towards providing free power to farmers, he should first clear all the dues to the Discoms and ensure subsidy to farmers. The Member of Parliament and claimed that the Modi government was determined to cleanse the power sector by plugging loopholes. The MP advised the Chief Minister to emulate the neighbouring State which had issued an official order appreciating the power reforms instead of resorting to criticism against the Centre and “provoking” people.  The State power distribution companies are in financial trouble.

17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Speak out against injustice, says Khalid in pre-recorded video||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid recorded a video statement before his arrest on Sunday wherein he urged people to continue to raise their voice against injustice. In the 2 minute 18 second clip, Mr. Khalid — who has been arrested in connection with a north-east Delhi riots case lodged against him under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — starts off by saying that if people are watching the video, it means he has been arrested. Police inaction Pointing finger at the way investigations are being conducted into the riots, Mr. Khalid said the police are not after rioters or those who incited violence. “They are not after those who incited violence in front of the police and TV cameras… we all saw. Let alone any FIR against them, the police have not even brought them in for questioning,” he said. On the other hand, those who criticise the government and were protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens are being falsely implicated even though the police have no evidence against them, he added. Trying to arrest “They had been trying to arrest me for the last few months and attributing false statements to me,” said the activist Talking about the video that has been cited by the police as evidence of Mr. Khalid inciting violence, the former student said that just a few seconds of his 17-minute speech — given in Amravati on February 17 — has been extracted and shared online. “I did not even mention the words: riots and violence. In fact, I was talking about satyagraha and ahimsa . Now, they are using false narrative against me in the media and forcing people to give false testimonies against me. They are trying to put everyone who criticises the government behind bars,” he said. “What is my crime? Is it my mistake that I say that this country is as much mine as it is yours?” he asks in the clip. Talking about the diverse cultures in India, Mr. Khalid said there are believers of many religions in the country and they are all equal in the eyes of the law. “Today, they are trying to change this and trying to divide us. They re trying to silence everyone who speaks against it by putting them behind bars,” he said. Scare and silence Mr. Khalid added that “they are not only trying to scare and silence the ones they are arresting”, but also everyone else who “wishes to speak against them”. “ Nainsaafi ke khilaaf awaaz buland kijiye… jin logon ko jhoote mukadmon main phasaya jaa raha hai, unki rihai ki maang kijiye… har zulm ke khilaaf boliye… (Speak louder against injustice… demand release of those who have been falsely implicated and jailed… speak out against every cruelty),” he concluded.

Shrivastava’s open letter. Mr. Ribeiro mentioned that “your gesture of personally phoning me to justify and explain your stand and two days later personally putting down your say in an e-mail is praiseworthy. In your place I would have done likewise”. “There are doubts in my original open letter which you have not addressed. I realise it is difficult, indeed impossible, to justify the licence given to the three BJP stalwarts I named — licence to rant, rave and threaten those who are peacefully protesting perceived wrongs. If the speakers were Muslims or Leftists, the police would have surely taken them in for sedition!”. ‘Dispelling doubts’ “After talking to you on the phone and perusing your letter, I have decided to put myself in your shoes! How would I dispel the doubts that your retired brother officers still have about Delhi Police investigation in the NE riots? I would quickly file the chargesheets in all the 753 cases, including specially the conspiracy case registered by your Special Cell and get the evidence authenticated in a court of law,” he mentioned in the letter. “More pertinently I would not prolong the UAPA case by arresting persons just a day or two before the time limit expires for filing the chargesheet. I note in your email to me that you have doubted the patriotism of the three who I named as true ‘patriots’. The three include Harsh Mander, Professor Apooravanand and me. I have not described one else as such and hence my surmise. Harsh and Apooravanand are Gandhians. I should have remembered that Gandhians have lost favour with this regime!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/doubts-in-my-original-open-letter-not-addressed-ribeiro/article32625502.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Police investigation into riots needs to be probed: Bhushan||Advocate Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday demanded a probe into the Delhi Police investigation in the communal riots that broke out in the Capital in February this year. He was among several activists, academics, advocates and teachers who came out in support of former JNU student Umar Khalid, who was arrested on Sunday. “Some of us wrote to the President some time ago that a commission should enquire into the investigation by Delhi Police, as had happened in 1984 riots. Same thing needs to happen here,” he said during a media conference at the Press Club of India. Mr. Bhushan said the way the police are investigating is not actually an investigation but a criminal conspiracy by Delhi Police “to frame innocent people who were protesting peacefully against an unconstitutional rule”. “Those who held peaceful protests... those who were at the forefront of this movement are being accused of conspiring for riots. Those who helped these people such as Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, professor Apoorvanand and activist Harsh Mander are being targeted,” he said. Mr. Bhushan also talked about the WhatsApp group Delhi Protest Solidarity Group, which investigators have been probing. “The only purpose of that group was to support the exemplary protests,” he said, adding that members of the group are being accused of conspiring for riots. He reiterated that people like Kapil Mishra and others who used phrases like “ goli maaro ...” have not been investigated. Sayeda Hameed, writer and ex-member of the Planning Commission; Kavita Krishnan, CPI-ML leader; Pamela Phillipose, senior journalist; and Nandita Narain, former president of the Delhi University Teachers’ Association were at the event wearing masks with faces of those arrested, including Meeran Haider, Mr. Khalid, Khalid Saifi, Gulfisha Fathima and others. Mr. Saifi’s wife Nargis said, “They are putting all those who spoke againstCAAbehind bars so there are no voices against the regime.” Mr. Khalid’s parents were also in attendance but did not speak at the event.  ‘Anticipating arrest’ Mr. Mander, whose name is mentioned in a riots case chargesheet, said that he was anticipating his arrest. Ms. Krishnan, who wore a mask of Gulfisha Fathima’s face, questioned lack of police action against Komal Sharma, a suspect in JNU December violence case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-investigation-into-riots-needs-to-be-probed-bhushan/article32625504.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||‘Politically sophisticated network tried to influence Delhi polls’||Raghav Chadha, chairman of the Delhi Assembly Committee on Peace and Harmony, on Wednesday said that he will propose the committee to take suo moto cognisance of a report by media platform BuzzFeed News about revelations by a whistleblower from Facebook about an alleged attempt to influence the February Delhi election. “I am likely to put it before the panel and this will be considered in the ongoing matter. The committee will have to decide on it though,” Mr. Chadha said. The panel is currently looking into other allegations against Facebook. Fired FB employee “In India, she [whistleblower] worked to remove ‘a politically sophisticated network of more than a 1,000 actors working to influence’ the local elections taking place in Delhi in February. Facebook never publicly disclosed this network or that it had taken it down,” read a BuzzFeed News article about a memo sent by a recently fired Facebook employee. The House panel said that revelations made in the article find resonance with the initial findings of the panel with respect to “misinformation” spread by Facebook. Mr. Chadha said, “These practices adopted by Facebook are in no manner condonable and have direct adverse effect on the sanctity of free and fair elections in our country. If not deterred timely, it will be an assault on the pristine democracy of our country and may cause unfathomable damage.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/politically-sophisticated-network-tried-to-influence-delhi-polls/article32625501.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Audit shows DU colleges misappropriating funds’||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said that a preliminary audit report of six of the 12 Delhi University (DU) colleges that are funded by the Delhi government shows that the institutes have been misappropriating funds given to them. The colleges are in a tussle with the Delhi government over formation of governing bodies and have alleged that they are unable to pay salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff as the government has not released unds. Incomplete audit Mr. Sisodia said that the independent audit has found that despite the Delhi government increasing the salary grant to teachers since 2014-15 and the bank accounts of the colleges showing enough funds, the colleges were claiming that they had no money. He added that the audit that began this month could not be completed as the colleges stopped cooperating after the initial findings raised red flags. “The Delhi government has provided enough funds to these colleges for paying salaries but in their initial observation report, the auditors have found that those funds are being directed elsewhere,” Mr. Sisodia said. He accused the DU administration of behaving like the BJP’s party office. “They are only focused on blaming the Delhi government.In reality, these colleges are having surplus amount and yet they are not paying due salaries to the teachers. This is criminal and will not be tolerated,” Mr. Sisodia said. He also requested the Delhi University Teachers’ Association to raise the issue. Mr. Sisodia said that it was found that while claiming to not have money to pay teachers, the colleges have kept huge amounts of money as fixed deposits (FDs). Keshav Mahavidyalaya has kept Rs. 10.52 crore as FD while Bhagini Nivedita College has around Rs. 2.5 crore as FD in their accounts, he added.  DUTA response The DUTA, which is on a three-day strike, said that it is extremely unfortunate that teachers are caught in the crossfire of these allegations made by Mr. Sisodia. “The DUTA strongly condemns the obdurate stance taken by the Delhi government and warns it against any further harassment of these institutions and the employees,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/audit-shows-du-colleges-misappropriating-funds/article32625509.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||HC refuses to entertain JMI student’s bail petition||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it was not inclined to entertain the bail plea of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha as the police was in the process of filing the chargesheet in the case before a trial court here by September 17. Justice Vibhu Bakhru said that once the chargesheet is filed in the case, Mr. Tanha can agitate the bail before the trial court. The High Court also directed the trial court to dispose of any bail plea filed by Mr. Tanha expeditiously, preferably within two weeks from the filing. The High Court gave the direction after Delhi Police said that it will file the chargesheet in the case under the stringent anti-terror law — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — by Thursday. Mr. Tanha, a 24-year-old student, who was arrested on May 19 and in judicial custody since May 27, has challenged the trial court order dismissing his bail plea in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-refuses-to-entertain-jmi-students-bail-petition/article32625500.ece
17 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Upcoming metro stretch to be named Silver Line||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday announced that the Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor, under the Phase IV metro network, has been assigned the silver colour. The 20-km corridor comprising 15 stations is one of the three corridors coming up under Phase IV that got the Centre’s nod last year. The other two corridors: Janakpuri West-R.K. Ashram; and Majlis Park-Maujpur will be extensions of the Magenta and Pink lines, respectively. While the Pink Line Extension is proposed to be 12-km long comprising eight stations, the Magenta Line Extension is set to be approximately 29-km long with 25 stations. Meanwhile, line utilisation on the Delhi Metro network has been steadily increasing over the past few days with the number of journeys on Tuesday being recorded at 6.46 lakh. Metro services resumed in a staggered manner from September 7 after a five month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak. On September 12, when the metro became fully operational, line utilisation was recorded at 3.8 lakh; on Sunday it was 3.07 lakh; and 6.42 lakh on Monday. Average daily line utilisation in the first week of March, prior to the lockdown, was 57 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/upcoming-metro-stretch-to-be-named-silver-line/article32625507.ece
17 September 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Farmers fear end of MSP regime||Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are up in arms against the Centre’s agriculture-related Bills as they fear their enactment — one of these has already been passed in the Lok Sabha — would be a step towards the abolition of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime. Agriculture experts too share similar concerns that this could leave farmers vulnerable to possible exploitation at the hands of big corporate houses. “The three farm-related Bills, which are all set to become law after being passed in the ongoing session of Parliament, are anti-farmer. The one on essential commodities removes all cereals, pulses, oilseeds, potato and onion from trade restrictions and price control — this will ultimately benefit only the middlemen and traders. Private players will buy the produce in harvest season, when prices are generally lower, and release it later when prices firm up. Small and marginal farmers will suffer the most as they depend immensely on the intermediaries to sell the produce,” Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) in Punjab, told The Hindu . Mr. Singh claimed by doing away with the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act that facilitated procurement of the produce of farmers, the BJP government has given a free hand to private corporate houses to exploit the farmers. “After the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, which aims to open up agricultural marketing outside notified ‘mandis’ for farmers, now private companies will establish private ‘mandis’ on which there will be no government regulation,” he said. The ramification, he argued, is that all State bonuses on MSP and purchase and other protections will be lost. “Companies will benefit as trading rates will not be under pressure of government procurement and they will be able to force farmers to reduce their rates.”  ‘Stir will be intensified’ Sarvan Singh Pandher of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti, which had been staging continuous sit-ins in Punjab since September 7 as a mark of protest against the Bills, said that they will be forced to intensify their stir if the Central government did not address their concerns. “These Bills are a first step towards elimination of the MSP regime, which are in line with the recommendations of the Shanta Kumar committee, which had also suggested dismantling the MSP structure. It’s clear that after implementing the recommendation on the Bills, now the discontinuation of the MSP would follow,” Mr. Pandher predicted. Nirbhay Singh, president of the Kirti Kisan Union (Punjab), said that in the absence of any government security for farmers against possible manipulation, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, which creates a framework for contract farming through an agreement between a farmer and a buyer prior to production, would only result in exploitation of farmers. “Corporates will buy from farmer at cheap rates and sell at higher price to consumers,” he said. Rattan Mann, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait) in Haryana, said that the Central government needs to understand that these Bills in present shape would not benefit the farming community. “The government should promulgate another Bill making the MSP a statutory right of farmers,” he said. Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert and a professor of economics at Punjabi University, Patiala, said once the foodgrain market is created outside the regulated market (APMC), then it’s quite clear that there would be no MSP. “It is understood that when one is taking food trade outside the regulated market, and there is no regulation of that market, then MSP will not be applicable on that trade,” he said. ‘Don’t stop traffic’ Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday appealed to farmers not to stop traffic or violate Section 144 in the State over the agriculture Bills. He, however, made it clear that no cases would be registered against them for violation of Section 144 “as they are fighting for their lives”. “FIRs already registered against farmers protesting in violation of Section 144 would be withdrawn,” said the Chief Minister, urging the farmers to take their protests to Delhi, at the doorstep of the Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmers-fear-end-of-msp-regime/article32625706.ece
17 September 2020||Chandigarh,||Bills will lead to unrest in Punjab: Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday led a Congress delegation to submit a memorandum to Governor V.P. Singh Badnore seeking his intervention for non-pursuance of the agriculture related Bills by the Centre in Parliament. He cautioned that the enactment of the farm ordinances would lead to unrest in Punjab, which was already at the receiving end of Pakistan’s concerted efforts to foment trouble. The Chief Minister said he told the Governor that the party felt that any move to tinker with the present procurement system, and that too in the times of nation-wide crisis, may deepen social unrest among the farmers of the State. “It may not be conducive for the peace and development of the region, which faces serious challenges of public order due to a live international border,” he said. Pointing to Pakistan’s bid to disturb the peace and stability through narco-terror and other anti-India acts, the Chief Minister later told journalists that the legislations would lead to rise in the people’s anger. “Why are we playing into the hands of Pakistan?” ‘Farmers will suffer’ “These Bills, one of which has already been passed in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, are against the national interest, and particularly detrimental to Punjab where the majority of the farmers tilled less than five acres and would be the worst hit,” he said. Hoping that the Centre will not get the other two passed in Parliament, he said the Centre had failed to take the interest of the farmers into account in introducing the ordinances and instead, took a stand in favour of corporate houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bills-will-lead-to-unrest-in-punjab-amarinder/article32625708.ece

17 September 2020||Guwahati,||Locals of same tribe oppose Bru resettlement in Tripura area||After non-Bru communities, local Reangs of Tripura have opposed the large-scale resettlement of Bru refugees from Mizoram in their vicinity. Reang is another name of the Bru tribe, also called Tuikuk in Mizoram. In a memorandum to the District Magistrate of North Tripura district on September 14, the chiefs of four villages have objected to the proposed measurement of land for resettling some of the Bru refugee families in the Urehampara area of Kanchanpur Subdivision. The four villages are Urehampara, Donjoylapara, Nouhbaraipra and Gomohonpara. More than 35,000 Brus, who had fled ethnic violence in Mizoram over a few years since 1997, are housed in seven refugee camps across Kanchanpur and adjoining Panisagar Subdivision of North Tripura district. “The resettlement of the displaced Brus in Urehampara area will affect the jhum (shifting cultivation) farmlands and put pressure on our people,” said Guthiram Reang, the ‘choudhury’ or chief of Urehampara village. His Donjoylapara counterpart Ontomoni Reang said the people of the four villages, an average of 34 km from sub-divisional headquarters Kanchanpur, have inhabited the area for 65 years. “Remoteness, lack of road connectivity and access to government facilities make life difficult. Dumping people from elsewhere will make our lives harder,” he said. The village chiefs and Koilajoy Reang, the vice-chairman of Manuchailenga Panchayat covering these villages said the government should rather resettle the displaced Brus in Purnojoypara area nearby. They also suggested that the number of families to be settled there should be 1,000 at most. The displaced Brus want at least 500 families to be settled in one area. This they said was one of the points in the quadripartite agreement of January 16 for resettling them in Tripura instead of making them return to “uncertainty” in Mizoram.  Resettlement agreement Representatives of the Ministry of Home Affairs had signed the agreement with leaders of the refugee Bru organisations and representatives of the Mizoram and Tripura governments. Earlier in September, the Joint Movement Committee (JMC) comprising Bengali and Mizo organisations had opposed the State government’s move to settle 4,900 Bru families in Kanchanpur and Panisagar subdivisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/locals-of-same-tribe-oppose-bru-resettlement-in-tripura-area/article32625710.ece
17 September 2020||Kolkata,||Mahalaya revives memories of the radio||In this digital age not many people care for the good old radio. But there is that one time of the year when nostalgia for this device is rekindled for many in Kolkata, and in West Bengal. Mahalaya, which marks the beginning of the festival season, is also an occasion for the rendition of Mahishasura Mardini by Birendrakrishna Bhadra on the radio. For decades Mahisasura Mardini has been religiously played in every Bengali household in the wee hours of Mahalaya. Amit Ranjan Karmakar (62) has been repairing radios in his small dingy shop in north Kolkata for almost five decades. The shop on 40 Banamali Sarkar Street in Kumartuli is easy to miss but a peek into it reveals that it is stocked with hundreds of models of vintage radios. By Wednesday, a day before Mahalaya, Mr. Karmakar said that he had repaired 30-odd radio sets. “I will not say that business is like previous years. Trains are not running and there are fewer customers. But still there is work,” Mr. Karmakar said. He started repairing radios in 1976, as a teenager, long before there was television. “For those in their 20s it might not matter but for the older generation listening to Mahisasura Mardini on radio is a must,” he said. Till a few years ago there were a number of shops repairing radios in Kolkata but now his is one of the few remaining. Photographers and tourists who visit Kumartuli in the run up to Durga Puja often bring their old radios along to be repaired.  Mahisasura Mardini, is one of the oldest All India Radio programmes played every year on Mahalaya since 1966. Conceived by Bani Kumar the music was composed by Pankaj Mullick.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mahalaya-revives-memories-of-the-radio/article32625482.ece
17 September 2020||LUCKNOW,||Babri demolition case verdict on September 30||The judgment in the Babri Masjid demolition case will be delivered by a Special CBI court here on September 30, almost 28 years after the structure in Ayodhya was razed to the ground. Special Judge S.K. Yadav has directed all the 32 accused to appear in court. Among the accused are senior BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and his colleagues Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Kalyan Singh, Vinay Katiyar and Sadhvi Rithambara. Mr. Singh was the Chief Minister of U.P. when Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992. The Special CBI court framed charges of criminal conspiracy against Mr. Advani and several other accused in 2017. K.K. Mishra, one of the defence lawyers, said it was mandatory for the accused to be present in court in case they were convicted and needed to be taken into custody. “The law says they will have to be present when the judgment is pronounced,” he said when asked if senior accused like Mr. Advani and Mr. Joshi, who had recorded their statement via videoconferencing, would be able to make it in person. “It needs to be discussed what arrangement the court will make for those who are unable to attend.” “I can’t comment at this moment who will come and who will not,” Mr. Mishra said. The CBI court was working against the month-end deadline set by the Supreme Court for the verdict. The final arguments by the defence and the prosecution were heard by September 1, and then the judge began writing the verdict. Some of the final submissions by the accused were made through videoconferencing. The CBI, which investigated the case, has produced 351 witnesses and about 600 documents as evidence before the court.

In 2016, 466 children died in U.P. due to the Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and the Japanese Encephalitis, a government spokesperson said quoting Mr. Adityanath. In 2020, the figure came down to seven, the government claimed.  ‘Successful strategy’ This shows how successful the State government’s strategy against vector-borne diseases has been, said Mr. Adityanath after an inter-departmental review meeting of vector-borne diseases. In 2017, the BJP government soon after coming to power had come under fire after several children died in the Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur allegedly due to shortage of oxygen supply over payment of dues of the supplier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/7-children-died-of-encephalitis-in-2020-yogi/article32625711.ece
17 September 2020||Mumbai,||Plea seeks hearings by public authorities via videoconferencing||Former central information commissioner Shailesh Gandhi along with five others on Tuesday  filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Bombay High Court seeking a direction to all the public authorities in Maharashtra to adopt an appropriate videoconferencing platform. Mr. Gandhi said that on July 29 and August 1, legal notices were sent to the State government through its Chief Secretary. The notices urged the State to issue guidelines and directions to all the public authorities to resume hearings at the earliest by adopting an appropriate videoconferencing platform. However, the notices were ignored and hence, the PIL. The PIL sought a direction from the HC to conduct all quasi-judicial and administrative hearings under the respective statute applicable to the public authorities concerned, as well as first appeal hearings under the Right to Information Act. The plea said, “Modern technology has enabled courts to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the administration of justice. Technology has facilitated advances in speed, accessibility and connectivity which enable the dispensation of justice in diverse settings and situations without compromising the core legal principles of adjudication.” The PIL further said, “Given that the videoconferencing technology fully meets the standard of proof requirement of criminal proceedings, it is humbly submitted that the said technology has all the potential to be very comfortably adopted for the conduct of quasi-judicial and administrative hearings not only for now under the present exceptional circumstances, but as a matter of norm for all times to come in future.” A Division Bench directed the petitioners to send a copy of the PIL to the State and posted the matter to be heard on September 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-seeks-hearings-by-public-authorities-via-videoconferencing/article32625485.ece
17 September 2020||Mumbai,||Fadnavis dials Goyal, seeks withdrawal of ban on export of onions||Amid growing discontent over the Centre’s move to ban export of onions, former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis asked Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal to withdraw the decision. “I have written to him. We also spoke on phone and I reiterated the demand to withdraw the ban,” Mr. Fadnavis said on Wednesday. The day also saw protests by the Congress in Pune, Thane and Solapur demanding withdrawal of the export ban. Sensing the rising discontent, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s senior leaders are also demanding a roll back. Mr. Fadnavis said, there is a huge demand for onions from Maharashtra abroad and it ensures good income to farmers here. “They will be impacted due to the ban on exports. I am hopeful that you will take appropriate decision in this regard,” said Mr. Fadnavis. On Tuesday, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar too had met Mr. Goyal in new Delhi and demanding withdrawal of the ban. Will follow-up: CM Meanwhile, the State cabinet, at its meeting on Wednesday, decided to write to the Union government on this issue. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the State will follow-up with the Centre to seek withdrawal of the ban. In 2018-19, Maharashtra exported 21.83 lakh metric tonnes of onion, while in 2019-20 it was 18.50 lakh mt. At present four lakh mt onion is lying at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port for export while 500 trucks are standing for further instructions at Bangladesh and Nepal borders. ‘No help from Centre’ Criticising the Narendra Modi-led Union government, State unit Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said while Maharashtra is extending a helping hand to farmers suffering losses due to floods or heavy rains, the Centre has not provided any help. “The decision by the Centre to import milk powder resulted in thousands of tonnes of milk powder lying with the dairy farmers, resulting in a drop in milk prices. Just as when onions were fetching a good price in the market, a decision to ban exports was taken which has led to the price of onion crashing by Rs. 700-800 per quintal,” he said, adding that the agitation will continue till the decision is rolled back. In Pune, the Congress city president Ramesh Bagwe said despite the lockdown, farmers produced onions and when they were about to get good returns, the Centre banned its export. “This is injustice and the Centre should withdraw the decision as soon as possible,” he said.

17 September 2020||Mumbai,||Cabinet clears insurance scheme for mishap victims||The Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday cleared the proposal to implement late Balasaheb Thackeray Road Accident Insurance scheme to provide medical and financial aid to victims during the golden hour. Initial expenditure of up to Rs. 30,000 will be borne by the State for 74 enlisted medical procedures, as per the scheme. Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the State Health Assurance Society will make finances available to implement the scheme which will then choose the insurance companies. “Any road accident victim in Maharashtra, irrespective of domicile or nationality, will benefit from the scheme which will make medical and financial aid available to them,” he said.

These treatments include costs for ICU, orthopaedic, stay in hospital, and meals. The scheme does not include industrial, domestic or railway accidents.” Police recruitment The Cabinet also decided to undertake one of the biggest recruitments of 12,528 police constables. “The Supreme Court has stayed reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward community in State recruitment process. The government has instructed the Home Department to move ahead in consultation with Social Justice and General Administration Departments,” said an official from the Home Department. Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said, “This decision will be a big boost to thousands of unemployed young men and women.” The recruitments will cover 5,297 posts from 2019, 6,726 posts from 2020, and 505 posts for the newly formed Mira Bhayandar-Vasai Virar police commissionerate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cabinet-clears-insurance-scheme-for-mishap-victims/article32625478.ece
17 September 2020||Navi Mumbai,||Maratha Kranti Morcha protests SC stay on quota||A week after the Supreme Court, in its interim order, stayed the implementation of the Maratha reservation for the current academic year, members of the Maratha Kranti Morcha held a protest at Shivaji Chowk in Vashi on Wednesday evening. The group blamed former chief minister Ashok Chavan, who is the head of a sub-committee formed by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the issues related to the Maratha quota, for ignoring the community’s demands. “Mr. Chavan was responsible for communicating with the advocate who was fighting our case in the SC. But neither did he brief the advocate properly nor appoint a known lawyer to represent us,” Narendra Patil, who led the agitation, said. Mr. Patil said they were against the apex court’s decision. “It was the BJP-Shiv Sena government that took cognisance of our demands, and in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, only the Sena is concerned about the Marathas. Now the SC has stayed the reservation and no one knows how long this stay will go on for,” Mr. Patil said. The SC has referred the petitions challenging the Maratha quota law of the State to a larger constitution Bench. “The State government was conducting admissions and recruitment as per the Maratha reservation law till the SC issued a stay. We want the State to carry on with the implementation of the quota till a larger constitution Bench hears the matter and gives its verdict,” Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maratha-kranti-morcha-protests-sc-stay-on-quota/article32625483.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||ED attaches assets worth Rs. 11.62 cr. in NH-74 case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth Rs. 11.62 crore in connection with the alleged disbursal of excess compensation to the people from whom land along the National Highway (NH) 74 in Uttarakhand was acquired. It resulted in a loss of Rs. 215.11 crore to the exchequer. The properties belonging to Barinder Singh, Balwant Singh, Ramesh Kumar, Vikramjeet Singh, Mandeep Singh, Harjinder Singh, their family members, and Fibremarx Papers Private Limited of Jasdeep Singh Goraya, have been attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The assets include agricultural/industrial land, commercial plots and buildings located in Udham Singh Nagar, and the balances in five bank accounts. The ED probe is based on an FIR registered, and a chargesheet filed, by the Uttarakhand police against Dinesh Pratap Singh and others revenue officials, farmers and middlemen. It is alleged that Mr. Singh and Anil Shukla, the then land acquisition officers, conspired with others to grant compensation at non-agriculture rates. This was done on the basis of a back-dated order for changing the land use from agriculture to non-agriculture. Back-dated entries were also made in revenue records. The ED probe revealed that the land owners received higher compensation, and they gave commission to the accused revenue officers. The funds were diverted to the accounts of various individuals and entities. Barinder Singh and Balwant Singh diverted the proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs. 9 crore, and Harjinder Singh to the tune of Rs. 1 crore, to the accounts of Jasdeep Singh Goraya and Mehak Kaur, which was used in their company, Fibremarx Papers. Ramesh Kumar created the fixed deposits in the name of his family member. In the same case, the agency had earlier attached properties worth Rs. 21.84 crore, which was confirmed by the PMLA Adjudicating Authority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-1162-cr-in-nh-74-case/article32625712.ece

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Siddharth Shirole has urged the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government to come up with post-COVID care guidelines to help ‘recovered’ patients who may be suffering from COVID-19 sequelae. Mr. Shirole, in his letter to the CM, said that while the administration and the State were trying to check the spread of the virus and reduce the mortality rate, it was vital to set up post COVID care clinics for the underprivileged sections while conducting awareness drives to emphasize the need for regular check-ups. More than 7.75 lakh patients in the State have recovered till date. Mr. Shirole said as per global health reports, many patients who had exhibited severe COVID-19 symptoms are now suffering from impaired cardiac functions and permanent damage to lungs, kidneys and other organs. The MLA, who inspected the city’s jumbo facility at the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) grounds, further said that he planned to hold discussions with the CM and State Health Minister Rajesh Tope to resolve issues pertaining to equipment, experienced staff and medicines plaguing the CoEP facility. Meanwhile, Pune City Congress general secretary Ramesh Iyer has called the district administration’s attention to the shortage of cardiac ambulances. “As cases mount across the State, patients from western and northern Maharashtra, as well as the Marathwada region are flooding Pune’s hospitals. At any given time, there are at least 600-650 patients on the ventilator. Many patients are succumbing due to non-availability of cardiac ambulances,” Mr. Iyer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plan-for-post-covid-care-facilities-shirole-tells-cm/article32625484.ece
17 September 2020||COLOMBO,||Maldives defends ties with India||Apparently  responding to the  growing anti-India refrain from the political opposition in the Maldives, Foreign Minister Abdulla has said that those “unable to stomach” the strengthening bilateral ties were resorting to such criticism. Speaking at an event to launch a street-lighting project supported by India, the Foreign Minister said: “This connection is with the people of the two countries. A connection indicating a heart-to-heart relationship. We acknowledge that.” His remarks come at a time when the jailed former President Abdulla Yameen-led Progressive Party of Maldives-People’s National Congress (PPM-PNC) combine has been protesting “foreign military presence in Maldivian soil”. Following a recent agitation by a group of youth, the PPM-PNC said it was “appalled by Police crackdown and indiscriminate mass arrests at peaceful motorbike rally”. Amid speculation among sections that Indian military might arrive at Hanimaadhoo in Haa Dhaalu Atoll, in addition to the Indian officers that are already in Maldives to operate the helicopters gifted to Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) by the Indian military, the Chief of Defence Force Major General Abdulla Shamaal has asserted that “no foreign armed forces” are present in the Maldives. In the last few weeks, some Maldivians also took to Twitter, beginning an “#Indiaout” campaign that trended for some time. Given that during President Yameen’s time in office, Malé-New Delhi relations turned rather sour, while his government was accused of an evident China slant, ruling party sources accuse the political opposition for triggering the social media campaign. China has been a close development partner and lender. Malé has been trying to renegotiate some $1.4 billion it owes to Beijing. On the other hand, India’s engagement has significantly grown since President Solih came to power, particularly in development partnerships. Last month, India announced a $500 million package — including a grant of $100 million — in addition to New Delhi’s earlier line of credit of $800 million announced in 2018. However, countering the recent anti-India rhetoric, largely from its political rivals, is only one of the many challenges facing President Solih’s government. Economic impact Two years into office, the Solih administration has a massive challenge in the economic impact of Covid-19 that has brutally hit the Indian Ocean island nation’s high-revenue tourism sector. India has announced $250 million special financial assistance to help the Maldives as it tries to cope with the economic strain gravely aggravated by the pandemic. According to the UNDP, the Maldives is amongst the worst affected countries in Asia region and potentially globally, due to the impact of Covid-19. In its latest outlook the Asian Development Bank has also observed that output in Maldives is expected to shrink by a fifth in 2020, the sharpest GDP forecast revision in the sub region, then grow by 10.5% in 2021.” Despite possible travel bubbles, including with India, opening up the country may not be easy for the Solih government, as Coronavirus cases continue to rise. Over 9,000 cases and 33 deaths have been reported so far. Tensions within Meanwhile, some in government fear the simmering tensions within the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) – apparently between President Solih and Speaker and former President Nasheed may pose yet another serious challenge, especially after Mr. Nasheed sought the removal of certain Ministers — accusing them of corruption. “The Speaker has also been pushing for a parliamentary system. There is concern within the government that his moves might undermine the President, who is trying to work with the coalition partners,” according to a government legislator, who spoke to The Hindu from Malé, requesting anonymity. “Be it on the economy, or on democracy, our government hasn’t been able to deliver much yet and the pandemic has made it worse. At such a time, the tensions within may prove damaging,” added the MP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/maldives-defends-ties-with-india/article32625208.ece
17 September 2020||Washington,||Indian Americans favour Joe Biden, says survey||A significant majority of Indian Americans are expected to vote for Democratic nominee Joe Biden, as per a new report released on Tuesday by Indiaspora, a non-partisan diaspora organisation and AAPI Data, an organisation that conducts data and policy research. Sixty-six percent of Indian American voters favour Mr. Biden as their candidate of choice in the presidential election, 28% favour the incumbent Donald Trump, while 6% are undecided. While Mr Biden has a sizeable majority of the anticipated votes, the Democratic numbers are lower than in 2016 , where Indian Americans overwhelmingly (77%) voted for Hilary Clinton versus the 16% who voted for Mr. Trump. However, 67% of Indian Americans had said they would vote for Ms. Clinton in 2016 pre-elections — a number comparable to this year’s potential vote for the Democratic candidate.Over 80% had supported former U.S. President Barack Obamain 2012. Fifty-four percent of Indian Americans identify as Democrats, 16% as Republicans and 24% as Independents, as per the report. The survey results are derived from AAPI Data’s 2020 Asian American Voter Survey, which consisted of 1,569 (+/- 2% margin of sampling error) Asian American voters ( including 260 registered voters identifying as Asian Indian margin of sampling error of +/- 6%). Almost all (98%) of the Indian Americans surveyed said they would vote in the coming election, while 54% said they voted in the primaries this year. Crucial group Through the use of campaign events and commercials, theDemocraticandRepublicanparties have made a play for Indian American votes this year, which are seen as particularly crucial in battleground states (those with close races) such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona. “I think Democrats absolutely should be concerned about making sure they conduct sufficient outreach to Indian Americans... because every vote is going to count, especially in those battleground states,” Raja Krishnamoorthi, a legislator from Illinois, said during a panel discussion that accompanied the launch of the survey report. He was responding to a question on whether Democrats should be worried about Indian voter attrition. Republicans have touted the bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Trump in the hopes of swaying some voters towards Mr. Trump. On the Democrat side, Kamala Harris’s Indian roots have been a talking point at diaspora campaign events. In terms of voter outreach, 56% of Indian Americans had been contacted by the Democratic party in 2020, compared to 48% by the GOP. This is a significant increase from the 31%, who had been contacted by any party in 2016 (compared to 44% of White voters and 42% of Black voters). “It’s great that both major political parties have begun to realise just how critical it is to reach out to Indian Americans — our impact is only going to increase over time,” M.R. Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, said. Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group and Indian Americans are the fastest growing within that group, Karthick Ramakrishnan, a University of California professor and founder of AAPI Data, said. There are 4.16 million Indian Americans, 4.5 million if you count individuals who have some Indian ancestry. This week’s survey results show foreign policy ranks lower than many domestic issues for Indian American voters. U.S. foreign policy towards Asia ranks relatively low compared to domestic issues in the minds of Indian American voters. Education (94%), jobs and economy (92%), health care (92%) and environment ( 88%) were among the issues that this demographic thought were ‘extremely important’ or ‘very important’. Then came racial discrimination and policing reforms (both at 84%), national security (also 84%), immigration (80%) and foreign policy in Asia (66%). Asian Americans Overall, 54% of Asian American voters (Indian, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Filipino) said they were voting for Mr. Biden, while 30% planned to vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden was favoured by all national groups except for Vietnamese Americans who preferred Mr. Trump. Indian Americans had the strongest inclination to vote for Mr. Biden relative to other Asians. “Asian Americans saw a record high level of midterm election turnout in 2018,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said during the release of the Asian American Voter Survey. “With a majority saying that they are even more enthusiastic than usual about this election suggests that we will see record turnout for Asian Americans for a presidential election in 2020.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indian-americans-favour-joe-biden-says-survey/article32625210.ece
17 September 2020||Tokyo,||Japan’s new PM Suga pledges to tackle virus, kickstart economy||Japan’s new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged on Wednesday to keep coronavirus infections under control and kickstart an economy in recession, as Shinzo Abe left office after a record-breaking tenure. In his first remarks after being elected by Parliament earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Suga emphasised his will be a cabinet of continuity, seeking to further the policies championed by Mr. Abe. “We need to carry forward the policies that the Abe administration was pushing, I feel that is the mission for which I have been called,” Mr. Suga told reporters. He sidestepped questions on the possibility of a snap election to consolidate his position, saying that “what the public wants right now is that we manage to end the pandemic soon and at the same time we steadily restore the economy”. “Achieving both the prevention of the spread of infection and rebuilding the economy is what they desire most... We hope to do our best on this issue first.” He dwelled little on political ideology or foreign policy goals, instead pledging administrative reform, an end to “bureaucratic silos”, and greater digitalisation of government. He said he would seek continued strong ties with Washington and stable relations with China and Russia. But he offered no details and made no mention of ongoing tensions with South Korea, or any specifics of his defence strategy, particularly towards North Korea.  The 71-year-old takes the top job after decades in politics, most recently in the role of Chief Cabinet Secretary, where he was a key enforcer of government policy as well as spokesman. A long-time Abe adviser, Mr. Suga has said his run was inspired by a desire to continue his predecessor’s policies. His new Cabinet is full of familiar faces, with Mr. Abe’s Foreign and Finance Ministers staying on, and the outgoing premier’s brother appointed to lead the Defence Ministry. Mr. Suga won an easy victory in a vote in Parliament, where his Liberal Democratic Party holds a commanding majority. But he now faces a raft of tough challenges, from immediate problems like the pandemic and the postponed Olympics, to longer-term issues including a declining population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-new-pm-suga-pledges-to-tackle-virus-kickstart-economy/article32625204.ece
17 September 2020||Philadelphia,||Trump says vaccine could be ready in a month||U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that a COVID-19 vaccine may be available within a month but added that the pandemic could go away by itself. “We’re very close to having a vaccine,” he told a town hall question-and-answer session with voters in Pennsylvania. “We’re within weeks of getting it you know — could be three weeks, four weeks.” Only hours earlier, speaking to Fox News, Mr. Trump had said a vaccine could come in “four weeks, it could be eight weeks”. Democrats have expressed concern that Mr. Trump is putting pressure on government health regulators and scientists to approve a rushed vaccine in time to help turn around his uphill bid for reelection.  At the town hall, Mr. Trump was asked why he’d downplayed the gravity of the pandemic, which has now killed close to 2,00,000 people in the U.S. Mr. Trump replied by saying: “I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action.” But Mr. Trump himself told journalist Bob Woodward during taped interviews for the new book Rage that he had deliberately decided to “play it down” to avoid alarming Americans. ‘Herd mentality’ Returning to one of his most controversial views on the virus, Mr. Trump insisted “it is going to disappear.” “It would go away without the vaccine but it’s going to go away a lot faster with it.” Challenged about how the virus would go away by itself, Mr. Trump said “you’ll develop like a herd mentality,” apparently meaning the concept of herd immunity, when enough people have developed resistance to the virus to effectively stop transmission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-says-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-a-month/article32625205.ece

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Nationalism and the crisis of federalism||Several Chief Ministers have recently complained about the growing crisis of Indian federalism. The central government backing out of its legal commitment to compensate for Goods and Services Tax (GST) shortfall is one ground for this complaint and just the tip of a dangerous iceberg. A deeper problem lies in a flawed understanding of nationalism and the government’s disregard for democratic principles. Federalism can function only in the hands of those with a grasp of India’s democratic nationalism. Both are indispensable and neither works properly without the other. Three nationalisms Two broad conceptions of nationalism developed in the subcontinent before India achieved Independence. The first, the idea that a community with a strongly unified culture must have a single state of its own, bifurcated into two nationalisms. One defined culture in ethno-religious terms and was articulated by the curiously similar Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League. Hindus and Muslims were separate nations and needed states of their own. For the Hindu Mahasabha, Indian nationalism simply had to be Hindu nationalism. This primacy of Hindu identity potentially had adverse consequences not only for religious but also linguistic minorities, including those Hindus who viewed their mother tongue as important as their religion. For Hindu nationalists, Hindu identity permanently outweighed being Tamil or Punjabi. The second manifestation of the same conception was articulated by sections of the Congress party which too saw the nation as defined by a common culture whose adherents must have a state of their own. But this common culture was not ethno-religious. It was defined instead by shared historical experience, the struggle against British colonial rule, and developed through an interpenetration of ideas emanating from different cultural sources. For want of a better term, call this second nationalism, civic . More inclusive than any ethno-religious nationalism, its secular, composite content is qualitatively different from Hindu or Muslim nationalisms. However, surprisingly, its basic form is not unlike Hindu nationalism. It too conceives common culture in terms of a strong idea of unity that marginalises or excludes other particular identities. A civic Indian identity, shaped at best by a thin composite culture, trumps other public identities, including linguistic ones. A third nationalism accepts that communities nourished by distinct, territorially concentrated regional cultures have the capacity to design states of their own as also educational, legal, economic, and other institutions. They possess self-governing rights. Yet, they eschew independent national aspirations, seeing themselves as constituents of a larger, equally significant common culture with another state that belongs to everyone. Indeed, they build on this shared culture and come together to consolidate the nation. Occasional conflicts between the common culture of the central state and distinct cultures of constituent states are admitted but mechanisms to prevent them are also created. This may be called a coalescent nationalism consistent with a fairly strong linguistic federalism; The central state associated with it is not multi-national. At best, it is a multi-national state without labels, one that does not call itself so; a self-effacing multi-national state.  Being linguistically federal In the 1930s, all three conceptions circulated among political elites in India. By the 1940s, however, coalescent nationalism was submerged by the other two. After Partition, India rejected ethno-religious nationalism but its ruling elites, obsessed about the dangers of further fragmentation, began to view with suspicion the political expression of even linguistic identities. No one was more uneasy with this than Jawaharlal Nehru himself who wondered if a federation structured along ethno-linguistic lines might tempt politicians to mobilise permanently on the basis of language and divert attention from issues of material well-being. Second, like religious identities, it might ‘freeze’ linguistic identities and increase the likelihood of inter-ethnic violence, encourage separatism and eventually lead to India’s break up. Thus, when the Constitution came into force in 1950, India adopted unitary, civic nationalism as its official ideology. Though a federal arrangement was accepted, the second tier of government was justified in functional terms not on ethical grounds of the recognition of group cultures. The security and unity of India were cited as the primary reason. A unitary mindset shaped by the experience of a centralised colonial state was resurrected and it seemed that the idea of a coalescent nationalism with multi-cultural federation was lost forever. A special commission to examine this issue concluded that language-based provinces were ‘not in the larger interests of the Indian nation’. Yet, another committee, that included Nehru considered the recommendations of the commission and felt that while ‘the present is not an opportune moment for the formation of new provinces, if public sentiment is insistent and overwhelming, we, as democrats must submit to it’. Before long the unitary arrangement and the conception that underpinned it proved inadequate. The third nationalism on the backburner came right back into the game as India shifted its allegiance slowly to a system of states that rejected the wholesale absorption of ethnic identities into a larger civic identity. This happened when the fledgling Indian democratic state was forced to encounter mass politics. Demands for autonomy, for sharing political power were immediately made by regional leaders. The issue of linguistic States became the focus of popular agitation forcing the creation, in 1953, of the State of Andhra for Telugu-speaking people. Soon after, a commission to reorganise States on a linguistic basis was set up.  The committee argued that justice requires the creation of partially self-governing States that recognise all major linguistic groups. Besides, their creation improves administrative efficiency, deepens democracy, and alleviates anxieties of regional minorities induced by fear of linguistic domination. Since domination eventually invites resistance and conflict which undermines the nation-state, only federalism can block language-based majoritarianism, contain conflicts and strengthen Indian nationalism. Only coalescent nationalism creatively combines claims of unity with claims of recognition of diverse cultures. A robust democratic arena allows the play of complementary multiple identities, and through dialogue, discussion and negotiation, helps to resolve disputes. Following the Committee’s recommendations, States were reorganised in 1956. Soon mass agitation forced the division of the province of Bombay into Maharashtra and Gujarat. In 1966, Haryana was separated from Punjab to become an independent state. Much later, States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand were carved out. India slowly became a coalescent nation-state, moving from the ‘holding together’ variety to what is called the ‘coming together’ form of (linguistic) federalism. This meant that regional parties were stronger than earlier in their own regions and at the centre. This sowed seeds of a more durable centre because it was grounded more on the consent and participation of regional groups that, at another level, were also self-governing. Indian federalism also attempted to remove its rigidities by incorporating asymmetries in the relation between the Centre and different States; treating all States as equals required the acknowledgement of their specific needs and according them differential treatment.  States as equals This coalescent nationalism has served India well, benefiting several groups in India. True, it has not worked as well in India’s border areas such as the North-east and Kashmir. But their problems can only be resolved by deepening not abandoning coalescent nationalism. Indeed, the Indian experience shows that whenever the Centre has been non-manipulative, treated politicians and people of regional States with respect, the entire polity works smoothly. On the other hand, whenever regions are treated disrespectfully, and norms of democratic functioning abandoned, then powerful, even violent, forces have been unleashed leading to grave instability. The contemporary crisis of federalism is due to the attack on coalescent, democratic Indian nationalism by a conceptually limited and morally weak idea of Hindu nationalism. Unless this offensive is curbed, and these trends reversed, I fear we might begin to see major cracks in our distinctive nationalist project. That would be nothing short of disastrous for the Indian republic.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||To the brink and back in Ladakh||Realists within India have always argued that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) only deals in the currency of power and brushes aside liberal and moralistic underpinnings to negotiations in every realm. Whether the recent talks between India’s External Affairs Minister, Dr. S. Jaishankar, and China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, will yield any major dividends, or whether it will be another elaborate smokescreen laid by China, is anybody’s guess. A recent editorial in the pro-government Global Times in Beijing has put out a clarion call for the people of China to be prepared for ‘war with neighbours’, without specifically mentioning India. Presciently, this was put out after the Jaishankar-Wang Yi talks and included a reference to the moral conduct of war. Not often have the Indians realised that at the heart of the PRC’s strategy to manage its periphery was another fault line in history. Often referred to as Mao’s ‘Five Finger Strategy,’ the strategy has continuously sought to reassert control over Arunachal Pradesh, or what the PRC calls ‘Southern Tibet’, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal and Ladakh, as part of an effort to secure China’s periphery. This has turned into a Chinese obsession that has destabilised South Asia. It can now be argued that despite being surprised and having had to reckon with a successful PLA operation to change the status quo in several pockets across the LAC in Ladakh, India’s refusal to buckle under pressure has given the PLA and Xi Jinping much to think of. The spontaneous and violent response of the Indian Army during the Galwan clash of June 15, and the well-planned and executed operation to tactically occupy important heights on both the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso have demonstrated a wide spectrum of capabilities and intent on India's part. While these have not resulted in any gains on the ground, the PLA remains entrenched in ‘grey areas’ and has been forced to pause and mull over its future actions on the ground, giving India time to build up for the winter and prepare for the long haul. Some analysts believe that an escalation of some kind seems inevitable, and that it is imperative that the series of meetings at various levels do not infuse a sense of hope that rapprochement is around the corner, unless it is accompanied by a visible change on the ground. Others who have served in the area and observed the trajectory of the PLA build-up argue that there is no way that the deployments, dense as they may be, are enough to support even a localised skirmish. Adding to the difficulties of the PLA in any further operations is the widely accepted military proposition that uphill attacks to dislodge entrenched defenders from the kind of heights now occupied by the Indian Army would require overwhelming force ratios of upwards of 9:1. If one looks back at the heavy losses suffered by the Indian Army during their initial assaults in the Kargil conflict, one may wonder whether the PLA has the appetite to deal with such losses. Measured approach A ‘hot’ LAC will favour the PLA with its greater reserves and will test India to its limits. It is the worst option that India must prepare for, even more than a localised and limited conflict. The latter is a situation that the PLA wants to avoid as it has already achieved several operational outcomes by adopting elaborate coercive methods short of conflict. Hence, the only body language that must go out from the Indian armed forces at present is that it is more than prepared for a limited conflict. Of greater significance will be a realisation within the PLA leadership that India’s emerging combined arms firepower has the potential to inflict significant attrition on the PLA’s combat potential in and around the tactical battle area and in medium depth on the Tibetan plateau. This may be coupled with a realisation that in its obsession with learning from the lessons of the 1991 Gulf War, the PLA may have missed out on thinking more about high altitude warfare, something that the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force have gained much experience in over the decades. There is also a realisation that the Indian Navy’s assertive maritime posturing, its willingness to join collaborative groupings to contain an aggressive PLA Navy, and increasing articulation on the need to ensure freedom of navigation reflects a growing willingness on India’s part to ‘go out and meet an adversary’ on the high seas rather than stay in the backwaters. The biggest stumbling block to rapprochement between the two countries lies within the PLA, which has seriously intellectualised its role as the sword-arm of Chinese national power. It has assiduously developed plans to take down adversaries and rolled out its playbook with a multi-front strategy that will run its course. History looms large again, as the PLA was Mao’s principal instrument against Chiang Kai Shek in the late 1940s as he sought to forge a new identity for the Chinese people. This time around, after shaping the global environment with economic muscle, Xi Jinping is now using the PLA as a vanguard in his bid to narrow the gap further with China’s principal global competitor, the U.S. India would do well not to become collateral damage in this great power competition. While diplomatic initiatives and further coercive explorations in the economic domain must continue, pragmatism and realism suggest that in the short-term, it is India’s military resolve that offers the most potential for precipitating any kind of conflict mitigation. Several practitioners feel that the current face-off will only be resolved if the PLA is offered a face-saving proposition, and that would need some deft politico-military-diplomatic manoeuvring from India. What of a fresh boundary agreement with China following this face-off? Two trajectories seem possible. The first will involve a path of least resistance that brings into play a new paradigm and fresh protocol for managing a stressed but not a ‘hot’ LAC – much like ‘old wine in a new bottle.’ The second would entail a stroke of ‘enlightened statesmanship’ that sees both President Xi Jinping and PM Modi cut through much of the clutter to reach a ‘swap deal,’ the kinds of which are said to have been proposed by Zhou-Enlai in 1959 and Deng Xiaoping in the early 1990s. For Xi, it would mean having to get around an increasingly assertive PLA, while PM Modi would need to get around fractured and jingoistic constituencies across the political spectrum that still hold on to impossible historical probabilities.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Nicks to the Chinese strongman’s image||Domestic security constitutes an integral dimension within the strategic-security dynamics of states. However, for authoritarian regimes and political ideologies, where power flows from the barrel of the gun, the concept transcends this traditional role and becomes a tool of both political survival and power for the top leadership. As such, it becomes crucial for authoritarian leaders to exert absolute command over the domestic security apparatus of the state. It is in this context that the recent downfall, in China, of top security officials on corruption charges and the creation of a new ‘small leading group’ assume significance. At the very outset, they reflect Chinese President Xi Jinping’s perceived vulnerabilities and one of Beijing’s primary socio-political dilemmas. Targets of anti-graft drive In addition to sanctioning an aggressive foreign policy posture and military assertiveness in China’s various sovereignty disputes, Mr. Xi announced his post-COVID-19 blitzkrieg at the domestic scene by once again launching an attack on the so-called ‘tigers’ through his anti-corruption campaign. Among others, one of the prominent officials facing corruption charges is the former Vice-Minister of Public Security, Sun Lijun. This makes Sun the third vice-ministerial level official belonging to China’s Ministry of Public Security to have fallen in recent years since the arrests of Meng Hongwei and Li Dongsheng in 2018 and 2016, respectively. Notably, Meng was serving as the president of the Lyon-based Interpol at the time of his arrest. In addition to his high-profile status, Sun’s arrest is significant as he led the ministry’s First Bureau which deals with the sensitive issues of domestic security and Hong Kong affairs. Other top security officials facing corruption charges are the police chiefs of major provinces such as Shanghai (Gong Daoan) and Chongqing (Deng Huilin). The arrest of Deng Huilin once again highlights the challenge of Chongqing that Mr. Xi first dealt with in the form of the infamous Bo Xilai scandal which involved an alleged coup attempt against the Chinese President shortly after he had assumed office. Chongqing has become one of the primary targets of the anti-corruption campaign, with several high-ranking officials having fallen under the corruption net over the years. Challenges from within The arrests of Meng, Sun and Deng follow Mr. Xi’s struggles with the security establishment that began with the downfall of the former public security czar and Politburo Standing Committee member, Zhou Yongkang back in 2014. Though information remains sketchy, it is widely believed that Sun, Meng and Li were close to Zhou who himself was regarded as a prominent member of the ‘Shanghai Clique’— the powerful faction of the Chinese Communist Party led by its patriarch and former President Jiang Zemin. Analysed from this perspective, Mr. Xi seems to continue to face challenges from the fragments of a faction that had once catapulted him to the helm of China’s politics, but has since then become one of his primary targets in the quest for supremacy. At one level, these cases serve to highlight the depth of the corruption malice within the Chinese Communist Party; they also point towards the ever-increasing efforts by Mr. Xi to exercise absolute authority over China’s domestic security apparatus; hence, they reveal a possible challenge facing his meticulously crafted and deftly marketed ‘all powerful’ image. In fact, as has been noted by prominent China watchers, a 2015 article (by Xinhua) listed the domestic security forces as one of the 12 most frequently used phrases by Mr. Xi during his first two years in office. Planned events Another move that underscores Mr. Xi’s renewed efforts to control the domestic security machinery is the launch of a nationwide campaign to “rectify education” for politicians and law enforcement officials. The aim is to “scrape the poison of the bones” of the country’s political and legal systems under the aegis of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (CPLC), China’s apex body dealing with law enforcement and public security. This campaign will run from next year to the first quarter of 2022. A pilot programme will be tried in select regions between July and October this year. Interestingly, 2022 is the year when the CPC is slated to hold its 20th Party Congress. This will perhaps be one of the most important political events in China’s recent history as it will decide Mr. Xi’s political fate and the continuation of his direct or indirect influence (via an all loyalist politburo) over the country. Additionally, the commission has announced plans to use technological advancements such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and big data to help monitor its police officers and judges. In conjunction with this campaign, a new body called the Safe China Construction Coordinating Small Group has been established with the CPLC Secretary, Guo Shengkun, serving at its helm. This group has been tasked with tackling the emerging challenges to the country’s social and political stability. It is worth noting that during a Politburo Standing Committee meeting in February, Mr. Xi had characterised the coronavirus pandemic as a major test for China’s governance system, with implications for the country’s social stability. In fact, these new measures have come amid growing international chorus against China’s policies in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and in China’s territorial dispute with India. On the domestic front, Mr. Xi has faced rare public criticism from individuals such as Xu Zhangrun, a (now former) professor at Tsinghua University (incidentally, the President’s alma mater) and fellow ‘princelings’ or the “second generations reds” such as Ren Zhiqiang and Cai Xia. Confronted with an increasingly complex international and domestic scenario, it is no coincidence that Mr. Xi wants to keep a tight rein on the security establishment of the Chinese Party-state. Shuffling the deck While these latest moves are to a great extent governed by Mr. Xi’s assessment of China’s (and his own) present vulnerabilities, they nevertheless complement his efforts since assuming power to bring the domestic security front under his supreme control. A key initiative in this regard was the restructuring of the People’s Armed Police (PAP) command structure in 2017-18. Prior to 2018, the PAP had a dual command structure wherein it used to report both to the state Council and the Central Military Commission (CMC). With the restructuring, the PAP now operates under the sole command of the CMC, and thereby its Chairman, Mr. Xi. Furthermore, Mr. Xi has created at least two new institutions to streamline, better integrate and oversee China’s domestic security apparatus in the form of the Central National Security Commission and the National Supervision Commission. These bodies were established in 2013 and 2018, respectively. However, not much information is available regarding the exact nature, role and activities of these institutions. On closer scrutiny, the recent developments within China’s domestic security landscape may not point towards a significant threat to Mr. Xi’s authority. They nonetheless provide a glimpse into the existing fissures within the Chinese system.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Pandemic and a free press||India is justly proud of its position as the world’s largest democracy. It is less proud of the fact that it has become a hotbed for the spread of COVID-19, with an estimated 90,000 daily infections, and over 5 million cases overall, second only to the United States. Can India find a way to combat the virus while preserving the democratic values that define the nation? At the heart of any democracy is an informed citizenry that is empowered to make decisions and hold its government accountable. That is why there is nothing more essential to a democracy than a free press. It is not merely the means through which citizens gather information. It is the vehicle through which ideas are debated, policies are formulated, and conflicts are resolved. Yet, India’s press freedom record has seen a decline in recent years. Violent attacks against journalists, including murder, are surprisingly common in India and rarely punished. A 2016 report entitled ‘Dangerous Pursuits’ by the Committee to Protect Journalists, the organisation I lead, found that journalists who report on government corruption are routinely murdered with impunity. Legal prosecution is also rife, particularly against journalists reporting on the conflict in Kashmir. Aasif Sultan, a journalist with the monthlyKashmir Narrator, was arrested on August 31, 2018 in reprisal for his reporting. He has since spent more than two years in jail. ‘Only official versions’ These negative trends have only intensified since the COVID-19 outbreak, with journalists across the country facing attacks, harassment, and arrests. The Narendra Modi government of course famously asked the Supreme Court to impose a nationwide censorship on the publication of information that the government deemed “false or inaccurate.” The Supreme Court denied that request, but it did direct the media to refer to the “official version” of events when covering the pandemic — an ambiguous edict which has not been enforced. The government, and the Indian society as a whole, have a legitimate concern about the ways in which the spread of false or misleading information can undermine public health and efforts to fight the pandemic. And the damage to the Indian economy caused by the disease itself and the precipitous national lockdown in March has inflicted tremendous pain on families across the nation. The Modi government needs to deploy the full arsenal of tools available in a democracy to confront the challenge. This means presenting a clear and credible plan to the people for tackling COVID-19, and using persuasion, arguments, evidence and reason to rally their support. It means unleashing the innovation and entrepreneurship of the Indian business community that has fuelled the country’s rapid growth. It means encouraging debate and competition of ideas that drive political solutions. And it means combating misinformation through aggressive public information campaigns, not raw censorship.  The democratic world is rooting for India’s success. While Chinese censorship helped fuel the original outbreak in Wuhan by suppressing information about the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Chinese government has used its propaganda networks to cover up its initial failures and shape global perceptions. China has made the case that its system of authoritarian power was essential for controlling the pandemic. It contrasts the giant pool parties in Wuhan, where life has largely returned to normal, with the chaotic response in democratic countries like the United States, Brazil, and India. Not surprisingly, the Chinese government’s narrative has resonated with authoritarian governments around the world that have used a public health emergency to restrict civil liberties and increase State surveillance and control. Even in democracies, citizens are beginning to wonder if liberty and freedom must be sacrificed to fight the disease. The U.S., grappling with its own shortcomings and political dysfunction, has not effectively made the case that democracy is an asset and not a liability in fighting a public health emergency. India has long been a leader and an example in the democratic world, but its response to the pandemic has weakened its position. In order to restore its lustre, India’s leaders need to express confidence in democratic principles and trust in the country’s citizens. That starts with a commitment to a free press.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Beyond the barriers of disability||Nearly 75 years ago, the United Nations (UN) was created in the face of intolerance and discrimination to reaffirm faith in the dignity and worth of humans, and in the equal rights of women and men. Its fundamental values postulated that in order to live sustainably, we must practise tolerance and endorse the values of equality. However, if we are to stay true to the values of the UN, we must bring marginalised communities from the fringes back into the development mainstream. Well-known for his advocacy of disability rights, singer Stevie Wonder, who was blind, once declared that ‘love’s in need of love today’. In a plea to elicit support for the community of persons with disabilities, he stressed the importance of counteracting the cycle of oppression. It was a call for greater equality made many years ago, but the promises still remain unfulfilled. Based on recent estimates, over a billion people worldwide are impacted by disability and the stigma surrounding it. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 15% of the world's population has some or the other form of disability, making disabled people the largest global minority. Continuous discrimination denies them equal access to education, employment, healthcare and other opportunities. Essentially, what we are looking at is an enormous reservoir of untapped resources excluded from the workforce. The stigma attached to persons with disabilities, compounded by a lack of understanding of their rights, makes it difficult for them to attain their valued “functionings”, which Amartya Sen defined as capabilities deemed essential for human development. Furthermore, women and girls with disabilities are at a higher risk of experiencing sexual and other forms of gender-based violence. About 80% of the estimated one billion persons with disabilities worldwide live in developing countries. The International Labour Organization , using data from the latest national Census (2011), reports that 73.6% of persons living with disabilities in India are outside the labour force. Those with mental disabilities, women with disabilities and those in rural areas are the most neglected. Worst-hit group As is the case with most crises, the COVID-19 pandemic has had its worst impact on marginalised communities. For instance, students with disabilities have found it extremely difficult to access remote learning through digital platforms. The UNESCO's 2019 State of the Education Report of India acknowledges that inclusive education is complex to implement and requires a fine understanding of the diverse needs of children and their families across different contexts. India has made considerable progress in terms of putting in place a robust legal framework and a range of programmes that have improved enrolment rates of children with disabilities in schools. However, further measures are needed to ensure quality education for every child to achieve the targets of Agenda 2030, and more specifically, the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goal 4. Globally, UNESCO joined its partners in the Global Action on Disability (GLAD) Network to raise awareness about the need to put in place strategies to mitigate the impact of school closures on learners with disabilities. The implementation of the groundbreaking National Education Policy 2020 provides a historic opportunity to utilise the immense potential. Two of the most celebrated icons of music, Stevie Wonder and Andrea Bocelli, and star Indian para-athlete Deepa Malik have already set the tone for making inclusion the norm. With the right investments, youth with disabilities in India can also be the country’s largest asset. The pandemic has shown us that we are only as healthy as our neighbour. It has exposed the large cracks of inequality, urging us to ponder over our responsibilities towards each other. Let us use this time as a catalyst for change and work together to ensure that all persons with disabilities enjoy the full range of human rights.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Stop press||A blanket gag order against the media is often fraught with serious consequences for both free speech and the citizen’s right to receive information. Orders by different courts, restraining the media from reporting on particular cases or programmes from being telecast, have drawn attention this week to questions of prior restraint, media freedom and the right of people facing investigation to a fair trial. A quite unusual and legally questionable decision has been the interim order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court imposing a ban on the media, and even social media, from mentioning anything in relation to an FIR filed by the police against a former Advocate General of the State and others. It is unusual in the sense that there appears to be no material to justify such censorship other than an allegation by the petitioner that it is a “foisted” case. It is also accompanied by an order staying the investigation itself. It is indeed open to a High Court to grant a stay on investigation in extraordinary cases. When political vendetta is alleged against the government of the day, that too by someone who had served a previous regime as a law officer, the need for media coverage and public scrutiny is all the greater. How the petitioner would benefit from the complete absence of any reportage is unclear. It prevents legitimate comment even to the effect that there is no substance in the allegations. Injunctions against publication can either be an order to prevent possible defamation or invasion of privacy, or one aimed at protecting the fairness of a trial or investigation. The Supreme Court did hold in Sahara vs. SEBI (2012) that the Court can grant preventive relief on a balancing of the right to free trial and a free press. However, it favoured such temporary restraint on publication “only in cases of real and substantial risk of prejudice” to the administration of justice or a fair trial. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, on the same day, passed a more important interim order stopping the telecast of the remaining episodes of a series on Sudarshan News on entirely different grounds. Holding that the programme — four episodes were aired — was nothing but vilification of Muslims, the Court found it necessary to interdict the telecast of more episodes. The Court seems to have made a distinction between freedom of expression and propagation of hate. In recent years, there have been quite a few instances, especially in Karnataka, of omnibus interim injunctions against all media houses obtained by some people solely to prevent any news reporting about themselves. While claiming to be defamed by one publication, they sue all media outlets and obtain open-ended stay on publications, including those that are hardly interested in writing about them. As a matter of principle, courts ought to avoid omnibus orders against publication. Such orders are often to the detriment of the right to know.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stop-press/article32625182.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||New order in West Asia||The so-called Abraham Accords, signed in the White House on Tuesday by the UAE, Bahrain and Israel, under U.S. President Donald Trump’s mediation, clearly mark a new beginning in the relations between the Sunni-ruled Gulf kingdoms and the Jewish state. Under the agreement, the UAE and Bahrain would normalise ties with Israel, heralding better economic, political and security engagement. More Arab countries are expected to follow suit, say U.S. and Israeli officials. The agreements have the backing of Saudi Arabia, arguably the most influential Arab power and a close ally of the UAE and Bahrain. The ailing, octogenarian ruler of the Kingdom, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is treading cautiously for now, but Riyadh has opened its airspace for commercial flights between the UAE and Israel. The accords, the first between Israel and Arab countries since the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace treaty, also offer a rare diplomatic win to Mr. Trump, whose other foreign policy bets, be it Iran or North Korea, were either disastrous or stagnant. With less than 50 days to go before his re-election bid, he has called the agreements “the new dawn of a new Middle East”. Though of historical and geopolitical significance, it is too early to say whether the accords will have any meaningful impact on West Asia’s myriad conflicts. Unlike Egypt and Jordan, which signed peace treaties with Israel in 1979 and 1994, respectively, the Gulf countries are not frontline states in the Arab-Israeli conflict. They had established backroom contacts with Israel years ago; what is happening now is their normalisation. Second, the agreements leave the Palestinian question largely unaddressed. With Arab countries signing diplomatic agreements with Israel bilaterally, the Arab collective support for the Palestinian movement for nationhood, which has been the basis of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, is crumbling. But it does not mean that the Palestinian question would fade away. The vacuum left by the retreat of the Arab powers from the Israel-Palestine conflict is being filled by the non-Arab Muslim powers — Iran, Turkey and their allies. The geopolitical sands may be shifting but the core issue concerning Israel is unresolved. Three, the UAE-Bahrain agreements are in fact endorsing the region’s emerging order. With the U.S. in retreat and Turkey and Iran pursuing more aggressive foreign policies, there is a three-way contest taking shape, in which Sunni-ruled Arab kingdoms, all American allies, are realigning their geopolitical interests with Israel. The Abraham Accords are likely to sharpen this contest. If Mr. Trump and the signatories to the accords want to bring peace here as they have claimed, they should address the more structural issues, which include the unresolved question of Palestine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/new-order-in-west-asia/article32625183.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||The Meston Award (From an editorial)||The text of the second report from the Joint Select Committee on the Rules under the Government of India Act is now available. It shows that the amendments made by the Committee in regard to the Meston Award are far less satisfactory than what Reuter led us to believe. The provincial share in the income-tax is not to be 25 per cent of the gross revenue estimated to accrue from the income-tax and super-tax collected by the provincial agency, as we were originally led to suppose. It would appear that the India Council suggested some modifications, and we are told that accepting the more important of these suggestions the Committee are of opinion “that there should be granted to all provinces some share in the growth of revenue from taxation on income so far as that growth is attributable to an increase in the amount of income assessed.” The manner in which this share is to be assessed and its extent “are stated in the new Rule 15 which the Committee have inserted, and it may be explained here that the figure 400 lakhs in that rule represents approximately 25 per cent of the gross revenue estimated to accrue from income-tax and super-tax collected by provincial agency in the year 1920-21.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-meston-award-from-an-editorial/article32625191.ece

Rajagopalachari, founder-leader of the Swatantra Party, to clarify what would happen if Mrs. Indira Gandhi’s Government was toppled at the Centre as desired by him. In a press statement, Mr. Karunanidhi wanted Rajaji to tell him what kind of a Government would be formed and who would be the “fortunate” person to become the new Prime Minister. Would Rajaji “unhesitatingly” accept the responsibility of taking over the Prime Ministership, or would Mr. Kamaraj be made Prime Minister, he asked. Mr. Karunanidhi desired to know whether Rajaji thought that a new Parliament would be elected or the President would “rule” till 1972. Would Rajaji accept Presidential rule till 1972, he asked. Even if elections to Parliament were held in 1971 itself, elections to the Assemblies would have to be held in 1972. This would result in both the Government and the people being preoccupied with elections for the next two years. Did Rajaji want this, he asked. In future also, the two elections would be held in alternate years, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/what-happens-if-govt-is-toppled/article32625192.ece
17 September 2020||MUMBAI,||‘Recovery not yet entrenched, may be gradual’||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said while there were some signs of ‘stabilisation’ in the pandemic-hit economy, a recovery was yet to take firm root and would probably take longer to gain momentum. Observing that high frequency indicators of agricultural activity, manufacturing PMI and private estimates for unemployment pointed to some stabilisation of economic activity in the second quarter, Mr. Das said, “the recovery is, however, not yet fully entrenched and moreover, in some sectors, upticks in June and July appear to be levelling off”. “By all indications, the recovery is likely to be gradual as efforts towards reopening of the economy are confronted with rising infections,” the RBI chief told members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry’s national executive committee in a speech, the text of which was shared on the central bank’s website. A protracted nationwide lockdown and local restrictions in several States aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus notwithstanding, the total number of COVID-19 cases raced past the 50-lakh mark this week. Noting that the immediate policy response had been to ensure stability, including the RBI’s own steps of cutting policy interest rates and enabling targeted infusion of liquidity, Mr. Das said looking ahead policy measures were required in specific focus areas to make sure that the growth that emerged after the recovery from the crisis remained durable. Highlighting five critical areas that would determine India’s ability to sustain growth in the medium-run, he said these include human capital, in particular education and health; productivity; exports, which is linked to raising India’s role in the global value chain; tourism; and food processing and associated productivity gains. “Indian banks and the financial system would need to respond proactively to opportunities arising from the NEP (new education policy) for new financing,” he asserted, adding that the the health sector should adopt a more comprehensive approach similar to the NEP. He also said that in a vastly altered landscape for trade, India had an opportunity to expand exports by focusing on global value chains. “There is a need to move up the value chain,” he said referring to the need to prioritise greater value addition to farm output. Answering a question he said the restructuring window allowed for COVID-19-impacted companies was a balancing act to safeguard the interests of depositors, lenders and borrowers. ‘Depositors’ interest’ “The primary concern of any bank is protection of depositors’ interest because ultimately it is depositors’ money. There are crores of depositors while borrowers could be in lakhs only. There are small depositors, middle class and retired people who depend on their deposit income and their interest has to be protected,” he said. Besides depositors, the aspect of financial stability also had to be kept in mind. “Both these sides need to be balanced. The revival of such [COVID hit] businesses will also ensure that NPA levels are kept low and there will be quicker economic recovery,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/recovery-not-yet-entrenched-may-be-gradual/article32625166.ece
17 September 2020||HYDERABAD,||RDIF talking with Indian firms on making vaccine||Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF is in discussion with Indian firms to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V that is currently undergoing trials. “We would confirm that we are in talks with a number of Indian companies on Sputnik V manufacturing, but cannot disclose [their] names as yet,” a spokesperson for the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said. Responding to queries, after RDIF announced a partnership with Dr. Reddy’s for clinical trials and distribution of the vaccine in India, he said details of tie-ups with other companies would follow soon. On pricing, he said, “RDIF has said previously, it was not aiming at making a profit, just covering costs”. Developed by Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine against COVID-19 based on the human adenoviral vectors platform. Global export hub Besides a big domestic market, India is a strong player globally in the field of vaccines. In FY20, vaccine exports amounted to $878.64 million, accounting for 4.27% of total pharma exports of $20.58 billion.

17 September 2020||MUMBAI,||Rentals decline in key metros as pandemic drives people to smaller towns, outskirts||Rental housing in key metros has taken a hit with reverse migration due to the pandemic and on account of prolonged work-from-home (WFH) assignments, besides salaried job losses. On the other hand, it has picked up in sleepy towns and peripheral areas both in terms of demand and occupancy rates, according to analysts. “Over 10,000 people have vacated their rental homes in the last 3 months and have gone back to smaller cities and home towns,” said Amarendra Sahu, CEO, Nestaway Technologies, a home rental company with more than 60,000 homes across 16 cities. He said COVID-19 had caused massive disruptions in the home rental industry, especially in cities, as there had been a massive reverse migration of youth to their home towns. An estimated 50% tenants had left Bengaluru, as per reports. “Prior to COVID-19, tenant base was crowded in central business districts and a few busy areas in Tier-1 cities. We see a tectonic shift in consumer behavior now,” Mr. Sahu said. ‘Cheaper rent’ “With more than 85% of tenants with us belonging to knowledge jobs, they now prefer far-off locations and nearby smaller cities as the rents are cheaper and they do not have to commute to work daily,” he said. Pankaj Kapur, managing director & CEO, Liases Foras said the luxury housing segment bore the maximum brunt of 30-40% in rental correction, while the mid-housing segment has seen a rental correction of 5-10 %. “When the economy goes down, house rents also go down. But this adverse impact is short-lived. Over 70% of the people will come back and then rents will move up,” Mr. Kapur said. Commenting on the trend, Ritesh Mehta, senior director and head — West India, Residential Services, JLL, said, “ While we are witnessing some correction in rental values due to COVID-19, the real financial impact is yet to be to be seen in the next couple of quarters.” “While there has been relaxation in terms of daily utility bills and maintenance, loans have moratoriums. The real crash crunch will seen [from October to April] when individuals would be burdened with liabilities to fulfil expenses vis-a-vis an uncertain drop in income,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rentals-decline-in-key-metros-as-pandemic-drives-people-to-smaller-towns-outskirts/article32625169.ece

In a setback to the Centre, the top court rejected its appeal against the February 19 order of the Delhi High Court saying that it had not made out a case of violation of procedural due process in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings. While upholding the high court verdict, a bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer, Indu Malhotra and Aniruddha Bose said the enforcement of the foreign award did not contravene the public policy of India, or that it was contrary to the basic notions of justice. The top court vacated the interim orders of status quo on June 17 and July 22 and held that the award dated January 18, 2011 passed by the tribunal is held to be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of Sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The bench said the Centre was aggrieved by the interpretation taken by the tribunal with respect to provision of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and its other sub-clauses. The interpretation of the terms of the PSC lay within the domain of the tribunal and that it was not open for the appellants to impeach the award on merits before the enforcement court, the top court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sc-upholds-award-on-ravva-favouring-vedanta/article32625179.ece

In seasons past, the side has been dragged down by a few recurring failings — an overdependence on Virat Kohli and A.B. de Villiers, and a dearth of death bowlers and middle-order finishers. In the December player auction, the franchise did not do enough to address these issues. While the marauding Aaron Finch and in-form Devdutt Padikkal add substance to the top-order, the list of finishers — led by Chris Morris, Moeen Ali and Shivam Dube — lacks that explosive quality. The RCB arsenal is missing the devastating detonation provided by the likes of Andre Russell, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard, all of whom can consistently win matches from tight situations. The death bowling responsibility falls on pacer Navdeep Saini, who has great control over yorkers and bouncers. Saini, however, lacks support. Dale Steyn, on a comeback trail at 37, is effective with the new ball but leaks runs towards the end of the innings. Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Siraj do not inspire confidence at the death, as, in seasons past, they have not shown the required temperament and skill in the face of heavy fire. Clever mix Wiry Sri Lankan left-arm seamer Isuru Udana, with his clever mix of slower deliveries, could be called in to keep the late runs in check. The middle overs, with dependable leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal in action, does not pose much concern. With pitches subject to wear and tear as the season rolls on, the spin contingent — consisting of Chahal, leg-spinner Adam Zampa, left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed and offies Washington Sundar and Moeen — will play a big role. RCB must shun the old unreliable formula of banking on star players Kohli and de Villiers to conjure up victories. It is time for new match-winners to step up and be counted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-rcb-end-years-of-frustration/article32625307.ece

17 September 2020||Bengaluru,||‘Heat and humidity will test players’||The heat and uncomfortable humidity in the UAE will test players in the IPL, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) star A.B. de Villiers stated. “I’m not used to these conditions. It’s very hot. It reminds me of the Test we played in Chennai (in March 2008), when Viru (Virender Sehwag) scored a 300. That was one of the hottest weather conditions I’ve ever experienced in my life. “The humidity here is similar. Though the weather is getting better, it will definitely play a part. “You have to make sure to conserve energy for the back end of your batting innings or for the last five overs when bowling,” de Villiers said, in an RCB Bold Diaries interview.  The South African explained that the long layoff forced by the COVID-19 pandemic has made players all the more hungry to perform. “You might see a levelling-up (in the overall standard of cricket). The guys are back with rediscovered energy and love for the game,” de Villiers said. The experienced de Villiers reserved special praise for young teammate and wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Philippe. “He’s a very talented player with all the shots in the book. I see a lot of similarities with the way I played when I was younger,” de Villiers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/heat-and-humidity-will-test-players/article32625305.ece
17 September 2020||Chennai,||Gopi calls for multiple mini-leagues||Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla said on Wednesday that the federation was working with the government to ensure athletes are high up in the priority list to receive a vaccine when it is ready. “We have already discussed this with the government. If they need to go to the Olympics, we need to ensure our athletes should get it [the vaccine] in the first batch,” Sumariwalla said during a webinar jointly organised by IDBI Federal Life Insurance, Athletics Federation of India and FIT India. Eyeing January start The Olympian also added that athletics events in the country might resume only in January with intensive training set to begin in October. “We have just chalked out our detailed calendar and we are hoping to see competitive action from January onwards. “Due to the delay [in the start of the Olympics] we are confident of a much better show as our young athletes will be more mature and better prepared,” said Sumariwalla. Bio-secure bubbles National Badminton Coach P. Gopi Chand proposed multiple mini-leagues for top athletes within bio-secure bubbles to kickstart sporting activity. “Sport across the world has started and we cannot be left behind. It may not be possible to hold the same kind of tournaments like in the past. “We can look at a league in each sport among elite players by dividing them into groups as per their levels. We can create a bubble and ensure they don’t need to travel much,” Gopi Chand said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/keep-athletes-on-vaccine-priority-list-afi-chief/article32625365.ece
17 September 2020||Mumbai,||Watching Dhoni would be a delight, says Sehwag||Virender Sehwag expects this year’s IPL to be “extra special” and a major reason for that is M.S. Dhoni getting back on the pitch after announcing his international retirement following a year-long sabbatical from the game. The IPL will get underway on September 19 in the UAE, moved out of India due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Extra special “I think this tournament will be extra special for everyone — the players as well as the audience... watching Dhoni back on the pitch is sure to be a delight. There’s so much in store, need I say more?” Sehwag, who will be co-hosting a show ‘Power Play with Champions’ on Flipkart Video, said. Dhoni, who surprised everyone with his decision to call it quits from international cricket in mid-August, will be back in action when he leads Chennai Super Kings in the IPL. CSK will take on defending champion Mumbai Indians in the lung-opener of the league in Abu Dhabi on September 19.  Sehwag said cricket is an integral part of an Indian’s life and the fans have waited long for the sport to return. “I’ve spent a lot of my time during the lockdown watching old matches, analysing them, including my own innings. Cricket forms an important part of our DNA as Indians and we’ve waited with bated breath for it to return” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/watching-dhoni-would-be-a-delight-says-sehwag/article32625361.ece

Little wonder the hard-hitting left-hander from South Africa is much in demand in T20 leagues around the globe. He has lit up the IPL with some sensational knocks since he joined Kings XI Punjab in 2012. After making 1850 runs (strike rate 138.78, average 34.25) for the Punjab team, which he also led in 2016, he has moved to Rajasthan Royals. He spoke to The Hindu from Dubai. Excerpts:  On joining Rajasthan Royals: I am really excited to start this new challenge with a new team. So far, it’s been a fantastic experience here at the Royals with the boys and all the staff. I have been welcomed with open arms by everyone. It’s a close unit and the camaraderie is brilliant.  On the significance of the IPL during a pandemic: Sport has that power to bring some cheer to the general public in difficult times. The IPL is obviously massive in India, and people will have something to enjoy at their homes and spend some time watching with their families what they like and are truly passionate about.      On the rising profile of Indian pacers: Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav, have all been brilliant. They can swing the ball at good speed, which is difficult. It is challenging [to handle] for a batsman in any form of cricket. I think all of them are really impressive and certainly pose a major threat to the opposing batsmen.

17 September 2020||Abu Dhabi,||Hardik says injury setback ‘a motivation’||Back from a lengthy injury layoff, Mumbai Indians’ star all-rounder Hardik Pandya said the setback motivated him to work harder and he is now in good shape both physically and mentally for the IPL starting September 19. Pandya’s form will be crucial for defending champion Mumbai Indians, which will take on Chennai Super Kings in the lung-opener on September 19. Matter of time “The way I’m hitting the ball right now, the shape I’m in, the mental space I’m in, it is just a matter of time that I go and spend some time on the ground and I think things will come out pretty well,” Pandya said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians’ official Twitter handle. “No matter how far I go from the game, no matter how long I stay out, when I come back, it has to be worth it. I have prepared very well and I think, great things are coming ahead,” the 26-year-old all-rounder added. Last November, Pandya had undergone a back surgery in London. Part of life “In my life I have realised one thing that injuries would be with me. No one wants to get injured, but I accept the fact that what I do, injuries would be a part of it. “Injuries have always kept me going, always kept me motivated. Actually taught me how much I have to put in the hard yards and the hard work has always increased, never decreased,” said the Baroda all-rounder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hardik-says-injury-setback-a-motivation/article32625908.ece

17 September 2020||MANCHESTER,||Bairstow takes England to 302||Jonny Bairstow’s century powered England to 302 for seven in the third and final ODI against Australia at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The opener could only stand and watch from the other end as left-arm quick Mitchell Starc took two wickets with the first two deliveries of the match, removing Jason Roy and Joe Root. Bairstow, however, counter-attacked, smashing Josh Hazlewood for two fours and lofting Cummins for six. Eoin Morgan, who had survived the hat-trick ball from Starc, made 23 before driving leg-spinner Adam Zampa to Starc at mid-off. Zampa also sent back Jos Buttler, the batsman chipping to extra-cover after scoring just eight. Bairstow, however, continued to make merry, reaching his century in style with a six off a 90mph delivery from fast bowler Pat Cummins. It was his 10th century in 83 matches and Bairstow shared a fifth-wicket partnership of 114 with Sam Billings, whose 57 followed his 118 in the first ODI. Chris Woakes’ late assault — 53 not out off 39 balls with six fours — and his partnerships with Tom Curran (19) and Adil Rashid (11 not out) pushed England past the 300-mark. No Smith again Australia was again without Steve Smith, the team management insisting that he was being rested purely as a precaution.   The scores: England 302/7 in 50 overs (Jonny Bairstow 112, Sam Billings 57, Chris Woakes 53 n.o., Mitchell Starc 3/74, Adam Zampa 3/51) vs Australia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bairstow-takes-england-to-302/article32625300.ece

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Bhakti and prapatti||The Supreme Brahman is the final goal of all who practise Bhakti yoga. Meditation on the Lord with total love and devotion continuously without getting distracted by the pulls of the world is the main characteristic of this yoga. Krishna explains that those who worship Him thus are very dear to Him and He becomes their saviour to release them from samsara. In a discourse, Asuri Sri Madhavachariar drew attention to the fact that prapatti or surrender to the Lord, like bhakti yoga, is also a sure means to moksha. Prapatti is the path for those who realise their inability to engage in the arduous demands of bhakti yoga. Prapatti is a complete, self-sufficient and direct sadana to moksha. The prapanna seeks the all powerful and compassionate Lord who alone can grant moksha. Prapatti is known as ‘nyasa’ vidya and it is mentioned in the Vedas. ‘Nyasa’ means entrusting someone or something to a reliable person. Prapatti is pledging oneself to God with the knowledge of one’s undying relationship with the Lord. This is the Sesha-Seshi bhava, where He alone is the Master and all else in creation is His possession. Prapatti has five ‘angas’ or distinguishing features. The prapanna has to have the firm commitment that he will do only what is ‘anukula,’ that is, abide by God’s wishes at all times and also refrain from ‘pratikula, that is, not do anything that will cause Him displeasure. Being fully aware that there is no way for him owing to his inabilities, insufficiencies and the enormous burden of karma and sin, he places total faith, ‘Maha vishwasa’ in the Lord to guide him out of samsara. This honest awareness of one’s own helplessness absolves him of any sense of ‘I’ and ‘Mine.’ The Lord out of His divine grace leads him out of samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/bhakti-and-prapatti/article32625256.ece

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Weddings 2. 0||The big fat Indian wedding hasbecome leaner, adapting to the new COVID-19 normal. While weddings have been taking place during Unlock 3.0 with up to 50 real-time guests, now Unlock 4.0 permits social gatherings with a ceiling of 100 guests. After months of lockdown, bookings are accelerating, with weddings bringing cheer to families, as well as the hospitality, fashion and textile sectors. Actors Prachi Trehan, Manish Raisinghani, Nikhil Siddhartha, Nithiin and Rana Daggubati, director Sujeeth and producer Dil Raju were among those who tied the knot in the last few months. In Bengaluru, weddings of former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy’s son and that of actor Nikhil Gowda were in the spotlight. There have been several other weddings, away from the celebrity cliques. Masked getaways Families now opt for toned down celebrations with fewer ceremonies, at hotels that promise to adhere to hygiene protocols. The norms include maintaining a registry of guest details, temperature checks, individual sanitiser bottles, fresh masks, frequent cleaning of touch points and restrooms, and distanced seating arrangements. Renu Basu, senior vice president, global sales and marketing IHCL (the parent company of Taj Hotels), states that among the Taj hotels, the properties in Rajasthan, Karnataka and Telangana were among the first to host weddings after lockdown. “Resorts and hotels at drivable distances from cities, for instance, Mahabalipuram from Chennai, Damdama, Rishikesh and Corbett from Delhi as well as the hotel in Nashik that’s a few hours from Mumbai are witnessing a significant number of social celebrations, including weddings,” she says. Grand Hyatt at Bolgatty Island, Kochi, has been hosting 10-12 weddings a month, says general manager Shrikant Wakharkar: “This is the peak season for weddings in Kerala and we abide by Government regulations to make people feel secure by providing a sanitised environment.” The Leela Goa is gearing up to host 15 destination weddings between October 2020 and April 2021. The families that have booked these weddings are from Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. General manager Shridhar Nair says the fear psychosis which loomed large in the early phase of the pandemic is waning: “People want to enjoy their special occasion while taking precautions. We will be offering Bureau Veritas (an inspection and certification company) certified sanitisation for the events.” In Delhi, Amaara Farms has been hosting weddings in its open-air venues. “When we hosted the first wedding after the long lockdown, there was a lingering fear; but the families soon began enjoying their special occasion. Enquiries are on the rise now. Most weddings we have hosted involve either the bride or the groom’s family from Delhi and others driving down to reach the venue,” says founder Shivan Gupta. He notes that there has been a shift in conversation, moving away from the ostentatious nature of the event to focus on safety and hygiene. Hotels now offer e-concierge and virtual tours of locations. The F&B services have also been tweaked. Guests are asked to keep their masks on while going to the buffet counters. A few properties offer pre-plated starters and main courses instead of buffets. Like many other sectors, the hospitality sector also bore the brunt as business plummeted during lockdown. To attract more guests, hotels stated that they are offering wedding packages at prices 10% to 20% lower than that of 2019. Sanitisation and hygiene come at no additional costs. Dressing up for Zoom Miriam Matthen who recently got married at the Hyatt Bolgatty Island talks with happiness when she recollects her wedding. Originally scheduled as a destination wedding in April 2020, lockdown forced the families to change plans four times and finally, she was glad that the ceremony could be organised in her home town. Friends and family participated in the celebrations via an online link. “Some of them even dressed up to keep with the celebratory mood,” she says. Masks in white and gold fabric that is synonymous with kasavu saris of Kerala, greeted the 50 guests at their flower-draped open-air venue, anchored by the hotel’s villas. When bridal couture spells luxury, the accompanying masks too have to look the part. Designers are busy making customised masks that match the ensembles, withzardoziand all finery. Masks with embroidery and embellishments that match the lehenga or sari, are now part of the trousseau. Samhita Gadde who got married mid-August at a resort on the outskirts of Hyderabad says her family and that of the groom were concerned that none of the invitees fall sick, having come across news reports of families testing positive after attending social gatherings. “We had a small gathering but booked a hall that would, in normal circumstances, accommodate 1,000 people,” she says. The pre-wedding ceremonies like the mehendi were held outdoors. Their initial plan, before the pandemic, was to have around 3,000 guests. “But the scaled-down celebration turned out to be fun; we could talk to all the guests. We had a live webcast for those whom we couldn’t invite,” she says. Bengaluru-based Nilma Dileepan, a wedding designer, has been organising weddings with small gatherings at venues as varied as backyards of homes to a presidential suite of a five-star hotel. “Around 75% of the people have cut down their budgets and millennials are enjoying the simple weddings that they always wanted. Sometimes the requests are for arrangements within Rs. 50,000 or a lakh of rupees. There’s more attention to masks, sanitisers, chair décor and other props. Couples are also open to mindful, sustainable choices like using local flowers in terracotta pots and chalk boards as opposed to flex boards,” she says. Bridal couture The fashion and textile industry which is still dealing with piles of pending stock from lockdown is also limping back in to action, thanks to weddings. In mid-July, Tarun Tahiliani showcased his bridal-festive collection ‘Pieces of You’ through a live fashion show on Instagram. Couturier JJ Valaya who recently launched his e-commerce portal notes that buyer interest is back. Valaya admits that many in the fraternity thought this year would be a washout and had decided to focus on the next season. But he was pleasantly surprised when the footfall at his stores showed an increase: “People are connecting through the video walk-through. I recently dressed-up a bride from Sri Lanka, whose wedding ensemble was decided and arranged for, online.”  VR-enabled weddings  Bengaluru-based firm LifeVR which provided the tech support for Rana Daggubati’s wedding, had facilitated a similar VR webcast of actor Venkatesh Daggubati’s daughter Aashritha’s wedding in 2019. For Rana’s wedding, guests were sent VR headsets with customised messages, an explanatory video and text instructions: “We sent them test links prior to the event,” says Abhilash Jain, technical director of LifeVR.  The company has so far enabled 300 VR weddings and Abhilash says, “VR is the future for sport, cinema and events but it’s still a niche segment. The pandemic is making a few more people consider the option.”   The firm will be hosting VR webcasts of weddings in Jaipur, Udaipur and other cities in the coming months. “When ceremonies are smaller with limited guests, the emotions can be captured better. For VR, it’s important to film in such a way that the viewers, while feeling like they are transported to the actual venue, do not feel dizzy watching through the headset,” adds Abhilash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/weddings-2-0/article32625156.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||A different league||What connects 92-year-old KSN Swami from Mumbai, 28-year-old Sonal Goyal from Biratnagar (Nepal) and 34-year-old Saravanan from Tiruvottiyur in Chennai? They are all die-hard fans of Chennai Super Kings. Like most other followers, they are impatiently waiting for Saturday, when their team takes on Mumbai Indians at the opening match in Abu Dhabi. This year’s IPL is being played under the most unique circumstances for both players and audiences; there will be no loud cheering from the stands, usually a highlight of the extravaganza. “It’s going to take a few games for everyone to get used to this new normal,” admits former Indian cricketer and commentator Deep Dasgupta, who is currently in the ‘bio bubble’ that the teams too are in, in the UAE. Wha is a ‘bio bubble’? “Let’s think of an actual bubble. Get a hotel inside it, get the ground inside it and that’s pretty much what it is. Before you get into this bubble, there’s a host of protocols and processes like testing and quarantine. For about 60 days, we will have the same people who’ll be serving us.” explains Deep, who goes on to pick CSK as the team that has a better chance of doing well due to their players’ experience. Ninety two-year-old Swami has already pasted the newspaper clipping of the IPL schedule on his cupboard. “I will be watching the matches with my son and granddaughters, who have evinced interest in the game after the introduction of IPL,” says Swami, who pits Chennai and Bangalore as teams to watch out for. The nonagenarian will be sporting a yellow T-shirt for the matches, in his residence at Chembur in Mumbai. Elsewhere, in the same city, 81-year-old Sharadambal Visweswaran will be draping a yellow sari and keenly anticipating the helicopter shot from MS Dhoni. “He’s my favourite,” she says. Celebrations have begun for for cricket fans of all ages... in front of the television sets at their homes. Grounded, but not out Although fans cannot congregate at Chennai’s Chepauk stadium this year, most of them are just thankful for the resumption of cricket after a long break. ‘Srini mama’ is one among them. “This will be the most competitive IPL, because the teams have had time to practise. That it is being played in the UAE nullifies the home advantage, and players will have little travel exhaustion,” says the cricket lover who prefers anonymity, and is the man behind the popular ‘@SriniMaama16’ handle which has more than 40k followers on Twitter and 14.5k on Instagram. He promises that his parody account, also popular with celebrities from the sporting fraternity, will be active in the coming weeks. “There will be analysis, strategies, kalaais (teasing)  and memes,” says Srini mama, and picks Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Hyderabad as the top four contenders for the coveted trophy. Prabhu Damodaran, one of the founders of CSK’s official fan club, the Whistle Podu Army, is also busy despite being forced to Cheer From Home. “We had made some special plans to do with the three stands that were earlier sealed but have now been reopened at Chepauk. But we know this is an unprecedented situation,” says Prabhu, who hails from Coimbatore. “We have sent T-shirts, CSK flags, some stickers and a couple of masks to the 2,000 active members to help them get ready.” Sonal Goyal, who manages the army’s social media pages, which has a following of over 1.5 million users, will be keeping track from Biratnagar. “A lot of us are planning to watch the games together via Zoom. We are planning to record some of the reactions and post them on social media pages,” she states. City trail The other city teams are not far behind. Dileep KM of the RCB Bold and Virat Gang pages, which have over a million followers on social media, is backing Bangalore and hoping for ‘ Ee Sala Cup Namde ‘ (This year, the Cup is ours). “Though I have been a supporter since 2012, I have never watched an RCB game from the stands. I was going to this year, but it looks like I have to watch it on TV again,” he rues. Mumbai Indians’ (MI) fan Vinesh Prabhu might also have to do the same. Vinesh watches at least five MI games at the Wankhede every season, but this year will be different. “My routine on match days used to be: have vadapav right outside the Churchgate station, buy a flag or get my face painted and head to the stadium. If we win, I go to a late night Mughlai food joint called Bade Miyan. And, if we lose, it’s usually ghar ka khaana .” This year, irrespective of the team you are supporting, the food, and the cricketing action, will very much be at home.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Free miles||It usually takes a day or, at best, a week for New Year’s resolutions to start cracking. Tushar Motwani, however, did the unthinkable. With 10 days to go for his birthday in December 2012, Tushar, and his friend Deepak Oberoi, resolved to run 10 kilometres a day. They have not stopped running since. Alongside Bhuvandeep Chowdhary, Tushar and Deepak are the co-founders of Mumbai-based Bombay Running, a strong community of runners that includes everybody from the average to the athletic. Tushar says that there are various chapters of the running community who stay connected on location-based WhatsApp groups and who commune for runs on all days of the week; some of the runners also take part in decentralised and/or unsanctioned races, like the do-it-yourself race, The Speed Project (TSP). Six runners of the Bombay Running community took part in this race earlier this month, which had participants from across the world run relay style. The target? Run as much distance as they can within a time limit of 31 hours and 15 minutes (which is the current record time set during a TSP run between Los Angeles and Las Vegas). Bombay Running’s Amit Lahekar, Anil Korvi, Aman Mehla, Manoj Rane, Priyanka Bhat and Payal Khanna ran 502.47 kilometres in the time afforded to them, which placed them third on the global list. “The idea of participating in TSP was to put Bombay Running and India on the global running map. A lot of people run for their own pride or to achieve the targets they set for self. With races like TSP, it is not something everyone can do because you need to get people together, train with them as a group and then participate,” says Tushar, over a Zoom call from Mumbai. The youngest of the six runners, 21-year-old Aman Mehla, only started in 2017, and took part in his first 3K run while in college. “It was a race for charity on Marine Drive. Pokémon GO was very popular at the time, and I ran the race to catch Pokémon on the circuit. I finished third,” he laughs. Unlike Aman, Amit Lahekar (28) was inspired to take up running when he came in contact with two marathoners at a book promotion event in Pune a few years ago. “I love sports but I couldn’t get far playing cricket and football. So I took to running wanting to fare better,” says Aman, who has now run a handful of marathons and even participated in the Bombay-Goa chase, an unsanctioned run similar to TSP. Helping them prepare for TSP was Daniel Vaz, head coach, Nike Run Club India. “It was hard to train during lockdown. Coach Dan gave us endurance training and gave us new workouts to help us add more speed and to survive the time. We used to train and do simulation runs from morning 5 am till 10 pm,” says Anil Korvi, adding that the team eventually set on the strategy of sprinting for three minutes before switching so that “the fatigue build-up isn’t as high” as compared to doing a 5K or marathon run. This also allowed individual runners the time to recover while their relay partners went on their sprints. What’s next for Bombay Running? “We came in third and we have now set the bar for others. For us, it will be about taking up newer challenges. The bottomline is about developing consistency and a habit. Even today, Deepak gives me a wake up call at 5 am and we go on a run together. It is about the community that we can build through our runs,” Tushar adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/free-miles/article32625159.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Recreating Pulp Fiction with Rekha||Imagine Rajinikanth as the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar, popping a cigarette in the hit TV series Narcos . Imagine how philosophical the conversation would end up being if Nallasivam (from Anbe Sivam ) and Forrest Gump (from Forrest Gump ) met. Imagine Scarface with MG Ramachandran mouthing the famous “I’m Tony Montana”. These bizarre yet original ideas are the offerings of the Instagram page Aesthetic Kunjamma (@aesthetic_kunjamma), managed and run by a team of eight artists whose innovative poster designs of vintage Malayalam and Tamil movies are gaining popularity on the Internet. Twenty-year-old Arun A was finding ways to satisfy his creative urge during lockdown. A student of Commerce, he started an Instagram page to celebrate the “good” and “retro” movies, particularly the kind he grew up on. He needed a name for the page and was stuck with ‘aesthetic’, wondering how the word is usually associated with beauty and texture. Over phone from Kochi, Arun explains how people do not conventionally associate old age with beauty, which is why he juxtaposed aesthetic with kunjamma (which means older lady, or aunty.) One his first designs, featuring Rajinikanth on the poster of Narcos , caught the attention of netizens and shot him to fame. Soon, he found like-minded artists — all in their 20s — who were interested in collaborating with him and now, they divide the work amongst themselves. Their designs are a blend of two worlds; a vintage movie character is superimposed over a Hollywood poster/magazine cover, or, in some cases, coloured/illustrated to leave a lasting impact. A recent one features an unseen photo of Kamal Haasan from Aval Appadithan interspersed with a poster of Into the Wild . There is also the illustration of Kumbalangi Nights with the backdrop of The Silence of the Lambs . A challenge they encounter often is the unavailability of high resolution photos of classics, such as the works of Satyajit Ray, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Padmarajan. “It is very difficult to find old movie posters, some of them have not been preserved. In some cases, photos were in bad quality and we ended up colouring them,” he explains, “Sometimes, we get an idea and work around it. If we find a rare and interesting photo of a movie/celebrity online, then we would take that image and come up with designs.” It is not just movie posters that the page is popular for. Their illustrations, too, have had a rippling effect on social media, especially the Grand Theft Malabar design featuring popular South Indian actors, amassing over 50k likes on Instagram alone. What pushed Arun into graphic design and subsequently creating Aesthetic Kunjamma, was the concept of Narcos feat Rajinikanth. “In the long run, I hope to establish a production house in our name,” says Arun, adding that they have worked on the title design for an upcoming anthology produced by Mani Ratnam, an upcoming movie for Amazon Prime Video by Gautham Menon, and a Tamil web series produced by Karthik Subbaraj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/recreating-pulp-fiction-with-rekha/article32625136.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||The longest hours||To what extent would you go for a seven-minute song? Chennai-based Ankith Gupta did what most musicians would not; spend 7,500 hours putting it together. The hip-hop artist, who is currently studying in Class XII at Sishya, is ready with a multi-language song titled ‘7500’, denoting the time he worked on it, spread across nine months. Based on the theme that music has no language, the song, which released on Wednesday on all leading musical platforms and on YouTube, covers 14 languages and has already bagged the certificate for a ‘song composed by an individual in maximum languages’ from the India Book of Records and Asia Book of Records. The song is the result of Ankith’s quest for artistes across the world to collaborate with. He narrowed in on 12 musicians, whose work he really liked. “When I looked at the names, it suddenly stuck me: ‘Why not use all of these 12 singers in a single song and make them sing in their native language?’” That question lingered and helped him conceive ‘7500’, featuring 14 languages including English, Arabic, Malayalam, German, Hindi, Bangla, Italian, Kannada, Swedish, Spanish, Tamil, Nepali, Jamaican, and Telugu. But the song would not have shaped the way it has now, had it not been for the pandemic, says Ankith. “Though the idea was conceived in November last year, I had little time, due to my regular school activities. Lockdown gave me that time.” Ankith has worked with international artistes like VAR!N, Almukhtar, Swat, Obeka, Loud Silence (Hindi and Bangla), Ilon (Italian and Jamaican), Yaaru, Filip Winther, Young S.C.O, King Sinister, Lay G and BFAB on this track. “I had to coordinate with all these artists across various time zones to communicate and execute. Though the song’s framework was ready, access to recording theatres for these artists was a huge challenge.” Ankith has been a hip-hop convert from the time he heard ‘Lollipop’ by Lil Wayne. “My main influences are international producers like Kanye West, Metro Boomin, Murda Beatz, DJ Khaled and Dr. Dre,” he says. Closer home, he regards AR Rahman and Hip-Hop Tamizha as musicians he looks up to. “My ambition is to showcase India on the hip-hop field,” says Ankith, who has 30 singles and EPs on music platforms and is planning a monthly release henceforth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-longest-hours/article32625138.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Etched in the past||At first glance, they are difficult to decipher. On a closer, second look, the dots, curves and the ‘akku’ unique to the Tamil script — albeit stylised — reveal themselves. In straight, thick lines, they are inscribed in a calligraphic style which is satisfyingly contemporary. And, interestingly, what lends content to this style is ancient Tamil literature: Avvaiyar’s 12th Century text, Aathichoodi , a collection of 109 single-line quotations arranged in alphabetical order that preaches everything from good habits to the importance of discipline. An avid reader of Tamil literature, Chennai-based artist Arvind Sundar draws a lot from ancient texts in his calligraphic practice. His lockdown interest has now evolved itself into an online design studio, Urue (which means, ‘to create’), which he runs along with photographer Mahesh Thiru. Urue strives to create a contemporary design space exclusively for Tamil literature. The studio’s upcoming project is a pack of playing cards demarcated by the four dynasties that ruled Tamil Nadu — namely, the Chola, Chera, Pandya and Pallava dynasties. The King, Queen and Jack cards of each suit will be illustrated as belonging to these dynasties. “The kings are portrayed in their war attire with the royal insignia, while the queens take up different roles pertaining to medicine, literature and battle. There will be two female Jacks and two male Jacks in each set,” says Arvind. The playing cards project is done in collaboration with designer Meena Priya from Shrishti College of Design. Urue hopes to get the decks in production by mid-October. “At the beginning of lockdown, I attended an online course (with a coupon provided by the college) on Islamic culture which had a chapter on the Quran . The chapter talked about how the Quran was written in a calligraphic style,” he says. This rekindled his interest in the ancient writing technique. “Then, I thought if I can copy an ancient text from Persia, why can’t I do it for our own language?” says the artist. This led to his exclusive work with Aathichoodi in Tamil calligraphy: but it does not involve just copying the verse. Design elements pertinent to the moral of each verse characterise the calligraphy. For example, in ‘Nandru Karudhu’ (which translates to ‘think/analyse well’), a verse from Puthiya Aathichoodi written by Subramania Bharati, the design finds itself enclosed in a more contemporary thought bubble. While reading about Aathichoodi and Avvaiyar Arvind realised the graphical quality of ancient Tamil literature: “If you take Avvaiyar, she speaks about ‘ nga pol valai’ . She says that bend like the letter ‘nga’ in front of elders. She is giving us a very symbolic expression of the letter itself,” says Arvind. This particular verse inspired his series on the Sangam Age. He writes ‘cholar’ by incorporating a tiger (emblem on the flag of Chola dynasty) motif, while ‘cherar’ is beautifully inscribed with the symbol of a bow that replaces ‘che’. He has also done an animal series in calligraphy featuring animals whose names are derived from Tamil literature.

17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||The world is ending, let’s make jokes||Stand-up comic Rabhinder Kannan, by his own admission, has not interacted with many human beings in the recent past (as is the case with most of us). And so, he tends to ramble on during phone calls and is well aware of it. So much so that, in this interview, he stops to clarify mid-chuckle: “In the afternoons, I talk a lot.” Not helping his case is his dog, Mowgli, who looks at him every morning with disdain at his lack of social life: “ It’s an all-new low.” This is why perhaps his first 60-minute special could not possibly have had a more appropriate title, — None of this Matters . The Chennai comic who is “31 and in strong denial”, released the special, adapted completely for an online audience, early in the month of September. It adopts a narrative style that strings together incidents from different points in time, in a format where jokes are built on the course and frequent punchlines take a backseat. The opening, however, is riddled with a few numbers that attempt to ease the audience into the show: but, are not devoid of cliches. Everything from why a Chennai boy has ‘Rabhinder’ for a name to the shift from a corporate life to an artistic pursuit and his “adventures” with Mowgli make passing appearances in None of this Matters . But, what is quite refreshing is the fact that towards the closing, the narrative deviates rather abruptly into dark humour rooted in realism. “I didn’t want it to be just 60 minutes of jokes. I wanted some bits of truth to be told.”  None of this Matters had been in the works for about eight months, though the idea of a special occurred to him almost two years back. “I wanted to launch sometime in March or April, but you know what happened. Now, I have 10 to 12 Zoom shows lined up and that gives me an opportunity to work on the material. So that, whenever the world resumes, I am ready with a tight script.” Each of the sets has been workshopped about 30 times. Those that made the cut were the ones that made sense for a Zoom setting. “I feel the audiences have got a place where they want to talk about the times we live in. Because, everyone knows what everyone is going through,” says Rabhinder. Though he says performing for an online audience is nowhere close to the experience of being on stage, on the positive side, it does enable less famous comics to get more stage time and reach wider audiences. “Comedy in Chennai has not had that for a while. Getting that much screen time has also forced us to come up with more content,” he adds. Rabhinder notes that there has been a steady increase in the number of people wanting to do comedy in the past few months, thanks to the online medium:“It’s like, the world is ending so we might aswell make some jokes!”  Tickets for the upcoming India shows (with Evam) on September 26 and October 3 are on insider.com.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-world-is-ending-lets-make-jokes/article32625144.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Weddings 2. 0||The big fat Indian wedding hasbecome leaner, adapting to the new COVID-19 normal. While weddings have been taking place during Unlock 3.0 with up to 50 real-time guests, now Unlock 4.0 permits social gatherings with a ceiling of 100 guests. After months of lockdown, bookings are accelerating, with weddings bringing cheer to families, as well as the hospitality, fashion and textile sectors. Actors Prachi Trehan, Manish Raisinghani, Nikhil Siddhartha, Nithiin and Rana Daggubati, director Sujeeth and producer Dil Raju were among those who tied the knot in the last few months. In Bengaluru, weddings of former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy’s son and that of actor Nikhil Gowda were in the spotlight. There have been several other weddings, away from the celebrity cliques. Masked getaways Families now opt for toned down celebrations with fewer ceremonies, at hotels that promise to adhere to hygiene protocols. The norms include maintaining a registry of guest details, temperature checks, individual sanitiser bottles, fresh masks, frequent cleaning of touch points and restrooms, and distanced seating arrangements. Renu Basu, senior vice president, global sales and marketing IHCL (the parent company of Taj Hotels), states that among the Taj hotels, the properties in Rajasthan, Karnataka and Telangana were among the first to host weddings after lockdown. “Resorts and hotels at drivable distances from cities, for instance, Mahabalipuram from Chennai, Damdama, Rishikesh and Corbett from Delhi as well as the hotel in Nashik that’s a few hours from Mumbai are witnessing a significant number of social celebrations, including weddings,” she says. Grand Hyatt at Bolgatty Island, Kochi, has been hosting 10-12 weddings a month, says general manager Shrikant Wakharkar: “This is the peak season for weddings in Kerala and we abide by Government regulations to make people feel secure by providing a sanitised environment.” The Leela Goa is gearing up to host 15 destination weddings between October 2020 and April 2021. The families that have booked these weddings are from Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. General manager Shridhar Nair says the fear psychosis which loomed large in the early phase of the pandemic is waning: “People want to enjoy their special occasion while taking precautions. We will be offering Bureau Veritas (an inspection and certification company) certified sanitisation for the events.” In Delhi, Amaara Farms has been hosting weddings in its open-air venues. “When we hosted the first wedding after the long lockdown, there was a lingering fear; but the families soon began enjoying their special occasion. Enquiries are on the rise now. Most weddings we have hosted involve either the bride or the groom’s family from Delhi and others driving down to reach the venue,” says founder Shivan Gupta. He notes that there has been a shift in conversation, moving away from the ostentatious nature of the event to focus on safety and hygiene. Hotels now offer e-concierge and virtual tours of locations. The F&B services have also been tweaked. Guests are asked to keep their masks on while going to the buffet counters. A few properties offer pre-plated starters and main courses instead of buffets. Like many other sectors, the hospitality sector also bore the brunt as business plummeted during lockdown. To attract more guests, hotels stated that they are offering wedding packages at prices 10% to 20% lower than that of 2019. Sanitisation and hygiene come at no additional costs. Dressing up for Zoom Miriam Matthen who recently got married at the Hyatt Bolgatty Island talks with happiness when she recollects her wedding. Originally scheduled as a destination wedding in April 2020, lockdown forced the families to change plans four times and finally, she was glad that the ceremony could be organised in her home town. Friends and family participated in the celebrations via an online link. “Some of them even dressed up to keep with the celebratory mood,” she says. Masks in white and gold fabric that is synonymous with kasavu saris of Kerala, greeted the 50 guests at their flower-draped open-air venue, anchored by the hotel’s villas. When bridal couture spells luxury, the accompanying masks too have to look the part. Designers are busy making customised masks that match the ensembles, withzardoziand all finery. Masks with embroidery and embellishments that match the lehenga or sari, are now part of the trousseau. Samhita Gadde who got married mid-August at a resort on the outskirts of Hyderabad says her family and that of the groom were concerned that none of the invitees fall sick, having come across news reports of families testing positive after attending social gatherings. “We had a small gathering but booked a hall that would, in normal circumstances, accommodate 1,000 people,” she says. The pre-wedding ceremonies like the mehendi were held outdoors. Their initial plan, before the pandemic, was to have around 3,000 guests. “But the scaled-down celebration turned out to be fun; we could talk to all the guests. We had a live webcast for those whom we couldn’t invite,” she says. Bengaluru-based Nilma Dileepan, a wedding designer, has been organising weddings with small gatherings at venues as varied as backyards of homes to a presidential suite of a five-star hotel. “Around 75% of the people have cut down their budgets and millennials are enjoying the simple weddings that they always wanted. Sometimes the requests are for arrangements within Rs. 50,000 or a lakh of rupees. There’s more attention to masks, sanitisers, chair décor and other props. Couples are also open to mindful, sustainable choices like using local flowers in terracotta pots and chalk boards as opposed to flex boards,” she says. Bridal couture The fashion and textile industry which is still dealing with piles of pending stock from lockdown is also limping back in to action, thanks to weddings. In mid-July, Tarun Tahiliani showcased his bridal-festive collection ‘Pieces of You’ through a live fashion show on Instagram. Couturier JJ Valaya who recently launched his e-commerce portal notes that buyer interest is back. Valaya admits that many in the fraternity thought this year would be a washout and had decided to focus on the next season. But he was pleasantly surprised when the footfall at his stores showed an increase: “People are connecting through the video walk-through. I recently dressed-up a bride from Sri Lanka, whose wedding ensemble was decided and arranged for, online.”  VR-enabled weddings  Bengaluru-based firm LifeVR which provided the tech support for Rana Daggubati’s wedding, had facilitated a similar VR webcast of actor Venkatesh Daggubati’s daughter Aashritha’s wedding in 2019. For Rana’s wedding, guests were sent VR headsets with customised messages, an explanatory video and text instructions: “We sent them test links prior to the event,” says Abhilash Jain, technical director of LifeVR.  The company has so far enabled 300 VR weddings and Abhilash says, “VR is the future for sport, cinema and events but it’s still a niche segment. The pandemic is making a few more people consider the option.”   The firm will be hosting VR webcasts of weddings in Jaipur, Udaipur and other cities in the coming months. “When ceremonies are smaller with limited guests, the emotions can be captured better. For VR, it’s important to film in such a way that the viewers, while feeling like they are transported to the actual venue, do not feel dizzy watching through the headset,” adds Abhilash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/weddings-2-0/article32625464.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Mimic to survive||During the first year of our nature trails back in 2016-17, when I pointed out Danaid Eggfly butterflies to people, we saw far more males than females. In time, I realised that not being able to see females was because they have a greater responsibility towards the survival of their species, while the male’s role is restricted to mating. For this reason, the Danaid Eggfly ( Hypolimnas misippus ) has an evolutionary adaptation. The females mimic (in appearance) the similar-sized Plain Tiger, a toxic butterfly with the toxic Milkweed as its host plant. The vibrant colours of the Plain Tiger advertise its unpalatable nature to predators around, so the Danaid female sends out the same signal, regardless of it not being toxic. This mimicking is called Batesian Mimicry, named after an English Naturalist, Henry Walter Bates for his work on butterflies. To aid this behaviour, the females also sometimes tend to move with plain tiger butterflies. There are very minute differences in appearance of the two butterflies. The males are elegant with the upperside black and large white oval discs on both wings, with yellowish brown undersides. They tend to fly higher and faster than the females, who prefer being close to the ground. When disturbed, the males quickly gain height to reach a tree branch, whereas females tend to move to nearby bushes. A scheduled butterfly protected under the Wildlife Protection Act of India, 1971, the Danaid Eggfly belongs to the largest family of butterflies, Nymphalidae. The butterflies in this family are also called Brush-footed Butterflies, where the forelegs (first pair of legs) are reduced in size and covered with long hair, much like brushes. Butterflies need both nectar-rich plants (like Periwinkle or Sadabahaar) as food sources as well as host plants (where they lay eggs) to survive. These butterflies are known to frequent urban parks and botanical gardens to feed on flowering plants, though they prefer open country, both scrubland and moist areas. When the females are ready to lay eggs, they look for host plants like the Philippine Violet ( Barleria cristata ), also commonly known as Vajra Danti in Hindi. The best time to see butterflies is when the sun is up and shining. The writer is the founder of NINOX - Owl About Nature, a nature-awareness initiative.

Closer home, he regards AR Rahman and Hip-Hop Tamizha as musicians he looks up to. “My ambition is to showcase India on the hip-hop field,” says Ankith, who has 30 singles and EPs on music platforms and is planning a monthly release henceforth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-longest-hours/article32625715.ece
17 September 2020||September 17 2020 00:00 IST,||Etched in the past||At first glance, they are difficult to decipher. On a closer, second look, the dots, curves and the ‘akku’ unique to the Tamil script — albeit stylised — reveal themselves. In straight, thick lines, they are inscribed in a calligraphic style which is satisfyingly contemporary. And, interestingly, what lends content to this style is ancient Tamil literature: Avvaiyar’s 12th Century text, Aathichoodi , a collection of 109 single-line quotations arranged in alphabetical order that preaches everything from good habits to the importance of discipline. An avid reader of Tamil literature, Chennai-based artist Arvind Sundar draws a lot from ancient texts in his calligraphic practice. His lockdown interest has now evolved itself into an online design studio, Urue (which means, ‘to create’), which he runs along with photographer Mahesh Thiru. Urue strives to create a contemporary design space exclusively for Tamil literature. The studio’s upcoming project is a pack of playing cards demarcated by the four dynasties that ruled Tamil Nadu — namely, the Chola, Chera, Pandya and Pallava dynasties. The King, Queen and Jack cards of each suit will be illustrated as belonging to these dynasties. “The kings are portrayed in their war attire with the royal insignia, while the queens take up different roles pertaining to medicine, literature and battle. There will be two female Jacks and two male Jacks in each set,” says Arvind. The playing cards project is done in collaboration with designer Meena Priya from Shrishti College of Design. Urue hopes to get the decks in production by mid-October. “At the beginning of lockdown, I attended an online course (with a coupon provided by the college) on Islamic culture which had a chapter on the Quran . The chapter talked about how the Quran was written in a calligraphic style,” he says. This rekindled his interest in the ancient writing technique. “Then, I thought if I can copy an ancient text from Persia, why can’t I do it for our own language?” says the artist. This led to his exclusive work with Aathichoodi in Tamil calligraphy: but it does not involve just copying the verse. Design elements pertinent to the moral of each verse characterise the calligraphy. For example, in ‘Nandru Karudhu’ (which translates to ‘think/analyse well’), a verse from Puthiya Aathichoodi written by Subramania Bharati, the design finds itself enclosed in a more contemporary thought bubble. While reading about Aathichoodi and Avvaiyar Arvind realised the graphical quality of ancient Tamil literature: “If you take Avvaiyar, she speaks about ‘ nga pol valai’ . She says that bend like the letter ‘nga’ in front of elders. She is giving us a very symbolic expression of the letter itself,” says Arvind. This particular verse inspired his series on the Sangam Age. He writes ‘cholar’ by incorporating a tiger (emblem on the flag of Chola dynasty) motif, while ‘cherar’ is beautifully inscribed with the symbol of a bow that replaces ‘che’. He has also done an animal series in calligraphy featuring animals whose names are derived from Tamil literature.

17 September 2020||New Delhi,||Capital hits a new high with daily COVID-19 count touching 4,473||The Capital on Wednesday witnessed the highest COVID-19 tally with 4,473 cases being reported in the past 24 hours. Delhi also saw the second highest number of daily tests — 62,593 — on Wednesday, according to Delhi government’s health bulletin. Of the total 2,30,269 cases, 1,94,516 people have recovered and there are 30,914 active cases. Also, 33 more deaths were reported, swelling the death count to 4,839. Out of the total 14,521 beds available for COVID-19 treatment, 53.2% were vacant, as per government data on Wednesday. But 60.8% of the ICU beds with ventilators have been occupied and 65.4% of the ICU beds without ventilators are full. Taking the crisis into consideration, the government has declared 100 beds each for COVID-19 treatment in government-run Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, according to an official order. “In view of the pandemic, to augment the availability of beds for COVID-19 patients in NCT of Delhi, Government of NCT of Delhi has decided to declare the following hospitals as designated COVID hospitals partially for admitting confirmed/suspected cases in addition to the already designated COVID hospitals,” an order issued on Tuesday by the Delhi government read. Rate spike The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) has slightly gone up to 7.1% from 6.8%. The number of containment zones jumped to 1,637, the highest so far. Health Minister Satyendar Jain told the media that positivity rate has decreased from 8% last week to 6.8%. The death rate of last one week is 0.71%. “Scientists told me that in some people antibodies are less and in some, antibodies decrease after a few months. But memory cells remain in the body and if reinfection occurs, they trigger and won’t let it [disease] happen,” explained Mr. Jain about antibodies not being found in some people who were tested positive for the virus. On Tuesday, The Hindu had reported that according to the second serological survey done in August by the Delhi government, 30% of the 257 people who had recovered from COVID-19 and tested for antibodies against the virus did not have any trace of it. But experts said there was no need to “panic” as the neutralising antibodies (IgG) tend to vanish after three months. But in most cases the memory cells will remember the virus and trigger an immune response if the person, who recovered from COVID-19, is again attacked by the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/capital-hits-a-new-high-with-daily-covid-19-count-touching-4473/article32625477.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||Environment Minister offers solution for stubble burning||Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said that the government will give farmers a product developed by Pusa Agriculture Institute, which can turn stubble into manure to avoid stubble burning without any expense. The product, in the form of capsules, has to be mixed in water and sprayed on straw to decompose it. “I met the Director of Pusa Agricultural Institute, who said they have developed a technology that can turn stubble into manure, which can be used on the fields. Today, I am here to see its demonstration. We have also invited some farmers to witness it. The cost of spraying it on the fields will be borne by the Delhi government so that there is no financial burden on the farmers and an effective solution to stubble burning can be developed,” Mr. Rai said. The Minister said he will also get in touch with the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab based on the results so that the model can be implemented in those States as well to ease the financial burden on the farmers and reduce air pollution. “We will speak to both the Central government as well as the States. Union Environment Ministry has a very important role to play in this initiative. We will create a proper strategy after discussion with the Chief Minister,” Mr. Rai added. A Delhi government official said that the capsules mixed in water will be sprayed on stalks that are left behind from the harvester, but the shorter stubble that sticks to the ground even after cutting the crop will have to be managed separately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/environment-minister-offers-solution-for-stubble-burning/article32625475.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||Court tells Delhi govt. to focus on shoring up RT-PCR testing capacity||The High Court on Wednesday directed the Delhi government to focus on shoring up the capacity of testing through RT-PCR, noting that results of the tests conducted through RAT are accurate only to the extent of 60%. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said, “We are of the firm view that RT-PCR should be the way forward”. “The results of the tests conducted through RAT are accurate only to the extent of 60% thus leaving a great doubt about infection being carried by those persons who are asymptomatic,” the Bench said, directing the Delhi government to ‘substantially’ scale up testing through RT-PCR. It directed an expert committee constituted by Lt. Governor to identify the areas of focus in Delhi for conducting testing through RT-PCR. The court also directed the government not to declare the sero surveillance-3 report till its analysis vis-a-vis the previous two sero surveillances is finalised and placed on record before the court. Delhi government’s additional standing counsel (ASC) Satyakam stated that the sero surveillance-3 results are still being compiled and more time will be required to finalise the report. In response to the High Court direction, Delhi government said it will implement the orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-tells-delhi-govt-to-focus-on-shoring-up-rt-pcr-testing-capacity/article32625469.ece
17 September 2020||New Delhi,||‘Slum dwellers along railway tracks can be rehabilitated in 40,000 flats’||Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday wrote to Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and said that 48,000 shanties along Delhi railway tracks can be rehabilitated in 40,000 flats, which are in the city, and offered full cooperation for their rehabilitation. “The Delhi government also has more than 40,000 flats, out of which some are ready and some will be ready soon. These flats can also be used if needed, and the Delhi government had also written a letter to the railways last week in this regard. But these flats are located on the outskirts of Delhi. These flats can be given to slum dwellers who live in areas that do not have vacant land around and who cannot be provided houses under ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahin Makaan’ policy,” Mr. Jain wrote. “I am very happy that the Central government lawyer said in the Supreme Court that the Delhi government, the Centre, and the railways will prepare a plan in this regard. On behalf of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Delhi government, I assure full support and cooperation in our efforts to provide shelter to the poor people,” he added. Mr. Jain said that a detailed plan has to be created to find out where every slum is to be built. “We will cooperate fully with you in formulating these policies, and the Delhi government can make these plans and give it to you if you need it,” the letter read. He said that they must now find land around every slum area where pucca houses can be built for the slum dwellers. “It will require the cooperation of all government agencies. The support of the agency to which the land belongs to will also be required,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/slum-dwellers-along-railway-tracks-can-be-rehabilitated-in-40000-flats/article32625473.ece
