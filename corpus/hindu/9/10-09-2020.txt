10 September 2020||New Delhi,||Massive Chinese build-up on north bank of Pangong lake||As Indian troops are engaged in a stand-off on the south bank of Pangong Tso (lake) for the past week, a massive build-up had again begun in the Finger area of the north bank, a senior government official told The Hindu . The ground commanders met on Wednesday to resolve the stalemate but it remained inconclusive. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had occupied the ridge lines and amassed troops on the north bank, where Fingers 4-8 are located, the official said. There was a worrying concentration of troops on both sides, with China dominating the area, the official noted. The development comes a day before the Foreign Ministers of both countries are expected to meet in Moscow on the sidelines of a meeting of the eight-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). As reported, China has ingressed about 8 km in the Finger area of the north bank. India has not been able to patrol beyond Finger 4 since April last week when China amassed troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Earlier, Indian troops could patrol up to Finger 8. Several rounds of meetings at the military and diplomatic levels have not yielded any results. China partially retreated to Finger 5 and as per the agreement, Indian troops were pulled back to Finger 2. ‘China dominating area’ “China is dominating the ridges in the Finger area of Pangong Tso for the past four months. Since last evening, it has rushed additional forces. We have had no option but to match the presence,” said the official. The build-up on the north bank comes even as the attention has shifted to areas south of the lake, where for the past week, the Indian Army has been dominating the ridges and hills in the Chushul area. For the first time in 45 years, aerial shots were fired along the disputed LAC. The Indian Army said on Tuesday that Chinese troops fired some rounds in the air on September 7, as they attempted to close in on one of India’s forward positions and “intimidate” troops deployed there to dislodge them. Brigade Commander-level talks were held at Chushul on Wednesday in the wake of Monday’s firing incident which, a defence source said, were routine ground-level talks to de-escalate the situation. Both sides agreed to hold another round of Corps Commander-level talks, for which the date was yet to be finalised, the source added. China has repeated its accusations of India firing first. A Chinese source said that during the talks, both sides agreed that there should not be further incidents of firing. Tensions have been high since August 29, when Chinese troops engaged in “provocative action” trying to change the status quo on the south bank, which forced India to take pre-emptive moves. India has since occupied the key heights in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/massive-chinese-build-up-on-north-bank-of-pangong-lake/article32566447.ece

The 33-year-old actor, who hails from Himachal Pradesh, landed in the city from Chandigarh in the afternoon. She took to Twitter and said, “My office was suddenly declared illegal in last 24 hours, they have destroyed everything inside... and now I am getting threats they will come to my house and break it as well, I am glad my judgement of movie mafia’s favourite world’s best CM was right.” In a video addressed to the CM, she said: “Uddhav Thackeray, what do you think, you along with film mafia have taken revenge by demolishing my house? Today, you broke my house, tomorrow your arrogance will crumble. Thus is the wheel of time, never constant.” Meanwhile, the actor received relief from the Bombay High Court, which stayed the demolition.  ‘Unauthorised move’ The court said, “From the notice, it is clear beyond any doubt that the works which are ‘unauthorised’ have not come up overnight. However, all of a sudden, the Corporation appears to have overnight woken up from its slumber, issued Notice to the Petitioner (Ms. Ranaut), that too when she is out of the State, directing her to respond within 24 hours, and not granting her any further time, despite written request, and proceeding to demolish the said premises upon completion of 24 hours.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-stops-demolition-of-house-kangana-lands-in-mumbai/article32566437.ece

10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||17 policemen die of COVID, no relief to kin yet||Delhi Police has lost 17 of its personnel to COVID-19 in the last four months but none of their families has received the Rs. 1 crore ex gratia announced by the Delhi government, The Hindu has learnt. Commissioner of Police S.N. Shrivastava confirmed that the 17 families are still awaiting compensation from the government even though most of their files have been submitted by the police to the Revenue Department. “We have already sent the proposals and I understand that their examination is at an advanced stage. We are awaiting their response. We have been pursuing the proposals that we sent,” he said, adding that some of the proposals were recent and the queries raised by the government had been replied to as well. A Delhi government spokesperson said, “We are yet to receive all the papers from the Delhi police. We have requested them to submit it so that the compensation can be disbursed at the earliest.” A government order dated May 13 stated that if any person, including sanitation workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics, police personnel and other government officer/official, deployed on COVID-19 duty dies of the infection, he/she  shall be paid an ex gratia of Rs. 1 crore. Speaking to The Hindu , Pawan Kumar, son of Assistant Sub-Inspector Karambir Singh, said he spoke to officers in the police department about 10 days ago regarding the compensation and was told that the file has already been processed. Karambir died of complications related to COVID-19 on June 9 after spending a week in hospital. Mr. Pawan said his sister and mother are now dependent on him. He used to work as a helper in the railways in Mumbai and had returned to Delhi because of the COVID-19 outbreak.  ‘Dependent on savings’ “We have received the compensation from Delhi Police Welfare Society but not from the government. How long will the savings last?” he said. “I am concerned about my sister and mother but I will have to go back [to Mumbai] to earn for them.” Aakash Borghare (28), son of Sub-Inspector Ram Lal Borghare who died on June 3, said they haven’t heard anything about the compensation yet. Mr. Aakash, who holds a diploma in electronics, works with a private firm in Panchkula. “My younger brother is a graduate. He has applied for a position in Delhi Police in place of our father. My mother is a housewife. I am supporting them with my salary,” he said. The family of constable Amit Kumar, who was the first Delhi policeman to succumb to COVID-19 on May 5, has been waiting for the compensation for four months. His wife Pooja, five months pregnant, is taking care of their three-year-old son. “I have made so many calls and met officials in person too. The police department says it has processed the file. I don’t know about its status now,” said Ms. Pooja’s brother Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/17-policemen-die-of-covid-no-relief-to-kin-yet/article32566622.ece

10 September 2020||New Delhi,||SII pulled up for not pausing vaccine trial||The Drug Controller of India has demanded that the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune, which is conducting Phase-3 trials on people in India involving U.K.-based AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, explain why tests have not been paused in India too until safety has been established. AstraZeneca on late Tuesday put global trials on hold after reports emerged of “severe adverse reaction” in a volunteer being injected with the vaccine, probably in the United Kingdom. The nature of the event was not known. This pause would prevail, pending a review by a data safety monitoring board, AstraZeneca said in a statement in response to medical news website, Stat News. Pune-based SII, which is testing a COVID-19 vaccine, said on Wednesday that so far there had been “no issues” with its trials. “It has been widely reported in the national and international media that sponsor of the aforesaid vaccine, M/s AstraZeneca has paused the ongoing trial as a volunteer developed an unexplained illness....Serum has not informed the Central Licensing Authority regarding pausing the clinical trial and also not submitted causality analysis of the reported severe adverse event,” said a letter signed by Dr.V.G. Somani, Drug Controller General (India), “I [Somani] give you an opportunity to showcause why permission granted to you should not be suspended till patient safety established.”  The Hindu has viewed this letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sii-pulled-up-for-not-pausing-vaccine-trial/article32566444.ece
10 September 2020||MANGALURU,||Stranded for two nights in a turbulent sea, fisherman brought home safely||It was a virtual rebirth for a 47-year-old fisherman Arthur Sunil Coelho from Mangaluru on the day of Monthi Fest (Virgin Mary festival) when he reached Malpe Fishing Harbour on Tuesday morning after spending two nights on a dinghy amid a deep and turbulent Arabian Sea alone. A resident of Ullal Hoige off Mangaluru on the southern banks of the Netravathi, Mr. Coelho got onto Falcon, a purse seine fishing vessel, along with about 30 fishermen at the Mangaluru Fishing Harbour early on Sunday. When the vessel was in deep sea by afternoon, he got onto the dinghy trailing the vessel to spread a fishing net, along with three other fishermen. By evening, they had finished spreading the net when the sea became turbulent with heavy rain and wind. While the three fishermen boarded the mother vessel, Mr. Coelho stayed on the dinghy saying that he would not be able to disembark the main vessel once again to remove the net owing to his advancing age. At the same time, the mother vessel had developed a technical snag with most of the fishermen huddled inside the engine room to restart the engine, according to Mr. Coelho’s elder son Sachin Jeevan Coelho. Meanwhile, the rope drawn from the mother vessel to the dinghy snapped due to rough winds. And, Mr. Coelho could not catch a rescue rope thrown to him by a fellow fisherman from the main vessel. Soon, he was left stranded in deep sea. Though the mother vessel was repaired by Monday morning, it could not locate Mr. Coelho whose dinghy was drifting aimlessly. “With no food or water onboard, my father collected rainwater in plastic bottles to survive. Though he was sure the dinghy won’t sink, he was apprehensive of other vessels hitting him during the night traffic,” Mr. Jeevan Coelho said, even as his father was recouping from trauma at home on Wednesday. Finally, Seagull, a deep sea fishing boat returning to Malpe Fishing Harbour in neighbouring Udupi district, noticed the dinghy and Mr. Coelho before taking him aboard and offering him the much-needed food and water. He was brought to Malpe on Tuesday morning and Mr. Coelho reached home by afternoon. Mr. Jeevan Coelho said that only divine intervention saved his father as, otherwise, there were fewer chances of his survival in the deep and turbulent sea.  ‘Only divine intervention saved my father as, otherwise, there were fewer chances of his survival in the deep and turbulent sea,’ says his son||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stranded-for-two-nights-in-a-turbulent-sea-fisherman-brought-home-safely/article32566686.ece

Sengottaiyan in Gobichettipalayam on Wednesday. Addressing mediapersons, he said the vacation would help students refresh and added that consent had been obtained from Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for declaring holidays. The Minister said that all the schools, including the ones run by private institutions, would be monitored to check whether classes were conducted during the five days. Asked about the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issuing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for partial reopening of schools for students of Classes 9 to 12, the Minister said only after the COVID-19 situation changed in the State, a decision would be taken. In an official statement issued on Wednesday evening, the Minister said some schools had started online classes from June and that quarterly holidays were generally scheduled in September. “The school education department announces this as a quarterly break and no online classes will take place during this time,” his statement read. The Minister once again reiterated that as per the guidelines issued for conducting online classes, attendance was not compulsory for students. “As per the guidelines, teachers should take the responsibility for students who weren’t able to attend classes and ensure that they are suitably coached once schools reopen,” he said. He also pointed out that while assessments and assignments can be done online, none of these should be mandatory. Nor should they be counted for their performance evaluation. Several schools that had scheduled a term break in October to coincide with Navarathri, will now reschedule it to September end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-online-classes-from-sept-21-to-25/article32566532.ece

10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Crucial meeting for Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday in Moscow. The meeting is expected to lay the ground for further engagements scheduled for Thursday on the sidelines of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Following his meeting with Mr. Lavrov, he said, “Pleasure to meet Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, this time in person. Excellent talks that reflect our special and privileged strategic partnership. Value our exchanges on the international situation.” The pandemic had prevented physical meeting among diplomats and the SCO summit and the bilaterals are the first such interactions of the Foreign Ministers of the grouping in this circumstance. Mr. Jaishankar is scheduled participate in the Council of Foreign Ministers of SCO on Thursday. A statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said the meeting will begin shortly after midday. On the sidelines of the meeting, he is likely to engage his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi for a discussion on the tense situation in LAC. The gathering is being keenly watched as it is the first time the Chinese and the Indian Foreign Ministers will come face to face in the backdrop of the evolving tense situation in Eastern Ladakh. Spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Xhao Lijian said Mr. Wang’s agenda in the coming few days includes both bilateral and multilateral engagements. That apart, a separate meeting of the Russia, India and China grouping is also expected on Thursday where Eastern Ladakh is likely to figure prominently. Russian engagements with India and China have indicated that Moscow is playing a subtle role in controlling the situation along the LAC. However, Russian officials based in Delhi have maintained that Moscow is building positive circumstances to resolve international disputes. Mr. Jaishankar, who held talks in Tehran on Tuesday during a stop over to Moscow, is on a four-day visit to the Russian capital for the SCO ministerial and bilaterals. Earlier on Wednesday, he met his Tajikistan and Kyrgyz counterparts Sirojiddin Muhuriddin and Chingiz Aidarbekov.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crucial-meeting-for-jaishankar/article32566408.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Centre asks States to conduct free virus test for migrants||The States and the Union Territories have been advised by the Union Labour and Employment Ministry to organise free COVID-19 testing for migrant workers as well as to maintain a database of all workers moving out of their States. The Ministry on Tuesday released its guidelines to the States “for the welfare of migrant workers returning to destination States in the backdrop of COVID-19”. The 18-point advisory says that the States and the UTs may nominate a State-level nodal officer as well as district/block/tehsil-wise nodal officers for migrant workers. “The government(s) of the State of origin and destination State should ensure screening and testing of migrant workers as per the protocol devised by the Ministry of Health and family Welfare in respect of COVID-19. Further, the migrant worker should not be put to any financial burden on account of testing and any treatment/quarantine required to be undertaken by them,” it says. ‘Give masks, sanitisers’ The States and the UTs were asked to provide face masks, hand sanitisers and soaps to the workers when screening them before they leave for their destination States. “A proper database of migrant workers is a preliminary step to identify and protect the vulnerable among them,” the guidelines say. The States of origin should collect the data and share with the destination States. All migrant workers should be enrolled in the Central and State governments’ welfare schemes. Building and other construction workers’ welfare boards in the States should be “advised to incur the expenditure on account of payment of the premium for insurance schemes” for construction workers. The States should make sure there was no adverse impact on the education of the workers’ children. The guidelines come as workers are returning to cities after having left in the wake of the lockdown implemented in March. Chandan Kumar, national coordinator of the Working People’s Charter, which works to highlight the concerns of the unorganised sector, said the guidelines seemed to be “ad hoc”. “I’m very sure that the States are not prepared. Neither do the States have the capacity nor the human and financial resources to implement the advisory,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-asks-states-to-conduct-free-virus-test-for-migrants/article32566416.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||NEET on schedule as SC refuses to intervene||The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to the undergraduate medical course will be held on schedule on September 13, with the Supreme Court on Wednesday refusing to intervene in various petitions seeking its postponement to providing facilities for candidates. One of the petitions, represented by advocate Shoeb Alam, even sought the use of admit cards as curfew passes in the COVID-19 containment zones. He said a “slight nudge” from the court would go a long way to ensure the safety of lakhs of candidates across the country. Senior advocate K.T.S. Tulsi urged the court to postpone the exam, saying the virus infection count was steadily climbing and had reached 90,000 a day. Senior advocate Arvind Datar said States such as Bihar had only two exam centres. Aspirants had to journey miles, exposing themselves and others to infection. But the court said it would not be possible for the authorities to conduct NEET, which requires to be held simultaneously across the country, on different dates in different States. ‘Precautions taken’ “The authorities have taken all precautions,” the Bench said. The court reasoned that problems would not die by changing dates. Whatever date was fixed, there might be some difficulty. Mr. Alam said his petitioner was not seeking a quashing of the NEET but only for facilities to be provided to students. Mr. Datar sought a postponement by three weeks, but the court declined. The court recently heard a review plea filed jointly by Ministers from six non-BJP-ruled States against the conduct of the JEE Mains and the NEET-UG amid the pandemic. The JEE was conducted between September 1 and 6. On August 17, the court refused to entertain a petition by students to postpone the NEET and the JEE citing the pandemic after recording the exam authorities’ assurance that all necessary precautions will be taken to keep safe the candidates, who run into lakhs. “Education should be opened up. COVID-19 may continue for a year more. Are you going to wait for another year. Do you know what is the loss to the country and the career peril to the students?” the court had asked the petitioners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neet-on-schedule-as-sc-refuses-to-intervene/article32566429.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||JD(U) looks to Mahadalit votes||The Supreme Court’s ruling in late August that Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) do not constitute a homogenous group and may be considered for sub-categorisation by the States for the purpose of reservation is likely to play a role in the coming Bihar Assembly polls. The ruling, by a five-judge Bench led by now retired judge Arun Mishra, is being seen by the Janata Dal(U) as an endorsement of the Nitish Kumar government’s policies of Mahadalit sub-categorisation. The order has created grounds for revisiting earlier judgements on treating SCs as a homogenous category, and the sanctity of the Presidential List. Bihar Minister Sanjay Jha said the top court’s ruling endorsed Mr. Kumar’s more than a decade-long policy of sub-categorisation of Mahadalits among Dalits. “This ruling recognises what Nitish Kumar has been saying all this while on sub-categorisation and uneven access to resources within the reserved categories. The Mahadalit community associates itself with Nitish Kumar ji as he was the first to highlight their plight vis a vis reservations,” he stated. The JD(U) will be playing up the sub-categorisation ruling during the polls and consider it one of the triumphs of the social policy followed by Mr. Kumar’s government. Mr. Jha pointed out that apart from sub-categorisation, Mr. Kumar was also instrumental in making a Mahadalit the Chief Minister — a reference to Jiten Ram Manjhi of the Hindustan Awam Morch (HAM), which recently rejoined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The sub-categorisation ruling comes at an interesting point in seat adjustment talks within the NDA, with the Ram Vilas Paswan-led Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP), which claims the support of Dalit communities in the State, champing at the bit within the alliance in the run-up to polls. LJP’s view LJP parliamentary board leader Chirag Paswan has written a letter to Mr. Kumar, protesting what he termed the undermining of the Dalit community under the latter’s government. This evoked a sharp reaction from JD(U) general secretary K.C. Tyagi. He said Mr. Kumar’s government did not require a certificate on Dalit welfare from “anyone”. While Mr. Jha did not comment on the LJP’s recent statements questioning aspects of Mr. Kumar’s leadership, others in the JD(U) said the latter’s support base among Mahadalits was a sore point. “The Tola Sewak scheme and the special provisions for Mahadalits are important contributions of this government to social justice,” said Mr. Jha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jdu-looks-to-mahadalit-votes/article32566402.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. will ease problems of poor: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the government was working on a new digital transaction platform for street vendors in the wake of the pandemic. Mr. Modi addressed street vendors in Madhya Pradesh who got loans through the PM Street Vendors AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi), a micro credit scheme launched by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry in June. Under the scheme, street vendors badly hit by the pandemic and lockdown can get loans up to Rs. 10,000 to restart their work. The Prime Minister also interacted with three of the beneficiaries via videoconferencing. He said whenever there was a crisis, it was the poor who bore the brunt, which is why the government was focused on easing their problems now. As customers preferred digital transactions over cash due to the pandemic, street vendors should move towards digital transactions. Citing the example of restaurants that take orders and deliver through apps, the Prime Minister noted that street food vendors could also carry out their business online. The government would come up with a platform for street vendors to transact digitally. Under the PM SVANidhi scheme, which is part of the Centre’s AtmaNirbhar Bharat package, he said street vendors had access to easy capital. “The scheme helps one get rid of interest completely. Under this scheme, interest rebate of up to 7% is being given anyway. A new beginning has been made in collaboration with banks and digital payment facilitators to ensure that our street vendors do not lag behind in digital shopkeeping,” he stated. Chat with beneficiaries Earlier in the event, Mr. Modi spoke to three beneficiaries from Madhya Pradesh, which accounts for 4.5 lakh of the total 10 lakh registrations for the scheme. Since its launch on June 1, just over 1 lakh loans have been disbursed. Chagan Lal, who makes and sells brooms in Indore, told the Prime Minister: “After the lockdown, my business was completely destroyed. Since our work depends on us going from lane to lane and we could not move out during the lockdown, I had to face many problems.” He said he took loans from family members to be able to make ends meet. Now, with the Rs. 10,000 loan, he repaid the previous loans and bought materials to restart his work. Mr. Modi remarked that he spotted a plastic water bottle near Mr. Chagan Lal’s pushcart and advised him to replace it with an earthen potHe also urged Mr. Lal to recycle the “pipe” portion of the brooms. Archana Sharma, who runs a food stall in Gwalior, said her business stopped during the lockdown, but she was able to restart using the Rs. 10,000 loan. Dalchand Kushwaha, A vegetable vendor in Raisen, told the Prime Minister that his income had taken a hit during the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-will-ease-problems-of-poor-pm/article32566424.ece
10 September 2020||KOCHI,||Drug case accused helped gold smugglers, claims ED||Investigations by the Narcotics Control Bureau have revealed that the accused in the Bengaluru drugs case has assisted the accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has informed a trial court. In a separate development, the ED officials interrogated Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, in connection with the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case and the recent Bengaluru drugs seizure for more than 10 hours on Wednesday. ‘High-profile individual’ The agency submitted before the Economic Offences Court that it was interrogating a high-profile individual in connection with the gold smuggling and drug cases. It was in its application seeking the extension of the remand of Swapna Suresh and others in the money laundering case that the agency made the revelation. The agency informed the court that more than 20 persons who were involved in the gold smuggling case were to be interrogated regarding the money laundering case registered by it. The Narcotics Control Bureau has requested the ED to share the information in the gold smuggling case with it, the agency submitted. Mr. Kodiyeri appeared at the Kochi office around 10 a.m. on a notice from the agency. The agency was probing whether Mr. Kodiyeri was involved in aiding the accused in both the cases. One of the accused in the drugs case had reportedly stated that Mr. Kodiyeri had provided him financial aid. Mr. Kodiyeri, later, explained that it was a loan for opening a restaurant in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drug-case-accused-helped-gold-smugglers-claims-ed/article32566386.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Court stays Maratha quota, sends plea to Statute Bench||A three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday referred a group of petitions challenging the Maratha reservation law to a Constitution Bench. The Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao found merit in the arguments made by senior lawyers that a larger Bench should examine the issue of reservation for the Maratha community. Chief Justice S.A. Bobde will constitute the Bench. PG entry unaltered The court said the Maratha quota, meanwhile, will not apply for admissions and appointments made in the State for 2020-21. However, the postgraduate admissions which have already been made will be left unaltered. The court gave the petitioners the liberty to seek an early hearing. The three-judge Bench led by Justice Rao had reserved orders on pleas to refer the case to a larger Bench. Some of the senior lawyers had even sought the formation of an 11-judge Bench to re-consider the judicial law of 50% cap on reservations in appointments and admissions. The appeals challenging the Maratha quota law contend that the statute provides 12 to 13% quota for the community in Maharashtra. This has breached the 50% cap declared by a nine-judge Bench of the apex court in 1992. The court heard detailed arguments of senior advocates like Kapil Sibal, Mukul Rohatgi and Gopal Sankaranarayanan for various parties in the case. Mr. Sibal had reasoned that 28 States had already granted reservation exceeding 50% to their respective Backward Classes. Lawyers had submitted that the court should take into consideration recent developments like the 10% quota for economically weaker sections introduced through the 103rd Constitutional Amendment. The petitioners have claimed that the Maharashtra government has passed the quota law to make a mockery of the rule of law. They accused the State of using its constitutional powers arbitrarily for political gains. They said the Act overstepped the constitutional limitations contained in the 102nd Amendment to the Constitution. The Amendment said reservation can be granted only if a particular community is named in the Presidential list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-stays-maratha-quota-sends-plea-to-statute-bench/article32566400.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Israel in trade talks with India, China||Israel hopes that tensions between India and China will ease and it is in talks with both countries on trade agreements, according to an Israeli official. While India and Israel were negotiating a limited trade deal for about 200 designated products, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with South Korea, China and Vietnam were under way. Israel also planned to discuss India-United Arab Emirates (UAE)-Israel cooperation in a number of areas such as agriculture, technology and water once the UAE-Israel agreement is formally signed in Washington on September 15, the official said. “We have good relations with India and China,” Gilad Cohen, Deputy Director General of the Asia Pacific division in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told journalists at a special briefing when asked about the four-month stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), “We hope all tensions will be sorted out peacefully and the situation will [ease] soon,” he said. Last month, the Israeli Foreign Ministry inaugurated its first “Asia-Pacific Day,” hosting 11 Asian countries, including India, at a special event, with a view to increasing trade and investment with the ‘East’ as a key priority for post COVID-19 economic recovery. China, Hong Kong and India are Israel’s biggest trading partners in Asia. Since both China and India established full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992, China’s trade has increased from $50 million to $15 billion, while India’s trade has grown from $200 million to about $5 billion. “Our most advanced negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement are with [South] Korea at present,” Mr. Cohen said, listing the agreements being discussed. “We hope this will be completed soon, and then in 2021, we will finalise agreements with China and Vietnam,” he noted. While India and Israel’s talks were not in an “advanced stage” yet they were discussing lower tariffs on about 200 products that were “of importance to” both countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/israel-in-trade-talks-with-india-china/article32566406.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Plasma therapy didn’t help COVID-19 patients: ICMR||Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy failed to benefit COVID-19 patients, the largest trial conducted across 39 hospitals in India and spearheaded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found. The trial spanning April-July enrolled 464 hospitalised patients with “moderate” COVID-19 and administered convalescent plasma — antibodies derived from plasma filtered from the blood of those who have recovered from COVID-19 — on some of them. Last week, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava had said that the trial had been completed and results were expected soon. The idea was that such antibodies would neutralise replicating viruses and check the growth of the infection. However, in the 235 patients that received the plasma along with the “best standard of care” (called the intervention arm) and the 229 patients that received only the “standard of care” (called the control arm), there was not a significant difference in the proportion of those who did not progress to severe illness over 28 days, nor did the trial save a significant fraction of patients from death. “Thirty-four patients (13.6%) died in the intervention arm and 31 (14.6%) in the control arm,” the report noted. No reduction in deaths “CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19. This trial has high generalisability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity,” the authors concluded. The findings were reported in preprint repository MedRxiv, meaning that the report has not yet been peer-reviewed in a medical journal. The PLACID trial, as it is called, was an open-label (patients know the nature of treatment they are getting), parallel-arm, Phase 2, multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 39 tertiary care hospitals across India. Of these, 29 were teaching public hospitals and 10 were private hospitals spread across 14 States and Union Territories, and representing 25 cities. The results from the study mirror previous international findings from CP that failed to find a measurable benefit. These findings are sobering compared to claims by political parties of CP being a lifesaver. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that plasma therapy was a “crucial” prong in Delhi’s fight against COVID-19. U.S. President Donald Trump too had praised plasma therapy. The head of the United States’ medical regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, apologised for hyping the benefits of CP after the organisation approved the use of it as a treatment under the emergency use authorisation. Frantic rush ICMR guidelines currently leave it to medical practitioners to administer CP in case of moderately ill COVID-19 patients. The initial promise of the therapy had led to a frantic rush in many hospitals where patients were asked to source, using their own means, CP from those who had recovered from COVID-19. The study’s authors said that the use of CP appeared to mitigate shortness of breath and fatigue among patients, and did correspond to a “higher negative conversion of viral RNA”, but ultimately did not improve outcomes over the period of evaluation. “Use of CP as a treatment modality for COVID-19 has received authorisation for off-label use in India. This authorisation has been paralleled by questionable practices such as calls for donors on social media, and the sale of CP on the black market with exorbitant price tags in India. CP is a safe therapeutic modality, plasmapheresis, plasma storage and Nab (neutralising antibody) measurement are all resource-intensive processes, with limited number of institutes in the country having the capacity to undertake these activities in a quality-assured manner,” the authors underscored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plasma-therapy-didnt-help-covid-19-patients-icmr/article32566420.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘One in three high schoolers gets private coaching’||One in five students in India supplements school education with private coaching, including almost one in three at the secondary school level or Classes 9 and 10. Private coaching fees make up almost 20% of the total cost of education for those in secondary and higher secondary school. In some States, such as West Bengal, students actually spend more on private coaching than on their regular school, according to the National Statistical Organisation’s (NSO) latest report on education. Like regular schools, such coaching and tuition classes have also been closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, although many have been conducting online coaching classes instead. From September 21, schools will be partially reopened on a voluntary basis for Class 9 to 12 students, with the Health Ministry issuing guidelines on Tuesday. It remains to be seen how many of these students, who have now missed six months of classroom lessons, will continue to depend on coaching classes to bridge the gap. In the 75th round of the National Sample Survey, conducted between June 2017 and July 2018, households were surveyed on consumption related to education. The final report, which was published recently, shows that 19.8% of students at all levels — from pre-primary to graduate students — take some form of private coaching. Among Class 9 and 10 students, starting to prepare for the crucial board exams and admission tests, more than 30% do so. Among these secondary school students, those from the cities and upper castes are able to access private coaching at far higher levels. More than 52% of urban upper caste boys take coaching, in comparison to just 13.7% of rural boys and girls from scheduled tribe communities. Such coaching comes at a cost. The average annual expenditure on education for secondary school students is Rs. 9,013, of which Rs. 4,078 goes towards regular school fees. About Rs. 1,632, or just over 18%, goes towards private coaching. In higher secondary school, students spend more than Rs. 2,500, also about 18% of the total expenditure, on private coaching. Some States in eastern India seem to spend more on private coaching than the rest of the country. In West Bengal, students at all levels spend an average of Rs. 3,769 on private coaching.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/one-in-three-high-schoolers-gets-private-coaching/article32566434.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Airfare refund for lockdown cancellations||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the government to clarify whether its proposal to refund air tickets is confined to flight bookings made during the lockdown. A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation to respond to doubts raised by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde whether the proposal also encompassed air bookings made prior to the lockdown for journeys during the pandemic freeze. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta assured the court there was “no catch” in the proposal mooted by the Ministry. “It includes flights cancelled during the lockdown,” Mr. Mehta submitted while agreeing to clarify. The law officer said “tickets will have to be refunded”. The bone of contention is a line in the proposal which says “for all the other cases, the airlines shall make all endeavours to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days”. Mr. Hegde indicated that the phraseology “for all other cases” is too open-ended. He pointed out that while the proposal obligates airlines to fully and immediately refund tickets booked during the lockdown, it does not clearly indicate if bookings made before the lockdown are included. Does “all other cases” mean bookings prior to lockdown, he asked. The Solicitor-General said the proposal “essentially takes care of the interests of the passengers as well as ensures that airlines do not suffer immediately”. The proposal recommends immediate refund of air tickets. It also allows airlines to open credit shells in the name of passengers. Passengers can use the credit shell to fly any route. The credit is transferable. If the credit is not used, the ticket amount has to be mandatorily returned to passenger by March 31, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/airfare-refund-for-lockdown-cancellations/article32566417.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Defence exports increased 700% in 3 years: Rawat||In the past three years, the country witnessed a “staggering” 700% growth in defence exports — from Rs. 1,521 crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 10,745 crore in 2018-19, an all-time high and 19th in the list of defence exporters in 2019, according to Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Bipin Rawat. “We must move out of the constant threat of sanctions of dependency on individual nations for military requirements,” he said, talking of the huge defence imports, at a webinar by the Federation of Indian Chambers of CommerSce and Industry on catalysing defence exports, on Wednesday. “India is the third largest spender on defence around the world. It’s time to have a hard look at the distribution of our budget expenditure. We must carry out a realistic analysis of our expenditure. We are the only net importer in the category and account for 9.2% of global arms imports”, he noted. With the aim to achieve a manufacturing turnover of $25 bn or Rs. 1,75,000 crore, including exports of $5 bn in aerospace and defence goods and services by 2025, in August, the Defence Ministry issued a draft ‘Defence Production & Export Promotion Policy 2020’. A series of measures had been taken since 2014 to boost exports, including simplified defence industrial licensing, relaxation of export control and grant of No Objection Certificates, Gen. Rawat pointed out. MEA move Specific incentives were introduced under the foreign trade policy. The Ministry of External Affairs has facilitated a Line of Credit for foreign countries to import defence products. “Where feasible, defence exports can also be financed through the Exim Bank,” he observed. Defence attaches in Indian missions were empowered to promote defence exports, which would also strengthen defence diplomacy, he stated. Gen. Rawat acknowledged that the current Indian military fleet “comprises fair share of vintage platforms”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/defence-exports-increased-700-in-3-years-rawat/article32566425.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||ED attaches assets of Church of South India Trust Association||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth Rs. 59.52 crore of the Church of South India Trust Association (CSITA) in connection with a money laundering case. The movable assets are in the form of fixed deposits maintained with the State Bank of India’s Sudhamanagar branch in Bengaluru. FIR registered The action has been taken on the basis of a First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Ashoknagar police station in Bengaluru against the CSITA, following a complaint lodged by the Defence Ministry. It was alleged that the CSITA dishonestly entered into an arrangement with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), a Karnataka government undertaking, for transfer of the title of defence land measuring about 7,427 square metres. The land in question was earlier leased to the All Saints’ Church. A part of the precinct, where the All Saints Church is located, was transferred to the BMRCL against a compensation of Rs. 59.29 crore in 2019. The BMRCL acquired the land through the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. Proprietary right An ED probe revealed that the title of the land belonged to the Defence Ministry and it was only leased out to the All Saints’ Church for conducting religious affairs. No proprietary right of the land had been transferred. “The CSITA illegally transferred the land belonging to the Defence authorities to the BMRCL. The compensation for the land was required to be transferred to the Consolidated Fund of India, as the rightful owner of the land was the Defence Ministry,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-assets-of-church-of-south-india-trust-association/article32566376.ece
10 September 2020||Bengaluru,||Rain lashes Bengaluru, many areas flooded||When Jacob Francis, a resident of Sai Layout, Vaddarapalya, near Hennur Bande, woke up around 3 a.m. on Wednesday, he was surprised to see four inches of water inside his house. As heavy rains continued to lash outside, the water level inside his house rose. The family was forced to take refuge in their neighbour’s house. “My children, studying in class 9 and 5, have lost their books. All the electronic goods have been damaged. So are our car and two-wheelers,” he said. Similar scenes played out in many parts of the city, including Anugraha Layout, Poojappa Layout, Geddalahalli, Telecom Layout, HBR 5th Block. More than four cross roads were flooded and rainwater entered several homes in Telecom Layout. According to a resident, this is because around 400 metres of the retaining wall of the stormwater drain was yet to be constructed. Following heavy rains, the drain overflowed and flooded the roads. The heavy rains also resulted in lakes overflowing. Many thoroughfares within Manyata Tech Park near Hebbal were flooded, after the drains linking the Rachenahalli, Nagawara and Hebbal lakes overflowed. Most affected zones The control rooms of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) were flooded with complaints from aggrieved citizens. Speaking to reporters after inspecting a few affected areas, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said Mahadevapura, East, Dasarahalli and Yelahanka zones were most affected. Over 16 wards recorded more than 100 mm of rainfall. Kushalnagar in East zone recorded the maximum at 136 mm, followed by Chokkasandra in Dasarahalli zone (132 mm), Yeshwantpur in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone (129.5 mm), K.R. Puram in Mahadevapura zone (128.5 mm), Byatarayanapura in Yelahanka zone (125.5 mm), Vishwanath Nagenahalli in East zone (125 mm). Ironically, during the last BBMP council meeting, several councillors spoke about the works that had been taken up over the past five years for the overall development of the city. The term of the incumbent council comes to an end on September 10. Power disruptions Adding to the misery, many areas reported disruption in power supply. For instance, there was no power in parts of K.R. Puram from 5 a.m. on Wednesday. A post-graduate student, who resides in the area, complained that she could not attempt her examination properly, as her laptop ran out of charge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rain-lashes-bengaluru-many-areas-flooded/article32566380.ece
10 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Southern Railway yet to take a call on cancelling trains||The Southern Railway is yet to take a call on cancelling the Kozhikode- Thiruvananthapuram Central - Kozhikode Jan Shatabdi, Kannur- Thiruvananthapuram Central- Kannur Jan Shatabdi, and the Ernakulam- Thiruvananthapuram Central- Ernakulam Venad Express specials from September 12 as directed by the Railway Board. Poor patronage Although the board is firm that these special trains should be cancelled due to poor patronage, the divisional railway authorities in Kerala are putting pressure to continue the services citing the peculiar situation in the State and in view of protests from all quarters. “We are yet to be conveyed of the decision by the operations wing of the zonal railways to cancel the three pairs of trains as directed by Railway Board,” a railway official told The Hindu . These three trains were among the seven pairs of trains introduced by Railways from June 1 to facilitate essential travel as per a request of State government. The Railway Board had cited 24.25% load in the Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode Jan Shatabdi, 20.86% in the Thiruvananthapuram-Kannur Jan Shatabdi, and 13.29 % in Venad Express. These trains are being run without any additional charges. Office-goers worried With the proposed cancellation of these trains, short-distance commuters, especially office-goers, will be hit as there are no other daily trains plying in the State. A proposal to reduce the number of coaches from 21 to 10 on these trains in the wake of poor patronage was overruled by the zonal railways. The 02431/02432 Thiruvananthapuram Central- New Delhi- Thiruvananthapuram Central Rajdhani special and the 06345/06346 Lokmanya Tilak Terminus- Thiruvananthapuram Central- Lokmanya Tilak Express had been suspended till September 15 due to traffic restoration works between Pernem and Madure stations of the Konkan Railway. If the board directive is executed, the 02283/02284 Ernakulam- Hazrat Nizamuddin- Ernakulam Duronto and the 02617/02618 Ernakulam - Hazrat Nizamuddin- Ernakulam SF Express will be the trains left from the seven that began services in June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/southern-railway-yet-to-take-a-call-on-cancelling-trains/article32566769.ece
10 September 2020||New Delhi,||Backbone of unorganised sector broke during lockdown: Rahul||In the fourth and final part of the video series on the Indian economy, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi “misled the country” by saying that the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic would be won in 21 days. Instead, in those 21 days, the “backbone of the unorganised sector was broken”, Mr. Gandhi alleged. The lockdown, which was imposed without prior notice, was the “third attack” on the unorganised sector, he said. In the earlier video series, he had listed “demonetisation” and “faulty implementation of the GST” as the other reasons that led to a collapse of the sector. “The poor, those working in small and medium businesses, are daily wage earners. They eat with what they earn each day. When you announced a lockdown without a notice, you attacked them,” he said. The government did not heed the Congress’s repeated advice that there was a crying need to implement a cash transfer scheme for the poor. “We suggested that for small and medium businesses, you should prepare a package but the government did nothing,” he stated. No relief: Chidambaram On these lines, senior Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in a series of tweets, asked whether the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, the rescue package offered by the government to tide over the financial crisis in the wake of COVID-19, was a “relief” in any real sense or tokenism. Under the National Social Assistance Programme, he pointed out, 2.81 crore persons got Rs. 2,814 crore or Rs. 1,000 a person. He asked, “Could that sum have kept body and soul together?” Similarly, in Jan Dhan accounts, women got Rs. 1,500 each over three months; just Rs. 500 a month to run daily affairs. “The numbers prove that the money given was niggardly and totally insufficient. And certainly, the money could not have acted as a ‘stimulus’ to boost demand and revive the economy,” Mr. Chidambaram stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/backbone-of-unorganised-sector-broke-during-lockdown-rahul/article32566412.ece
10 September 2020||Bengaluru,||ED attaches assets of Church of South India Trust Association||The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) has issued a Provisional Attachment Order under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) attaching assets worth Rs. 59.52 crore in the form of fixed deposits (FDs) in the name of Church of South India Trust Association (CSITA). According to a release, the FDs are maintained with the State Bank of India, Sudhamnagar branch. Investigation was initiated on the basis of an FIR registered at Ashoknagar Police Station, Bengaluru, against CSITA for “dishonestly entering into an arrangement” for transfer of title of Defence land measuring 7,426.886 sq m, which was earlier leased to All Saints Church, with Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL). “Part of the precinct where All Saints Church is situated has been transferred to BMRCL by CSITA for receiving compensation of Rs. 59.29 crore during 2019. Earlier, BMRCL had acquired this land through Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). Investigation revealed that the title of the land belonged to Ministry of Defence, Government of India and it was only leased out to All Saints Church for conducting religious affairs of the church and no proprietary right of the land was ever transferred to the church,” the release said. The ED has alleged that CSITA “illegally transferred the land” belonging to Defence authorities to BMRCL, and the compensation for the land as the rightful owner of the land is the Ministry of Defence. “CSITA, being not the rightful owner of the land, illegally barged into the shoes of Defence authorities and has transferred the property and obtained the proceeds from BMRCL. Accordingly, identified assets to the tune of Rs. 59.52 crore, including accrued interest on the amount received, has been provisionally attached under PMLA,” the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-assets-of-church-of-south-india-trust-association/article32566486.ece

10 September 2020||New Delhi,||Cong. renews campaign for Deputy Speaker’s post||With the Rajya Sabha poised to elect the Deputy Chairman, the Congress renewed its campaign seeking the Deputy Speaker’s position in the Lok Sabha. Congress’s floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, in a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, urged him to adhere to the constitutional mandate. The Lok Sabha has not had a Deputy Speaker for the last 15 months. Instead, a panel of MPs has been assisting the Speaker. In contrast, within a couple of months after the vacancy arose, the process of electing the Deputy Chairman has begun in the Rajya Sabha. Former Deputy Chairman and JD(U) MP Harivansh filed his nomination papers on Wednesday. The Congress is also trying to bring together the opposition parties to field a joint candidate, though the opposition does not have the requisite numbers. Mr. Chowdhury, in his letter, said that according to the constitutional mandate the seat of the Deputy Speaker should be filled either by election or consensus after a new Lok Sabha is constituted. He said that by convention the post of the Deputy Speaker is offered to the opposition party. “Already a year has elapsed but still the Lok Sabha is deprived of having a Deputy Speaker, as if it appears a one-horn chair of the Lower House, meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha has been on the verge of electing the Deputy Chairman,” he wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-renews-campaign-for-deputy-speakers-post/article32566403.ece

The Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Wednesday told the Chief Election Officer (CEO), Leh, that elections should be delayed “till the border situation becomes normal.” However, the BJP has pitched for election, due in the third week of October. Movement of people During a meeting chaired by the CEO, a Congress leader pointed out that “the party apprehends that a large number of people have come to Leh from border villages” due to the border tensions. “There might not be enough people in the villages for campaigning,” its representative said. The party also cited the growing cases of COVID-19 in Leh. The AAP, which is contesting the LAHDC-Leh polls for the first time, said the spike in COVID-19 positive cases made “voters above 65 years vulnerable, and the elaborate SOPs may result in poor turnout”. BJP differs The BJP, however, has backed elections on time. “A gathering of 20-50 people should be permissible with the standard operating procedure (SOP) for COVID-19. Electronic Voting Machines should be used and sanitised after a vote is cast,” a BJP representative told the meeting. For the first time, traditional regional parties, the NC and the PDP, may not contest the polls.

The court said, “From the notice, it is clear beyond any doubt that the works which are ‘unauthorised’ have not come up overnight. However, all of a sudden, the Corporation appears to have overnight woken up from its slumber, issued Notice to the Petitioner (Ms. Ranaut), that too when she is out of the State, directing her to respond within 24 hours, and not granting her any further time, despite written request, and proceeding to demolish the said premises upon completion of 24 hours.” “Though the manner in which the MCGM (BMC) has proceeded to commence demolition work of the said premises, prima facie does not appear to be bonafide and smacks of malafide. If the MCGM would act with similar swiftness qua the numerous unauthorized constructions in this City, the City would be a completely different place to live in,” the court said in its order. The court has directed the civic body to file an affidavit and is to hear the matter at 3 p.m. on Thursday. Leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis defended Ms. Ranaut and tweeted a video in Hindi that said: “If those who talk against us are stopped and attacked and that too with the support of the State government ... this has never happened in the history of Maharashtra.

10 September 2020||special correspondent,||Elephant succumbs to blast wounds in Kerala||A full-grown rogue elephant that had been found injured at Sholayur in Attappady’s Agali forest range three weeks ago died on Wednesday. The tuskless male elephant called ‘makna’ succumbed to deep wounds it suffered in its mouth and pharynx apparently after chomping on an explosive. Forest officers suspected that the animal suffered the wound while being in Tamil Nadu region.  People not attacked The elephant, which used to cross the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border frequently in the last two years, was nicknamed bulldozer by the people of Attappady. The elephant had razed down at least two dozen tribal huts in the period. However, it never attacked any human being. A team of forest officers and veterinarians led by Forest Veterinary Officer Arun Zacharia and Agali Forest Range Officer K.T. Udayan had attended to the elephant after tranquillising it through darting on August 22.  The elephant vanished into Tamil Nadu forest areas and re-emerged at Attappady on Sunday. Although it began to drink some water, it had become too weak. Dr. Zacharia and team had found the wound very deep and its tongue had been torn. Its snorkel valve was badly damaged. “An explosion would most likely be the cause of injury. We could not follow up the treatment as the animal drifted away into Tamil Nadu side of the jungle,” said Dr. Zacharia. Even as the forest officers watched, the three-metre tall elephant fell at Marappalam near Anakkatty on the State border on Wednesday. Assistant forest veterinary surgeon Arun Satyan conducted a necropsy. The tribespeople of Attappady led by Vellinkiri and Lakshmi conducted a special puja for the dead elephant. They said it never attacked them and they owed their respect to it. The carcass was shifted to a nearby private plot and buried there using a crane.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/elephant-succumbs-to-blast-wounds-in-kerala/article32566390.ece

They showed the soldiers carrying spears, rods and clubs. The official said the issue was raised with the Chinese commander. “The Chinese say that the rods and spears are for construction work to build temporary sheds on their side of the LAC. But it is evident that such tools serve no such purpose,” the official pointed out. In the past fortnight, three top officials — Army Chief Gen. M.M Naravane; Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Director General S.S. Deswal; and Secretary, Border Management, Sanjeeva Kumar, visited Ladakh. On Wednesday, China’s State media reported that the PLA was “mobilising forces, including bombers, air defence troops, artillery, armoured vehicles, paratroopers, special forces and infantry units from different parts of the country to the bordering plateau region” after the latest tensions. Bombers mobilised Bombers and transport aircraft from the Central Theatre Command, which is responsible for Beijing and surrounding provinces, and an air defence brigade from the Eastern Theatre Command, which is focused on Taiwan and Japan, have been mobilised to the Tibetan plateau and linked up with the Western Theatre Command, which covers Tibet, Xinjiang and the India border. The Central Theatre Command said in a statement that it had deployed H-6 bombers and Y-20 large transport aircraft to the Tibetan plateau for training missions as part of the mobilisation. The Eastern Theatre Command had mobilised an air defence brigade to the northwest and “held live-fire confrontational drills with anti-aircraft guns and missiles”, State broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported. It said the military was conducting “long-distance manoeuvres, deployment exercises and live-fire drills” last week. The Communist Party-run Global Times said the manoeuvres were taking place “after India crossed the LAC near the southern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake and near the Reqin Mountain pass on August 31”.

10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC allows interim bail to anti-CAA protesters||The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed interim bail to 21 anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters accused of violence in Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada district in December last year. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde referred to an earlier Karnataka High Court observation that “it was not possible to prima facie determine the presence of the accused persons at the spot.” At the same time, the court made it clear that the High Court’s observation would not be treated as a “final finding of fact” during trial. “...The observations of the High Court on question of fact and law are obviously made prima facie and shall not affect the trial,” the Supreme Court noted. When the virtual court hearing began, senior advocate R. Basant along with advocate Haris Beeran, for the protestors, highlighted that none of the protesters, aged between 19 and 43 years, had any criminal antecedents. “That is why we are asking you what the conditions of their bail should be. Otherwise, we would have imposed the conditions and not asked you,” Chief Justice Bobde replied. They would have to report to the nearest police station every alternative Monday and should not participate in any violent activities/meetings. The apex court, in March, had stayed a February order of the High Court granting them bail. The accused have been in jail for six months. The accused said they were the sole breadwinners of their families. They would suffer irreparable harm and prejudice if bail was not granted. They said the situation had drastically changed with the spread of the pandemic and jail was not safe. They reminded the court of its own order that an undertrial should be granted bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-allows-interim-bail-to-anti-caa-protesters/article32566391.ece

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||SII pulled up for not pausing vaccine trial||“I [Somani] give you an opportunity to showcause why permission granted to you should not be suspended till patient safety established.”  The Hindu has viewed this letter. Last month, SII began Phase-2/Phase-3 trials to compare the safety and immunogenicity of its vaccine candidate COVISHIELD (SII-ChAdOx1), with the Oxford vaccine (Oxford/AZ-ChAdOx1). Both vaccines are similar in structure and the early-human-trial data of Oxford/AZ-ChAdOx1 from studies in the United Kingdom was used to approve Phase-2 and Phase-3 trials in India, Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology told The Hindu . According to information on India’s clinical trial registry, where all human trials of vaccine and drugs must be registered, 1,600 adults would be enrolled in the study. Of these, 400 participants will be part of an immunogenicity cohort and will be randomly assigned either COVISHIELD or Oxford/AZ-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, respectively. The remaining 1,200 participants from the safety cohort will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either COVISHIELD or a placebo, respectively. Immunogenicity is to test if a vaccine can coax the immune system to launch a protective response that can shield against future infection. Regarding the show-cause notice issued by the DCGI, SII, told The Hindu , “We are going by the DCGI’s direction and, so far, were not told to pause the trials. If the DCGI has any safety concerns, we will follow their instructions and abide by the standard protocols.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sii-pulled-up-for-not-pausing-vaccine-trial/article32566394.ece

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said the status involved giving animals a “legal personality”. This means bestowing on animals, by judicial direction, the capacity to sue and be sued in courts of law. “Animals already have the protection of the law. There are laws like the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, etc. But making them a legal entity is giving them the capacity to sue and be sued ... How is that possible?” Chief Justice Bobde asked petitioner-advocate Devesh Saxena in a virtual court hearing. Mr. Saxena made an impassioned plea that animals are considered “property.” “We will look into this point on punishment not being enough of a deterrent against hurting animals,” the CJI addressed Mr. Saxena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-for-legal-entity-status-to-animals/article32566427.ece

The government will also examine the proposal for providing isolation facilities for patients hailing from BPL families in government hospitals. The State would also discuss with senior officials about the scope for announcing a relief package for the families of the poor who suffered job losses due to the pandemic. Replying to a short discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on the State, the Chief Minister said he would appoint a committee headed by a senior bureaucrat to examine reports relating to private hospitals charging exorbitant fees for treating COVID-19 patients. He was responding to a request made by Congress member Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka who expressed concern over the exorbitant charges levied by the private hospitals. The Chief Minister said Telangana was the first State to alert the Central government about coronavirus. The government took timely action to contain the spread of the virus and these steps had ensured that the State was on better footing as compared to several others and the Central government. The situation had not got out of “our hands” because of the steps initiated by the government in advance. The government at the same time had ensured that there was no stoppage of welfare activities and had imposed cut in the salaries of employees and elected representatives to meet the shortfall.

10 September 2020||Bengaluru,||NLSIU releases proctoring protocols for NLAT-2020||The National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, which will conduct an online test for admissions to the university, has released a list of malpractices and their proctoring protocols which will be used to monitor the examination process. Some of the malpractices that will lead the proctor to terminate their session include if a candidate’s face is not detected on the screen. In such an instance, the proctor will send a warning and if the candidate does not return within 45 seconds, his/her examination will be terminated. In some instances, candidates can get 10 extra seconds if they have not noticed the messages. Other malpractices include impersonation, if another person is present in the vicinity and if the candidate is looking in other directions. According to the document put out by the university, candidates will be logged out of the examination if they are found switching the windows more than five times. Candidates are also not allowed to use more than one device and cannot use earphones, headphones or Bluetooth audio devices. Meanwhile, the university has also said that the undergraduate National Law Aptitude Test – 2020, which will be conducted on September 12, will be held in three sessions in line with other examinations. The university has acknowledged that in spite of “all efforts to maintain equivalence among various question papers, the difficulty level of the question papers administered in different sessions may not exactly be the same”. To overcome this, the university has said that a normalisation procedure will be used to compile law scores across batches and “ensure a level-playing field where candidates are neither benefitted nor disadvantaged due to the difficulty level of the exam”. Merit list to be published After drawing flak for stating that no merit list will be published, the NLSIU on its website said that a general merit list will be prepared prior to admissions and all students may access the marks secured and rank using their admissions login. “The provisional admission list will be provided with the names and ranks of selected students. The marks secured by other students are personal information protected from disclosure,” a note on the university’s website stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nlsiu-releases-proctoring-protocols-for-nlat-2020/article32566383.ece

CM’s appeal Meanwhile, Chief Minister V, Narayanasamy called on the aged in general and specifically the elderly with ailments such as blood pressure, diabetes, respiratory problem and cancer to take extra precautions. “One of the main reasons for the high number of deaths is that COVID-19 goes undetected in many elderly patients who self-medicate for fever, and by the time they reach hospital and are tested, their condition turns life-threatening,” Mr. Narayanasamy said. “The elderly should remain at home and not step out. In case they develop fever, they should immediately approach hospitals and not engage in self-medication,” the Chief Minister said.

Palaniswami on Wednesday blamed the Centre's system of allowing farmers to register themselves on a portal to become beneficiaries of the PM Kisan scheme for the major scam in Tamil Nadu in which Rs. 110 crore was fraudulently credited to 5.5 lakh ineligible persons.

10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Prevent dumping of sewage into drains: NGT||Government officials are expected to not allow discharge of sewage into storm drains, and the sewage must be taken to a treatment plant where it will have to be treated and the wastewater recycled for various purposes, such as irrigation and gardening, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal said. The Bench made this observation in a case relating to the alleged largescale discharge of sewage into storm drains by tankers around the Porur link road. Based on a report, the Bench noted that earlier, this practice was reported from the Vanagaram area along the Maduravoyal bypass and was stopped after complaints were raised; now it was being reported from the Porur link road area. “It is seen from the report that largescale discharge of sewage water collected from the Corporation area is being discharged into stormwater drains, which ultimately reaches some water body and is likely to cause the contamination of lake water,” the bench said. The Bench directed a joint committee to be formed with the Greater Chennai Corporation as the nodal agency to inspect the area and ascertain whether there was any mechanism for monitoring the vehicles that were authorised to carry the sewage to the disposal facility unit and whether such vehicles were fitted with GPS to track their movement. The committee was directed to find out if there were any violations and to trace persons carrying out this illegal activity and take action, including the imposition of environmental compensation on them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prevent-dumping-of-sewage-into-drains-ngt/article32566534.ece

Calling upon the partymen to collect details about the “atrocities, excesses, commission, corruption, unfulfilled promises and schemes stopped midway” by the AIADMK government, Mr. Stalin said people should be reminded of all the high-handedness of the ruling party. “We have to place it before the people’s court how the State has suffered in the last 10 years and its development has met a setback,” he said. Mr. Stalin felt even though people were fully aware that the government had not even lifted its hand to address the pressing problems, it was the duty of the DMK to remind them. “If the DMK has to rule the State even after a hundred years, not just me, but everyone who is the member of the general council should toil hard. Our only objective is to bring back the DMK rule,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the activities of the party in the next six month alone would catapult the DMK to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-must-work-hard-to-win-assembly-election-says-stalin/article32566549.ece

Initially, Metro had decided not to operate direct trains from Chennai Central and Chennai airport. But as a lot of passengers took the Metro to reach the airport, it decided to start operations on that route immediately. The extension of services till 9 p.m. is expected to help passengers boarding international flights. Patronage improves In the last two days of operations, about 5,000 passengers took the service on the first day and another 6,000 on Tuesday. The resumption of more services on Thursday is expected to increase the number of passengers travelling by the Metro, sources said. So far, the services have been smooth and passengers have been maintaining physical distancing inside trains and stations, which may encourage more commuters to use the network. This system used to handle 1.15 lakh passengers a day but it may take several months to see that kind of traffic as most offices are allowing employees to work from home. S. Pramila, a resident of Anna Nagar who works at Chennai airport, said she had to commute on her two-wheeler every day. “Yesterday, I saw a father and a child on a vehicle next to mine; they weren’t even wearing masks. I hate riding on the road. I can’t wait to get back to using Metro. Before COVID-19, I was taking direct trains to the airport every day; now, I’m relieved and glad they have restored services,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-airport-metro-service-resumes-today/article32566543.ece

Neethimani of Chennai-based Bullion Fintech LLP residing in Alwarpet claimed that he had construction businesses in Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai and other countries and offered high returns on investments in his industry. He engaged S. Anand, a government school teacher, to canvass the scheme and raise funds in Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts. Accordingly, Mr. Anand raised funds through Angayoan Associates, a financial firm operated in the name of his wife. On information that the accused had cheated depositors and were even planning to flee the country, the Ramanathapuram police registered a case and arrested both the suspects. Enquiries and the statement of Mr. Neethimani revealed the alleged involvement of Mr. Gnanavelraja and the names of film distributors Siva and Muruganandham were also added as accused in the case, the sources said. Since the scam involved a huge money and the investigation required the collection of documents/recording of statements in several districts, the Ramanathapuram Superintendent of Police wrote to the DGP recommending that the case be transferred to the EOW which is a specialised unit for investigating financial frauds, the sources added.

10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MRTS to connect Adambakkam and Ullagaram through shuttle services||With land acquisition for the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) expansion project connecting Velachery and St. Thomas Mount railway stations hanging in limbo, the Southern Railway has decided to run shuttle services connecting Ullagaram-Puzhithivakkam and the Adambakkam railway stations by next year. The Southern Railway planned to integrate the MRTS with the suburban and Metro services by extending the tracks from Velachery to St. Thomas Mount. But it has now reworked the strategy because of the delay in acquiring about a 500 m stretch of the land for the track. Having constructed the railway stations of Ullagaram-Puzhithivakkam and Adambakkam, the Southern Railway plans to operate shuttle train services to Velachery railway station from January next year. A senior official said more than 75% of the work had been completed by installing ballastless tracks, construction of railway stations and commissioning of signal systems. For operating trains on either tracks, crossover facility had been provided at the Velachery railway station on the Adambakkam side. Also, signalling work for providing trains to cross to other track had been executed by building a new relay room, which was commissioned on September 5, he said. The Railways had sanctioned Rs. 489 crore for the MRTS Extension Phase II project from Velachery to St. Thomas Mount. This year around Rs. 40 crore had been allocated for completing the work till Adambakkam. V. Rama Rao, an office-bearer of the Traffic and Transport Forum, while welcoming the move to operate trains from Adambakkam, said regular commuters would still have to depend on Velachery station, from where trains were operated to Chennai Beach. He rued that the main purpose of the extension would not be served until the MRTS trains were linked with other multi-modal transport options already available at St. Thomas Mount. But commuters would have to wait for a few more years for the integration of multi-modal transport facility planned at St. Thomas Mount.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mrts-to-connect-adambakkam-and-ullagaram-through-shuttle-services/article32566539.ece

10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two nabbed at airport while trying to flee after attacking man||Police officers on night duty nabbed a young woman and her associate at the airport as they were trying to flee after stabbing a man at a Jafferkhanpet apartment and setting him on fire. At 12.30 a.m. on Tuesday, the police control room received a call from a man seeking assistance; he claimed that he had been injured in a cylinder blast at his house. Taramani inspector G.S. Pushparaj and Assistant Commissioner of Police, Guindy, A. Subbarayan quickly reached the apartment located in Ragava Colony, Jafferkhanpet. The man was identified as Deepak, 28, from Delhi, who claimed to be involved in textile business. He was in critical condition, lying on the ground in front of the apartment. He had stab wounds and burns on his body. He was rushed in an ambulance to the Government Royapettah Hospital. The police sensed something amiss since he lived on the second floor of the apartment but he was lying on the ground floor and his house was locked outside. Police broke open the lock and entered the house. They found blood splattered everywhere in the bedroom, and clothes strewn around. “On scrutiny of CCTV footage, we found a young woman and a man were coming out of the house early in the morning with suitcases, and getting into a call taxi. Investigation revealed that the duo had been staying with the victim for some days here. Due to some dispute, they stabbed him and set him on fire. After locking up the house, they left the house and the victim managed to climb down using a sari from the second floor,” said Assistant Commissioner Subbarayan. A police team reached the airport and searched the lounge. They saw the man sitting in a corner with blood stains on his T-shirt and nabbed him. Again, they fanned the departure terminal and nabbed the woman just as she was leaving to board a Mumbai flight. Investigation revealed that Deepak was running a sex racket from his house. Hamdan, 26, from Delhi was his associate and stayed with him in the house. The woman suspect, who was 22, was brought two months ago from Kolkata. Following a dispute over sharing of money, the woman and her associate stabbed Deepak and set him on fire, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-nabbed-at-airport-while-trying-to-flee-after-attacking-man/article32566535.ece
10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||UGC notification eases norms for varsities to offer online courses||The University Grants Commission has, through a gazette notification, eased the norms for universities to launch online courses. Higher education institutions (HEIs) which have valid NAAC accreditation and NIRF can apply for open and distance learning programmes. Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on Friday released the gazette and mentioned it on social media as well. The notification permits universities with a score of over 3.1 on a scale of 4 from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council to apply for permission to offer online programmes. The applicant institution must have ranked in the top 100 in the university category of the National Institutional Ranking Framework, at least once in the two preceding cycles. The NAAC and NIRF ranking requirements should be valid for the academic session 2020-21. The restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic have actually managed to re-emphasise the need for distance learning courses, but that has not been the case always. In 2018, the University of Madras, under Vice-Chancellor P. Duraisamy, faced an uphill task to get approval for its distance learning programmes. On average, around 30,000 students are admitted to various programmes offered via open and distance learning (ODL) mode at the university. The UGC’s new regulations then had prevented the university from offering MBA and MCA, which were popular among students and also fetched the university revenue. The Annamalai University, which has nearly 70 off shore centres to run programmes, went to court and got a stay on the UGC regulations. “The new changes are welcome,” Mr. Duraisamy said. “HEIs can start three UG and 10 PG programmes through online by giving an undertaking that the institution has met all the regulations. Earlier, the institutions had to have a NAAC score of 3.26 to launch ODL programmes. The notification would pave the way for offering science programmes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ugc-notification-eases-norms-for-varsities-to-offer-online-courses/article32566551.ece

He had availed a home loan by depositing title deeds. Petition In its petition, Amarprakash Developers Pvt Ltd said home buyer Thirumalai Kumar had moved TNRERA against it, seeking full refund of the amount paid by him for the purchase of a flat following delay in handing over possession. Title deeds deposited Further, the builder said the homebuyer had availed a loan from M/s. IIFL Home Loan Division by depositing the title deeds of the property. In event of a refund being ordered in the case, the amount has to be paid to the finance company to clear the charge over the property, and it is necessary for the firm to be made a party to the case, it added. The homebuyer argued against the plea. TNRERA noted that in case a refund was ordered along with interest compensation and other charges, it would be the duty of the home buyer to clear the encumbrance created by him with the finance company. This would enable the developer to sell the property to any other party with clear title, it noted and allowed the petition of the developer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnrera-makes-finance-firm-a-party-as-homebuyer-seeks-refund/article32566568.ece

10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Duraimurugan elected DMK general secretary, T.R. Baalu is treasurer||The DMK, after 43 years, has a new general secretary in senior leader Duraimurugan, with the party general council electing him unopposed to the top post on Wednesday. The post had fallen vacant in Marchfollowing the deathof party stalwart K. Anbazhagan, who had held the position since 1977. Another senior leader, T. R. Baalu, was elected unopposed as treasurer, a post vacated by Mr. Duraimurugan. A general council meeting, in which DMK district secretaries and others participated virtually, was chaired by party president M.K. Stalin. Former Union Minister A. Raja and former State Minister K. Ponmudi were appointed deputy general secretaries of the party. A resolution adopted in the meeting appreciated the contribution made by the four leaders for the development of the DMK ideology and the organisation. The meeting also placed on record the relief work done by the DMK leaders and cadres during the COVID-19 pandemic. SC verdict hailed “As the ruling AIADMK failed to address the problems of the people, our leader (M.K.Stalin) came to the fore and worked to provide relief to the people,” the resolution said. Another resolution hailed the order of the Supreme Court “upholding separate reservation created for the Arundhathiyar community in Tamil Nadu,” when the DMK was in power. The meeting also welcomed the Madras High Court direction to implement reservation for OBCs in the medical seats surrendered by Tamil Nadu to the central pool, and the allocation of seats in postgraduate courses to government doctors. Condemning the National Education Policy (NEP 2020), a resolution said it should not be implemented until it was discussed by all political parties in Parliament. “The AIADMK government should oppose the education policy which advocates a three-language policy,” the resolution said. Yet another resolution accused the AIADMK government and its ministers of indulging in corrupt practices during the pandemic. “A time will come and they will be answerable to the people,” the resolution said.

10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Demands of producers unjustified, say exhibitors||Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association (TNTOA) president Tiruppur Subramanian on Wednesday said that the demands of producers were “completely unjustifiable”, a day after the Tamil Film Active Producers Association placed a list of demands as a precondition to release new movies once theatres reopen. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Subramanian said, “Each one in the industry should look after their own business and not interfere in others business.” Referring to the demand that theatre owners should share their advertisement revenue with the producers as it was the film that brings the audience to cinema halls, Mr. Subramanian said: “Have they invested any money in the theatre infrastructure to ask for a share in our revenue?” “How is it justified to seek a share in revenue when they have not invested any money? We haven’t invested money in their film — if we ask for a share in OTT rights and satellite rights, will they give it?” He dismissed the argument of the producers in the vexatious issue of ‘Virtual Print Fee’ currently paid by producers to digital distribution companies. Mr Subramanian underlined that the producers began paying digital distribution companies because it reduced the costs of distribution by almost 75%. “When they had to give us film prints, they spent around Rs. 65,000 for a print but it has been reduced to just Rs. 15,000. Now, they want this service for free. How is this possible? Also, they are not paying theatre owners any money. They are paying the company directly,” he said, adding that companies had made massive investment to create the infrastructure. “The theatre owners can always turn theatres into marriage halls if producers don’t budge,” Mr. Subramanian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demands-of-producers-unjustified-say-exhibitors/article32566581.ece
10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Theme park operators seek succour from govt.||Theme Park operators in Tamil Nadu who closed gates in March due to the lockdown are struggling to meet their expenses and to maintain properties spread over several acres. A few parks have not been able to pay salaries to employees for the last three months. Others have asked temporary workers to leave and told them they would be taken back when business resumes. The industry is seeking permission to reopen. It wants both the State and the Centre to come forward and provide support. In Tamil Nadu, one of the biggest worries is the 10% entertainment tax. “We request the government to waive off the entertainment tax being levied only in Tamil Nadu,” said V.G.P. Ravidas, managing director of VGP Universal Kingdom. On behalf of all theme/amusement parks, he said the State should consider giving a waiver of minimum/fixed cost charges levied by the electricity department and also extend existing licenses without charges for one year. Operators have also asked for GST waiver for the next 12 months and a reduction of effective rate of interest on loans from financial institutions. “We have prepared an SOP, engaging a consultant through our association. This will help in implementing norms set by the government when we open,” Mr. Ravidas said. Seasonal business Another big player said they are on the verge of closing down. “This is a seasonal business — people come during summer or when they have a holiday. With no tourist movement, our industry has collapsed. It will take us another two years to get back to normalcy.” Vincent Adaikalraj of Black Thunder said schools and colleges were a big market. With the closure of educational institutions there would be no excursions. “Since the closure, the maintenance cost has been the biggest challenge. If the parks are not maintained properly rust and dirt would accumulate on the infrastructure,” he said, adding that maintenance costs are around Rs. 15 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh a month. “Black Thunder is doing maintenance work with 70 plus people, and the other workers have been asked to come only when the park opens. While salaries were paid during the initial three months, the firm could not afford to pay after that,” said Mr. Adaikalraj. Those in the business said physical distancing would not pose a challenge as the properties were located on huge parcels of land. With the ticketing system, they could restrict the number of people getting entry at any point of time. This was being done in major parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios. Operators are also working out ways to keep the water rides safe. According to estimates, there are over 25 organised players in Tamil Nadu and each employs 300-500 people. According to the Indian Association of Amusement Parks and Industries, there are 150 parks and they have projected revenue losses of over Rs. 1,100 crore due to COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/theme-park-operators-seek-succour-from-govt/article32566553.ece
10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Probe on into Harbhajan Singh’s complaint, police tell High Court||The Greater Chennai police on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court that it was yet to register a First Information Report (FIR) on a complaint lodged by cricketer Harbhajan Singh on August 26 claiming that he had fallen victim to a fraud played by a Chennai-based partnership firm to which he had extended an interest bearing loan of Rs. 4 crore. Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira was told by Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz that only a preliminary inquiry had been initiated on the basis of the complaint and that one of the partners of the firm, G. Mahesh, had rushed to court seeking anticipatory bail immediately after receipt of summons asking him to appear for the inquiry. After recording his submission, the judge directed the petitioner to cooperate with the inquiry by producing all relevant documents and other materials in his possession and approach the court later if an FIR gets registered. In his complaint, Mr. Singh stated that the petitioner had sought an interest bearing loan of Rs. 4 crore for the real estate business done by him through the firm called Aaura Mega Investments. Accordingly, he extended the loan through two cheques (one for Rs. 1 crore and another for Rs. 3 crore) on condition that it should be repaid within 12 months. However, after 12 months, even the interest was not paid fully and the petitioner reportedly stopped picking the cricketer’s phone calls. After huge pressure, Mr. Singh recovered Rs. 2 crore besides obtaining eight post dated cheques for Rs. 25 lakh each in February this year. The very first cheque bounced last month forcing him to lodge the complaint. On the other hand, the anticipatory bail petitioner told the court he had availed the loan from the cricketer in 2015 and deposited with him the original title deeds of a property at Thalambur near here as security. Further, a power of attorney was also executed in favour of the cricketer at the Sub Registrar’s office in Tiruporur. Claiming to have repaid Rs. 4.05 crore so far, the petitioner claimed that the process of reconciliation of account towards consolidation of the interest component was going on at present. He also said that eight cheques were issued to the cricketer in February this year as further security towards repayment of the interest component. Stating that negotiations with respect to consolidation of interest were hindered due to COVID-19, the petitioner said that the cricketer, in the meantime, presented one of the cheques for encashment on August 17. The bank did not honour the cheque because the petitioner had issued instruction to stop payment. The petitioner asserted that he did not intend to cheat the cricketer and that it was a case of a simple loan transaction between them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/probe-on-into-harbhajan-singhs-complaint-police-tell-high-court/article32566578.ece
10 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools can allow students to attend classes: High Court||The Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered that government and private schools in the State can allow a small group of students to attend classes by following physical distancing and other safety norms if there were difficulties in teaching them through television channels or online mode during the ongoing lockdown to fight COVID-19. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha said the schools could also explore the possibility of “teachers going to the students and giving education if there exists facility to do so.” The orders were passed while disposing of a batch of public interest litigation (PIL) petitions filed for regulating the conduct of online classes. After the filing of the cases, the Union Ministry of Education had come up with comprehensive guidelines titled ‘Pragyata’ for conduct of online classes by schools. The State government too came up with separate but similar guidelines on July 29 following a court direction issued on July 20. Observing that the guidelines were elaborate and covered every other aspect concerned with digital education of children, the judges said the only issue that they had to adjudicate was with respect to implementation of those guidelines at the ground level and ensuring strict compliance by the schools. Since there was every chance of schools not following the guidelines by claiming that they were only advisory and not mandatory in nature, the Division Bench held those guidelines to be binding on all schools and ordered constitution of district level committees by the School Education Department for monitoring online classes. The court directed the Department to translate those guidelines in Tamil too, if not done already, and forward copies to all schools which, in turn, were expected to circulate them among the parents. Considering the ills of students remaining glued to computer and mobile phone screens for long, the Bench ordered strict compliance of the time limit prescribed in the guidelines, which state that no session of online class should extend beyond 45 minutes at a stretch and that there must be a break of 10 to 15 minutes after every session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-can-allow-students-to-attend-classes-hc/article32566547.ece

Ramadoss on Wednesday reiterated the demand that National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical courses should be permanently cancelled after a young medical aspirant from Ariyalur district, who was suffering from mental stress due to the exam, died by suicide recently. In a statement, he said the student had been under severe mental stress as he was preparing to get more than 500 in NEET to secure a place in a government medical college. “He developed stress after he was told by many that he has to get more than 500 to get a seat in a medical college. As a result, he died by jumping into a well. We can state without doubt that the previous government and the current government, which has imposed and organised the NEET, are responsible for his death,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said the young student’s death reiterated once again that the justification for introducing NEET that it improves quality and prevents commercialisation of medical education no longer holds true.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cancel-neet-permanently-ramadoss/article32566548.ece

The house-cum-jewellery making unit of J. Nandagopal on Pavizham Street here was searched by a five-member NIA team, headed by a DSP-ranked officer in the morning. It is learnt that the NIA named Mr. Nandagopal an accused in the case for allegedly acting as a middleman by buying the smuggled gold and turning it into finished jewellery. Documents naming him an accused had already been submitted before the NIA special court in Kochi, sources said. Mr. Nandagopal operates a jewellery manufacturing unit on one floor of the building while he resides on another floor. NIA officials questioned him for several hours. There was no official communication from the NIA on further action against the jeweller and materials or digital devices, if any, seized during the search. There are around 30 accused in the case, which became sensational in Kerala because of the alleged links of the suspects with key personnel in the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nia-searches-jewellers-premises-in-coimbatore/article32566566.ece

10 September 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||MP opposes BU Syndicate appointment||Coimbatore MP P.R. Natarajan has opposed the appointment of P. Kanagasabapathi, State vice-president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as a Syndicate member of the Bharathiar University. The MP said in a press release that the National Education Policy introduced by the Central Government was opposed by many. The BJP government at the Centre was trying to saffronise several issues and was not accepting views against it, he alleged. He said the appointment of a person affiliated to a political party as a Syndicate member of the University was a new practice and this move by the Governor of Tamil Nadu was setting a bad precedent. The Governor should have consulted the University Vice-Chancellor before making such appointments. It raises doubts if the BJP Government was making backdoor moves to make the National Education Policy acceptable in the State as there was widespread opposition to it. The Governor should withdraw the appointment and the State Government should intervene and ensure that he does so, the MP said. Meanwhile, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA N. Karthik has urged the Governor-Chancellor to reconsider nominatingMr. Kanagasabapathi to theSyndicate. In a release, Mr. Karthik said the nomination showed the inability of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government in the State to stand up to the BJP government in the Centre. Nomination of a political person to the Syndicate would send a wrong signal and set a bad precedent, the MLA said. The nomination seen along with other recent developments in higher education in the State seemed to indicate that the State Government was not keen on promoting a secular education, he added.  Appointment of a person affiliated to a political party as a Syndicate member of the University is a new practice P.R.

While for people from within the Dindigul district, the e-pass was not required. However, they have to produce a valid photo identity card, they added. Since March 25, when the governments had announced lockdown following the covid-19 spread, the hill station was shut for public entry. For almost five months, there was a total ban on tourists here. Following representations from the trade, hotels and tourist operators' associations to relax the norms and permit tourists, the government relaxed norms in a phased manner. As a sequel to this, the district administration had accorded permission to open only three tourist spots - Bryant Park, Rose Garden and Chettiar Park. All the other spots, including boat rides on the lake, continued to be under the ban. Meanwhile, hoteliers and resort owners in the hill station expressed satisfaction over the relaxation.

10 September 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Meenakshi Bazaar resumes business||Store owners at Meenakshi Bazaar, one of the city’s prominent markets selling cell phones and tech accessories, are relieved to open shops after six months. I. Shirajudeen, a shop owner for over 20 years and secretary, Meenakshi Bazaar Small Traders Association, says when shops were allowed to stay open, people arrived to repair broken screens, repair headsets and buy mobile accessories. Some lined up to purchase second hand mobile phones since working from home and attending online classes has become the norm. Some line up for repairs but many customers cannot afford to buy new phones, he says. V. Dawood Basha, a shop owner, says that all those selling accessories have been managing with stock but are anxious over depletion of stock. For, goods from China are not arriving. Regular supply of cell phone covers, tempered glass and other accessories are unavailable. Others selling cell phones have not been able to sell any device. They come to the shop and wait for customers, he says. V. Madhavan, president of the association, says that there is no possibility of good sales unless tourists arrive in Madurai. Bus service has resumed but it is hard to tell how long it would take for the economy to revive. Unless it picks up, our sales too will remain dull. Allowing free flow of international cargo would also help. He says that all shopkeepers have been told that they cannot sell their products unless they wear masks to ensure proper hygiene during the pandemic. We see police regularly fining those who do not follow social distancing or wear masks. It is strict here," he says. Mr. Basha says that it would be useful if the corporation could consider their situation and reduce the rent levied on shops to ensure their survival. For the past six months, we have not earned anything. It would be useful if the our plea is consdiered, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/meenakshi-bazaar-resumes-business/article32566865.ece
10 September 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC directs State to respond to queries on conduct of probe||Taking into account serious lapses in the investigation in a criminal case, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court put forth a series of queries for the State to respond on knowledge and expertise of investigating officers in conducting criminal investigation and how it was ensured by superior officials. The court was hearing a criminal appeal preferred by Balamurugan from Sivaganga. The trial court had found him guilty of culpable homicide. With several lapses in investigation in the case, the High Court set aside the conviction and acquitted the petitioner. The fine amount paid by him was directed to be refunded. Justice B. Pugalendhi observed that in a case of murder, an officer in the rank of Inspector of Police conducts the investigation and has the assistance of subordinate officers. The superior officials are expected to monitor the investigation. An impartial investigation is the basic requirement for any investigation. “We are taking pride that the Tamil Nadu State Police is one of the best investigation agencies in the world and it is because of the exemplary service rendered by our police officers. We cannot allow this reputation of the agency be eroded by some irresponsible officers”, the Judge said. Further the Judge pointed out that in the recent years, the quality of investigation in the State was considerably decreasing and the conviction rate was slowly declining, while the combined acquittal and discharge rate was on the rise. If the investigation is carried out in such a manner, victims will lose their faith in the system, the court said. In a murder case, if the trial ends in acquittal, a practice was in existence not long ago to call for an explanation from the investigation officer and disciplinary proceedings were initiated, if it was found that the investigation was perfunctory. But it appears that this practice had been given a go by, the Judge said. The court sought State’s response to whether the investigation officer alone was responsible or the superior officers were also responsible in case of lapses of investigation. “Whether the circulars issued by the Director General of Police are being complied with and is there an existing mechanism to enhance the quality of investigation?” The court asked as to why not a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh be awarded to the victim in the present case who suffered because of the perfunctory investigation and the same be recovered from the investigating officers concerned. The case was adjourned to September 22 for filing the response/reply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-state-to-respond-to-queries-on-conduct-of-probe/article32566859.ece

10 September 2020||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Do not cross IMBL, Collector tells fishermen||Making an appeal to the fishermen to ensure safety and not to cross the IMBL (international maritime boundary line), Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao underlined the need for cooperation with security agencies here on Wednesday. Speaking at an awareness-cum-interaction with the fishermen representatives in the district with senior officials from the Coast Guard, INS Parundhu and Naval authorities, he said that the district had close to 1.70 lakh fishermen dependent on fishing activity. There were about 180 hamlets comprising families of fishers in the district. Next to agriculture, fishing activity is the most intense sector in Ramanathapuram. The district, which has the longest coastal stretch, is very close to the international waters. From Dhanushkodi in the district, in just about nine nautical miles, and in about 24 nautical miles from Thondi, the fishermen can reach the international waters or the IMBL. Sharing the need to function within the IMBL, Mr. Rao said that with the northeast monsoon setting in, the fishermen had to be more guarded before venturing into the sea. Similarly, due to unforeseen circumstances or due to natural calamities, the fishermen may either go missing or cross the IMBL. Under such situations, they may have to seek the assistance of the security agencies, he said. The officers and commandants, including Raja Nagendran, K Silambarasan, Anil Kumardas representing the Coast Guard, Navy and INS Parundhu and others attended the meeting. Deputy Director (Fisheries) M.V. Prabhavathi and others spoke. The fishermen representatives assured to cooperate while venturing into the sea. In a brief chat with reporters, Mr. Rao said that in the interest of the fishermen, the governments - State and Centre - conducted awareness programmes on the safety and security aspects at periodic intervals. It was essential to educate the fishermen, especially, during monsoon times. When the sea turned rough or showed signs of bad weather, the fishermen had to stay off from the sea on their own. By doing so, the lives can be safe as otherwise, they may either go missing or unknowingly cross the IMBL, which would be an offence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-cross-imbl-collector-tells-fishermen/article32566871.ece
10 September 2020||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||HM demands CBI inquiry||The Hindu Munnani State president Kadeswara Subramaniam has demanded CBI inquiry into the murder of Arun Prakash by an armed gang here on August 31. Speaking to reporters, he said that the youth, who was actively involved in the Vinayaga chaturthi celebrations, was targeted by an armed gang led by Left Sheik. He added he was involved in many crimes in Ramanathapuram and other districts in Tamil Nadu. Though the intelligence agencies here had "knowledge" about the threat, the murder showed the official machinery’s indifferent attitude. The murder could have been averted by the police. He condemned officers’ claim that the motive behind the murder was rivalry in business. This is nothing but an attempt to divert the probe, he blamed. The Hindu Munnani leader claimed that some of the accused in the Arun Prakash murder also figured in the murder of SSI Wilson case, who was done to death at Kaliyakavilai check post in Kanniyakumari district last year. Similarly, in a case of an attempt-to-murder against a Munnani functionary Saktivel of Tirupulani, the name of Left Sheik figured. Hence, there was an urgent need for the State government to give instructions to the police to step up vigil against such murderers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hm-demands-cbi-inquiry/article32566855.ece

The market, inaugurated three years ago, was built at a cost of Rs. 77 crore in an area of 9.8 acres. The objective was to shift traders at Gandhi Market to the new complex that had 830 shops.

Venkateshwaran, secretary, Andhanallur FPO, said. “We have returned this time in the hope of patronage from more customers and further encouragement from authorities,” he contended.

Krishnan, former Agriculture Minister, said the district administration must close the G- Corner temporary market if they wanted the Kallikudi Market to function successfully.

10 September 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Tougher action likely against COVID-19 norms violators||Even though the corporation and the police are imposing fine on those who violate the COVID-19 norms like wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing, people continue to violate these norms, forcing the urban civic body to be tougher against such violations in the days to come. Governor Banwarilal Purohit recently promulgated an ordinance that made violations of COVID-19 lockdown and physical distancing norms ‘compoundable offences’. The Department of Public Health issued an order that empowered the officials to slap a fine of Rs. 5,000 for violation of standard operating procedure issued for the commercial establishments. Those who do not wear mask in public places will have to pay Rs. 200 as fine and spitting in public places and violation of physical distancing norms will attract the fine of Rs. 500. Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish deployed four inspection teams in Tirunelveli to identify violators and impose fine on them. The teams visit business establishments to check for violations, if any. The Corporation team collected Rs. 2.24 lakh on Tuesday as fine from violators, including those who did not wear mask in public places and maintain physical distancing. “Apart from individuals, business establishments will face fine if they fail to ensure their customers wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing,” Corporation Commissioner G. Kanann warned. However, the number of persons roaming around along roads without mask is on the rise in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai even as the number of COVID-19 positive cases refuses to subside. Moreover, none of the business establishments in the twin towns make sure that their customers were wearing mask and maintain physical distancing on their premises. “We have to bring down the number of fresh cases, which is possible only with the cooperation of the public. Since the public refuse to cooperate, we’ve decided to deploy more teams to fine violators,” says Mr. Kannan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tougher-action-likely-against-covid-19-norms-violators/article32566854.ece

Officials said the dholes, two males and two females, said to be around four-years-old, were found dead on Wednesday. Samples collected A post-mortem was conducted on the carcasses by a veterinarian from Masinagudi. Samples have been collected and sent for forensic testing in Coimbatore and for histopathological analysis in Chennai. Secondary poisoning Deputy Director of MTR (buffer zone), L.C.S. Srikanth, said that forest officials suspected that the dholes could have been killed due to secondary poisoning. “During postmortem, we found the meat of a spotted deer in the stomach of the animals. We suspect that the deer could have fed on crops grown in the area, which may have been grown using pesticides, which in turn affected the animals,” Mr. Srikanth said. Test results He said that only after the test results returned, and the toxin that led to the death of the four animals was identified, could the Forest Department be certain about whether people had poisoned the carcass of the spotted deer. There were concerns among officials that the four animals were poisoned, as they were found dead in the same forest range where an Adivasi woman was mauled to death by a tiger. The death had led to tensions rising between local residents, who had been demanding the capture of the tiger, and the forest officials. Further investigations are on. Endangered species The dhole is classified as an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-wild-dogs-die-of-suspected-poisoning-in-mtr/article32566609.ece

Manickam Tagore has demanded a Supreme Court-monitored Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the “large-scale” irregularities in providing benefits under PM-Kisan scheme to ineligible persons in various districts of Tamil Nadu. Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, he said that such a huge scam could not have happened without the support of the ruling party. Raising suspicion on the role of Bharatiya Janata Party in this scandal through which ineligible persons were given Rs. 6,000 annual assistance that was meant for farmers. “It looks like anyone who had registered themselves through website with their Aadhaar card and bank account details were given the assistance,” he said. It is a dangerous trend, the Virudhunagar MP said.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Bharathidasan University asks government to reimburse salaries of guest faculty||Bharathidasan University (BDU) is understood to have sought from the State government reimbursement of salaries it has been paying to guest lecturers of four of its constituent units even after they were converted into government arts and science colleges. As per official records, salary expenses of 282 guest lecturers in the colleges at Perambalur, Orathanadu, Lalgudi and Aranthangi are being met by the university. When the government passed orders last year converting 14 out of 41 constituent colleges of State universities into government arts and science colleges, the teaching and non-teaching staff of BDU, which has the highest number of 10 constituent units among the State varsities, heaved a sigh of relief in view of the tough financial situation. However, the government is yet to take follow-up measures for the complete takeover of the constituent units, sources said. As per a conservative estimate, the university spends more than Rs. 7 crore to run the constituent units every year. There are a total of 578 guest lecturers in six constituent colleges and four institutions in the converted colleges. Out of them, 322 on consolidated pay and 205 appointed on hourly basis continue to receive their salaries from the university. However, 51 teachers appointed through parent-teacher associations in the constituent colleges have not been paid their salaries during the lockdown period. According to university sources, the possibility to meet the salary expenses of the 51 teachers was bleak due to weak financial situation. Earlier this month, the Finance Committee of Bharathidasan University, at its periodic meeting, urged the State government to reimburse the salary paid to teachers of the converted colleges. The very purpose behind the takeover — to relieve the State universities of considerable financial burden — has been belied, according to functionaries of associations representing teaching and non-teaching staff in Bharathidasan University. The government estimated the takeover of the 41 colleges to entail an expenditure of Rs. 168 crore every year, and citing financial crunch decided to carry out the conversion in three phases. The State universities eagerly expect the government to ease their financial burden on account of the salary for guest lecturers in the converted units so as to focus more on research activities. What is causing worry for the State universities is that there is no sign as yet from the government that the takeover procedure with particular attention on financial expenditure will be completed any time soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bharathidasan-university-asks-government-to-reimburse-salaries-of-guest-faculty/article32566915.ece

The move comes a day after the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for partial reopening of schools for students of classes nine to 12 on “voluntary basis” for taking guidance from their teachers from September 21. Some of the measures mandated are cleaning and regularly disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Teaching material, computers, laptops, and printers are to be disinfected with 70% alcohol wipes, among other measures. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said this would lead to a steep increase in their housekeeping budget. “Even though our costs will increase drastically, we plan to increase the housekeeping fees by just 5% and hope parents understand our plight,” he said. He also said that private schoolswere in a tough situation as many parents had not paid fees for the 2020–21 academic year, leading to salary and job cuts. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said they would have to set up new infrastructure and procure several items such as thermal scanners, besides making their housekeeping staff work extra hours. “All these charges will be bundled under one bracket and termed as ‘COVID fee’. Parents may have to pay between Rs. 150 to Rs. 250 per student per month,” he said. This will be collected only from parents who allow their children to come to school. Meanwhile, schools have also demanded more clarity on how students can be called to schools and what activities are permitted. “The SOP states that students can come to get their doubts clarified if their parents consent. Does this mean that teachers can conduct revision classes in small batches or that they can come to only get feedback on their assignments?” asked Mr. Shashi Kumar. Manila Carvalho, principal of Delhi Public School, Bengaluru East, said although they would be allowed to call students from September 21, they do not plan to open the school this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-private-schools-plan-to-introduce-covid-fees/article32566514.ece
11 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||17.1% of suicides in 2019 linked to illnesses||Of the total 1,39,123 suicide cases reported in India during 2019, 17.1% were due to fear, pain, anxiety and stress caused by illness. According to the recent National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, 23,830 people in the country suffering from various ailments, including cancer, AIDS and paralysis, chose to end their lives in 2019. In fact, after family problems, which accounts for 32.4% of the total suicides, illness is one of the major causes that pushed people to the edge. Two States Maharashtra and Karnataka had the highest number of suicides linked to illness in 2019 with 3,507 and 3,166, respectively. Manipur and Nagaland had the least number with two and three persons, respectively, choosing to end their lives due to illness here. Maharashtra and Karnataka had the highest suicide of persons suffering from paralysis with 244 and 108 cases, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic also had profound psychological and social effects on people across the country. While there is no data on COVID-19 related suicides, five of the 19 deaths of COVID-19 patients in Karnataka categorised as “due to non-COVID causes” are suicides. According to K.V. Trilok Chandra, who heads the State’s Critical Care Support Unit (CCSU), one patient each ended his/her life in the State-run Victoria, Bowring and Lady Curzon and K.C. General hospitals, and one each took the extreme step in Mangaluru and Gadag. “The other non-COVID deaths are due to road traffic accidents and poisoning among other causes,” he said. Mental health counselling has been integrated into treatment now to mitigate the psychological impact and video calls to families are allowed from wards. G. Gururaj, Senior Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at NIMHANS, said suicides are linked to a number of physical and mental health conditions, especially in terminal stages. The risk is associated to be higher with certain chronic conditions such as cancer, brain injury, HIV/AIDS, multiple comorbid conditions. Mental health conditions like depression, mood disorders, substance use disorders and psychosis carry a higher risk of suicide, he said. He pointed out that the nature and extent of suicidal attempts and acts depends on a number of factors like age, gender, nature of medical problem, understanding of the disease by the individual and family, stigmatising nature of illness, extent of pain, disability and distress and others. Many times, availability and affordability of medical care and mental health services makes a significant impact on whether to live or not, he noted. Multiple factors “The unusual and unexpected COVID-19 brought a wide range of things together at one point of time like disease per se, fear, anxiety, frustration, panic, limited medical care in the early stages of pandemic, stigma towards illness, financial distress due to loss of job and income, loss of family support and social isolation of individuals within homes,” Dr. Gururaj pointed out. He said health services and professionals need to respond better in these situations while dealing with chronic terminally ill and at times even with those of acute conditions. Apart from providing improved medical and mental health care to the best possible extent, psychosocial support on a continuous basis through communication and counselling has to be integrated into hospital and public health care systems, he added.  Total number of suicides in 2019: 1,39,123 Suicides because of illness: 23,830 Maharashtra and Karnataka had the highest number of suicides linked to illness with 3,507 and 3,166, respectively Major chunk of suicides due to illness are owing to insanity, mental ailments, and prolonged illnesses Source: NCRB data||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/171-of-suicides-in-2019-linked-to-illnesses/article32566500.ece
10 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘We have a blueprint for current year with reduced stress on exams’||A day after the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for partial reopening of schools for students of classes nine to 12 on a “voluntary basis”, Karnataka’s Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Wednesday said no activity beyond getting doubts clarified would be allowed on the school campus. In the light of the pandemic and time lost this academic year, Mr. Kumar said for the 2020–21 academic year, they had reduced stress on examinations and expect the principles of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) to come in handy. Excerpts from an interview. What is the State government’s plan on implementing the Centre’s direction on partial opening of schools from September 21? The government of Karnataka has in fact gone a step ahead and already arranged regular student-teacher interaction. School premises are not used for teaching and students of all classes can interact with teachers in public places. This has caught the attention of many other States too. Now that the Central government has come up with the SOP for partial resumption of schools, we will have to see diverse possibilities. The direction says students can visit schools for guidance of teachers. Is it only to clarify doubts or to attend classes? On the face of it, it looks like the students are expected to come to schools to clarify their doubts with their teachers. So any activity beyond it is not allowed. We will also see how the Ministry of Education is framing its plan of action based on this SOP by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  More than four months of the academic year has been lost owing to the pandemic. What is the focus for this academic year? It is true that much of the time is lost. Vidyagama and Samveda are designed not just to hone the skills of students but also to continue their academics. If you look at the guidelines of Vidyagama, every minute detail has been addressed there. We already have a blueprint for the current year with a reduced stress on examinations. The principles of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation must come in handy this year for assessing the performance of our children. Will schools bear the expenses of teachers if they test positive for COVID-19? Schools will be expected to exercise all necessary precautions and they are also expected to take care of their teachers as well as their students in the best possible manner.  The principles of CCE must come in handy this year for assessing the performance of our children||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-have-a-blueprint-for-current-year-with-reduced-stress-on-exams/article32566512.ece
10 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lakes overflow; focus shifts to drain management||Commuters driving through Manyata Tech Park were in for a surprise on Wednesday morning – many roads were flooded, and at Chikkabanavara, a road had turned into a rivulet and people stood on the middle of the road trying to catch fish. The heavy rains that lashed the city late on Tuesday and early Wednesday resulted in the filling up of many lakes and overflow from the waste weirs, causing flood water to enter homes, damaging white goods and vehicles. Vidyaranyapura lake (also known as Narasipura lake), Chikkabanavara lake, Singapura lake, Puttenahalli lake, Nagawara lake, Rachenahalli lake, Hebbala lake, Jakkur lake, Yelahanka lake, Sheelavanthakere, Sadaramangala lake were some that have overflowed. Stating that this was a common phenomenon following heavy rainfall, civic activist V. Ramaprasad, co-founder of Friends of Lake, said when a lake overflows through the waste weirs, local communities usually perform a small prayer called ‘Kodi Pooje’. “It is a good sign that the lakes are overflowing. Hopefully, the lakes have been rejuvenated to ensure that the original holding capacity of the water bodies are maintained. Any rejuvenation should take into account the original holding capacity while the Detailed Project Report is being drafted,” he said. Rainwater expert S. Vishwanath said that the lakes are not designed to be flood management structures. While faulting the rajakaluve designs, he said with bunds being created on all sides of lakes, the sheet flow was not getting into the lake, causing it to accumulate and flood surrounding areas. G.S. Srinivas Reddy, former director of Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), stressed on the need to properly assess the carrying capacity of the stormwater drain network in the city. He said common reasons for flooding could be siltation of drains, encroachment and increase in the quantity of runoff. B.S. Prahlad, BBMP’s chief engineer (stormwater drains), claimed the carrying capacity of drains was around 50 mm. He said the city had received nearly 140 mm of rains in the span of a few hours. He claimed that regular maintenance of drains had been taken up across the city and that encroachments were being cleared as and when they were identified. More rain expected Heavy rains are expected to lash the city over the next four days. C.S. Patil, Director (Weather Forecast), Indian Meteorological Department, Bengaluru said with the presence of three systems, monsoon was vigorous over south interior Karnataka and active over north interior Karnataka. The present synoptic conditions are an offshore trough from the Maharashtra coast to north Kerala, a circulation over the Arabian Sea, off the Karnataka coast, and an east-west shear zone over peninsular India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lakes-overflow-focus-shifts-to-drain-management/article32566496.ece

Trains were operated in two shifts from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. Resumption of services on the Green Line received a poor response on the first day. A.S.

We are hoping that in the coming days, ridership will increase.” Passengers were allowed inside the stations after thermal screening and hand sanitisation. As per the SOP, only smart card holders were allowed to travel. To maintain social distancing, 400 people can travel in a six-coach train that has a capacity for close to 2,000 passengers. Hemanth G., a passenger, said, “The BMRCL has taken various safety measures for passengers. Very few are travelling now as many are working from home. In the coming days, the number will increase once the trains are operated for longer hours.” Starting from Friday (September 11), the BMRCL will operate trains from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on both the lines with a frequency of five minutes in peak hours and 10 minutes in non-peak hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/green-line-services-resume/article32566492.ece

A Division Bench issued the direction during the hearing of PIL petitions related to COVID-19 health management. Taking note of increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the State, including in Bengaluru city, the Bench said it is time to ascertain whether the committee has done the duty assigned to it and whether proper health facilities are available in private hospitals. The Bench asked the member-secretary of the committee to submit report within a week on its actions of monitoring the facilities such as availability of medicines, equipment, standard of facilities, treatment and food provided in private hospitals and care centres for COVID-19 patients. Though the apex court had on June 19 directed all the States to immediately set up committees to monitor COVID-19 health facilities, a committee was set up in Karnataka during July-end after the High Court pulled up the government. Wage payment Meanwhile, the Bench directed both the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute and the State government to look into allegations that full wages were not paid to contract labourers and the allegation of “ghost” labourers. The Bench also directed the BMCRI and NIMHANS to inform the court whether they have appointed representatives to certify payment of wages by the contractors to the employees on contract as per Section 21(2) of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 The All India Council of Trade Union, in its petition, had alleged that wages were not being paid in full to the contract employees in Victoria Hospital and there are some names in the rolls of contract worker in the hospital but actually no such persons are working.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-directs-panel-to-give-report-on-facilities-in-private-hospitals/article32566508.ece

Titled ‘Arka tricycles’, they were distributed to a few beneficiaries under the SC Sub-Plan. The IIHR-designed tricycles have a glass-covered area for keeping vegetables and fruits in a hygienic condition. Also, the evaporative cooling condition installed in the vehicle helps in keeping the produce fresh for at least 36 to 48 hours from the time of harvest.

10 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cubbon Park opens for traffic despite protests||The city’s prime green space, Cubbon Park, was opened for vehicular traffic on Wednesday morning following an order from the State government. The park was closed for vehicular movement since imposition of the lockdown. Citizens’ groups have been demanding prohibiting the entry of vehicles inside the park. When the gates were opened for motorists in the morning, some citizen activists staged a protest. A senior official of the Horticulture Department said, “On Tuesday evening, the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority headed by the Chief Secretary took a decision to allow vehicular movement, and we have gone by that. The park was closed for traffic movement for close to six months. Traffic has been allowed from Hudson Circle and other sides.” The order issued by member secretary of the Authority, Anjum Parwez, stated that departments concerned must follow the national and State government guidelines on containing the spread of COVID-19 by opening parks and roads within parks that were in use prior to imposition of lockdown for the general public. On Wednesday, the Revenue Department also issued an order allowing the general public inside the parks and to use the roads inside the parks as was being done prior to the lockdown. It is not only citizens’ groups, even some government agencies have been advocating prohibiting traffic movement inside the park located in the Central Business District. The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) had written to the government recently recommending preservation of the green space and banning motorised vehicles. The BBMP council too passed a resolution supporting the citizens’ groups. However, the city traffic police asked the government to allow traffic, reasoning that banning of vehicles in the park would result in traffic congestion in the CBD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cubbon-park-opens-for-traffic-despite-protests/article32566490.ece

The legislature session is scheduled from September 21 to 30. In a letter to Mr. Kageri on Wednesday, the Congress leader said the session has been called for just eight days and it needs to be extended to enable members to participate in fruitful discussions. Many people in the State have been facing unprecedented difficulties owing to floods and COVID-19. More than 6,500 people have succumbed to the pandemic in the State. Besides law and order issues, the drug racket has been spreading its wings in the State, he said. Stating that the eight-day session was inadequate for detailed discussion of Bills, the former Chief Minister said the BJP government seems to be making efforts to clear all Ordinances and Bills in the legislature without discussions. “The government’s conduct is unconstitutional in this regard,” he said. As per the law, the government should convene the session four times for a minimum 60 days in a year. But the BJP government has been continuously “undermining” the parliamentary system, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/extend-session-says-siddaramaiah/article32566509.ece

A delegation of KFCC comprising chairman Jairaj and actors Shivarajkumar and Yash among others pointed out that Telangana had made such a recommendation to the GST council. At the same time, they demanded that the government bring down the ticket rates in multiplexes to Rs. 200. The multiplexes had challenged the government’s order in this regard on the basis of technicalities as the order had been issued by the Information Department instead of Home Department, they said, and appealed to the government to rectify it. The delegation appealed to Chief Minister to reimburse the SGST with respect to the Kannada cine sector to the producers concerned. The delegation explained that the Kannada cine world had faced losses even in the earlier regime when the State had declared complete tax holiday for it. But now, they have to compete with other language films as there is an uniform tax for all in the GST regime, they pointed out.   Piracy in lockdown Alleging that cine producers and the government were facing losses during lockdown due to piracy that had resulted in streaming of films through OTT media services without getting permission from producers, the delegation demanded that a separate cyber cell be set up to look into these issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/film-chamber-seeks-gst-exemption-for-single-screens/article32566519.ece

10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,KARNATAKA||Consortium terms varsity decision ‘arbitrary, irrational’||The Consortium of National Law Universities told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the decision taken by the Bengaluru-based National Law School India University (NLSIU) to disregard the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) and conduct their own separate entrance test is “arbitrary, irrational, and fanciful”. Faizan Mustafa, secretary of the consortium, said the NLSIU’s move has put aspirants under “tremendous mental stress”. They have to now appear for two tests instead of one for admission to national law universities. CLAT is now scheduled for September 29 while the controversial National Law Admission Test Under Graduate (NLAT-UG) – 2020, conducted exclusively by the NLSIU, is on September 12. Mr. Mustafa, Vice-Chancellor of NALSAR in Hyderabad and represented by advocate K. Parameshwar, was responding on behalf of the consortium to a petition filed by the former Vice-Chancellor of the NLSIU R. Venkat Rau, along with a parent. Mr. Rau, represented by advocate Vipin Nair, described NLAT as an “elitist” online admission process. He said the suddennotification by the NLSIU about a separate admission test has left thousands of aspirants in a state of fear and confusion. Mr. Mustafa, in his turn, said the NLSIU has no powers to devise an independent admission process. The NLSIU has gone against the “core values of the consortium and policies and decisions of the governing body”. He said this turn of events undermined the very basis of legal education in the country. The consortium said even the updated technical requirements for conducting NLAT online was not enough. Mr. Mustafa said technical requirements like 1 Mbps bandwidth, laptops which are audio and video enabled, etc, “suffer the vice of discrimination” and creates inequities. The consortium dismissed as “flawed” the NLSIU’s defence that NLAT was devised to avert the prospect of a ‘zero year’, which had loomed heavy due to the continued delays in the conduct of CLAT.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/consortium-terms-varsity-decision-arbitrary-irrational/article32566507.ece
10 September 2020||Sagar (Shivamogga district),KARNATAKA||A pvt. forest shows the way in conservation||What was once 21 acres of barren land has turned into a thick forest over the last 10 years at Amatekoppa, about 8 km from Sagar in Shivamogga district, thanks to the efforts of two friends. Hundreds of birds, reptiles, and wild animals roam in the forest created on the private land which is now covered by innumerable varieties of plants. B.V. Suresh Kumar, who runs a software firm in Bengaluru, purchased the 21 acres by paying Rs. 1.5 crore in 2008. The previous owner had a nilgiri plantation on the land, and he cut the trees before selling the land. Mr. Kumar did not want to utilise the land for commercial purposes; he wanted to use it for public good. He approached his friend Akhilesh Chippali, an environmentalist, for suggestions. “I suggested that he create a forest on the land. He readily agreed and I took up the responsibility,” said Mr. Chippali, who also works as a physiotherapist in Sagar. He began his work in 2010 with the support of the landowner. “Initially, it was a tough task. I literally cried many days when the plants died within days of planting. The fast-growing nilgiri had emptied the nutrition in the soil,” he said. For years, he travelled to the land, about 7 km from his house at Chippali-Lingadahalli village, and observed the vegetation. The local species survived and showed signs of growth. By the fourth year, he regained confidence. Over the years, he planted about 5,000 saplings of bamboo, honne, and many fruit-bearing species. “The number of saplings I planted is negligible considering the number of plants that grew on their own on the land. All I did was protect them with fencing and providing water using tankers during the summer,” he said. Now, the 21 acres is a thick forest and has been named Ushakirana forest, as per the suggestion of the landowner. Mr. Kumar, happy with the forest, has been supporting monetarily to conserve it. A family stays in a house built on the land. “The owner spends nearly Rs. 3 lakh annually to maintain the forest,” said Mr. Chippali. Amit Hegde, a field biologist, has made a database of fauna found in the 21-acre forest. “The study showed 159 varieties of birds, besides many reptiles, amphibians, and other wild animals in the area. We will soon be drawing up a flora database as well,” he said. This year, he has taken up construction of a tank with a capacity to hold 65 lakh litres of water. This exercise has been applauded by many people. Interestingly, two people have come forward to create forests on their private land following this example. He has also rejuvenated two tanks in his village with the support of villagers and donors as well. Karnataka Bank has supported the tank rejuvenation activity by providing Rs. 7 lakh for two tanks. “We need to show the world that we can create forests and rejuvenate waterbodies even as many government policies and projects are harming the Western Ghats,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-pvt-forest-shows-the-way-in-conservation/article32566521.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Vaccination trials: 220 volunteers to take part in second phase||Over 220 volunteers are expected to take part in the second phase of two different sets of COVID-19 vaccine trials in Belagavi this week. As many as 170 will be enlisted for ZyCoV-D, developed by Ahmedabad based Zydus Cadila pharmaceutical company. The rest have been vaccinated with COVXIN, developed by Bharat Biotech. Both the trials are being run in Jeevan Rekha hospital, a private hospital in front of the district civil hospital. Belagavi is the only place in the State selected for COVAXIN trials and one of the seven across India for ZyCoV-D. Paritosh Desai, senior scientist involved in the trials, said both the vaccines had proved safe in the first round of trials. “Now we are testing the effectiveness of the vaccine in the second phase,” he said. He said the hospital was likely to conduct a third set of trials for the AD 2 COV2S being developed by Bio Epharma company from Hyderabad. The trial is not confirmed yet, he said. Healthy participants have been selected for the first phase and second phase of trials. The reports are routinely sent to ICMR for validation. COVID-19 vaccine in very small amounts is injected into the blood stream of volunteers. They are sent home after the vaccination. They are observed for a period of 28 days, at the end of which the antibodies in their blood are counted. The other possible effects in their immune system and other conditions are observed. “The second phase of ZyCoV-D is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in larger sample size. It is a plasmid DNA vaccine candidate. If injected into host cells, such molecules are known to translate into the viral protein and trigger a strong cellular and humoral immune response,” Amit Bhate, director of Jeevan Rekha hospital, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-trials-220-volunteers-to-take-part-in-second-phase/article32566698.ece

A virtual public consultation on the project has been scheduled on September 23. A CfB release said they met BDA Commissioner H.R. Mahadev and handed over a petition. “He mentioned that the PRR project alignment has changed and that the new DPR is not final,” the release said. “CfB believes that due process on the PRR project is being violated. The public is not only entitled to an accurate DPR, the current public consultation process is meaningless given the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is based on the old alignment and has no standing in view of the changed alignment. The PRR process of conducting an EIA even before concluding the alignment and a public consultation, that too without the DPR, is a sham given the changes,” the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-at-bda-against-peripheral-ring-road/article32566499.ece

10 September 2020||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Land acquisition delays bridge over Pampa||The process of acquiring land for the construction of a bridge across the Pampa river connecting Kavalam and Thattassery in Kuttanad will be expedited. A meeting chaired by District Collector A. Alexander on Monday decided to initiate immediate steps to acquire the land needed for the project. The move comes after an inordinate delay in land acquisition. Earlier this year, a report submitted by a private agency after conducting a social impact assessment was approved. However, a survey later conducted found that some of the land needed for the project was missing from the notification issued, which brought the entire process to a halt. In 2016, the State government allocated Rs. 30 crore for the construction of the bridge and the approach road. The estimate was later revised to Rs. 51.5 crore following changes made in the design. The original plan was to acquire the land through direct negotiated purchase. However, some landowners demanded a change in the alignment. As the alignment was fixed by the Inland Waterways Authority, officials rejected their demand. Later, the Revenue Department ended the move to acquire land through negotiated purchase. Following this, in November 2018 the department announced that the Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act would be invoked to acquire land for the construction of the bridge and the landowners were given time till December 1, 2018, to hand over the consent letters. However, the authorities failed to take follow-up action until the turn of this year. The bridge will connect the Alappuzha-Changanassery (AC) road and Main Central (MC) road. It will help reduce the distance between Alappuzha and Kottayam by around 9 km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/land-acquisition-delays-bridge-over-pampa/article32566894.ece

10 September 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||A salon to break social inequality||A first in the State, a grama panchayat has taken the initiative to open a salon. The Vattavada grama panchayat decided to open a salon with a view to breaking the caste system. The salon will be opened on September 14. The panchayat took the initiative as hairdressers refused to attend on people belonging to a particular caste. When the issue was raised before panchayat authorities by a few youths, the panchayat gave a directive to hairdressers to treat people equally. But it had little impact as those salons that followed the directive faced a social boycott. The authorities then asked all salons in the village to close down from August 13 and a discussion was held on September 6. “Meanwhile, we took steps to open a salon under the grama panchayat where all could go. A hairdresser was given charge and a building under the panchayat is being refurnished. It will be opened on September 14,” grama panchayat secretary R. Nandakumar said. “Anyone can go there and no one will be discriminated against,” he said. Vattavada, a vegetable cultivating village 42 km from Munnar, has a predominantly Tamil origin population. “However, the Chakliya community members were discriminated against and barred from saloons made use of by others,” said a ward member. “When the efforts of the grama panchayat to set things right failed, it decided to open the alternative channel,” he said. Strict action Now all salons in the village are closed and they will be allowed to function only if they attend to all without social discrimination, the panchayat authorities said. Till recently, certain castes were forbidden from drinking tea in glass from tea shops. They were served tea in coconut shells. With the new salon, the ice is expected to break in Vattavada.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-salon-to-break-social-inequality-in-kerala/article32566487.ece

10 September 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Finally, Alan and Thaha get bail||Finding that there existed “rational and reasonable doubts in the question of prima facie charges against the accused,” a NIA special court granted Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal bail in the Pantheerankavu Maoist case on Wednesday. They have been in jail since November 1. Allowing the bail, NIA special judge Anil K. Bhaskar noted that it could be “never said that the movement and the activities of the accused were wholly controlled by the banned organisation”. Charge dropped Prima facie there existed many missing links in establishing that the accused were the cadres of the CPI(Maoist) and their movements and activities were controlled by the organisation as contended by the National Investigation Agency. Though the accused were initially booked for being members of the terrorist organisation, the charge was dropped from the chargesheet after the completion of the investigation. Right now, even the prosecution does not have a case that the accused are members of the banned organisation, the court noted. The slapping of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the accused by the LDF government had triggered a political debate, with CPI(M) leaders, including M. A. Baby, condemning it. Noting that there was not even a single allegation of violent overact against the accused, the court said that it only “indicated a leaning on the side of the accused towards this banned organisation”. ‘No violent acts’ Regarding the allegations that Fazal was in possession of the constitution of the banned organisation, its flag, and a magazine published by it, the judge noted that since no specific violent overact had been attributed against the accused, it was not possible to prove any nexus between the accused and the terrorist activities. None of the witnesses had given any specific statement to the effect that the accused were the members of the organisation and they had in any way aided or abetted the terrorist activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/finally-alan-and-thaha-get-bail/article32566814.ece

The Mayor has asked the Corporation Secretary and the officials concerned to look into the issues raised by the report and ratify them. After the Opposition objected to the hurried discussion of audit reports for the past four financial years and utilisation of the 2014-15 Mayor’s development fund at a single council meeting, only the recently released audit report for 2018-19 was discussed at the special meeting held at the Ernakulam Town Hall in keeping with the COVID-19 protocol on Wednesday. The Opposition LDF pointed to the issues with tax collection that the recent audit report submitted by the Local Fund Audit Department had raised, including reusing of cancelled receipts for tax collection. With regard to expenditure, auditors had blocked the spending of Rs. 24.85 crore in the absence of vouchers and sufficient explanations for spending, said V.P. Chandran, LDF parliamentary party secretary. The opposition raised objections about the sale of the Mayor’s official car to a private individual and said the Mayor could not provide sufficient explanation for it. Ms. Jain countered that there had not been any violation of norms in the auctioning of the car and the purchase of a new one. It was authorised by the finance standing committee and the council, and the Secretary will now look into the allegations, she said. According to the Kerala Municipality (Manner of Inspection and Audit System) Rules, 1997, the audit report is to be discussed at a special council meeting convened for the purpose within a month of receiving the report, the Opposition pointed out. “But after this corporation council came to power, audit reports have not been discussed at all. The problems raised have not been remedied and officials responsible for inconsistencies have not been held accountable,” Mr. Chandran said. Speaking to The Hindu , Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar said, “The audit report is not the final word. In several years, the audit report has been discussed in the council only once.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/oppn-walks-out-of-council-meet/article32566784.ece

The push on infrastructure development received a boost with the completion of tender proceedings for the new college auditorium and the construction of a second floor for the department of chemistry. The foundation stone for the state-of-the-art auditorium, spread over 3,800 square metres, will be laid soon. The old auditorium will be demolished, and the new one is expected to be ready for inauguration in 18 months. “The highlights of the three-storey auditorium are open-air amphitheatre, hall and balcony with seating capacity for 700 and 350 people respectively, and adequate parking area on the ground floor,” said P.K. Raveendran, chairman of the governing council of the college. The present auditorium was constructed in 1975 on the centenary of the college. The decision to construct a new auditorium emerged in view of the structural shortcomings, he added. The State government had sanctioned Rs. 30 crore for Maharaja’s College under the category of ‘heritage colleges’ with funds from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). Of this, Rs. 11.69 crore will be used for the construction of the new auditorium. Kitco had drafted the project document. The modernisation of the heritage block and construction of compound wall are complete. Work on the three-storey academic block at a cost of Rs. 9.45 crore and a library complex worth Rs. 11.69 crore is nearing completion. They will be inaugurated in November. The present teachers’ hostel will be converted into a guest house to accommodate faculty members from abroad and other places visiting the campus. It will have all modern facilities. Work on the guest house and the second floor of the chemistry department will begin soon. Mr. Raveendran said work on hostels for teachers and students at the present hostel compound was progressing. The authorities had earmarked Rs. 10 crore for the new buildings. The construction of drainage, which is part of the first phase of work, is also on, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/major-infrastructure-push-for-maharajas-college/article32566791.ece

The Director, General Education, has been told to prepare a report based on the SOPs. The guidelines issued on Tuesday allow students of senior classes to attend schools outside containment zones on a voluntary basis from September 21. The Cabinet will discuss whether schools can reopen in a staggered manner. A decision is expected by next week. The Centre had already informed that each State can take its own call based on the local pandemic situation, according to senior officials of the Education Department. Teacher deployment The report to be drafted by the Director of General Education will include the district-wise scenario. It will have suggestions on whether a teacher deployment plan can be worked out. The department will take into account the feedback given by the Health, Transport, and Police Departments on whether a partial reopening of schools can be done as it involves several challenges and logistic issues, they said. The Ministry of Health had said that online/distance learning shall continue and be encouraged and students of Classes 9 to 12 shall be permitted to visit their school on voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers. This will be subject to written consent of their parents/guardians. The guidelines say all work areas intended for teaching and demonstration, including laboratories and common utility areas, shall be sanitised prior to resumption of activities with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Staggered manner The visits of students to schools and teacher-student interaction must be organised in a staggered manner. Students, teachers, and employees living in containment zones will not be allowed to attend the school. Students, teachers and employees are advised not to visit areas falling within containment zones, the guidelines say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/partial-reopening-of-schools-in-state-being-explored/article32566808.ece

It is likely to go up next year, considering the economic and emotional distress caused by the pandemic,” said Rajesh R. Pillai, president, Befrienders India. The organisation used to conduct physical activities on World Suicide Prevention Day and create awareness about the scourge. However, the raging pandemic has put paid to any such plan this year, compelling Befrienders India to take the campaign online. “The yellow ribbon movement has come to signify the campaign for suicide prevention and hence the concept Go Yellow Kerala,” Mr. Pillai said. People can upload their minute-long videos in yellow in Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter and urge their followers to follow suit to spread the message of suicide prevention. The videos — in the form of poems, paintings, or songs — could be tagged with their friends and Befrienders India Facebook page.

10 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||High Court finds flaws in probe in POCSO cases||The Kerala High Court has issued a host of directives, including appointment of a woman IPS officer in every district to oversee the investigations of cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), and establishment of One-Stop Support Centres as directed by the Supreme Court to protect the victims and plug the loopholes in the implementation of the provisions of the Act. Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar issued the directives as it had noticed certain fundamental flaws in the investigation of the cases. The court, while dealing with a POCSO-related case, found that the child victims were deprived of their valuable rights to avail themselves of legal aid and various other benefits. The court directed the State Police Chief to designate a woman IPS officer in every district to ensure that the investigations of POCSO cases were conducted, strictly adhering to the provisions of the POCSO Act. Trained officials The IPS officer so designated shall ensure that investigation of the cases are conducted only by the officers trained in Juvenile Justice Principle. The officer shall ensure that evidence to prove the sexual abuse through physical as well as behavioural indicators are also collected in every case. The court directed the State to take steps to enable the Kerala Legal Services Authority to disburse compensation to victims and to ensure that no victims are made to wait for the compensation. The court directed the government to appoint a nodal officer within two months to coordinate the activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-finds-flaws-in-probe-in-pocso-cases/article32566795.ece
10 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Periye: bail petitions dismissed||Observing that the case relating to the murder of two Youth Congress leaders in Periya, Kasaragod, was grave and serious, the Kerala High Court has dismissed the bail petitions of all the eleven accused in the case. The murder of Youth Congress workers Kripesh, 21, and Sarath Lal, 24, took place at Kallyot, near Periye, on February 17, 2019. The High Court has already ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case. The court also observed that there were sufficient materials collected during the probe by the Crime Branch to prove the involvement of the accused in the crime. It added that the apprehension of the prosecution that, if the petitioners who belonged to a prominent political party were released on bail, they would try to influence or intimidate the witnesses could not be ignored. Meanwhile, the parents of the deceased persons withdrew a contempt-of-court case filed against the State Police Chief for not handing over the case files to the CBI. When the petition came up before the court, the prosecutor submitted that the petition was not maintainable as a Division Bench had already upheld the order for CBI probe by a single judge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/periye-bail-petitions-dismissed/article32566812.ece
10 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||A youngster’s inspiring fight to beat odds||For 14-year-old Shravan, life has been a succession of tragedies. Born with a rare disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, the youngster from Edavanakkad faced the risk of breaking his bones if he as much as had a rough sneeze. His fragile health meant that Shravan never experienced a normal school life, restricted as he was to home-schooling all along. Fate further dealt a merciless blow, when his mother, his single biggest pillar of support, fell prey to cancer three years ago, driving him to the edge of depression. And then, he lost his father last June, leaving him orphaned for good. “Having never gone outside his home and interacted with anyone other than his parents, the thought of being put under institutional care turned him into an emotional wreck. That is when he moved in with us. His doctor says his condition will be much better around the age of 20, and we are prepared to look after him as long as it takes,” said Aswathy Sajilkumar, a relative who lives in Shravan’s neighbourhood. He was admitted to SDPY KPM High School, Edanavakkad, last year, again in the home-school category. Now in the ninth standard, things have started looking up for the youngster who is passionate about drawing. “He is very good in studies, and his emotional state is also much better, with children of his age visiting him under the Student Police Cadet (SPC) and Junior Red Cross initiatives of the school. He is also very good with pencil drawing, especially animation-like 3D images of automobiles and streets,” said Iby J. Vevukatt, one of the two special educators assigned to him from the Block Resource Centre, Vypeen. She shared the drawings of Shravan in social media recently. “Those images caught the attention of the old students association of the school who gifted him with a laptop loaded with animation tools on Independence Day, so that he could pursue a profession of his choice. Even before he was admitted to our school, we used to donate him with drawing kits under the SPC,” said K.G. Harikumar, the teacher who is in charge of the SPC at the school. Apart from the special educators, other teachers at the school used to drop in at his home to teach him after school hours. The pandemic, however, has put paid to that arrangement, and classes and notes are now mostly shared over WhatsApp. If not for the pandemic, Shravan would have had the opportunity to attend school for the first time this academic year. “A Thripunithura-based NGO had contributed him a wheel chair that would have helped him go to school at least sparingly. The school was also prepared to make arrangements on the ground floor for his classes,” said Ms. Vevukatt. Now, all that Shravan wants is for the virus to just fade away, so that he can go to school like other children of his age.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-youngsters-inspiring-fight-to-beat-odds/article32566782.ece
10 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Pandemic curbs: fishers to call on Ministers||Members of the Cochin Fishing Harbour Coordination Committee are expected to meet Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar, who is coordinating anti-COVID-19 operations in the district, and Minister for Fisheries J. Mercykutty Amma on Saturday to discuss the issue of continuing restrictions on fishing operations from the Thoppumpady harbour. Activities at Kerala’s biggest fishing harbour had only partially resumed in the second week of August after the 52-day trawling ban, pandemic restrictions, and bad-weather warnings. District Fisheries Coordination Committee convenor Charles George said around 650 gillnet and pole and line fishing boats continued to stay idle, as fishers from the neighbouring Tamil Nadu were not allowed to use the harbour as their base for operations. Almost the entire lot of the boats are operated by fishers from Thuthoor, Vallavila, Valiyavila and Chinnathura. Just around 60 purse seine boats and 70 trawlers operate out of the Thoppumpady harbour now, throwing all hope of an economic revival of West Kochi into disarray, said Mr. Charles. The Thoppumpady harbour is the economic lifeline of West Kochi, with around 5,000 people having direct employment at the harbour and associated facilities. Meanwhile, fishers at the Munambam fisheries harbour, under a full lockdown till September 11, also expressed regret over the current situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-curbs-fishers-to-call-on-ministers/article32566789.ece
10 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Uncertainty looms over future of FRBL||Uncertainty continues to loom over the future of FACT-RCF Building Products Limited (FRBL) after the unit shut down operations in December last year. The gypsum panels and wall putty producer is a joint venture between Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF), Mumbai. The unit temporarily wound up operations following a court order. FRBL had run into trouble with its lenders. The company repaid around Rs. 63 crore in 2018, while another Rs. 22 crore is outstanding. The lender, a Mumbai-based cooperative bank, approached the court, which temporarily froze its operations. The glass fibre-reinforced gypsum panel, built mostly using the idling stock of gypsum on the FACT campus in Kochi, is an eco-friendly and cost-effective substitute for traditional building materials. The closure of the company has plunged hundreds of projects into uncertainty and thrown around 5,000 workers out of their regular jobs in construction units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/uncertainty-looms-over-future-of-frbl/article32566794.ece
10 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Oppression a trigger to embrace Maoism: Judge||Oppression faced by the weaker sections of society may be influencing and tempting a number of persons towards Maoist philosophy, according to the Kochi Special Court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Granting bail to Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal arrested under the Unlawful (Activities) Prevention Act (UAPA) in Kozhikode, Special Judge Anil K. Bhaskar noted that it was impossible to hold all such persons as members of the terrorist organisation. While granting bail, the court warned the accused that the “chance offered by the court for the reformation shall not be mistaken as an opportunity to fasten their bond with banned terrorist organisation and to be part of it.” Though the prosecution, the court noted, was “able to establish that the accused had associated with and supported CPI(Maoist) organisation, it is doubtful whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie case regarding their affiliation and support to the banned organisation with the intent to encourage, promote or facilitate the commission of terrorist organisations.” On the allegation that Usman distributed notices supporting CPI(Maoist), the court noted that the contents of the notice suggested that he solicited the support of the public to the Maoist organisation who were fighting to establish a neo-democratic India. There was nothing in the notices to instigate terror or to entice violence to achieve the objective, the order said. The court viewed the shouting of slogans by Fasal in support of Maoism and Naxabari as his inclination towards Maoist ideology and said it cannot be be construed as an indication that he stepped into the path of violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/oppression-a-trigger-to-embrace-maoism-judge/article32566815.ece

The decision to reopen the mall was taken after a conciliatory meeting convened by District Collector S.Sambasiva Rao with the the Unity Group of Kudumbashree, which manages the mall, and women entrepreneurs a few days ago. The mall will be reopened based on the suggestions of the Collector. “We had expressed our wish to continue with the project, but the huge financial burden could not be managed. The Collector suggested that a fresh set of contracts be drawn for those who wished to continue with the project and also for entrepreneurs to clear their rent dues,” secretary of the group K. Vijaya said. Also, arrangements have been made with Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode to assume the role of financial consultant for the project. “Measures to improve the popularity of the mall, including introduction of new facilities and entrepreneurs, will be planned in due course,” she said The mall was launched in November, 2018, as the first mall with an all-women crew and was inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. But it was hardly a smooth sail for the crew despite the glorious start. Many entrepreneurs left the venture midway. Recently, the management had served a notice on entrepreneurs to clear their rent dues and vacate as they were planning to wind up the project. This led to a series of protests and court cases in which the entrepreneurs pointed out that they wanted to continue in the mall as they had already made huge investments in their shops. Several political parties and cultural organisations had turned up in support of the entrepreneurs. In the meeting convened at the Collectorate, Unity Group agreed to reopen the mall and operate it for one month, by which time all dues have to be cleared and new contracts will be drawn. “We will make an effort to reduce the rent from next month onwards,” Ms. Vijaya said adding that at least 15 entrepreneurs had surpassed the period of 10 months without rent, which could be adjusted from their advance payments. On the other hand, the Collector had asked the entrepreneurs to let the District Mission Coordinator (DMC) of Kudumbashree know of their stand in the issue. Accordingly, some of the entrepreneurs have submitted individual letters to DMC P.C. Kavitha in which some have expressed their wish to continue their association with the mall while most were indecisive. Meanwhile, the management has started the proceedings to reopen the mall with a cleaning drive, so that the entrepreneurs could move in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mahila-mall-to-reopen-in-a-week/article32566775.ece

Official sources said that the retendering process would be initiated before the three-tier local body polls so that the new firm could be finalised to start work early next year. The whole process would take at least six months. However, National Highways Authorities of India (NHAI) sources said cost escalation would have to be made in the new provisions of the contract and approved by the Ministry. The contract for Kozhikode bypass widening project had been signed between the Ministry and Krishna Mohan Construction Private Limited on April 18, 2018. All these months, the proposed multicrore project to expand the 28.8-km Kozhikode bypass had been going through a rough patch with the company failing to secure bank guarantee of Rs. 85.50 crore for almost a year. The construction work should have begun in September 2018 and completed around April-May this year. Multiple extensions given to the company to secure bank guarantee failed to yield any results. Later, with the support of the State government, INKEL Ltd. (formally Infrastructure Kerala Limited), a public-private partnership company, decided to step in to partner the project. However, the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 further delayed the decision on the joint venture. And finally, the NHAI decided to cancel the contract. Incidentally, it also did not consider the tenders of other firms that bid for the project. Four companies, including the Vadakara-based Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), had bid for the project, sources said. The expansion of the bypass was envisaged under the National Highway Development Project Phase III. The proposal includes the construction of four major bridges, a minor bridge, seven flyovers, two vehicle underpasses, 17 pedestrian underpasses, 64 pipe culverts and 39 box culverts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/highways-authority-likely-to-retender-bypass-work/article32566774.ece

Soon, they contacted an animal rights group in Thiruvalla, which then rushed to the spot and rescued the animal. According to officials, the goal was to rehabilitate the animal and ‘ensure that the animal gets the love and care it wants.’ Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police (South Zone) Harshita Attaluri here on Wednesday reviewed the progress of the investigation and held discussions with the District Police Chief K.G.

The oarsmen, representing various Palliyoda committees, will reach the temple ghats in the Pampa on board the snakeboat and will be accorded a customary reception. Keeping with the tradition, a team of devotees from the Chenappadi village in Kottayam on Wednesday visited the temple and supplied the specially prepared curd for the feast. Vallasadya, an important ritualistic offering by the devotees to the presiding deity at the Aranmula temple had been witnessing huge public participation over the years. As per estimates, close to one lakh people attended the event in the previous year. Meanwhile, a team of officials from the Health Department and the police will be present to ensure strict implementation of the social distancing norms during the Vallasadya on Thursday. Prior to preparing the feast, the chief chef and his assistants were subjected to serum test to confirm them negative for SARS-CoV-2. The move, according to the authorities, was in line with a decision by the authorities to organise the Vallasadya this year in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vallasadya-to-be-held-at-aranmula-today/article32566889.ece

10 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Pandemic blues continue to loom large over weddings||For years, Murali has been working as the manager of a medium-sized wedding hall in Thirumala in the capital. Until March this year, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it was almost smooth sailing for him. With public gatherings becoming impossible and wedding halls forced to down their shutters, many like him were forced to look for other avenues. Since April, he has been farming in a small plot of land that he owns. “I am cultivating plantain and other vegetables. Some of it got damaged in the rains. Most of the workers in this sector have now taken up other jobs to survive. Some of our cleaning staff are now working as domestic helps in households, while some others are going for other daily wage work,” says Murali. Most wedding halls in the State remain closed since March 12. Even though the government has allowed functions with 50 guests since June, people are opting to hold smaller functions at home. The government has now allowed functions with 100 guests from September 21, but wedding hall owners remain sceptical. Allied sectors The crisis has hit many who work in allied sectors depending on the big wedding industry, right from wedding photographers to flower traders to event managers, catering units, and decorators. “This is the longest stretch without work. Most of us are keeping afloat due to savings. But those who have recently invested in costly equipment are struggling,” says a wedding photographer. The wedding hall owners, especially the smaller ones, are struggling to pay their employees and repay the advance amounts for bookings that were cancelled. “For the first few months, we managed to pay all the staff. But now with the smaller gatherings and lesser number of weddings, most of us cannot afford to keep all the staff. We had availed ourselves of a loan to repay some of the advance amounts. The GST amounts on these cancelled bookings will not be coming back to us any time soon and will be adjusted only on future bookings,” says Rarith, managing director of RDR Auditorium in Thiruvananthapuram Anand Kannassa, president of the Auditorium Owners’ Welfare Association, says only a handful of weddings have happened after the partial lifting of restrictions. Since they have to get police permission to organise in halls now, people opt to organise it at home. The government should fix the number of persons allowed as per the size of the hall. There should be relaxations in fixed charges in electricity bills and building tax, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-blues-continue-to-loom-large-over-weddings/article32566832.ece
10 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Three fishers drown in sea||Three fishermen lost their lives after their boat capsized in strong winds in the sea off Anchuthengu in the district on Wednesday. The deceased were identified as Thankachan Elias, 55, Alex, 47, and Praveen, 33. Thankachan Elias hails from Anchuthengu, Alex from Kadayilpurayidam and Praveen from Madanvilakam. They were part of a six-member crew in the boat. Rescued Three others, Stephen, Biju and Raju, were picked up by the crew of another boat. The incident occurred around Wednesday noon. The fishermen, who had set out from Anchuthengu in the morning, were on their way back when the boat capsized, caught in a sudden gust. Rough seas were forecast since September 6 when a low pressure area had formed in the Arabian Sea. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had warned fishermen not to venture out to sea, as squally weather was expected along Kerala, Karnataka and Lakshadweep coasts. The mishap occurred some five to six kilometres off the Anchuthengu coast. The bodies of all three men were recovered and shifted to the Taluk Hospital at Anchuthengu. Close call On September 6, two fishermen from the district had a close call when they fell overboard from their boat near the Vizhinjam harbour. The men were rescued by the crew of another fishing boat. Strong winds with speeds touching 45 to 55 kmph are expected along the Kerala, Karnataka and Lakshadweep coasts till Friday. High wave alert The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has also issued a high wave alert for the Kerala coast, which is valid till Thursday night.  Rough seas had been forecast since September 6 when a low pressure area had formed in the Arabian Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-fishers-drown-in-sea/article32566488.ece
10 September 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Private hospitals in preparatory mode||With the COVID-19 epidemic curve in the State expected to scale the peak in the coming weeks, major private hospitals offering tertiary care are now in a preparatory mode, anticipating that they may be called in for providing critical care for COVID patients with complications. “In all districts, at least four or five major private hospitals each will be able to provide critical care and in the next two weeks, we believe that at least 80 to 90 hospitals will be ready to step in as and when the situation turns,” says A.V. Jayakrishnan, chairman, IMA Hospital Board of India. Many private hospitals are now treating patients who come in for general care and then get tested positive for COVID-19 or their staff members who contract the disease. Smaller hospitals who find COVID-19 cases in their general patient pool refer them for care to either a government or private hospital. “Though most hospitals are ready, not all have begun admitting patients because till now the patient numbers have been manageable within the public health system. Now that all asymptomatic or very mild cases (Category A patients) are being given the option of home care, things have been easier,” says P. Gopikumar, State president, Indian Medical Association.  Cost of care The government has already fixed the cost of care that private hospitals may charge patients enrolled under the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Paddhati and those patients whom government refers. Accordingly, ICU care for critically ill patients (without ventilator) will be Rs. 6,500 a day and ICU care with ventilator Rs. 11,500 a day. However, patients in the affordable category or those who opt for private hospitals will have to pay the regular charges fixed by the hospital. Informal enquiries put the average cost of care for a Category ‘A’ patient at Rs. 6,000 a day. Given that the average hospital stay of a COVID patient is about 10 days, the treatment course could be Rs. 60,000-80,000. However, this will be way higher for Category ‘B’ and ‘C’ patients, says Dr. Gopikumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/private-hospitals-in-preparatory-mode/article32566799.ece
10 September 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Bineesh issue may roil poll scene||Overlapping investigations by different Central law enforcement agencies into the Bengaluru drug bust and the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case appeared to get ‘awkwardly’ close to the kin of the leadership of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] in the State on Wednesday. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had summoned Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, to its office in Kochi for questioning. Though the ED’s tack of questioning remained classified information, the high-profile development set off ripples of speculation about the nature of the interview and its implications for the ruling front, if any. The Narcotic Control Bureau (NCB) in Bengaluru had nudged the ED to probe Mr. Kodiyeri’s ‘connection’ with Muhammad Anoop, a resident of Thrissur. The NCB had named Anoop as an accused in the drug bust. Mr. Kodiyeri’s sources of income, investments, business associates and two companies he had floated in 2015 were reportedly under ED scrutiny. Officials said the ED customarily looked for evidence of violations of anti-money laundering laws and the transfer of black money via hawala channels. Inter-relatedness By one account, the NCB, ED, Customs and National Investigation Agency (NIA) have expanded their investigations to cover a broad array of potential offences common to both the crimes. Central agencies are reportedly working in tandem to ferret out the inter-relatedness, if any, between the ‘racketeers’. The NCB had similarly bought the Customs in Kerala into the loop of its drug case investigation in Bengaluru. It had informed the agency that Anoop had links with K.T. Rameez, a UAE gold smuggling case suspect currently in judicial custody. Subsequently, the Customs sought permission from the court to question Rameez in prison. The anti-drug investigation in Karnataka had become a politically contentious topic in Kerala last week when Youth League president K. Firoz attempted to link Mr. Kodiyeri to Anoop. (Mr. Kodiyeri has denied any wrongdoing. He said he had helped Anoop in times of financial crisis but did not know about his activities. Mr. Balakrishnan had stated that neither the party nor the government would support lawbreakers.) Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala sought to spotlight the case on Tuesday by urging Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to institute an inquiry into the allegations against Mr. Kodiyeri. The BJP accused the CPI(M) leadership of shielding Mr. Kodiyeri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bineesh-issue-may-roil-poll-scene/article32566800.ece

The government has earmarked Rs. 40 crore for the project from the Rs. 118.24 crore set aside in the 2020-21 State Budget for the integrated development of paddy cultivation. Owners of paddy fields could apply for the royalty from September 11, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said on Wednesday. Owners of fields currently under paddy cultivation are eligible for the royalty. Other crops Paddy fields where pulses, vegetables, sesame and groundnuts are grown as part of the crop rotation too are eligible. In the case of paddy fields lying fallow, the owners will be eligible for the royalty provided they gave an undertaking that cultivation would be revived either by them or through other farmers or agencies. However, if the land in question continues to lie fallow for three consecutive years they will lose their eligibility. The applications for the royalty should be filed online on www.aims.kerala.gov.in. The land owners can also approach the Akshaya Centres for filing the application. Over the past several decades, land under paddy cultivation in Kerala has been on the decline. However, the government had been able to check the trend over the past four years, Mr. Sunil Kumar said. Production had risen by 2 lakh tonnes over this period, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paddy-land-owners-to-get-rs-2000-a-hectare/article32566803.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar and Minister of State for Railways Suresh Chanabasappa Angadi. “This is a step towards doubling the income of farmers by 2022 and fulfilment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise made in the Union Budget,” said Mr. Tomar, and announced that Kisan Udaan, to send horticulture and agriculture produce by flights, would soon begin from the north eastern States. The first train was run from Deolali (Near Nasik) to Danapur (near Patna). The Centre was committed to investing Rs. 1 lakh crore in the farm infrastructure, he added. Freight charges According to the Chief Minister, 15.6% of the country’s fruit production came from Andhra Pradesh as it is grown in 17.42 lakh hectares, but only 10 to 15% of the produce is consumed locally while the rest is sent to other parts either by road or by sea routes. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, quoting Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah, told Mr. Angadi to consider reducing the freight charges as current rates were almost equal to transport charges by lorries. The State government had created market intervention fund to rescue farmers during the lockdown, he said and reminded the Union Ministers that it was from Tadipatri in Anantapur district that 45,000 metric tonnes of banana were exported last year by Desai Fruits via JNPT in Mumbai. Current Kisan Rail is carrying 322 tonnes of papaya, sweet lime, mangoes, banana, musk melon, and tomatoes in 13 bogies, while one three-tier AC coach is carrying horticulture farmers, officials from Marketing, Agriculture, and Horticulture Departments, and SLR two bogies are for the railway staff. Guntakal Divisional Railway Manager Alok Tiwari said currently the freight charges were Rs. 5,136 per tonne and a single train can take a minimum of 150 MT to 460 MT depending on the demand. Mr. Rangaiah said 58 lakh tonnes of fruits were produced in Anantapur, of which only six lakh tonnes were consumed in a year and the farmers were ready for utilising a train daily to send their produce to Delhi, Mumbai and other places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kisan-rail-chugs-off-from-anantapur/article32566939.ece

Dig at TDP, BJP “All religions are equal. We will never allow any attack on places of worship irrespective of the religion.

In fact, some of the affected parties have not even received any compensation, nor were they provided the basic amenities and infrastructure on the 95 acres of land at Jogapuram village allocated for the project-affected families,” said U.G. Srinivasulu and K. Sudha, the forum’s State president and secretary respectively. The forum found fault with the State officials on a series of issues, including incomplete acquisition of the 80 acres meant for accommodating the displaced, hurriedly laying few roads and providing single phase electricity over the last ten days. The forum expressed ire over the inadequate compensation, flaws in the R&R package and undue haste shown in evacuating the families. “Priority must be accorded to rehabilitating the projected-affected people with dignity. They must not be coerced and threatened in any manner,” a release by the forum stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hrf-condemns-forcible-eviction-at-gandikota/article32566932.ece

10 September 2020||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||This ‘kova’ eyes PM’s award||‘Tadakanapalli kova’ is a well-known sweet across Rayalaseema and there are connoisseurs in Hyderabad too, but the story behind the success of this is ‘innovative livelihood’ efforts put in by the district administration. Cattle hostel District Collector G. Veerapandian made a power-point presentation of this success story of a ‘cattle hostel’ to the selection committee for the PM’s Award 2020 as one of the 12 short-listed IAS officers from India. Mr. Veerapandian explained in detail the milk production at the ‘cattle hostel’ and its effective use for livelihood and an innovative way of transforming the lives of the villagers. The result of the presentations is awaited eagerly. Located just 15 km from the district headquarters town of Kurnool, this village has good road connectivity and the milk cooperative is a part of the Vijaya Milk, a government dairy unit. This entire cooperative unit is maintained by women’s self-help groups of the village. The innovative methods adopted by the farmers in conserving the livestock and developing an industry around it drew the attention of the State government. Innovative methods The livelihood of the majority of the residents is linked to cows and buffalos and animal wealth is considered so precious that a ‘cattle hostel’ has been established to take care of the needs of the animals -- only one of its kind in Andhra Pradesh. The milk collected from these animals is converted into sweet kova. Mr. Veerapandian was the only IAS officer from Andhra Pradesh to get selected for making a presentation for the prestigious Prime Minister Award, 2020 under ‘Innovation promoting livelihood and economy’ category. Feedback of the stakeholders, and an analysis of the presentation and citizens’ response will be clubbed before deciding the award winners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/this-kova-eyes-pms-award/article32566929.ece

10 September 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State govt. paving the road for e-vehicles||Electric vehicles are affordable, efficient and clean for the environment and the government is eager to switch to this viable and eco-friendly alternative to carbon-emitting vehicular fuel such as petrol and diesel. “We are looking at retrofitting models. The idea is to convert the existing three-wheelers (auto-rickshaws) into e-rickshaws as part of promoting eco-friendly mode of transport in the State,” S. Ramana Reddy, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of the New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP), told The Hindu on Wednesday. NREDCAP is the State nodal agency for all renewable programmes and electric mobility. The corporation intends to implement the pilot project in Vijayawada, Tirupati and Visakhapatnam, which have been identified as three of the five non-attainable cities in the State that do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the Central Pollution Control Board. “The estimated cost of retrofit is Rs. 60,000,” he said. But the vehicle owner would not invest anything on the battery (estimated cost Rs. 90,000) as the State proposes to establish battery banks on the lines of petrol bunks where one can swap their used battery with a full one without wasting any time Mr. Reddy said the corporation would give these e-vehicles to three or four persons in each of the three cities free of cost to operate for a couple of months for a real-time feedback that would make modifications wherever needed before zeroing in on the final design of the vehicle and going ahead with mass scale conversion. In the two-wheeler sector, the NREDCAP found a donor in Hero Electrics which offered four e-scooters for demo purpose. These electric vehicles have been given to the village secretariat volunteers in Pulivendula in Kadapa district. “The corporation is also approaching other two-wheeler manufacturers seeking their support. These volunteers are multi-taskers, constantly on the move to reach out to beneficiaries of government schemes or the general public. Based on their feedback on the vehicles, we will approach the government for subsidy on the vehicles that will solve both fuel and pollution problems,” he said. Charging stations A.P. has been sanctioned 115 charging stations and most of them would be established in ’non-attainable’ cities. Mr. Reddy exuded confidence that once the charging infrastructure is ready, people would be keen on buying e-vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-govt-paving-the-road-for-e-vehicles/article32566451.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy’s vision for all-round development of the State with due focus on the industrial sector, where skills play a crucial role. The Central PSUs should contribute to skills’ enhancement in A.P. by spending a portion of the funds under their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) scheme on programmes being conducted by the State government, the Minister requested.

10 September 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Attacks on temples on the rise in State: BJP||The BJP leaders condemned house arrest of the party State president Somu Veerraju and the arrest of the representatives of various religious organisations ahead of the ‘Chalo Antarvedi’ protest. Addressing the media on Wednesday, MLC P.V.N. Madhav and former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju demanded the unconditional release of those arrested and a CBI probe into the fire at the Atarvedi temple. “As many as 15 incidents of attacks on temples and institutions have been reported in the State after the YSRCP came to power,” they alleged. Mr. Madhav alleged that the YSRCP government was trying to dismiss the burning of the temple chariot as a ‘lunatic act’. In a similar way, the government dismissed the attacks on temples at Pithapuram and Bitragunta. He opined that the government was trying to avoid a probe with such frivolous remarks. Funds allocation While the opposition was demanding action against the accused, cases were being booked against the protesters, Mr. Madhav said. The allocation of funds to the Brahmin Welfare Corporation from the Endowments Department showed that the government did not know about Hindu traditions, he said. It was not just people from the community, but devotees belonging to other castes also donate to the temples. Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju said it was strange that attacks on temples were happening regularly only in Andhra Pradesh. In the BJP-ruled States, there were no attacks on religious institutions of other communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/attacks-on-temples-on-the-rise-in-state-bjp/article32566951.ece

Veedhi mandal||The district police unearthed two landmines that were planted allegedly by the Maoists between the Kumkumpudi and Pedapadu villages of G.K. Veedhi mandal on Wednesday.

Mr. Naidu said the Maoists had earlier planted two landmines at Chintalaveedhi of Pedabayalu mandal, which led to the killing of two innocent tribals when they stepped on them on August 2. The Maoists, while terming it as unfortunate, had promised that such incidents would not recur, the ASP said. “But what about these landmines?” he questioned. “The landmines have been planted on the route frequented by the tribal people.

He along with another grazes over 100 cows in the open fields of the tanda in the outskirts. But, life is not normal any more due to a sudden spurt of disease in his cattle. Some of his animals are suffering from lumpy skin disease (LSD) for several days. In this, large sized lymph nodes form in the body of the animal with fever and when it breaks open, it can spread to other animals. He owns about 30 animals and he claimed that more than 45 animals of the lot are affected by this skin disease. One such cow had to be kept in the open field for about 15 days before recovery. The cattle owners are forced to shell out more than Rs. 500 for each animal to get the required medicine from Hyderabad. Some of them had to consult veterinarians too. One Shafi from Enkepally in Sadashivapet mandal said that about 20 of his cattle have been suffering from LSD and no government doctor had visited the village so far despite complaints. He said that some of the animals are even unable to walk. LSD has been fast spreading in the district and officials are visiting villages to create awareness among farmers. Farmers are advised to keep animals suffering from LSD in isolation as the virus may be spread by flies and mosquitoes. Presently, officials are administering goat pox vaccine to affected animals. It was estimated that about 2% of cattle in the district might have been infected with the virus. However, no casualties were reported so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lumpy-skin-disease-in-cattle-spreading-fast/article32566753.ece

10 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Hassle-free start to EAMCET (engg.)||Amid COVID-19 protocols, the Telangana State Engineering, Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance Test (TS EAMCET) 2020 for engineering stream began on Wednesday. The computer-based test will continue on September 10, 11 and 14 at designated centres of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The first session was held from 9 am to noon and the afternoon session from 3 pm to 6 pm. Several students reached late by a few minutes at the exam centres due to the non-availability of public transport. Students coming from nearby districts and villages had a problem in reaching on time. However, officials were considerate enough to allow them if they were late by a few minutes much to the delight of the candidates.  Impressive turnout Despite the transport hurdles, the percentage of candidates appearing for the exam stood at an impressive rate. Students had to carry mask and hand sanitiser. However, arrangements were made for sanitisers at the exam centres. T. Papi Reddy, Chairman of the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE), said 13,909 candidates appeared out of the 17,885 in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

10 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Governor lauds TS govt. on irrigation, agriculture||Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan complimented the Telangana government for coming up with good programmes in Irrigation and Agriculture sectors but said that she preferred to see more focus on Health, Education and Tribal Welfare sectors. Interacting with reporters on the completion of one year in office, she said that the government has ramped up the tests now though initially there was a ‘lag’ in dealing with the pandemic. “I had written letters to the government concerned as a doctor as well. May be due to certain administrative issues and protocols, there was a delay but now the government is handling the situation well,” she said. She hoped that the government focuses on improving Health, Education and Tribal Welfare sectors, where there is a lot to be done. “Universities don’t have regular vice-chancellors and there are huge vacancies while government hospitals across the State need to be strengthened as they were the last hope of the poor. Tribals are poor and they need to be taken care of as well,” she said. The Governor said it would have been better had Telangana joined the Ayushman Bharat scheme as people get health coverage across the country. It can go well with the existing Aarogyasri like in Tamil Nadu where both the schemes run simultaneously and people benefit. “I have seen how insurance policies were not honoured here by private hospitals for corona treatment.” “I have shared these aspects with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and he responded positively,” she said, adding that there was nothing political in these aspects. “Raj Bhavan is Praja Bhavan. I will be catalyst, and complimentary force and a connecting force between people and the government,” she maintained. When asked if her views had taken a political colour, she said there was nothing without politics. “My views should be taken sensibly and not with sensationalism.” Stating that her one-year in office has been fruitful due to the love and affection of Telangana people, the Governor said she disclosed her desire to connect the alumni and the institutions with a concerted effort. As part of it, she launched a new programme – Chancellor Connecting with the Alumni. The idea is to rope them into strengthening their institutions using their present strengths and emotional quotient, and a website is being launched for this. “I hope within a year I will be able to connect lakhs of alumni with their institutions.” Replying to a question, she hoped that vaccine for COVID would be developed within a year and she wanted the first vaccine to come from India, particularly Telangana. She felt it was unfortunate the way private teachers had to observe Teacher’s Day as a Black Day due to job losses in the COVID period. Government has a responsibility but the onus lies on private school and college managements, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/governor-lauds-ts-govt-on-irrigation-agriculture/article32566751.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State pushes for major reforms in revenue administration||In a major push towards reforms in the Revenue Department, the State government has decided to do away with the posts of Village Revenue Officers and Village Revenue Assistants and enact a new legislation for maintenance of Record of Rights relating to lands in electronic form in the Telangana Land Records Management System for ensuring hassle free revenue administration in the larger public interest. The government has introduced four Bills in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday – The Telangana Abolition of the Posts of VROs Bill, 2020, The Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Bill, 2020, The Telangana Municipal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and The Telangana Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Options for VROs Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao however asserted that the existing VROs would be accommodated in the posts of same cadre in different departments and options would be given to them accordingly. The government had decided to take steps to absorb the VRs as scale employees in different departments as it is committed to protect their job security and had taken employees into confidence before bringing forth the legislations. The absorption of the VRAs as scale employees is likely to impose an additional burden of Rs. 560 crore on the State, but the government is firm that that interest of the VRAs, 90% of whom are from under-privileged sections, are protected. “This is a historic occasion. Passage of the Bills will eliminate the problems faced by the people, farmers and poorer sections in particular, in registering their lands,” he said. Discretionary powers The Bills, according to the Chief Minister, envisage removal of discretionary powers vested with the officials at different levels and ensuring a transparent and corruption-free land dealings. Tahsildars The Chief Minister gave a detailed explanation about the government’s intentions behind the introduction of the new Bills claiming that absence of IT intervention in the land related issues had further complicated the situation at the grass root level. He explained that tahsildars would continue to function but they would not have powers like in the past. “There are separate courts at the level of tahsildar, RDO and Joint Collector. The same officials will pass the orders and they will also deal with the cases relating to them. There is a mismatch in the process,” he said. There are an estimated 16,135 cases pending with the revenue courts at different levels. No revenue courts The enactment of the legislations would ensure that all the revenue courts would be abolished and people need to approach civil courts for resolution of disputes. The government has resolved to constitute 16 fast track tribunals giving them specific time frame to dispose of the cases and discussions are on with the Law Department officials in this regard. The government has decided to utilise the powers conferred under Section 7 of the Registration Act, 1908, empowering it to appoint officials, non-officials to the key posts in the department. Accordingly, the MROs would forthwith be made joint sub registrars and would be asked to deal with agricultural lands. Registrations pertaining to the non-agricultural lands would be dealt with by the sub registrars in 141 offices spread across the State. Complaints The reform is mandated as the complaints on corruption in the land related issues are on the rise while farmers developed a sort of animosity with the Revenue officials. Though there were efforts made to put in place land reforms from time to time, the previous governments could not evolve a permanent solution to the problem thereby leading to some violent incidents like people killing their own relatives for the sake of lands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-pushes-for-major-reforms-in-revenue-administration/article32566733.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Junior doctors at OGH may boycott emergency duty too||At least 120 junior doctors from Osmania General Hospital who continue to boycott elective surgeries are likely to stop attending emergency duties too from Friday if their demand for provision of elective Operation Theatres (OTs) and other resources, is not fulfilled. Elective surgeries under the General Surgery and Orthopaedics departments of the hospital have been on hold since mid-July. The surgeries under the two departments were performed in OTs present in the hospital’s in-patient (IP) ward. After rainwater flooded the IP block on July 15, patients from other wards were shifted to other parts of the hospital. However, the elective OTs of the two departments were not accommodated. With this, elective surgeries were kept on hold, causing huge inconvenience to poor patients. Besides, as part of their academic learning, the junior doctors have to perform surgeries too. They have lost this opportunity from July fourth week. The Telangana Junior Doctors Association-Osmania Medical College (TJUDA-OMC) unit submitted representations to the hospital administration and senior officials in the Health department from third week of August. While the hospital superintendent B. Nagender issued orders to accommodate General Surgery elective OT in Cardio Thoracic OT, the issue remained unresolved. After servicing strike notice, the first ones to boycott elective duties from Tuesday were 120 junior doctors from General Surgery department. They were joined by 60 post graduate students from Orthopaedics department from Wednesday. Some more might join in the coming days. Digging their heels in While the General Surgery post graduate students said that they will boycott emergency duties from Friday if the demands are not addressed, the others said they will stick to only boycotting elective duties. “We will boycott elective duties till the issues are addressed,” said P. Rohith, president of the TJUDA-OMC unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/junior-doctors-at-ogh-may-boycott-emergency-duty-too/article32566710.ece
10 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TV artist found dead at her house||Telugu television actor Kondapalli Sravani (26) was found dead at her house in Madhuranagar here on Tuesday night. The ‘Manasu Mamata’ TV serial actor committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan after he family members objected to her friendship with Devraj Reddy, SR Nagar police said on Wednesday.

According to him, the incident took place around 10 p.m. and came to light around 11.30 p.m. She was rushed to a private hospital in the area, where doctors declared her brought dead. After getting information, a police team was sent to the actor's house and her body was shifted to Osmania General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

"After that, the family members admonished her for moving with him," the officer said. Based on the complaint lodged by Sravani's parents, a case under Section 306 (Abetment to suicide) of Indian Penal Code was registered against Reddy and team was sent to Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to arrest him. Her parents also alleged that Reddy had threatened the victim to post her personal photographs and videos on social media.

10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Over 5,000 distress calls in 5 months||The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it unprecedented issues that has pushed up anxiety and stress levels among many. And that distress and helplessness is evident from the fact that Roshni, a NGO which provides emotional support to those battling depression or suicidal thoughts, have received more than 5,000 calls post lockdown announcement in March till August. Of those, around 20% callers had suicidal thoughts, and 5% had made up their mind to end their life. The Hyderabad-based NGO received calls from across the country. People who called included those facing financial distress such as inability to pay monthly loan instalments, school fees, anxiety of losing job or after losing it, pressure of working from home and domestic violence due to increased time spent at home with violent partners, and other issues. The volunteers said that there was a sudden spurt of calls after Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death on June 14. With that news, there was renewed focus on mental health and wellness. On September 10 every year, World Suicide Prevention Day is observed to provide worldwide commitment on action to prevent suicides with various activities.“There are times in our lives when we feel very low, depressed, and think that no one cares. At times, life becomes so painful that we just feel like ending it,” a statement from Roshni states. According to official statistics, over one lakh people kill themselves in India every year. “However, the realistic estimates could be five to six times more. It means that every five minutes one person feels so trapped, lonely, angry and unimportant that to end the pain, he or she chooses to end his/her own life,” the statement added. People feeling low can reach out to Roshni over their helpline number 66202000 or 66202001, visit the centre in Sindhi Colony (Secunderabad) or send an e-mail to roshnihelp@gmail.com. The centre is maintained by trained volunteers on all days from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m, Their service is free and confidential. “We provide emotional support. First, we create a safe and comfortable environment where can talk. We don’t rush into calls. As emotions can be overpowering and thoughts might be clouded, we give them time. Our calls might last 10 minutes to 2 hours or more. Our volunteers can speak in many languages,” said Tinky Bhardwaj, senior volunteer and former director at Roshni. She assured that details of callers are kept confidential and not shared with any individual or organisation. “We don’t ask for their name, phone numbers or their address,” Ms Bhardwaj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/over-5000-distress-calls-in-5-months/article32566708.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Poor response to one-time settlement scheme||The hopes of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to fill the gap in its coffers through the one-time settlement scheme for property tax dues have come up against a brick wall. The scheme could elicit little response from defaulters, as evident from the insignificant collections so far. With less than one week to the deadline, the corporation is short of over 90% of its targeted collections through the scheme. Total payable While the total amount payable under the scheme has been close to Rs. 1,550 crore over the years, actual collections failed to cross even the Rs. 100-crore mark. The one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, which came into force on August 1, offered property tax assessees an opportunity to avail themselves of 90% waiver on the penal interest amount, if the accumulated dues are cleared at one go. The scheme is applicable to dues up to the assessment year 2019-20, with a deadline of September 15 for payment. At the time of seeking permission from the government for announcement of the scheme, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials hoped for realisation of at least Rs. 1,000 crore of the tax dues through it. The dues have accumulated often over issues which can be resolved easily, such as vacant premises, decrepit buildings, and disputes related to property, apart from disputes in assessment, say officials. 5.4 lakh properties Over 5.4 lakh properties in the city are embroiled in such issues, and the total tax arrears inclusive of the 10% of the accumulated interest amount payable amounted to Rs. 1,546 crore. Majority of these properties are located in Charminar zone, followed by Khairatabad and Secunderabad zones. When it comes to the amount of arrears, Khairatabad zone leads with Rs. 660 crore, followed by Secunderabad zone at Rs. 249 crore. The scheme could elicit response from fewer than 50,000 property owners, officials said. “Perhaps, the timing of the scheme’s announcement was faulty. Several people are experiencing financial difficulties, and flow of liquid cash is low. We may have to seek government’s nod to extend the deadline to enable property owners to pay,” said an official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/poor-response-to-one-time-settlement-scheme/article32566722.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||South India’s first Kisan Rail on track||South India’s first ‘Kisan Rail’ between Anantapur and New Delhi carrying tomatoes, bananas, sweet oranges, papayas, muskmelons and mangoes in 14 parcel vans totalling 332 tonnes was flagged off by Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar and AP Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy virtually in the presence of Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi on Wednesday. Four van loads are meant for Nagpur and another 10 vans for Adarshnagar in Delhi and the distance of 2,150 km is being covered in approximately 40 hours. “It is a great day for farmers. Agricultural produce needs best possible distribution and returns. Kisan Rail will ensure that agro products reach from one corner to another corner of the country,” said Mr. Tomar. Mr. Reddy stated that AP is fast becoming the fruit capital of South India with cultivation of fruits and vegetables covering an area of 3.42 lakh hectares. AP is the largest producer of tomato, papaya and chillies; second largest in producing mango, orange and turmeric in the country. Introduction of Kisan Rail signals a new ray of hope for farmers, he said. Mr. Angadi said the Kisan Rail project originated out of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of doubling the income of farmers and as the lifeline of the nation. With railway electrification in full swing, AP too will benefit from this, he said. General Manager Gajanan Mallya said Kisan Rail will immensely help farmers in promoting the farm produce in the national market for better price realization by avoiding enroute damage and ensuring fast transportation. More than 80% of the 58 lakh MT of fruits and vegetables in Anantapur district is marketed out towards States of Delhi, UP, Punjab and Haryana among others. The same was being transported by roadways which was taking a lot of time and leading to lot of damage enroute. Transportation by railway provides a safe, reliable and fast transportation, said an official spokesman. Guntakal divisional manager Alok Tiwari said that government officials played a big role in this development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/south-indias-first-kisan-rail-on-track/article32566748.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Central govt. doing precious little in extending assistance, says KCR||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao took a dig at the Central government for doing precious little in extending helping hand to the State during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular release The Central government had so far released Rs. 265 crore which form part of regular releases under the National Health Mission and another Rs. 90 crore additional assistance. “There is no big assistance to the State other than this,” Mr. Rao said. Several requests made by the State to relax the norms under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act went in vain while the Centre had not considered the representation made for rescheduling of loans. The central government imposed conditions in availing relaxations under the FRBM norms rather than acceding the State’s requests. The Centre’s help was not substantial in terms of equipment too. In providing ventilators in the hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients, for instance, the Centre had no doubt sanctioned some ventilators, but simultaneously, it had imposed cuts in the grants that were due to the State. Own resources The State on its part had been mobilising adequate resources on its own to tackle the situation arising out of the impact of the pandemic while the Centre had not even released the justified share of GST dues to the State. Replying to clarifications sought by the members during the short discussion on COVID-19 in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, the Chief Minister assured that he would take up the issue of providing the State’s quota of vaccines that were being developed by the Bharat Biotech International Limited with the company’s representatives. To a query on the demolition of the Osmania General Hospital, he said he would not speak on the issue as it is pending in court. He assured that he would hold a meeting of the GHMC MLAs to evolve a way forward once the court adjudicates the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/central-govt-doing-precious-little-in-extending-assistance-says-kcr/article32566713.ece

10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State govt. to soon take up comprehensive land survey||The State government has decided to take up a comprehensive land survey covering every inch of available land across the State. The survey has been contemplated to prepare a digitised map of the State covering every nook and corner. For the first time, the government has decided to conduct the exercise using the latest technologies so that latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates are given to all the survey numbers and the lands located in them. Announcing this in the State Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said that the survey had been planned as part of efforts to ensure that complaints like land encroachments are done away with for ever and the common man is protected from land sharks and land mafias. “We are bringing an IT-based alternative to the existing systems to make the system corruption-free and transparent,” he said. The survey comes in light of the government’s decision to launch Dharani portal, the one-stop solution for land related issues. The portal, according to the Chief Minister, is under trial and testing stage and the government has put in place all the necessary equipment including computers at different levels of administration. The portal had been divided into two categories – agriculture and non-agriculture – and it could be accessed from anywhere by those interested. People could get the entire information pertaining to a particular land, including the encumbrance certificates and the latest mutations. “Copies of the land documents can be downloaded from anywhere. The data cannot however be tinkered with,” he asserted. The portal is being designed in such a manner that the data can be stored in multiple servers at multiple locations, including some outside the State. “This will act as a back-up mechanism as part of disaster management plan,” he said. In addition, the details of the prohibited lands, including those of the State and Central governments, would be hosted on the portal which would be equipped with auto-lock feature. “Whenever any entry is made relating to registration of prohibited lands, the software will reject it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-govt-to-soon-take-up-comprehensive-land-survey/article32566734.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Additional Collector demands Rs. 1.12 cr. bribe, held||Anti-Corruption Bureau officials on Wednesday arrested Medak district Additional Collector Gaddam Nagesh, Narsapur Revenue Divisional Officer B. Aruna Reddy along with Chilpiched Tahasildar Abdul Sattar in a bribery case involving huge sums of money. Mohd. Waseem Ahmed, a Junior Assistant working in the office of the Assistant Director of Survey and Land Records of Medak and Kola Jeevan Goud, a private person, were also arrested in the case. ACB Deputy Director M. Ramana Kumar, supervising investigation of the case, said that K. Linga Murthy of Serilingampally from city and four others wanted to purchase 112.21 acres of land in Chippalaturthi village of Narsapur mandal in Medak. To get the land registered on their names, they required ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the Revenue authorities as it was in the list of Prohibited lands-22A, Mr. Ramana Kumar said. The Additional Collector demanded bribe of Rs. 1.12 crore to issue NOC at the rate of Rs. 1 lakh per one acre, according to the ACB official. On July 31, the Additional Collector received Rs. 19.5 lakh from Linga Murthy as first instalment. A week later, he got the next instalment of Rs. 20.5 lakh bribe amount. But for some reasons, the complainant could not arrange the remaining bribery sum of Rs. 72 lakh to Mr. Nagesh, the ACB press release stated. Since Linga Murthy could not pay the bribe amount, the Additional Collector obtained an Agreement of Sale on August 21 from him for five acres of land out of the 112.21 acres he had purchased. Since cash could not be paid as part of the promised bribe, the officer decided to take the land in lieu of the deal, the ACB Deputy Director explained. The Agreement of Sale was executed in the name of Jeevan Goud (an alleged benami of the Additional Collector). On July 31, Waseem Ahmed allegedly received Rs. 5 lakh bribe at the instance of the Additional Collector, the ACB officials said. Out of these 5 lakh rupees, Ahmed allegedly gave Rs. 1 lakh each to B. Aruna Reddy and Abdul Sattar as their share. During searches at Gaddam Nagesh’s residence, eight blank cheques issued by the complainant, Agreement of Sale executed in the name of Jeevan Goud along with other incriminating materials were seized. An unaccounted sum of Rs. 28 lakh along with gold jewellery weighing nearly 500 grams were found in RDO Aruna Reddy’s house. The arrested officers and the private persons would be produced before Special Judge for SPE and ACB Cases. High drama High drama took place since morning in the Medak district headquarters since morning on Wednesday as the ACB conducted raids on the residence of Gaddam Nagesh. Though initially it was not taken seriously, soon things started moving fast involving other officials. Simultaneous raids were conducted at the residences of Aruna Reddy and Abdul Sttar, Wasim Ahmed and Kola Jeevan Goud, the benami of the Additional Collector. Raids were conducted at several places in the district as well as in Hyderabad. This is the second case involving huge bribe of more than Rs. 1 crore. In the past, Keesara MRO Nagaraju was involved in a case accepting a bribe of Rs. 1 crore and was arrested by ACB officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/additional-collector-demands-rs-112-cr-bribe-held/article32566737.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||T-BJP flays KCR for ‘praising’ Nizam||The Telangana BJP on Wednesday criticised Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for praising the Nizam in the Assembly and said it was an insult to the people of the State, who had suffered under his tyranny and took up an armed struggle against him. Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said that T-BJP would celebrate September 17 as Telangana Liberation Day, as was being done in Maharashtra and Karnataka to commemorate the ‘police action’ by Sardar Patel to make sure the Nizam joins the Indian Union - if it is elected to power in the next elections. Participating in a rally at Godavarikhani as part of the agitational programme to demand the official celebrations, the BJP leader castigated KCR for going back on his promise to observe the Liberation Day during the political struggle for separate Telangana due to “pressure from the Majlis party”. Mr. Sanjay also demanded the government postpone the Layout Regularisation Scheme as citizens are in no position to pay the hefty fee as they are reeling under COVID-19 effect. It would only benefit ruling party leaders to regularise their “illegal properties”. He wanted the government to bring LRS post-COVID by drastically reducing the fee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/t-bjp-flays-kcr-for-praising-nizam/article32566749.ece
10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Doctors feel the pain of patients||On Wednesday night, a 48-year-old patient writhing in pain was rushed from Medak to Osmania General Hospital, Afzalgunj. He was in need of a correction surgery in the hip. Having spent over Rs. 8 lakh for initial surgery at a private hospital which went wrong, family members of the patient have exhausted their finances and did not have any option other than relying on the government hospital. Since Gandhi Hospital here has been turned into an exclusive COVID-19 facility, Osmania General Hospital (OGH) is the only available option for non-COVID patients in need of emergency care or elective surgeries at State-run health centres. However, the patient’s family was in for a rude shock after reaching the hospital. Doctors told them that the elective surgery facility under Orthopaedics department is unavailable at OGH for now. “After he met with an accident, doctors at a private hospital placed implants in the patient’s hip. However, the hip got dislocated and he needed revision surgery which comes under elective service. Since we do not have facility to perform elective surgeries for over one-and-a-half months, we could not take up surgery on the patient,” said P. Rohith, president of Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA)-Osmania Medical College unit. This is not the lone case of a distressed patient who was denied medical service. Junior doctors (post graduate students) from Orthopaedics and General Surgery department have been witness to similar distressing situations since elective surgery of three departments were temporarily suspended and an alternative facility for elective surgery operation theatres (OTs) is not being provided from third week of July. The junior doctors boycotted elective services from Tuesday demanding provision of OTs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/doctors-feel-the-pain-of-patients/article32566711.ece

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Khammam, was dealing with a complaint filed by M Kranti Kumar, a private employee and resident of Khammam town. The complainant said that he had subscribed to the BYJUS app through an agent by the name Y Keerthi Raju. The subscription was for Classess VIII, VII and IV XEED syllabus. The complainant stated that the agent had assured him that he would be provided with three tabs and BYJU’S kit worth Rs. 60,000 after which the amount was paid on August 11, 2018. The complainant claimed that neither the tabs, nor the student login ID and kit whad been provided to him. He then lodged a complaint with the company’s regional business development manager who assured him that he would receive the aforementioned items. However, this did not happen. The complainant then contacted the company. When he failed to get the items, he filed complaint. Taking a view of the evidence placed on record, the forum observed that the company had not preferred to contest the matter. “In the stated circumstances, it is presumed that the averments of the complainant and the documents filed by the complainant are true and genuine, therefore we are in opinion that the opposite parties are in deficiency of service and also rendering unfair trade,” it stated and ordered a refund of Rs. 60,000, Rs. 10,000 for damages and Rs. 5,000 for costs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/forum-directs-byjus-to-make-refund-pay-damages/article32566728.ece

10 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bribe rates hit the roof||The country’s economy growth might have dipped. But the range of demand for bribery sums by some State government officials is surely going up and up. A few years ago, eyebrows would raise if a government employee was caught with Rs. 50,000 or more bribe amounts. Not any more. At least that is the inference one draws if the huge amounts recovered by ACB officials are anything to go by. Many were startled on hearing that ACB sleuths recovered Rs. 1.10 crore bribery sum involving Keesara tahsildar Nagaraju Elva Balraju in Medchal Malkajgiri district. According to ACB authorities, that sum was the bribe demanded by the officer from a real estate businessman for an official favour. Even before the ‘widely discussed corruption case’ receded from people’s memory, the ACB seized a whopping Rs. 4.47 crore which were invested in real estate by some accused officers in Insurance Medical Services (IMS) scam. Though this amount was not part of the direct bribe (received by government employees in regular bribery cases), the huge sum of Rs. 4.47 crore seized by ACB authorities kicked off a serious debate about ‘accelerated growth of bribery sums in corruption cases’. “In the backdrop of abnormal escalation of land prices in and around Hyderabad, government employees are demanding huge bribes to process files or make changes in records,” ACB officials unwilling to be named said. In areas close to Madhapur, Gachchibowli or farther places like Shamirpet, Hayathnagar, an acre of land has market value between Rs. 5 crore and Rs. 10 crore. When a person approaches the employees concerned for any changes in land records, the officers reportedly compare the price of the land and the bribe they ask. “We are asking you just Rs. 10 lakh per an acre which has a market value of more than crore rupees. This bribe is peanuts compared to your land value,” they reportedly tell the land owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bribe-rates-hit-the-roof/article32566735.ece

10 September 2020||Ghaziabad,||Delhi cab driver murder case transferred||The Gautam Buddha Nagar police have transferred the investigation into the murder of a Delhi-based cab driver to their counterparts in Bulandshahr. Aftab Alam, 45, was allegedly killed by three passengers when he was returning from Bulandshahr to Delhi on Sunday evening. His body was found on the front passenger seat of the car in the Badalpur area of Greater Noida. Aftab made the last call to his son Sabir who claimed he could hear a person in the background asking someone to chant “Jai Shri Ram”. Police said it was not Alam but a roadside vendor that they were addressing and that there was no communal angle to the murder. Harish Chandra, DCP, Central Noida, told The Hindu on Wednesday that Bulandshahr police should probe the case as the crime happened in an area under their jurisdiction. “The suspected killers boarded the cab at Bhud Chauraha in Bulandshahr so technically the Bulandshahr police should investigate the murder,” he said. However, Santosh Kumar Singh, SSP, Bulandhahr, said he was yet to receive any official communication in this regard. “It will be too early for me to comment on this matter,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, the Noida police released a video of an attendant at a CNG filling station near Dadri toll plaza wherein he purportedly said it was he whom the passengers/suspected killers were addressing on Sunday night. “In the audio, one could hear a passenger asking somebody what happened to his hand. It was this attendant as he has an injury mark on his hand. He told us they were trying to give him Rs. 10 more, which he refused, ” said Mr. Chandra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-cab-driver-murder-case-transferred/article32566633.ece
10 September 2020||New Delhi,||Bars in the Capital cheer again||Restaurants and bars in Delhi started serving liquor to customers once again on Wednesday, following a Delhi government order permitting the activity. While arrangements to ensure social distancing were ensured, business owners remained cautious over the way forward given low footfall and a lack of clarity on the extension of the current trial run, which will last till September 30. With government guidelines limiting the number of customers allowed to half the capacity of the restaurant, Rahul Singh, owner of the Beer Cafe chain of restaurants, said that business was likely to be proportionately effected. “A clearer idea will emerge only in a few weeks’ time,” he added. Focus on rebooting In the meantime, Mr. Singh said that the focus was on rebooting. “There are 150 things in our checklist,” he said, including retraining staff, medical tests, ensuring safety equipment, negotiating rent, servicing equipment, throwing out expired beer, buying new stock, among other aspects. Apart from the number of customers, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has also directed that no customer will be served who are standing, and that preventive measures for deadly COVID-19 should be displayed prominently at the bars. Need for rebates Among issues restaurants are batting for, Thomas Fenn, co-founder of the Mahabelly, stressed on the need for rebates on excise licence fees and fees on alcohol stock already purchased. Fees for licence is paid on an annual basis but since no alcohol has been served in the months of the lockdown, a rebate is justified, he said. Additionally, a fee was paid on alcohol stocks at the time of purchase under the assumption that they would be sold, he said, arguing that there must be a rebate on this too. Mr. Fenn added that there was a need for more clarity from the government regarding the basis on which the trial run would be extended or not, in order to make various business decisions such as restocking. Abhishek Patel, manager at restrobar Limitless, said that sanitising machines were also being set up everywhere. With low footfall on Day 1, Mr. Patel said that they would have to wait and see if the pace picks up. With regard to concerns about social distancing being hard to follow, especially in the case of inebriated people, Mr. Patel said that regular measures such as cutting people off at an appropriate time would be followed. However, for Mr. Singh, drunken antics are not a cause for concern. “Responsibility is our hallmark and its both ways, from our side and our patrons.”  There are 150 things in our checklist, including retraining staff, medical tests, ensuring safety equipment, negotiating rent, and buying new stock Rahul Singh Owner of Beer Cafe chain of restaurants||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bars-in-the-capital-cheer-again/article32566649.ece

Increase in timings Stage 2 and Stage 3 operations will kick in on September 11 and 12 with operational hours increasing to 12 hours daily on Friday and throughout the day from Saturday.   While guidelines state that metro trains will skip stations falling under containment zones, officials said that none of the currently operational ones fall under the same.

10 September 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi HC grants protection to Alt News co-founder||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted protection to journalist and co-founder of fact-checking website Alt News, Mohammed Zubair, against any coercive action from the police in connection with an FIR registered with Delhi Police Cyber Cell. Justice Yogesh Khanna also issued notice to the Delhi police on Mr. Zubair’s plea seeking to quash the FIR registered against him in Delhi. It also sought response of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), on whose complaint the case was registered. Mr. Zubair, in his petition, claimed that the FIR centred around a tweet he shared on August 6, 2020, where he called out one Jagdish Singh, who he alleged is a “habitual troll” for being an abusive person on social media. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for Mr. Zubair, submitted that his client has not been supplied copy of the FIR registered against him in Delhi. “The copy of the FIR was never supplied to the petitioner even after repeated calls were made to DCP Anyesh Roy, Special Cyber Cell, Delhi [Respondent No. 4] requesting for the same,” his petition said. Multiple FIRs Mr. Gonsalves said that another FIR on the same issue was registered on September 4 in Raipur, Chhattisgarh. The senior advocate said that multiple FIRs cannot be lodged for the same facts and incident, more so at different places. Mr. Zubair said he is in the process of challenging the FIR registered in Chhattisgarh separately, but fears that he may be arrested by Delhi Police immediately. Defending his tweet, which is at the centre of the controversy, Mr. Zubair said he “merely shared an image of Jagdish Singh standing with a minor girl whose face was pixelated and calling Jagdish Singh out on his foul, shameful and abusive behaviour on social media”. He said that the present “frivolous case is instituted at the behest of the powerful people of the ruling party with a view to give vent to their anger against the petitioner, for exposing fake news and communal propaganda”. Justice Khanna said it would be appropriate for Delhi Police to handover a copy of the FIR to Mr. Zubair so that he can respond to the allegations. The HC further, said the plea of Priyank Kanoongo, NCPCR chairperson, to be removed as a party from the current proceeding will be considered at a later stage. Mr. Kanoongo’s counsel argued that he was only acting as an informant and doing his statutory duty. However, Mr. Golsalves said Mr. Kanoongo was made a party as he had tweeted about the matter from his personal handle and not the commission’s handle. On August 8, Mr. Kanoongo from his personal Twitter handle had tweeted, “The Commission has taken cognizance of the case of threatening and torturing a girl child through Twitter. necessary communication have been issued to @TwitterIndia and concerned law enforcement authorities for appropriate action”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-hc-grants-protection-to-alt-news-co-founder/article32566640.ece
10 September 2020||New Delhi,||CM holds review meeting to assess COVID-19 situation||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held a review meeting on the COVID-19 situation in Delhi on Wednesday and directed the hospitals and authorities to take all preventive measures to contain its spread. The review meeting was attended by Health Minister Satyendar Jain along with the Chief Secretary and senior officials of the health department and medical superintendents of government hospitals and heads of private labs in Delhi. Along with directing the authorities to provide every possible help to the hospitals to prevent the spread of infection, Mr. Kejriwal said that just like Delhi was able to control the virus with the collective efforts of two crore people, it will be able to do this again with everyone’s support. The high-level review meeting was held to analyse the COVID-19 situation in Delhi, days after the Chief Minister had directed the authorities to double the testing and enabling testing without the requirement of a doctor’s prescription. Testing doubled “Tests have been increased from 20,000 to 40,000 per day. I request everyone to encourage as many people as possible to get tested without any delay. If any hospital is experiencing any issues, they can directly reach me and I will extend all possible help in this regard,” he also said. The Chief Minister also directed the Chief Secretary and officers concerned that all State and Central government SOPs should be strictly enforced and there should be no complacency regarding the same. Mr. Kejriwal also instructed the heads of the private labs in Delhi to not deny tests for anybody who wants to get tested. He further directed ambulance services that no calls from patients should be refused and they should be transferred to the hospitals if needed as soon as possible. The Corona App should display all information regarding the number of beds and ventilators well-within time to prevent panic, Mr. Kejriwal asserted. The government said Delhi has witnessed a “slight increase” in the number of daily COVID-19 cases with the re-starting of various activities since the unlock guidelines have come into force. Along with this, Delhi is also witnessing migration of people from other States in search of jobs and livelihoods, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cm-holds-review-meeting-to-assess-covid-19-situation/article32566666.ece

Plasma therapy A study funded by the ICMR has found that the use of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients does not help in reducing mortality or progression to severe infection, PTI had reported on Tuesday. When asked whether the Delhi government would go forward with its plasma bank and therapy in light of the new study, the government spokesperson refused to comment. In August, the government had said that, following Delhi, USA had adopted “convalescent plasma therapy” for treatment of critical COVID-19 patients. Congratulating the people of Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted: “They used to say, back in the day — what America does today, India would do tomorrow. Delhi has changed it. Now — what Delhi did yesterday, America does today.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/prescription-not-required-for-testing-govt-order/article32566668.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||14 children rescued from traffickers||Fourteen children, allegedly trafficked from different districts of Bihar to Delhi, were rescued by the Railway unit of Delhi Police, officials said on Wednesday. Ten people have been arrested. The rescued children, in the age group of 12-14 years, have been taken to a quarantine centre in south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, the police said. The matter came to light after an information was received from an NGO on September 7 about 14 minors being brought to Delhi by Mahananda Express train from different districts of Bihar, a senior police officer said.  A joint operation was launched at the Old Delhi railway station by police along with NGO Bachpan Bacho Andolan, Salam Balak Trust and RPF personnel. The team, on vigil, closely monitored the CCTV cameras to see any suspicious movement, the officer said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra K. Singh said, “Ten persons were detained and 14 children were rescued. These children were medically examined and taken to a quarantine centre in Lajpat Nagar.” “They were produced before the Child Welfare Committee through videoconferencing. Based on their statements before the committee, a case was registered and the 10 accused persons were arrested,” he added. During interrogation, the accused disclosed that the children belong to different districts of Bihar. Labour shortage Among those rescued, nine children are from Katihar, two from Begusarai, two from Kishanganj and one from Purnia. They had planned to take them to different places, including four to Azadpur and two to Seelampur in Delhi, two to Faridabad in Haryana and six to Punjab, he said. Due to shortage of labourers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the traffickers saw an opportunity to get the children employed in factories and targeted poor families in Bihar, the DCP said.

10 September 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi riots: HC to hear Tahir Hussain’s plea challenging ED custody today||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it will hear suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain’s plea, challenging his three days remand to Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody in a money laundering case related to the Delhi riots, on Thursday. Justice Yogesh Khanna asked the counsel for Mr. Hussain to place on record the judgments which he was referring to while posting the case for Thursday. Mr. Hussain has sought setting aside the remand order of September 7 passed by a trial court and a direction to the ED to immediately send him to Tihar jail. Money laundering The ED was probing allegations that Mr. Hussain and his accomplices laundered over Rs. 1.10 crore funds by using purported shell or dummy companies to fuel the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the riots. In his plea before the High Court, Mr. Hussain said he was formally arrested by the ED on August 20 from Tihar jail and on August 28, he was remanded in its six-day custody. The ED again sought extension of Mr. Hussain’s custody by nine days and the court on September 7 granted them three days to quiz him with the direction that he be handed over to Tihar jail authorities on September 10. His counsel challenged the trial court’s extension of remand order on the ground that the 15-day period for grant of police custody has to begin from the date of formal arrest, i.e., August 20 and thus, further extension of police remand is not permissible in law. “It is held by the Supreme Court in a catena of judgments that 15 days period for grant of police custody has to begin from the date of formal arrest,” his petition stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-riots-hc-to-hear-tahir-hussains-plea-challenging-ed-custody-today/article32566642.ece

Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha president Poonam Parashar Jha said: “All are well aware of the situation of women living in shelter homes.

She alleged that AAP had come to power with “attractive and misleading claims” but till date it had neither met issues of women’s safety nor had it taken any concrete step towards ensuring it. “If the DCW does not take responsibility of the safety and justice to the victim, will any woman be safe in shelter homes in Delhi?” Delhi BJP spokesperson Teena Sharma asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-delegation-seeks-dcws-intervention-to-ensure-womens-safety-at-shelter-homes/article32566667.ece

10 September 2020||Ahmedabad,||Jewellery firm dupes bank of Rs. 174 cr.||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has lodged an FIR against a Vadodara-based jewellery firm and its director for allegedly cheating the Bank of Baroda to the tune of Rs. 173.63 crore. The FIR was lodged on Tuesday by the CBI at its ACB-Gandhinagar office against Shree Mukt Jewellers Baroda Private Limited, its promoter-cum-director Harsh Soni and unknown persons. As per the bank’s complaint, Mr. Soni is absconding. In its complaint to the CBI, the bank accused the company, its director and others of “criminal conspiracy, criminal misconduct, cheating, forgery and diversion of public funds“. The company was into traditional gold and jewellery business in Vadodara and was sanctioned a letter of credit, cash credit and term loan facilities by the bank in 2013. “But it failed to repay the dues and the account became NPA (non-performing asset) in February 2016 and was declared as a wilful defaulter by the bank in 2018. The outstanding balance as on March 31, 2019, is Rs. 173.63 crore,” the FIR said. Suspecting a fraud, the bank conducted a forensic audit and learnt that “all the three suppliers with whom the company entered into transactions of buying gold and ornaments are related to each other”. An internal investigation by the bank revealed that two of these suppliers were having common directors while two were registered on same address. One of the suppliers, M/s P Gold Pvt Ltd, was into real estate business and not gold, according to the FIR. “The borrower company transferred Rs. 38.02 crore and got back Rs. 9.11 crore and diverted Rs. 28.91 crore through P Gold Pvt Ltd. It is suspected that the borrower company has misused the letter of credit facility for routing funds and diverting funds of business,” the FIR mentioned, citing the forensic audit report. It said the company allegedly indulged in round tripping transactions to show inflated turnover and funds were also transfered to accounts of other firms having common directors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jewellery-firm-dupes-bank-of-rs-174-cr/article32566676.ece

Manvendra Kumar Pundhir, Professor of History, AMU, a member of the committee formed by Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor for the ambitious task, said he was inspired by a similar exercise undertaken by the IIT, Kanpur, almost a decade ago. “We have a much longer and richer past which needs to be preserved and celebrated. The four-member committee also has the chairman of the Department of Mechanical Engineering who would help us in designing the capsule,” said Prof. Pundhir. He said experts from IIT, Kanpur, were also helping them. “I think the capsule would be made of stainless steel with a layer of PVC. The inside would be filled with inert gases to protect the material from decay for at least 500 years. The content would be written on acid-resistant papers and digital copies of the material would also be buried,” he explained. Interestingly, when the VC was mulling over the idea, Rahat Abrar, Director Urdu Academy and somebody who has written on Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, told Prof. Mansoor that Sir Syed also did something similar when the foundation of the College was laid on January 8, 1877. It created a buzz and historical evidence was asked for. Shafey Kidwai, Chairman Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, provided the proof. “The Gazette of January 12, 1877, gives a graphic account of the ceremony. It is the primary source which said Kunwar Lutuf Khan, a member of MAO Funds Committee, presented a bottle carrying the scroll enlisting the details of how Madarastul Uloom (the precursor of MAO College) came into being along with gold, silver, and copper coins to Viceroy (Lord Lytton), who put it inside a cavity of the foundation stone specially created for it.” He added the word ‘time capsule’ was not used and the time of its extraction was not mentioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/amu-to-bury-time-capsule-in-its-centenary-year/article32566680.ece

In a statement issued on Tuesday evening, the federation also said it “will not allow our land [Nagaland} and people to be eternally threatened by bullies with guns” while advising the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (IM) to be transparent, like its rival groups’ conglomerate, the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs). The NSCN (IM) calls itself the National Socialist Council of Nagalim. The NGBF said it had not deviated from its position that the final agreement should be signed according to the October 31, 2019, understanding between the Centre and the two negotiating groups – the NSCN (IM) and the NNGPs – based on the August 2015 Framework Agreement. “The Nagas will not be a party to any solution that is enforced and without transparency,” the federation said, adding that its members, at the September 4 meeting with NSCN (IM) chairman Q. Tuccu, asked all factions to “come under a single platform”. It also advised the NSCN (IM) to “disclose to the Nagas the contents and blueprint of post-solution political and administrative structure” like the NNGPs had done by sharing its “status paper on Indo-Naga political talks”. ‘Naga nationhood’ Reminding of the role of Naga village chiefs in building the “Naga nationhood” for more than a century, the NGBF alluded to a “nefarious game plan by an unprincipled and uninformed group of people desperately trying to limit, discredit, marginalise and muffle” the traditionally-honoured voices and authority of Naga village chiefs. The federation said the system of Gaon Bura (village chief) was institutionalised by the British in the Naga Hills much before India got independence. “The system has been retained as the premier traditional body in recognition of its authority,” it asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ambiguous-naga-solution-not-acceptable-village-elders-body/article32566635.ece

A few days ago, Mr. Tripathi, dealing in explosives’ trade in the mining-rich Bundelkhand district, had alleged that Mr. Patidar was threatening to kill him. Mr. Patidar was suspended on charges of corruption and tarnishing the image of the State government leading to question marks on its credibility, a government spokesperson said. He is accused of extorting money from drivers transporting gitti (loose rock) and harassing the vehicle owners if they did not pay up. In a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on September 5, Mr. Tripathi from Kabrai area had urged him to intervene and provide security. Mr. Tripathi alleged that the officer had demanded Rs. 6 lakh per month from him as ‘extortion’ and threatened to lodge false cases against him if he did not pay. Video statement Mr. Tripathi also released a video statement in which he said the SP and another explosives’ trader would be “responsible” if he was “murdered”. “The officer threatened that if I approached a politician or asked someone to telephone him, he would not hesitate to get me murdered. ‘I will get you murdered any time’,” he said. He also alleged that the officer said it would be made to appear like a case of suicide. Mr. Patidar, however, rejected the allegations and said the trader had targeted him as he was angry over police action on his illegal gambling business. On August 30, a notice was served to Mr. Tripathi in a gambling case, said the suspended SP. He added that Mr. Tripathi was into the big business of gambling and “illegal explosives trade”. “He made the video viral so that he could protect himself,” said the officer, adding that he would take action against the trader for defamation. Mahoba police tweeted that the allegations of involvement in the shooting case were baseless. The police said Mr. Tripathi has been transferred to a hospital in Kanpur for treatment. Senior officers are probing the matter, said the police. Mr. Patidar is the second IPS officer in the State to be suspended on ‘corruption’ charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/up-suspends-ips-officer-over-corruption-extortion-charges/article32566638.ece
10 September 2020||Mumbai,||Black day for Marathas: Maharashtra BJP after SC stays quota law||It is a “black day” for Marathas, the Maharashtra unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Wednesday as it attacked the State government after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the 2018 law granting quota to the community in education and jobs. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil claimed that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government is “not serious” in ensuring that the quota held its ground before the apex court. He also charged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar with not paying attention to the matter. The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the implementation of the law, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed. A three-judge Bench headed by Justice L.N. Rao referred to a larger Constitution Bench, to be set up by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, the batch of pleas questioning the validity of the law granting the reservation to Marathas. “The State could not ensure that the reservation held ground before the Supreme Court,” Mr. Patil said. Noting that the apex court referred the batch of pleas challenging the validity of the law to a larger bench, Mr. Patil said now nobody knows when the ruling in the matter will come. Mr. Patil contended that matters referred to a larger Bench in the past have remained pending for years. “This means the stay will continue till the Bench gives an order. Now there is no point in the community protesting either, because nobody knows when the ruling will come. Therefore, it is a black day for the community,” the BJP leader said. He said his party had repeatedly told the government to take the issue seriously and prepare well legally. “The State did not want the reservation. Which senior leader of theirs paid attention to the matter? Did Uddhav ji or Sharad Pawar pay attention?” he asked. “There is a scope to say now that their mindset was such that they were fine if the quota was stayed as they were not serious to ensure it holds ground,” he added. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018, was enacted to grant reservation to people of the Maratha community in jobs and education. The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June last year, held that 16% reservation was not justifiable and the quota should not exceed 12% in employment and 13% in admissions. The community, which constitutes over 30% of the State’s population, has held protests to push for the demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/black-day-for-marathas-maharashtra-bjp-after-sc-stays-quota-law/article32566831.ece
10 September 2020||Mumbai,||Rhea Chakraborty moves court again to seek bail||Actress Rhea Chakraborty, who has been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drugs case linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, moved a bail application before a sessions court on Wednesday. This is Ms. Chakraborty’s second attempt to seek release after a magistrate court on Tuesday denied her bail. In the fresh plea, filed by her lawyer Satish Maneshinde, the 28-year-old actress claimed to be “innocent”. “She has not committed any crime whatsoever and has been falsely implicated in the case,” said the plea. The court will hear the bail application on Thursday. Ms. Chakraborty was arrested by the NCB on Tuesday after three days of questioning by the central agency. Shortly after her arrest, she was sent to judicial custody till September 22 by a local court. On Wednesday, she was shifted from the agency’s office in south Mumbai to Byculla jail. The other accused arrested by the NCB, including the actress’s brother Showik Chakraborty, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, his personal staff member Dipesh Sawant, and suspected drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar, were sent to 14-day judicial custody by the sessions court, special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande said. Mr. Showik Chakraborty and Mr. Sawant have applied for bail and their pleas will also be heard on Thursday, he said. The NCB on Tuesday said it did not want Ms. Chakraborty’s custody as it had already questioned her for three days. She was produced before the additional chief judicial magistrate through video link on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rhea-chakraborty-moves-court-again-to-seek-bail/article32566677.ece
10 September 2020||Navi Mumbai,||3 held for trespassing into CM’s farmhouse||Three people, including two reporters from a TV news channel, have been arrested by the Khalapur police for trespassing into the Chief Minister’s farmhouse in Raigad district and assaulting a security guard. “Of the three, one is a driver and the other two claim to be reporters. We are verifying their claims,” Raigad superintendent of police Anil Paraskar said. On Tuesday evening, the trio stopped a passer-by on Bhilawale dam bridge in Khalapur and asked for directions to the farmhouse. The man said he was not aware of its location. When the accused reached the farmhouse, they found the same man posted as the security guard. “In his complaint, the guard said the accused started abusing and heckling him for lying to them,” Mr. Paraskar said. The guard noted down the licence plate number of the car and approached the police. The trio was arrested and charged under Sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 448 (punishment for house trespass), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intent to provoke breach of peace) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Residents protest against slum demolition order||Residents of jhuggies located near the railway track in Wazirpur Industrial Area held a protest demonstration on Wednesday against the Supreme Court order to remove 48,000 slum clusters located along railway tracks in the Capital. Expressing anger over the demolition order, residents asked where they are supposed to go now. “We will not move from our houses. It is the government that promised us house and land near our jhuggies. And now, during COVID-19 outbreak, when we are struggling to regain livelihood, we are being told that even our jhuggies will be demolished,” said a protester. Ajay Kumar, another resident, said that before the election the government promised us Jaha Jhuggie Wahan Makan , and now that there is no election they are planning demolition. “Where is our Makan Modiji?” Mr. Kumar asked. Addressing the protesters, CPI (ML) State secretary Ravi Rai said that it was shameful that the Ministry of Railways is directly behind the demolition order. “CPI (ML) is coordinating with affected slums in other places and we will fight till the government ensures proper housing and land title near their inhabitation. Any demolition will be resisted,” he added.  We will not move from our houses.

10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Police to focus on crime control; teams to handle COVID-19 norms breach||A day after Delhi Traffic Police was restricted to fine people for COVID-19 norms violation, Delhi Police on Wednesday ordered all police stations to focus on their primary job, that is crime control. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters) Chinmoy Biswal issued an order saying that Delhi Police will deploy dedicated teams in each police station to check violations of COVID-19 norms as cases are rising in the city again. He said all police stations will deploy such team in uniform at one location from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day. “In view of the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi, each police station shall detail one dedicated team comprising an upper subordinate and a lower subordinate to report to one location in their respective district to prosecute persons who violate protocols such as not wearing masks, not maintaining social distancing, and spitting etc.,” the order said. Under supervision District Deputy Commissioners of Police have been asked to select one area/location by rotation where frequent violations are noticed and keep it under the supervision of the respective inspector. Other district police personnel engaged in picket checking, patrol duty and crime control should concentrate on their primary job of crime control and law and order, and not on prosecution for COVID-19 violations, the order said. They shall not be issued the challan book, it said. “The traffic personnel shall concentrate on regulating the traffic and shall not be assigned the task of prosecuting public persons for violating COVID-19 protocol. The primary attention shall be regulating traffic in view of near normalcy of traffic on the roads.  All challan books which are thus required by district/traffic policemen shall be taken back and kept in safe custody under the knowledge of DCPs concerned, he said in the order. According to a data shared by Delhi Police, until 4 p.m. on September 8, it has issued 2,77,131 challans for not wearing mask, 2,434 for spitting in public places, and 26,116 for violating social distancing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/police-to-focus-on-crime-control-teams-to-handle-covid-19-norms-breach/article32566669.ece

10 September 2020||Patna,||RJD protests against unemployment with candles||Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders and supporters turned off lights and lit candles and lanterns for nine minutes from 9 p.m. on Wednesday night to raise the issue of unemployment in the State. Party leader Tejashwi Yadav, on the occasion, slammed the “double-engine government”, blaming it for the sorry state of affairs.  ‘Batons in place of jobs’ “Bihar has the most number of young people in the country and has the highest unemployment rate. There are 4.5 lakh government job vacancies here but the youth have been cheated by this double-engine government. It keeps promising jobs for them but when they come out on the streets demanding jobs, the Nitish Kumar government rains baton on them,” alleged Mr. Yadav. Bihar’s Leader of the Opposition, along with his mother Rabri Devi and elder brother Tej Pratap, stood with lanterns for nine minutes on the terrace of their official residence, 10, Circular Road, with the house staff following suit. Similar scenes were also witnessed at the RJD party office in Patna and other places across the State. “Today unemployment has become the biggest issue in Bihar. At 46.61%, it is the highest in the country. Why has Bihar become the centre of unemployment?” said Mr. Yadav. He alleged that the State government did not provide any employment opportunities to the migrant workers who had returned home during the lockdown. Earlier, on September 5, Mr. Yadav had also launched a portal B erojgarihatao.co.in and a toll-free number for unemployed youth to register, promising them jobs if his party came to power after the upcoming Assembly elections. The Bihar polls are due in October-November this year and the Election Commission is expected to announce dates by the end of September.  JD(U) jibe at RJD event Taking a jibe at the RJD event, ruling Janata Dal (United) leaders questioned the need for lighting lamps and lanterns when “every household in the State has power supply for over 22 hours every day”. “The lantern age in Bihar is over now,” quipped party spokesperson Niraj Kumar, hinting at the RJD party symbol. State BJP leaders too slammed the Opposition party. “After Assembly elections, Tejashwi Yadav will search for his employment lantern in hand,” said BJP leader Nikhil Anand. Tejashwi, however, hit back using the JD(U) symbol. “The ruling party may say the time of the lantern has gone but I would like to ask them if the time of the arrow [JD(U) party symbol] has come,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rjd-protests-against-unemployment-with-candles/article32566631.ece
10 September 2020||Pune,||10-day Janata curfew in Sangli, Kolhapur districts from Friday||As COVID-19 cases continue to mount at an alarming rate in western Maharashtra, authorities in Kolhapur and Sangli districts — the new virus hotbeds in the State’s sugar heartland — have appealed to people to observe a 10-day Janata curfew beginning Friday. After conferring with District Collector Daulat Desai, businessmen and traders affiliated to the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) said they will be observing a complete shutdown from September 11 to 16, in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus. While the city’s Laxmipuri grain market will remain closed for 10 days to discourage the assembly of traders and customers, industrial units in the urban pockets of Kolhapur will remain functional. Sources said industrial units could not afford to shut down again as they had already observed a strict seven-day lockdown in July. In Sangli, District Collector Dr. Abhijit Chaudhari has called for a similar 10-day Janata curfew as medical facilities struggle to cope with the alarming rise in cases and deaths. Over the last fortnight, Kolhapur has witnessed an average daily rise of 800 new cases, and Sangli a surge of over 550 cases. Opinion divided The call to observe the curfew has divided citizens, the business class and politicians. While expressing concern over the spike in cases, Sambhaji Raje, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajya Sabha MP from Kolhapur, said any form of lockdown is not a solution at the moment as it will severely cripple a beleaguered economy. He said, “This call for a curfew is not a viable solution. The economy is already in the doldrums. Instead, the focus must be on bolstering the medical infrastructure of these districts.” Mr. Raje said the Maharashtra government should set up a jumbo COVID-19 facility in Kolhapur on the lines of the ones in Mumbai and Pune. In Sangli, a number of traders associations have urged the district administration to impose a lockdown instead of merely appealing to the public to observe a curfew. “Given the violation of COVID-19 regulations by several citizens, we seek a complete shutdown in the district to break the virus chain,” said a trader. Traders at Sangli market yard have opposed the call for a Janata curfew, stating it would adversely affect their business. Kolhapur has reported nearly 30,000 COVID-19 cases, of which around 10,000 are active. The district has also recorded more than 800 deaths so far. Sangli’s case tally has exceeded 21,000, of which nearly 9,000 are active. Over 600 deaths have also been reported till date. Three-pronged strategy In Pune, the first district in the country to cross more than two lakh reported cases, authorities have devised an elaborate containment plan in 69 villages. The three-pronged strategy is designed for increased surveillance and early detection of cases in rural areas, which has seen a big surge in cases. “Aanganwadi and ASHA workers as well as teachers constitute the ground force of this strategy. Around 100 teams will be doing door-to-door surveys in the most-affected villages in the first part of this containment plan using pulse oximeters and thermal guns,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad. He said 15,000 people were screened on Tuesday in Junnar taluk. “More than 1,000 suspected cases were screened today at Manchar, of which 209 tested positive,” he said. Suspected cases are to be referred to screening centres, where doctors will test them for COVID-19 using rapid antigen kits. As per their symptoms, patients will be admitted to COVID-19 care centres or hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/10-day-janata-curfew-in-sangli-kolhapur-districts-from-friday/article32566674.ece

In the claim, the counsel advocate R.S. Motwani said the complainant operated the three wine shops and money collected was deposited at Navjeevan Co-op Bank in Ulhasnagar.

10 September 2020||WASHINGTON,||U.S. to reduce troops in Iraq to 3,000||The U.S. is cutting troop levels in Iraq roughly in half, to 3,000 forces, the top U.S. commander in West Asia said on Wednesday, in a long-expected move that will help fulfil President Donald Trump’s goal of reducing the Pentagon’s overseas deployments. The decision to reduce the 5,200 troops now in Iraq comes three weeks after Mr. Trump met with Mustafa al-Kadhimi, the Iraqi Prime Minister, in Washington, in part to finalise details of the drawdown, which will happen this month. Fight against IS “This reduced footprint allows us to continue advising and assisting our Iraqi partners in rooting out the final remnants of ISIS in Iraq and ensuring its enduring defeat,” Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the military’s Central Command, said in remarks in Iraq on Wednesday, using an alternative name for the Islamic State group. Gen. McKenzie said improvements in the Iraqi military’s campaign against the Islamic State enabled the Pentagon to make the additional troop cuts. “This decision is due to our confidence in the Iraqi security forces’ increased ability to operate independently.” Drawing down to 3,000 troops would bring U.S. force levels in Iraq roughly back to where they were in 2015, when the U.S. was in the early phase of its campaign against the Islamic State, which captured one-third of the country. The move allows Mr. Trump to tell voters he is fulfilling a campaign promise to bring home the troops. But the cuts are relatively modest and pale in comparison to the much larger reductions from when U.S. force levels in the country peaked at more than 150,000 service members at the height of the Iraq War. In a meeting with journalists after the White House gathering, Mr. Kadhimi reaffirmed the need for U.S. military assistance to help fight remnants of the Islamic State. Threat from militias The Pentagon is reluctant to keep more than the absolute minimum of troops in Iraq because they have been attacked by Iranian-backed militias. An attack on an Iraqi base in March killed three soldiers of the U.S.-led military coalition there, two of them Americans, and wounded 14. Since then, the U.S. has consolidated its troops on fewer bases, a repositioning that Gen. McKenzie acknowledged last month had diverted resources from fighting the Islamic State. Separately, the training mission has been suspended for the past several months because of concerns about the coronavirus.NY Times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-to-reduce-troops-in-iraq-to-3000/article32566372.ece
10 September 2020||London,||U.K.’s new law ‘breaches EU treaty’||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was accused on Wednesday of presiding over a “rogue state” as his government introduced legislation that intentionally breaches its EU withdrawal treaty in the messy countdown to a full Brexit divorce. Mr. Johnson defended the government’s approach after its extraordinary admission that the new Bill governing post-Brexit trade in Britain and Northern Ireland breaks international law. Asked why the British public at large should respect any laws now, the Prime Minister told Parliament: “We expect everybody in this country to obey the law.” In a bad-tempered exchange with Scottish nationalist MP Ian Blackford, Mr. Johnson insisted the Bill was about “protecting jobs, protecting growth, ensuring the fluidity and safety of our U.K. internal market”. ‘Legal safety net’ “My job is to uphold the integrity of the U.K. but also to protect the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,” he added, calling the new Bill a “legal safety net” if the EU makes an “irrational interpretation” of post-Brexit arrangements. The government maintains its new U.K. Internal Market Bill is needed to smooth trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and help power a recovery from the pandemic, once a post-Brexit transition ends this year. But under its EU Withdrawal Treaty, Britain is meant to liaise with Brussels on any arrangements for Northern Ireland, which saw decades of bloodshed until the 1998 Good Friday deal, and will become the U.K.’s only land border with the EU. Mr. Blackford argued the new Bill was a power-grab by London from the devolved administrations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. And he gave a withering assessment after Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis had conceded the changes do “break international law in a very specific and limited way”. ‘Creating a rogue state’ “The Prime Minister and his friends, a parcel of rogues, are creating a rogue state,” he added. Mr. Lewis’s admission on Tuesday provoked incredulity across the political spectrum in Britain, Brussels and beyond, just as British and EU negotiators are engaged in fraught talks to agree a new trading relationship. The government has struggled to explain why it has only now discovered problems with the EU treaty’s provisions for Northern Ireland, nine months after Mr. Johnson signed the document and said it set Britain on the path to a sovereign new future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uks-new-law-breaches-eu-treaty/article32566374.ece
10 September 2020||Kabul,||Afghan V-P Saleh sustains minor injuries in Kabul blast||Afghanistan’s Vice-President Amrullah Saleh sustained minor injuries on Wednesday when an explosion targeted his convoy and killed at least 10 people, as government-backed negotiators and the Taliban prepared to meet in Doha for long-delayed peace talks. The attack in the capital Kabul was quickly condemned as an attempt to frustrate the peace process, with top Afghan and foreign officials calling for an end to violence so negotiations between the two warring sides can proceed. In a video posted on Facebook soon after the explosion, Mr. Saleh, an outspoken Taliban critic, said he had been travelling to his office when his convoy was attacked. “I am fine but some of my guards have been wounded. My son, who was in the car with me, and I are both fine,” Mr. Saleh said, with bandages on his left hand. “I have some burns on my face and hand. The blast was strong.” The Interior Ministry said the bomb was placed on a hand cart and detonated remotely when Saleh’s convoy passed by. The Taliban, who have pledged not to launch attacks in urban areas under a deal with the United States, denied responsibility. Abdullah, a shopkeeper who gave only one name, said the blast had blown out windows of his shop. “A shop that sold gas cylinders also caught fire, causing the cylinders to blow up,” he said. “Unfortunately, 10 civilians, mostly people who were working in the area, were killed, and 15, including a number of the first VP’s bodyguards, were wounded,” Tareq Arian, spokesman to the ministry, told reporters at the scene. Mr. Saleh, the senior of Afghanistan’s two Vice-Presidents, survived an assassination attempt last year ahead of presidential elections. At least 20 people — most of them civilians — were killed and 50 others wounded when a suicide attacker and gunmen targeted Mr. Saleh’s Kabul office at that time. Enemies of peace The EU in Afghanistan said Wednesday’s attack was a “desperate act by spoilers of peace efforts”, while NATO’s mission in the country said in a statement that “enemies of peace” were ignoring the will of the Afghan people for peace talks to begin. President Ashraf Ghani, who met Saleh soon after Wednesday’s blast, condemned what he said was a “terrorist attack” on his first deputy. “The terrorists and their foreign backers cannot undermine the people’s strong faith in peace, democracy and the bright future of our country,” Mr. Ghani said in a statement. The head of the Afghan negotiating team, Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, called for violence to stop if the peace process was to succeed. “The time for making excuses has passed. The killing of the people must end,” he said in a statement. Even as preparations for negotiations continue, violence on the ground has carried on unabated, with the Taliban unleashing daily attacks. “There are some elements within the Taliban who don’t care if the talks fail,” said Kabul-based political analyst Atta Noori. The Taliban have been emboldened by a deal with Washington in February that paved the way for the withdrawal of foreign forces and the release of 5,000 militants in a prisoner exchange. “They know that the Afghan government is wearing out, with the international community losing interest in them and paying more attention to the Taliban,” Mr. Noori said. “In short, Taliban want their emirate at any cost and also want no resistance against them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-v-p-saleh-sustains-minor-injuries-in-kabul-blast/article32566359.ece
10 September 2020||SEOUL,||Kim calls for urgent steps after typhoon ravages east||North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for urgent efforts to rebuild thousands of homes and other structures destroyed by a typhoon that slammed the country’s eastern region last week, state media said on Wednesday. Mr. Kim during the Workers’ Party meeting on Tuesday also said the damage from Typhoon Maysak has forced the country to reconsider unspecified year-end projects, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said. The storm has inflicted further pain on an economy already ravaged by U.S.-led sanctions over Mr. Kim’s nuclear weapons program, border closures amid the COVID-19 pandemic and unusually heavy summer flooding that likely worsened the country’s chronic food shortages. KCNA said Maysak left “severe damage” in the eastern town of Komdok, destroying or flooding more than 2,000 homes and dozens of public buildings and paralysing transport systems. More than 60 km of roads in the region were “washed away,” while 59 bridges collapsed. Several miles of railroads were damaged in mining areas, the report said. Mr. Kim described the recovery efforts at Komdok a national priority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kim-calls-for-urgent-steps-after-typhoon-ravages-east/article32566364.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Sri Lankan tea kicks up storm in Lebanon||Lebanon's President Michel Aoun has come under fire after it emerged that tea donated by Sri Lanka for victims of the Beirut blast was distributed instead to families of his presidential guards. Critics see it as yet another example of official corruption in a country reeling from the August 4 explosion that killed more than 190 people, wounded thousands and ravaged central Beirut. Sri Lanka, many of whose expat community in Lebanon work as housemaids, was one of several nations that rushed to show support in the wake of Lebanon's worst peace-time disaster. The President’s office on August 24 released a picture of Mr. Aoun receiving the Sri Lankan Ambassador, and quoted her as saying Colombo had “donated 1,675 kg of Ceylon tea to those affected by the Beirut blast”. After Lebanese media and social media asked what happened to the donation, it issued a second statement on Tuesday. ‘A gift of Ceylon tea’ The presidency said Mr. Aoun had written to his Sri Lankan counterpart to thank him for “a gift of Ceylon tea that had been received by the Army... and distributed to the families of soldiers in the presidential guard”. Social media erupted in criticism, with the hashtags “tea thief” and “Ceylon tea” trending on Twitter. “The tea was sent to the Lebanese, particularly those affected by the explosion. Of course it wasn't a present for those who don't need it,” wrote Paula Yacoubian, a former MP who resigned after the blast many blame on official neglect. “Distributing the aid to your entourage is shameful,” she wrote. Another user quipped: “The excuse that it was a present for the president is even worse than the sin itself.” Beside the tea controversy, social media users have also been up in arms over the fate of 12 tonnes of fish that Mauritania sent in mid-August. Food aid After widespread calls to know its whereabouts, the Army said on Monday it had received the fish and “stored it according to public safety standards”. It was talking to several associations preparing meals for those in need “to cook it and distribute it to those affected by the port blast”. On Twitter, yet another user made light of the food aid controversy. “The presidential palace, or the palace of the people, invites you to a free lunch on Sunday,” she wrote. “Open buffet on Mauritanian fish, and open bar on Ceylon tea.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lankan-tea-kicks-up-storm-in-lebanon/article32566370.ece
10 September 2020||COPENHAGEN,||Norwegian MP nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize||A far-right Norwegian lawmaker said Wednesday that he has nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Middle East. Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of the Norwegian Parliament for the far-right Progress Party, said Mr. Trump should be considered because of his work “for a peace agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel which opens up for possible peace in the Middle East.” Israel and the UAE agreed last month to a historic deal normalising relations and are scheduled to sign it at a White House ceremony on September 15. “No matter how Trump acts at home and what he says at press conferences, he has absolutely a chance at getting the Nobel Peace Prize,” Mr. Tybring-Gjedde, told . Nominations must be sent to the Norwegian Nobel Committee by February 1, meaning the deadline to nominate people for this year’s peace prize has passed. Mr. Tybring-Gjedde was one of two Norwegian lawmakers who nominated Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for his efforts to bring reconciliation between North and South Korea. Any lawmaker serving in a national legislature can nominate someone for the Nobel Peace Prize. ‘Thank you!’ President Trump revelled in his nomination for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. “Thank you!” he said in one of a flurry of tweets and retweets celebrating the nomination. Former U.S. President Barack Obama was awarded the prize in 2009 only months into his first term, a move many felt was premature. The Norwegian committee said it honoured Obama for his commitment to “seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.” Last year, Mr. Trump predicted that he would win the Nobel Prize “for a lot of things if they gave it out fairly, which they don’t.” The Norwegian Nobel Committee doesn’t publicly comment on nominees. Under its rules, the information is required to be kept secret for 50 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/norwegian-mp-nominates-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize/article32566366.ece
10 September 2020||Beijing,||‘Australian spy agency targeted Chinese scribes’||Beijing claimed on Wednesday that Australia’s intelligence agency questioned foreign correspondents working for Chinese state-run media, seizing computers and mobile phones in raids apparently linked to a billowing spy scandal. The accusation, the latest scrap in a diplomatic falling-out that spans security, trade and media freedoms, follows an investigation by Beijing into Australian journalists based in China. The last two foreign correspondents working for Australian media in China, Bill Birtles and Michael Smith, fled on Monday fearing arrest, while another — Cheng Lei, who worked as an anchor for Chinese state TV — is being detained under “national security” laws. On Wednesday, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry added a new layer to the intrigue, saying Australia-based journalists from Xinhua, China News Service and the China Media group were the target of raids by local intelligence agents in late June. Four journalists were “interrogated... on the grounds of a possible breach of Australia’s anti-foreign interference laws,” Mr. Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing. They were questioned and had their phones, computers and even their children’s tablets confiscated. “Australia’s actions causes serious damage to the physical and mental health of the journalists and their families,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/australian-spy-agency-targeted-chinese-scribes/article32566360.ece
10 September 2020||Minsk,||Inclined to hold early election: Lukashenko||Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has faced the biggest protests of his 26-year rule after disputed presidential polls, said on Wednesday that he did not rule out calling early elections but it was too soon to set a date. Unprecedented demonstrations broke out after Mr. Lukashenko claimed to have defeated political novice Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and won re-election with 80% of the vote in the August 9 ballot. In an interview with Russian state media, Mr. Lukashenko said: “I am inclined to conduct an early presidential election. I do not rule this out.” “I am saying this for the first time,” he noted. The Opposition has urged Mr. Lukashenko to acknowledge defeat and step down so that fresh elections can be held according to international standards. His security services have hit back with waves of arrests and deadly violence against protesters and a campaign of intimidation and expulsions against opposition leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/inclined-to-hold-early-election-lukashenko/article32566362.ece

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Realism and the undemarcated border||The “deep conversation” with China that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has indicated must be informed by the past but should be based on the changed global context as festering problems left over from colonialism tend to get re-framed (West Asia is an example), as new trade-offs emerge, and leadership matters. As civilisational states, neighbours and rising powers, India and China have a unique continuing process of diplomatic engagement, even as their militaries face off against each other, which is very different to the international relations theory developed in the West to explain something that had never happened before, the 200 year global colonial and post-colonial world and inapplicable to differences arising from colonial ambiguity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that ‘this is the age of development”, and former Generals of the Leh-based Corps pointing to the undemarcated border, suggesting a ‘practical’ boundary along the Karakoram watershed reframes the national interest. Combined with the recent shift by China from Line of Actual Control (LAC) to Claim Line, a new national debate on demarcating the border is needed. Diplomatic positions The origin of different interpretations of the boundary is poorly surveyed ancient maps of uninhabited areas, visited only by traders and nomads, with even passes at an altitude above 13,000 feet. Commerce dominated economic activity  and several trade routes converged on Leh. With settled agriculture limited to strips along the Indus in the west, Aksai Chin was a kind of no-man’s land, as there was no need for an administration. With the Treaty of Amritsar, in 1846, the British granted Gulab Singh Kashmir without specifying its eastern boundary in Aksai Chin. According to Article 2 of the Treaty, the boundary was to be “defined by a separate engagement after survey”. The first one, the Johnson-Ardagh Line surveyed in 1865, ran along the Kunlun Mountain, included Aksai Chin in Kashmir and was not communicated to China. Another survey, the McCartney-MacDonald Line, ran closer to the Karakoram Range, treating the Indus watershed as the border. The later survey, officially sent by the British to China in 1899, was not followed up, and the border remained ‘undefined’. The dispute continues to be which watershed defines the boundary. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, according to the official transcript of the boundary talks with Premier Chou-en-lai [Zhou Enlai] in April 1960, argued that ‘it is true that the boundary is not marked on the ground; but if delimitation can take place by definition of high mountain areas and watershed and if it is a normally accepted principle of demarcation, then it is precisely defined in the past’, his reference was to the Kun Lun range. Premier Chou’s position was ‘we do not recognise the McMahon line but that we were willing to take a realistic view with Burma and India. It is easy to see that the national boundary between China and India is the Karakoram watershed. This extends from Kilik Pass, passes through the Karakoram Pass to Kongka Pass. Broadly speaking, rivers and streams to the south and west of this belong to India while those to the north and east of it are on China’s side’. Both sides could only agree there was no demarcation on the ground. Ghosts of old Three missteps by both countries have resulted in the current stalemate. First, two civilisational states establishing their identity were ill-advised by poorly informed experts. India issued new maps in 1954 removing the ‘un-demarcated territory’ tag and China in 1957 also showed Aksai Chin with the only traffic artery between Tibet and Xinjiang in its new map. A cartographic ambiguity was converted into clashing sovereignty, with unwarranted inherent notions of ‘concession’ and ‘aggression’. Second, further reliance placed on experts to assist the diplomatic process in reconciling records and custom obfuscated the political nature of the settlement. In 1960, the history and tradition of the area were to be examined by a joint expert group which could not produce an agreed report as earlier maps considered basin boundaries, and not who had exercised control over territory. These deliberations only confirmed that trust, the essential element of a negotiation, was missing. Third, despite the system of engagement from 1993 for “meaningful and mutually acceptable adjustments to their respective positions on the boundary question”, militaries remain tasked with defending borders where ‘grey areas’ and maximum restraint in ‘face to face’ situations have inherent limitations. Infrastructure development increases the potential for action and then reflection, and that process has outlived its utility. The Special Representatives of India and China, set up to resolve the boundary issue and diplomats have had to step in on border management. The missteps extended into the operational sphere. China constructed its strategic highway unhindered, as regular patrolling till all the border passes was not undertaken between 1954 and 1959, when a clash took place near the Kongka Pass, south of the Galwan valley, galvanising hectic diplomatic activity. On the Chinese side also, in 1960, their experts showed Indian experts a new map of the Chinese-claimed ‘traditional customary line’ which was at points well to the west of the alignment of the same area which Premier Chou en-lai had earlier described to Jawaharlal Nehru. Then, as now, public opinion had a disproportionate role and a furore arose when the term territory “administered” by India was used. The Soviet Union (Russia), as in the case of the Galwan face-off, resorted to quiet diplomacy, with a tilt towards India impacting on the disengagement. Re-framing differences The context is no longer newly independent countries unsure of themselves, but neighbours confident in their national power seeking ‘accommodation’. Lt. General P.J.S. Pannu, who commanded the Leh-based Corps, has advocated a boundary settlement laying stress on the difficulties in holding ground ‘divided by this history’, with military clashes inevitable as the LAC is not marked on the ground (https://bit.ly/35jNEfj). Lt. General N.S. Brar, a former chief of staff of the Leh-based Corps, has advocated a ‘sober handling of national security issues’ by ‘accepting Chou-en-lai’s proposal as ‘a practical and honourable accommodation with China’ (https://bit.ly/32eZ42h). National security is more than the military posture. Wedded to the questionable line of 1865, on the Kunlun Range, India has not claimed the more legitimate line of 1899 on the Karakoram watershed (communicated by the British to the Chinese) and which China has accepted as the boundary with Pakistan, and fully covers our patrolling points and strategic heights we now occupy. This translates to the Indus watershed lying within India, with the area to its east in China, including its strategic highway G219. Another new development is the guidance from the Modi-Xi summit, held in Wuhan in 2018, that the boundary question should be considered from the ‘strategic perspective of India-China relations’. The debate should really be whether the Wuhan Spirit, expected to create conditions for the Asian century, Asia with two poles, is still relevant. This marks a shift from India’s earlier stand agreeing with China that problems left over from history be left for another generation. There are indications that Jawaharlal Nehru was inclined towards negotiation but feared his Home Minister, Govind Ballabh Pant, would play the national card to oust him. Prime Minister Modi is secure, within the party and the national trust in him. He should audit the past, explain colonial ambiguity, establish the Himalayan watershed as border, and take a giant step for the $5-trillion economy.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||The twisted trajectory of Bt cotton||Cotton has been woven and used in India for thousands of years. Cotton fabric from around 3,000 BCE has been excavated from the ruins of Mohenjo-daro, and archaeological findings in Mehrgarh, Pakistan, show that cotton was used in the subcontinent as far back as 5,000 BCE. Indian cotton fabrics dominated the world trade during the succeeding millennia and were exported to many places, including Greece, Rome, Persia, Egypt, Assyria and parts of Asia. Much of the cotton cultivated until the 20th century was of the indigenous ‘desi’ variety,Gossypium arboreum. From the 1990s, hybrid varieties ofG. hirsutumwere promoted. These hybrids cannot resist a variety of local pests and require more fertilizers and pesticides. Cotton suffers from plenty of infestation from moth pests(Lepidopteran)such as the Pink Bollworm (PBW) and sap-sucking(Hemipteran) pests such as aphids and mealy bugs. With increasing pressure to buy hybrid seeds, the indigenous varieties have lost out over the years. But recently, there has been some resurgence of interest. The increasing use of synthetic pyrethroids (group of man-made pesticides) to control pests and the rising acreage under the American long-duration cotton led to the emergence of resistant pests. Resistant Pink and even American Bollworm (ABW), a minor pest in the past, began increasing, leading to a growing use of a variety of pesticides. Rising debts and reducing yields, coupled with increasing insect resistance, worsened the plight of cotton farmers. It was in this setting that Bt cotton was introduced in India in 2002. Genetically modified (GM) cotton, the plant containing the pesticide gene from the bacteriaBacillus thuringiensis(Bt), has been grown in India for about twenty years. This pesticide, now produced in each Bt plant cell, ought to protect the plant from bollworm, thereby increasing yields and reducing insecticide spraying on the cotton plant. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, from 2005, adoption of Bt cotton rose to 81% in 2007, and up to 93% in 2011. Many short-duration studies examining Bt cotton, in the early years, pronounced that Bt was a panacea for dwindling yields and pesticide expenses. The two-decade mark now provides an opportunity to review GM cotton in India more comprehensively. Broad review In March this year, K.R. Kranthi and Glenn Davis Stone published a review in the scientific journalNature Plants, analysing the entire picture of the use of Bt cotton in India. Earlier studies had attributed to Bt the tripling of cotton yield between 2002-2014 in India. However, one detail that sullied such a conclusion was that yield differences between farmers who were the early adopters of Bt cotton and those who were not suffered from selection bias. Controlling for such bias showed (in 2012) that the contribution of Bt cotton to yield increase was only about 4% each year; still, since yields vary annually by over 10%, the benefits claimed were dubious. Kranthi and Stone’s review examines data over 20 years, studying each State separately and correcting for illegal Bt cotton planting. There are discrepancies between yield and the deployment of Bt cotton. For instance, the Bt acreage was only 3.4% of the total cotton area in 2003, not sufficient to credit it for the 61% increase in yield in 2003-2004. Furthermore, with only 15.7% Bt cotton coverage by 2005, yield increases were over 90% over 2002 levels. While Bt cotton adoption corresponded to a drop in spraying for bollworms, the study states, “countrywide yields stagnated after 2007 even as more farmers began to grow Bt. By 2018, yields were lower than in the years of rapid Bt adoption.” Individual State data are more helpful in understanding subnational trends. In Maharashtra, yields climbed in the decade after 2000, with no change in the rate of increase when Bt cotton was introduced. In Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as well, there is no correlation between the adoption of the variety and increase in yields. For instance, Gujarat’s surge in cotton yields was 138% in 2003, even as Bt cotton was used only for 5% of land under cotton. Similar findings are seen in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, where yield increase is incongruous with the spread of Bt cotton. The rise in cotton yields can be explained by improvements in irrigation, for instance in Gujarat, and a dramatic growth across the country in the use of fertilizers. Gross fertilizer use for cotton more than doubled from 2007-2013; the average rose from 98 kg/ha in 2003 to 224 kg/ha in 2013. There is a strong correlation between the rise in use of fertilizers in individual States and yields, and this bias increases when it is combined with improvements in irrigation. The total insecticide expenditure per hectare reduced in 2006, andLepidopteranspraying expenditures continued to fall until 2011. While the ABW that feeds on different plants does not appear to have developed a resistance to Bt, the PBW developed a resistance by 2009 in India. In a few years, the situation was dreadful. Bollworm spraying began to climb again. Sap-sucking insects have surged for the hybrids, as thehirsutumBt cotton hybrids are quite vulnerable. With rising acreage under Bt cotton cultivation, expenditures for spraying for sucking pests also went up. By 2018, farmers were spending an average of $23.58 per hectare on insecticide — 37% more than the pre-Bt levels. Real-world challenges It is tough to isolate one particular aspect of a technology and evaluate it properly. A technology that works in the lab may fail in fields since real-world success hinges on multiple factors, such as different kinds of pests and local soil and irrigation conditions. The benefits of Bt cotton have been modest and short-lived. Changes to the agricultural systems correlate better with positive yields, and countrywide yields have not improved in thirteen years. India’s global rank for cotton production is 36 despite heavy fertilizer use, irrigation, chemicals and Bt cotton usage. This is below the national average of some resource-poor African countries that don’t have Bt, hybrids or good access to inputs. The cost of ignoring ‘desi’ varieties for decades has been high for India. These varieties resist many pests and don’t present the problems faced with hybrids. Research suggests that with pure-line cotton varieties, high density planting, and short season plants, cotton yields in India can be good and stand a better chance at withstanding the vagaries of climate change. But government backing for resources, infrastructure and seeds is essential to scale up ‘desi’ varieties. It is time to pay attention to science and acknowledge that Bt cotton has failed in India, and not enter into further misadventures with other Bt crops such as brinjal or herbicide resistance.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||In blockchain voting, leave out the general election||The Election Commission of India has for a while now been toying with the idea of further digitising the electoral infrastructure of the country. In furtherance of this, the Election Commission had, last month, held an online conference in collaboration with the Tamil Nadu e-Governance Agency (“TNeGA”) and IIT Madras (https://bit.ly/35k4niQ), through which they explored the possibility of using blockchain technology for the purpose of enabling remote elections. While this exploration is still only in the nascent stages, there are several concerns that must be considered at the offset with utmost caution. Rise in new applications A blockchain is a distributed ledger of information which is replicated across various nodes on a “peer-to-peer” network for the purpose of ensuring integrity and verifiability of data stored on the ledger. Blockchain ledgers have traditionally been used as supporting structures for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum; however, their use in non-cryptocurrency applications too has seen a steady rise, with some solutions allowing individuals and companies to draft legally-binding “smart contracts,” enabling detailed monitoring of supply chain networks, and several projects focused on enabling remote voting and elections. Arguments in favour of remote voting are plenty. In the way the envisioned system has been described, ‘remote voting’ would appear to benefit internal migrants and seasonal workers, who account for roughly 51 million of the populace (Census 2011), and who have, as a matter of record, faced considerable difficulties in exercising their democratic right of voting. The envisioned solution might also be useful for some remotely-stationed members of the Indian armed forces, though it should be noted that, for the most part, vote casting has not been an issue for those serving in even the remotest of places including the Siachen Glacier, which, given its altitude, is considered to be the ‘highest battleground’ on the planet. Key issues, security concerns The problems with the blockchain-based remote voting systems are manifold. At an earlier event held by the Election Commission, then Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena, explained that electors would still have to physically reach a designated venue in order to cast their vote, adding that systems would use “white-listed IP devices on dedicated internet lines”, and that the system would make use of the biometric attributes of electors. Digitisation and interconnectivity introduce additional points of failure external to the processes which exist in the present day. The system envisioned by the Election Commission is perhaps only slightly more acceptable than a fully remote, app-based voting system (which face a litany of issues of their own, and which have so far only been deployed in a few low-level elections in the West). The systems used in such low-stakes elections have suffered several blunders too, some of which could have been catastrophic if they had gone undetected. Blockchain solutions rely heavily on the proper implementation of cryptographic protocols. If any shortcomings exist in an implementation, it might stand to potentially unmask the identity and voting preferences of electors, or worse yet, allow an individual to cast a vote as someone else. In Russia, during the vote on the recent controversial constitutional amendment ushered in by Russian President Vladimir Putin, citizens were able to cast their vote online. While the voting process was still under way, a Russian media outlet reported that it was possible to access and decrypt the votes stored on the blockchain due to a flaw in cryptographic implementation, which could have been used to unmask the votes cast by electors. The requirement of physical presence and biometric authentication may not necessarily make a remote voting system invulnerable to attacks either. An attacker may be able to clone the biometric attributes required for authenticating as another individual and cast a vote on their behalf. Physical implants or software backdoors placed on an individual system could allow attackers to collect and deduce voting choices of individuals. Further, while the provisioning of a dedicated line may make the infrastructure less prone to outages, it may also make it increasingly prone to targeted Denial-of-Service attacks (where an attacker would be in a position to block traffic from the system, effectively preventing, or at the very least delaying the registration of votes). More attack scenarios that the system might be vulnerable to will slowly become evident when additional details about the hypothesised system are disclosed. Apart from lingering security issues, digitised systems may also stand to exclude and disenfranchise certain individuals due to flaws in interdependent platforms, flaws in system design, as well as general failures caused by external factors. Naturally, the more levers that are involved in the operation of a system, the more prone it would become to possible malfunction. Other solutions If the only problem that is to be solved is the one of ballot portability, then perhaps technological solutions which involve setting up entirely new, untested voting infrastructure may not be the answer. Political engagement could perhaps be improved by introducing and improving upon other methods, such as postal ballots or proxy voting. Another proposed solution to this issue includes the creation of a ‘One Nation, One Voter ID’ system, though it is unclear whether such a radical (and costly) exercise would be required at all for the mere purpose of allowing individuals to vote out of their home State. An obsession India can characteristically be described as a country obsessed with techno-solutionism. If a solution uses technology, the general consensus is that it must work. However, this optimism for technological solutions poses a threat and could stand to hinder free and fair elections in the future, if unchecked. It is important to lay stress on the point that further digitisation, in itself, does not make processes more robust. Any solution to electoral problems must be software independent and fault tolerable, where failure or tampering of one mechanism — or several — would not affect the integrity or transparency of the overall process. Even if the Election Commission is able to design a system which is proven to be satisfactorily secure in the face of attacks, where tampering could be detected, and where the integrity of the ballot is verifiable by electors, use of such a system could perhaps only be justified for lower level elections, and not for something as significant and politically binding as the general election.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Rethinking the defence doctrine||Over four months ago, the Chinese army entered territory that India has long considered its own, and never left. In effect, the multiple incursions have changed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and India has lost territory, at least for the time being. How could this happen? In part, it was a failure of the warning-intelligence system. Either Indian intelligence services did not collect sufficient data of Chinese intentions and early moves, or they did not interpret it correctly, or their policy and military customers failed to take the warning seriously. Wherever the fault lay, the system apparently failed. In part, however, the problem also lay in the Army’s concepts for defending the country’s borders. It is, as the current crisis shows, simply not postured or prepared for the type of security threat China presents. As I argued in a recent research study for Carnegie India, the Army’s prevailing doctrine is designed to deter and defend against major conventional invasions. This determines how the Army is organised, what equipment it operates, and where it is deployed. The Army expects to win wars, against Pakistan or China, by launching its own punitive offensives after an enemy attack, to either destroy enemy forces or seize enemy land. In this mindset, the Army expected that any Chinese bid to capture Indian territory would come as a major conventional invasion, as it did in 1962. The Indian response would accordingly involve large formations, with planning and command decisions made at the Corps headquarters or higher. But the Chinese army’s initial forays in April and May did not look like a guns-blazing invasion. It crossed the LAC in several places nearly simultaneously, and in larger numbers than usual. Still, the Indian Army probably expected the stand-off would repeat the pattern of years past: China would make its point with a temporary transgression and retreat after talks. In the meantime, Indian forces would reinforce their positions but hold back. Indian forces were under strict instructions from New Delhi that any aggressive response must be avoided as it would inflame the situation. It is now clear that the national security leadership and the Army miscalculated. China has no interest in launching a major conventional invasion, but this is not just a typical probe either. Rather, its quick land grab looks increasingly permanent, like an attempt to change the border without triggering war. This fait accompli leaves India with two awful choices: either start a war by launching its own reprisal attack, or do nothing and accept a new status quo. Addressing this type of security threat requires preventing, not reversing, such fait accompli land grabs. This requires a fundamental shift in the Army’s doctrinal thinking, from strategies revolving around punishing the adversary, to strategies that prevent its adventurism in the first place. Speed is of the essence In practice, this does not mean an unbroken picket of soldiers all along the border. It does, however, mean a greater investment in persistent wide-area surveillance to detect and track adversary moves, devolved command authority to respond to enemy aggression, and rehearsed procedures for an immediate local response without higher commanders’ approval. In countering China’s ‘grey zone’ tactics of quick land grabs, speed is of the essence. The military must be able to detect adversary action and react quickly, even pre-emptively, to stop attempted aggression from becoming a fait accompli. In peacetime, local commanders must have the authority and gumption to take anticipatory action and go on the offensive or fill forward defensive positions. The late-August incident at Chushul demonstrates how this can and should work. Indian special forces troops took position on previously unoccupied heights south of Pangong Tso. In so doing they have complicated future Chinese moves to consolidate their position, and may even hold some Chinese positions at risk. The country’s attempts to seize more ground have been foiled. Unfortunately, China was not foiled in its initial seizure of Indian territory. Reversing that occupation will require a remarkable feat of Indian statecraft. A military solution is decreasingly likely as China reinforces its deployments. Taking strident offensive actions now, amidst a heavily militarised crisis, may be hazardous because it carries new risks of unintended escalation. The challenge for India is to learn the right lessons and be alert to similar tactics in other regions, like the Indian Ocean. It must not rely on doctrines forged in wars half a century ago.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Redefining a farmer||The agriculture sector saw a slew of immediate and strategic stimuli under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ programme after a nationwide lockdown was declared on March 25 this year. The post COVID-19 responses in the sector range from investments in agri-infrastructure, logistics and capacity building to governance and administrative reforms. The direct cash transfer scheme under PM-KISAN and the credit boost through PM Kisan Credit Cards have benefitted farmers both directly and indirectly. Ownership of cultivable land as per land records is a mandatory criterion for being eligible under the PM-KISAN scheme, and an estimated 104.56 million farmers had benefitted from the plan as on August 23. However, there have been many debates about the definition of a ‘beneficiary’ under the plan. The Rs. 110 crore scam reported in the PM-KISAN scheme in Tamil Nadu recently is also a stark reminder of how even eligible beneficiaries can be cheated out of the scheme by colluding officials. Traditionally, land ownership is a mandatory criterion for availing benefits under various agricultural schemes in India. But is it an appropriate criterion for defining a ‘farmer’? Laws governing land leasing operate at different levels across India. The Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 was introduced to formalise land leasing based on the recommendation of an expert panel appointed by NITI Aayog. However, except a few States, a majority of State governments have not extended the scope of the Act to farmers. According to the 2015-16 agricultural census, about 2.65 million operational holdings are either partially or wholly leased. The impact of agrarian distress is felt disproportionately by tenant farmers. The tenant farmer incurs the costs (including the rental payments) and faces the risks, while the owner receives the rent, subsidies and other support. The lessees do not benefit from loan waivers, moratorium and institutional credit, and are forced to be at the mercy of moneylenders. The distress is reflected in the fact that tenant farmers account for a majority of farmer suicides reported in the NCRB data. There are multiple definitions for a ‘farmer’ in official data published by the Government of India. The population census defines ‘cultivators’ as a person engaged in cultivation of land either ‘owned’ or held in kind or share. The 59th round of the Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of farmers, conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), also stresses on ‘possession of land’ either owned or leased or otherwise possessed for defining ‘farmers’. Delinking of land as the defining criterion for a ‘farmer’ was done in the 70th round of SAS carried out by the NSSO, wherein agricultural households were defined as those receiving some value of produce from agricultural activities during the previous 365 days. Further, a minimum cut off value of Rs. 3,000 for agricultural produce in the last 365 days was fixed as an additional requirement. This was done to exclude households with insignificant shares of income obtained from agriculture. Similarly, the National Policy for Farmers, 2007 adopts a broad-based definition independent of ‘land ownership’ as well as ‘value of produce’. This definition includes everyone engaged in agriculture and allied activities to eke out a livelihood, including persons engaged in shifting cultivation and collection of non-timber forest produce. The definition adopted in the 70th Round of NSSO seems to be appropriate. It can be further refined to define a farmer as one who earns a major part of the income from farming. The definition delinks agriculture production from land per se, and not just ownership. Access to land as a policy instrument in bringing about equitable growth of rural economies needs no further emphasis. However, until the time ‘land to the tiller’ remains just wishful thinking, adopting a broader definition of a ‘farmer’ is a short-term solution to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth. Dr. M.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Digital disconnect||The full report of the NSO’s survey of ‘Household Social Consumption on Education in India’, for July 2017-June 2018, highlights the poor state of computer and Internet access in several States. The disparities are glaring among different economic strata as well. The digital chasm that separates the privileged from the deprived remains unbridged years after the broadband policy of 2004, and its effects are painfully evident during the pandemic as students struggle to log on to online classes. While some poorly connected States may have improved since the survey period, the gaps are so stark that any development could only be modest. Only in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala did the survey find Internet access exceeding 50% for urban and rural households taken together, while Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand exceeded 40%, unimpressive numbers still. Large States — Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka — had access below 20%. In today’s milieu, net access is critical, considering that even where mobile phones and laptops are available — some States provide them under student welfare programmes — they cannot be meaningfully used in its absence. If net connectivity is 5% to 10% in rural Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal, only a slim minority can hope to do any academic work. Many remote locations have reliability problems and power deficits, making it a challenge to keep gadgets operational even offline. Prime Minister Modi has acknowledged the digital divide by announcing in his Independence Day address that all villages would be connected with optical fibre cable in 1,000 days. This target, reflecting enhanced ambition, follows the one set in 2011 to link panchayats through a national optical fibre network — to raise administrative capacities through information infrastructure. Evidently, successive governments have dropped the ball. States have not shown the alacrity to make a big leap either, and the deficit has now dealt a blow to students. To make up for lost time, connectivity for education must be prioritised. Mapping the needs of each district based on the NSO data will help identify areas where children do need equipment and connectivity. Such efforts have been launched globally in the wake of COVID-19, some in partnership with the telecom sector to leverage its capacity for surveys and mapping. Some companies in India have made the valuable suggestion that their used desktop computers could be refurbished and donated, for which governments need to open a programme. On the network technology front, a new gigabit speed ‘wireless fibre’ standard is being viewed in developed countries as a leapfrog option to link inaccessible areas; it involves high capacity spectrum (E and V bands), and is commercially not contentious. The government needs to look at all possibilities and go into overdrive to bridge the digital divide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/digital-disconnect/article32566341.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||A necessary pause||The global clamour for a COVID-19 vaccine has whipped up unrealistic expectations that one is just around the corner. It is thus a reality check when biopharma company AstraZeneca, piloting its vaccine candidate, AZD1222 — there were large Phase-3 trials this month — said it was voluntarily putting the multi-national trial on hold. This was after a ‘serious adverse event’ in a volunteer, which a data safety monitoring board will now examine. The company’s move was first reported by an independent medical news site, underlining the critical role that independent scrutiny plays in one of the greatest global crises. Without a specific cure, the vaccine quest has become more than just a search along the pathway that research and pharma companies have traditionally taken. There are demands that probable vaccines be put into a pipeline for accelerated approval to yield political dividends too. U.S. President Trump has ‘demanded’ that a vaccine be available before voting day in November. India had its moment of vaccine controversy when the ICMR harried trialists to expedite testing of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin by August 15. Russia, which is to commence its Sputnik V’s Phase-3 testing, has launched a publicity blitz. Just before reports of the trial pause, AstraZeneca and eight companies developing vaccines signed a pledge that they would not approach regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. FDA, until they had safety and efficacy data from a Phase-3 trial. Overall, the road to a vaccine has become an arena for marketing and jingoism. AZD1222 has already been tested in Phase-1 and Phase-2 trials, where the data on its safety and ability to induce a relevant response by the immune system were evaluated and independent peer-review had deemed it fit to be tested in larger populations. A Phase-3 trial is the most daunting one. In the case of a vaccine, there is the additional burden of proof that it cannot sicken the healthy and the odds of adverse reactions greatly increase when a piece of virus is injected into thousands of volunteers. Vaccine trials take years of development precisely because of the chances of unexpected complications and to expect a vaccine, which has cleared accelerated Phase-1/2 trials, to inexorably clear Phase-3, flies in the face of evidence from the history of vaccine development. Developed at Oxford, AZD1222 was evolved on an adenovirus platform not used in a commercially approved vaccine in humans. They have however been used in an experimental Ebola vaccine. India and the world will gain from a vaccine that has been critically and transparently evaluated and not one that crosses a chimerical finish line first.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-necessary-pause/article32566342.ece

They said it would not work and yet it works”, Mrs. Gandhi said. “Those who now concede that non-alignment had some utility in days of cold war confrontation maintain that it is no longer so. Reviling it not any more on the basis and principle but of its practice”, she said. Referring to India’s stand on non-aligment, Mrs. Gandhi said: “As my father declared we are in no camp and in no military alliance.

Prepared himself for the greatest of sacrifices, it is open to question whether he does not impose upon his following conditions the rigor of which is greater than it can bear. The strength of a chain is not in its strongest but in its weakest link. That is precisely why we have so often insisted on the necessity for hastening slowly in the matter on Non-Co-operation, the need for preparing the ground by vigorous propaganda and for making a beginning with steps that are likely to find acceptance by the majority of the people. That is the sum total of the “betrayal” of which so much capital is being made in the Besantine and Moderate press. These, more royalist than the king would have us “go the whole hog” or repudiate Non-Co-operation and pretend to find in Mr. Gandhi’s programme the irreducible minimum of Non-Co-operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mr-gandhis-gesture-from-an-editorial/article32566350.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Retail auto sales fall 27% in Aug.’||Retail automobile sales continued to decline in August, with overall sales witnessing 26.8% contraction year-on-year to more than 11.88 lakh units, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) said. However, the pace of decline showed some improvement from the preceding month. Tractors continued to be the only segment showing a positive retail sales trend with a growth of 27.8% to 67,406 units as against 52,744 units in the same month of 2019. PV sales While passenger vehicles (PV) sales in August 2020 fell by 7.12% to over 1.78 lakh units, the two-wheeler sales declined nearly 28.7% to about 8.98 lakh units. Commercial vehicle (CV) retail sales tumbled 57.4% to 26,536 units, while three-wheeler sales were down 69.5% to 16,857 units. In July 2020, the total retail sales had fallen 36.3% year-on-year to about 11.42 lakh units — with PV sales down 25.2% to over 1.57 lakh units, two-wheeler sales down 37.5% to 8.74 units and CV sales down 72.2% to 19,292 units, according to FADA’s data. Noting that the PV segment saw a single-digit decline after five months, newly elected FADA president Vinkesh Gulati said, “Customers who were sitting on the fence, finally concluded their purchase during ongoing festivals of Janmashtami and Ganesh Chaturthi. Entry-level PVs were in high demand as personal mobility is being preferred with the current pandemic showing no signs of reduction.” He added that while the rural market was already showing revival signs, urban centres, for the first time, had also showed initial signs of a demand pull-back. Overall demand is still not back to pre-COVID-19 levels as banks and NBFCs continue to have a cautious approach towards funding, which is negatively impacting the CV segment. Mr. Gulati said that while OEMs were dispatching vehicles to dealers with a purpose of stocking-up inventory for the upcoming festival season, retail sales were still at 70-75% levels despite the low base of last year. “FADA advises extreme caution to all OEMs and our dealer fraternity to avoid excessive inventory build-up thus leading to unmanageable interest cost which could further result in dealership closures,” Mr. Gulati said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-auto-sales-fall-27-in-aug/article32566336.ece
10 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Bold action needed to revive economy, says industry||Following a 23.9% contraction in GDP in the first quarter of FY21, industry has urged “bold and decisive” action from the government to stimulate demand for India to return to a positive growth trajectory, the findings of a survey show. Conducted in August and covering 166 firms, the survey by FICCI and Dhruva Advisors said weak demand continued to remain the key bottleneck as almost 68% have reported this as their biggest challenge; 41% have said sales in August were less than 50% from a year earlier. Another 21%, reported sales between 50%-75% of the August 2019 figures. “Reviving the economy requires sustained effort, especially when, in the first quarter, our GDP suffered a major blow,” said Sangita Reddy, president, FICCI. “In the absence of a major fiscal push on the demand side, we could end up being stuck in a quagmire of a low demand and low-income cycle. If we have to return to the positive growth trajectory, the time for bold and decisive action is now.” The sharp GDP contraction was a matter of great concern and clearly underlined the need for a major stimulus to energise and strengthen demand in the economy, said FICCI. In June, only 25% of firms had reported that unlocking of the economy had a positive impact on their order books, while in August, 44% reported an improvement post opening up of the economy. Survey participants also suggested measures on supporting demand, including additional cash transfers to migrant workers, the poor and farmers; temporary cut in GST rates; increase in government procurement; front-ending infrastructure projects and part funding of wages as had been done in other nations to ensure employment was sustained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bold-action-needed-to-revive-economy-says-industry/article32566328.ece

With exposures to most corporates with weak financial health already recognised as NPLs, currently performing loans are better placed to withstand stress,” he said. “Lending in the past few years has been concentrated among stronger [firms] amid an overall slowdown in capital expenditure, while banks have also become more conservative”. “Job losses, declines in income and disruptions to business will strain the finances of retail and SME borrowers significantly,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gdp-contraction-raising-flags-over-lenders-asset-quality/article32566318.ece

While it was expected that the impact on revenue streams due to the shutdown and slowdown will last till October, current trends indicate only 30% occupancy in hotels till the start of the next year as opposed to an average annual occupancy of 68%. However, it added these are the worst-case scenarios.

Maybe there are many stakeholders who have been hurt... they might have been hurt very badly, I agree,” he said. He added many times popular decisions were not the right decisions and vice versa, “but we should not be guided by any pulls and pressures... however, it is also true that the industry, the way it is organised... there are a lot of huge stakes, people do sometimes attribute motives and it pains you.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tried-to-be-absolutely-unbiased-trais-sharma/article32566329.ece

10 September 2020||Chennai,||MRF Pace Foundation stays on course||There are times when you have to innovate and seek answers to vexing questions. The MRF Pace Foundation here had to find similar solutions after the outbreak of COVID-19. The final batch of trainees were here till the last week of March and by then the pandemic struck the country and the Foundation had to send the boys back to their respective States. However, head coach M. Senthilnathan, along with MRF’s Director of coaching, the legendary Glenn McGrath, came up with plans to keep the boys in shape. They found out what equipment the trainees had at home and gave the boys specific routines. Senthilnathan told The Hindu : “The idea was to keep the boys fresh and in good physical condition.”  They would monitor the boys through videos and change their routines every week. Push-ups and a set of exercises for developing their core strength were included and if the boys had a long corridor in their homes, they would be asked to bowl with a shortened run-up. Their bowling action would be analysed through videos and Senthil said: “We wanted to keep their motor speed going.” Around July, when the government relaxed some of the rules and the players were permitted to practise alone or with a trainer, the pacemen constantly sent videos of their bowling. Senthil said, “We would have discussions over Zoom about how their bowling looked and how it could be improved.” The Foundation has a MoU with Cricket Australia for the exchange of cricketers but that could not happen this year. And McGrath, who visits MRF thrice a year, has been unable to travel because of the pandemic. Every year, the Pace Foundation is active till September after which the boys travel to their States as various domestic competitions get underway. Different year This year has been different. Senthil said, “Apart from those in the main side, eight of our bowlers have travelled to the IPL in the UAE as net bowlers. We are monitoring them.” Senthil hopes that by the time the MRF facility reopens next year, a vaccine would be available. “We do not want to put the boys under risk,” he said even as the MRF Pace Foundation continues to stay relevant in these difficult times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mrf-pace-foundation-stays-on-course/article32566525.ece

10 September 2020||Kochi,||Don’t allow DSD athletes in national meets: Usha||While watching athletes closely at national meets over the last few years, P.T. Usha has often wondered whether some of the girls running there were genuinely female. And now, with South Africa’s double Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya losing her appeal in the Swiss Federal Tribunal against regulations that force women with high testosterone levels to take medication to compete internationally in events from the 400m to the mile, Usha feels that athletes with similar issues in India will try to get out of these events. “I think we have some such 20 athletes in our country. Most of them are running in the 400m and 800m with one or two in the 1500m,” said Usha in a chat with The Hindu on Wednesday. “And I feel quartermilers will not take medication to reduce their testosterone level to run the event. Isn’t the high testosterone level the reason for them winning. Will they win after taking medicines to lower it? “They will do the next best thing, run the 200m. We need to watch them closely.” However, it looks like tests are going on to see how fast these athletes can run under medication. “I feel, at the top level, there are two to three athletes in our country with this condition. And they they might be trying to see how they are running the 400m with medicines,” said Usha. Spoiling chances “If they are allowed in national meets, it will spoil the chances of other girls. First of all, when our natural girls see such athletes they will feel demoralised,” explained Usha. “Since a lot of tests have been conducted and since their results have come, countries would have been told that athletes with such issues cannot compete in international meets. The right thing to do is to ensure that such athletes are not allowed in nationals also. What is the point in allowing them to compete only in national meets if they cannot compete internationally?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dont-allow-dsd-athletes-in-national-meets-usha/article32566760.ece

10 September 2020||KOLKATA,||Jeje’s exclusion: MFA writes to Sports Minister||The Mizoram Football Association (MFA) has stood up for one of its most decorated footballers, Jeje Lalpekhlua, in seeking “answers” as to why the striker was not conferred the Arjuna Award despite getting nominated on three occasions in the last four years. In a letter addressed to the Union Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, the MFA took up the issue after Jeje conveyed his “shock and dismay” on being ignored. The MFA approached the Sports Minister for “Inquiry regarding disregard of Jeje Lalpekhlua for the Arjuna Award”. The MFA letter argued that Arjuna Awards committee went for the “lesser capped” players on all the three occasions (in 2017, 2019 and 2020) Jeje was nominated by All India Football Federation. “Jeje has earned 56 caps for India, scoring 23 goals, second only to Sunil Chhetri in the national scoring charts among active players. He is currently ranked sixth on the all time scorers list. Gurpreet Singh Sandhu (2019) and Sandesh Jhingan (2020), who both have earned worthy acclamation through their storied careers, have earned 38 and 36 caps respectively,” said MFA in its letter. Shocked “I am very happy for my National team colleagues Gurpreet and Sandesh for receiving the Arjuna Award but am shocked at the same time for being disregarded despite having better credentials on each occasion,” Jeje said. “If you look at my records, there is no one near me among the nominated candidates. “I am sad for the rejection but I will take that as a motivation to do even better when I return to the field now,” Jeje, who was named the AIFF player of the year in 2016, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jejes-exclusion-mfa-writes-to-sports-minister/article32566464.ece

10 September 2020||KOLKATA,||Rijiju requests WADA to lift ban on NDTL||Claiming that the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) is now ‘fully compliant’ with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) requirements, Union Sports Ministry Kiren Rijiju has requested WADA to lift the suspension on NDTL. Rijiju apprised WADA president Witold Banka of the development during an online meeting on Tuesday. “I have been informed that NDTL has submitted all the 47 corrective action reports to WADA as per timelines defined by WADA and also sent a compliance report on the 13 decision points conveyed by the Chair of the WADA Executive Committee. Fully compliant “With this, NDTL now stands fully compliant with all requirements of WADA and the International Standard of Laboratories (ISL). I would request you to expedite the process and organise to lift the suspension of NDTL’s WADA accreditation,” said Rijiju, as per a Sports Ministry statement on Wednesday. WADA had suspended NDTL for six months on August 20, 2019 due to non-conformities — including in relation to the laboratory’s isotope ratio mass spectrometry analytical method — with the ISL. The method, also known as GC/C/IRMS, needs the highest level of sensitivity to detect the presence of the smallest amount of steroid in an athlete’s body. In July last, WADA had extended NDTL’s suspension for another six months. Rijiju invited a WADA team for an on-site visit of NDTL. Financial contribution Besides, the Sports Minister offered to support WADA in terms of greater financial contribution as well as manpower resources. “We are good at scientific research and I feel that the presence of Indian representatives in your various committees will be beneficial,” said Rijiju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rijiju-requests-wada-to-lift-ban-on-ndtl/article32566468.ece

10 September 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||This IPL will be a different challenge: Anantha||K.N. Ananthapadmanabhan feels that the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will present a different sort of challenge to the umpires and officials. The former Kerala captain, who is officiating in his fifth season in the IPL, said the absence of crowd will make little difference to umpiring as the on-field intensity will remain the same as in the previous years. Ananthapadmanabhan said it will be a challenge and different experience for the umpires to stay and perform in the bio-secure bubble. Noise factor “We are used to officiating in the IPL before large noisy crowd and are always under pressure. But noise factor will not be there in the UAE if the matches are to be played in empty stadiums. “For most of us, this will be our first assignment in six months and it is important for us to get back into our groove quickly. The bio-secure bubble is something which we are not used to and it will be a challenge. We have to follow the Standard Operating procedures (SOP) which is same for everyone,'' he said. “Personally, I am relieved that the IPL is finally happening.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Concern for samsaris||The Supreme One not only created the world, but gave the world Sastras, which show how a jivatma can attain moksha. The Lord is impartial and can be likened to a rain laden cloud. When the cloud gives rain, it is unconcerned about who benefits. What we face in life is a result of our karma. Ideally, the atma must be in control of the body. But we are pulled by our desires, and let the body govern us. And we are caught in the ocean of samsara, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. It is said that samsara is full of horrors — samsara sagaram ghoram. Samsara has all kinds of sufferings — ananta klesha bhaajanam. We are like a man caught in a flooded river. Someone passing by gives him a boat and oars, advising him to row his way to safety. But the man throws away the oars, for he is too lazy to exert himself. In such a case, he is doomed to drown. We are very much like this man. We do not follow the Sastras, because we lack jnana to understand them. But it is said that we acquire jnana only if we study the Sastras. This is called anyonya asraya — a state of mutual dependence of two things. So, if the Sastras, meant to save us, are not taken as the proper guide by us, then how else can the Lord save us? That is why He decided to take avataras. Pillai Lokacharya, in his Srivachana Bhushanam, says that in Sri Vaikuntha, the place where nothing but joy prevails, the Lord is worshipped by nitya suris and muktatmas. And yet, He is not happy, for His thoughts are with those on earth, who do not know what they should do to attain moksha. Imagine a father who has some sons living with him, but his thoughts are always with the one son who lives far away. Likewise, the Lord too worries about those caught up in samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/concern-for-samsaris/article32566422.ece

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Check in. Relax. But touch me not||The reception, for ages, has been an inevitable and arguably important part of our hotel stays. It is where we arrive to check in, request an extra blanket or complain about the TV remote. It is also our last point of contact before exiting the hotel. But the pandemic has changed this reception routine. To reduce contact as much as possible, many hotels have introduced online check-ins, wherein guests can enter their room directly, bypassing reception. And, this is just one of the many disruptions guests witness in hotels during the pandemic. As accommodations across the country slowly re-emerge after the lockdown, their main challenge is to ease the anxieties of their consumers. A Pune-based IT employee Rajdeep Sen, 42, stays in hotels at least twice a year. “I will now avoid hotels at least until the vaccine is ready,” he says. Hospitality brands are fast adopting digital technology to reduce contact. Post-lockdown changes When Bengaluru-based entrepreneur Arun S checked into The Residency hotel in Coimbatore, he had in his room an iPad with which he could customise the lighting, control the TV and the AC and order food. “To an extent, it reduced my anxiety of interacting with people during these times.” The Oberoi Group, apart from employing a similar technology, has introduced tent cards with QR codes across all their restaurants which allows diners to view menus on their phones. Interestingly, The Residency and Oberoi implemented iPad-based technology before COVID-19. The Residency’s chief operating officer Gopinath Balasundaram says, “We introduced it in some of our properties to provide a unique experience to our guests.” But what used to be a matter of convenience has now become an aspect of safety. Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL), the parent company of Taj hotels, has tightened its safety guidelines in all their hotels. Some of their post-lockdown changes include mandatory temperature checks for guests and staff, frequent cleaning of high-touch points like elevators and lobbies, suspension of self-serving buffets and reduction in the number of restaurant tables. Vinay Deshpande, senior vice president and head of Digital & IT, IHCL, says, his team worked from mid-April to June to set up I-ZEST, a series of digital solutions to reduce contact, in over 20 hotels. It ranges from online check-ins/check-outs to digital menus for restaurants. A digital key, wherein guests can open and lock their rooms with their phones, is to be launched soon. Hilton Hotels and Resorts have already introduced digital keys in some of their properties. It has also partnered with Kipsu, a digital messaging app, to develop a chat service. “Some guests prefer texting over talking. So, with this, they can message their requests and orders,” says Ruban Das, general manager of Hilton Chennai. Est, the café in their property in Chennai, has tied up with a digital cataloguing company, DotPe. “Its QR-based catalogue and e-commerce platform reduces contact. And, our customers within the city can bypass third-party food delivery apps and order from our café directly,” adds Das. Breathe better Chennai’s ITC Grand Chola, meanwhile, has invested in MERV-13 filters (generally used in hospitals) and ultraviolet air purifiers for indoor ventilation. Zubin Songadwala, the hotel’s general manager, says the indoor air quality exceeds the standard set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). This apart, ITC Grand Chola also offers contactless check-ins and check-outs, QR Code-enabled menus and e-payment options. Contactless communication Rahul Salgia’s DigiValet, an iPad-based hospitality service provider, caters to over 30,000 luxury hotel rooms internationally. The company started its guest room services in 2008 with iPod touch. It is now used in hospitals, apartments and senior living communities. Salgia is hopeful that even smaller hotels will show more interest in adopting tech that will reduce contact. He plans to create a new division of DigiValet, which would cater to non-luxury hotels. In August, his company launched Thru, a cloud-based service that would allow guests to complete their check-in from their devices. “It can be implemented in any hotel in just one day using an online sign-up process. Hotels need not buy any additional hardware or software. Further, Thru comes with absolutely no adoption fee or any exorbitant capital layouts.” More product and service providers, who can help hotels minimise contact, are likely to sprout in the next few years. S Vaidhyaraman’s Chennai-based startup, Engauge, builds customised chatbots, which act as a virtual concierge. They aid guests in booking rooms, checking in/out, ordering food among other services. The chatbot’s built-in Google translate feature resolves language barriers too. Engauge initially targeted only luxury hotels. Before the pandemic, five such hotels in Chennai and Bengaluru were using their chatbots. “There wasn’t a burning requirement for contactless communication before the pandemic. But now, when it’s a question of safety, we expect more hotels to use our technology,” says Vaidhyaraman. He says the number of enquiries for Engauge surged after the pandemic. Hoteliers reckon it is tough to predict a return to pre-pandemic routines until the invention of the vaccine. But the question of going back to pre-COVID practices itself is perhaps redundant. Because the technologies many hotels have adopted are permanent. And they have most likely changed some aspects of hospitality forever.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/check-in-relax-but-touch-me-not/article32566296.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Cooked, sealed, delivered||Subashini Reddy was at her wits’ end when a call from her parents in Chennai confirmed her fears. They had tested positive for COVID-19 and were under home quarantine. Being in the UK, Subashini could do little to support them. Till she found the quarantine meal option from Chennai-based Roo’s Food Concepts. In minutes, she booked a week-long meal package for her parents, customised to their needs. Hotels and restaurants across the country are now delivering quarantine meals, much to the relief of those under home quarantine. In June, Gayathri Nandakumar and Rahul Ravi, who run the subscription-based food service Roo’s Food Concepts in Chennai, started receiving a flood of queries for quarantine meals, a majority of those were for 15-day meal packages. “We realised that there is a demand for home-cooked food. Good nutrition is crucial for health, particularly in times when the immune system needs to fight back. So we decided to start our quarantine meal packages,” says Gayathri. While they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, customers also have the option of subscribing to one meal per day for a 14-day period. Meals include Kerala rice, millets, quinoa, cauliflower rice, aviyal and zucchini roast. There are also non-vegetarian options with chicken, mutton and fish. According to Gayathri, their quarantine breakfast option is popular with children. “Kids are known to be fussy eaters especially when they are down with an illness. Keeping that in mind, we use natural colouring elements like pudina, beetroot and turmeric to make dishes like a simpleidlilook attractive,” says Gayathri. Roo’s Food Concepts now delivers an average of 50 quarantine lunch and 50 dinner orders at the doorsteps of customers every day. Keeping it simple In Bengaluru, Divya Prabhakar and Vishal Shetty of Oota Company are on their toes every morning catering to the 80-odd quarantine meal orders pouring in from across the city. They call it Lockdown Lunchbox. “I received a call in July from a friend, who along with her whole family tested positive and wanted to subscribe to meals for 10 days. That is when I started offering the quarantine meal options,” says Divya. Oota Company has two kinds of subscription options — five or 10 days. One can opt for lunch or dinner or both. The meal consists of a vegetarian menu with a curry, a dry dish, homemade curd,rasamand rice, chapati or ragi mudde . Packed and sealed in plastic boxes, the meal is home delivered through Dunzo. “We have received a lot of orders from NRI clients whose parents or relatives are in the city and under home quarantine. We also give an option to customise food according to the requirements,” says Divya. The kitchen at Visakhapatnam’s Hotel Rockdale has been working round the clock for the past three weeks, ever since it rolled out its quarantine meal services. “We are delivering nearly 150 meals per day,” says Satish Varanasi, the food and beverages manager of the hotel. Contact-less delivery and a nutritious menu are the highlights of these meals. The hotel provides a combination ofidli-vada, tomato rice, upma, ragi malt for breakfast, while its lunch and dinner menus consist of phulka , steamed rice, dal and curd rice along with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry depending on the package selected. “We have a team of four chefs who come up with a different menu daily and have a dedicated staff of four to package the food,” says Satish.  Active meals is what Hotel Minerva in Vijayawada likes to call their quarantine food package. General manager E Nagesh says, “Our food is high in protein. We have relied on native ingredients like different varieties of millets and seasonal vegetables. With each meal we providedrasamwith either garlic, munakkaya (drumstick) or pepper,” he says. Nagesh adds, “We have also tied up with hospitals for food delivery for patients and it has worked well for us.”  (With inputs fromPrabalika M Borah)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cooked-sealed-delivered/article32566308.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||A song in its last mile||Not many of us would have managed to tide through the lockdown without songs — and other forms of art — to give us solace, calm us down, and amp us up as and when we needed it. Making music that does all this requires not only talent but also a team, equipment, and technical know-how. As recording studios around Chennai gradually reopen, they have challenges to navigate. For instance, “You cannot wear a mask when recording vocals,” states Mervin Thomas categorically. It would distort or muffle the singer’s voice, and thus affect the song as a whole, says the founder of TASE Studio, explaining one of the many challenges that recording studios in Chennai — and elsewhere — have to circumnavigate during Unlock 4.0. Rethinking spaces As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, Chennai’s music producers are well aware that hygiene cannot be a secondary concern. But how does one keep confined spaces filled with temperature-sensitive equipment operational and safe? “For now, I’m only working with musicians I am familiar with,” says Mervin. This sentiment is echoed by Ashvin Vinayagamoorthy, who runs Shimmr Studios in Mogappair. “If I know that they can follow a certain work ethic in the studio, we call them in,” says Ashwin. Work ethic is key, because the rules, especially now, are many. Singer-composer Alvin Presley describes his first post-lockdown recording experience from last week. “I went to Voice and Vision Studios in Kodambakkam, run by Alaap Raju. The studio has rules: there should be a maximum of three people; everyone should wear a mask unless the person is singing. There is a recording booth and a studio room. Inside the recording booth they have a foot-operated hand sanitiser that we worked with a foot pedal, in addition to another hand sanitiser at the entrance of the booth,” he recalls. While the three-person cap makes sense, it has other implications. Goutham Healer, drummer of the band Big Sam, observes that while it worked fine for their recording session with a vocalist and bassist, it also means that some music arrangements still cannot be recorded in a studio, at least for now. The point, says Alvin, was keeping the artistes’ physical touch to the minimum. “We had brought some of our drum equipment along, that were needed particularly for this recording and was not available at the studio. Lijesh at the studio had set everything up beforehand, and we kept letting him know what equipment we wanted to handle. Mics were not to be touched.” Though studios take the lead in safety, musicians who step in are expected to pull their weight, too. Says Alvin, “I have a home studio setup, so I had done some groundwork — basic structure and placements — beforehand.” This new project comes a little over a month after the release of Alvin’s debut EP ‘Fall Today’, created entirely at home. So why go to a studio now? Simply put, while the quality of music depends on the talent, the quality of its sound depends on the right conditions and equipment. Explains Alvin, “While recording vocals at home, I had to find the right spot where the reverb wasn’t too much and at the same time not too dead. Studios have a vocal booth made just for that. The purpose of the place is recordings alone; our homes are designed for other things.” The biggest concern is the vocalist, who has to sing very close to the mic. “Even more important than sanitising the mic is sanitising the pop filter, that sits between the mic and the vocalist. We sanitise both of them, as well as all our headphones, with isopropyl alcohol-based sanitiser before every session,” says Mervin, who works with independent and gospel musicians. Ashwin adds that pacing out the clients is important. “If vocalists are involved, we try to keep a day and a half’s gap between clients — never two singing sessions in the same day. For everyone else, we swap out the mics for each session. Overdubs help for bands: we record two people at a time and replay that recording for the other band members to play along to.” Ashwin’s clientèle, he says, includes not only indie talent like Kevin Fernando and Shravan Sridhar, but also the likes of Sid Sriram, Chinmayee and Harini. “But the industry has taken a backseat during lockdown; it’s the indie musicians who have continued to create music throughout.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-song-in-its-last-mile/article32566280.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Zoom to salute||On the periphery of his lawn in his farmhouse on the outskirts of Jalandhar, Colonel NJS Pannu has planted two casuarina trees, in memory of his days at what used to be the Officers Training School (now the Officers Training Academy) in Chennai. “We used to be taken for mock battles amongst the casuarina groves. We don’t see them in North India,” says the colonel, whose second batch of 1970 celebrated its 50th year of passing out on September 6. The course, with their families, had planned to meet on September 12 and 13, with people flying in from across India and the world. They were to stay at the OTA and relive their days of the 49 weeks of military training that gentleman cadets (and lady cadets from 1992) are put through. Unfortunately, all they could manage was a Zoom call, so that 93 Naughty Niners, as they called themselves (they were the ninth batch of the OTA) could ‘meet’ — they were all 10 minutes early, naturally! While they had a great time reliving all the punishments they got because of anything from a missing button on a uniform to the grey beret that was askew, “It was heartbreaking for most of us, because this is the first time after we passed out that so many of us would have been together, and it’s unlikely that we’ll all meet again altogether,” says Col Pannu, who got the Sword of Honour at his alma mater, for best all-round performance during the course. The preparation for the 2020 meet began two-and-a-half years ago, says Colonel EJJ Isaacs, in Chennai, who in 2012 was appointed as the course coordinator by the OTA alumni association. Lieutenant Colonel KJ Singh in Mohali did a lot of the legwork of getting phone numbers and starting a WhatsApp group. For the first meeting held in September 2018, people came in to Chennai from across the country. They were to have released a souvenir, with articles from the retired officers recalling their times at the academy and a presentation of an ISO resin installation about 9.5 feetX35 feet, called The Making of an Officer, a series of 15 figures depicting the transformation of a greenhorn into an officer. There was to be a wreath laying ceremony at the Temple of Remembrance, a monument with an honour roll to those from OTA who have died in the service of the nation. The batch itself has had 23 gallantry awards. As part of the Zoom call on Sunday, Col Isaacs made a presentation of how the academy now looked. “No one could believe how much it has changed, and how green it is now. The cadets barracks and mess, and the library are far better than what we had. There’s even a road up P Hill (they joke it was short for Punishment Hill, though the hill is a spur off Parangi Malai — St Thomas Mount). We had to run up and roll down,” he says, laughing, adding that someone remembered how they were given cycles but joked about how they hardly ever rode them — they were mostly carried around over the head as a punishment. During the call, people remembered movies in the Safire multiplex with three cinema halls, lunches at Buhari’s and Swapna, the latter a draw for those from up North, who missed chhola-bhatura . While the then cadets grappled with the tough training that included tests of physical endurance and mental toughness, many struggled with summer-time temperatures and the humidity of Chennai, while those from here tackled Hindi, a language they were introduced to at the academy. What they missed experiencing was the view of the academy from the top of P Hill, the stay planned in the barracks for two nights reliving the days when discipline was drilled into them, lunches and dinners at the cadet’s mess, a walk around the parade ground that now has tarmac but which used to have only red soil. “Mostly we missed the camaraderie, an extended period of trying to recall the glorious days, not just in OTA, but also in the services,” says Major General Panicker, the senior-most in the course, who remembers picking up cycle polo at the academy and later starting it in places he was posted, wherever possible. The OTA trains about 200 gentlemen and 30 lady cadets in every course, to enter the Army for a period of 14 years (10 with an extension of 4). It is set on a campus of 650 acres, with 10 new buildings and 16 dating to pre-Independence days (some close to 100 years old). “The fighting arms (armoured corps, artillery, infantry) are still the most popular (among the gentleman cadets). What’s different about today’s cadets is that they often come with more exposure, some having worked in the corporate world,” says Brigadier K Sampath, secretary of the alumni association. What is not is the spirit they come with. He says the trend of organising silver and golden jubilee celebrations for batches is relatively new: “It started in 2013, when OTA itself celebrated 50 years.”  The tank in front of OTA was once a Centurion and is now a T55||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/zoom-to-salute/article32566301.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Glitch in the crowd?||‘And the crowd goes wild!’ Well, not really. Whether you were watching this year’s Coppa Italia or even Major League Baseball, you may have noticed the fans in the stands were unusually animated — pun intended. Yes, 2020 has been the year of CGI fans being the new ticket-holders for sport events you most definitely want to attend in that tight-locked bio-bubble. No more hilarious rival fan fights in the stadium for all the world to see; COVID-19 has cleared out festival venues, stadiums, theatres and more areas where hundreds would have communed to celebrate. CGI fans are digitally rendered people — yes, like Sims — which fill out a scale of space. Early forms of CGI crowd simulations have been used for crisis training and other crowd-oriented demos by scientific testing facilities with a flow-based approach where the crowd is treated as a whole entity rather than individual CGI characters. This concept of CGI crowds, though, dates back to the 1980s in the form of behavioural animation. The process sees animators rendering one anthro-figure, then duplicating them with custom-coded variables — hair colour, clothing, and body language being key ones — so that there is variety in a given space. And with the advent of Artificial Intelligence and the development of algorithmic power, technologists are able to separate crowds according to loyalty, letting them ‘cheer’ for their teams or ‘heckle’ for the opposing team, making for a more immersive viewing experience for the fans watching the event via a screen. While baseball is not exactly on India’s sports radar as much as another certain bat-and-ball sport, broadcaster Fox Sports was one of the first to scale out CGI fans at Major League Baseball in August; detailed avatars included families, couples, and college-goers with beers and/or snacks in hand. But the faces were not discernible. Close to the real thing Production houses and broadcasters are the gateway for making CGI fans a thing of ‘reality’ for the fans at home. Often enhancing sports experiences using Augmented Reality, London-based OZ Sports is one of the champions for tech-powered sports. “The idea is to protect the integrity and experience of the game, by turning the attention away from the empty stadium, and instead replacing it with appealing surroundings to make the game more interesting, and as close to reality as possible. These are times to explore and experiment, to make sports even more appealing and to bring it closer to the latest developments in e-sports,” says CEO Gudjon Gudjonsson over email. Creating virtual crowds requires specific rendering technology, of course. Norway-based Vizrt creates this very tech, making it possible for sports players to look a little less alone in a stadium. They have even held virtual interviews by merging independent streams of individuals located in separate countries to appear to be in the same room having a conversation in a live, one-on-one talk show. Year of adaptation Jonathan Roberts, senior vice president of Vizrt Global Sports and Virtual Advertising, says, “2020 for Vizrt’s Sports solutions has been the year of adaptation. When it became clear to us in February and March that there was a chance that crowds would not be allowed into stadiums in the foreseeable future, we had to see how this would affect our business and whether we could adapt any of our technology to help our customers during this time. When the Virtual Fan overlay solution was suggested and we realised that this would be a huge benefit to the sporting world, we diverted all our resources to making it successful. This crisis has helped us to innovate.” Two major sporting events are ahead for us in September: football championship Premier League and, of course, the Indian Premier League. Premier League and Sky Sports are reportedly exploring the potential for CGI fans while IPL is unlikely to take on this additional measure. But other technologies are touted to be a part of games. Recently in May, OZ Sports announced OZ Arena, a way for people at home to include themselves in a sports event, through AR. While not exactly CGI, it does leverage the same core technologies (AI, visual effects, sound immersion) to help bring the fans ‘closer’ to the fun.  Get down to business Virtual advertising boards are a thing of the future too, avers Jonathan Roberts of Vizrt Global Sports. After all, sports attracts a lot of business for sponsors of any scale. “These [virtual boards] replace the physical advertising around the perimeter of stadiums and sports fields, delivering far more flexibility and enlarging the sales window to attract more sponsors,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/glitch-in-the-crowd/article32566314.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Stand up and laugh||Rajmohan Arumugam has had a productive lockdown; he launched his own YouTube channel addressing socially-relevant issues in a simple, conversational style, in the hope to make them comprehensible for college students. He is one of the judges and mentors for the comedy hunt show, Comicstaan Semma Comedy Pa , a spin on Comicstaan (Hindi) which was launched in 2018 and produced by Amazon Prime Video. While the format of the show largely remains the same, the Tamil version, according to Rajmohan, is even more culturally-specific. He is unsure of the demography of audience consuming stand-up on OTT platforms, but is sure of the effect the pandemic has had on them. “I am in Karaikudi currently shooting for a web series and I met someone who was asking about Comicstaan Tamil . This means that digital penetration has already started,” says Rajmohan over a Zoom call. Excerpts from the conversation: How did this offer come about? Have you been following Comicstaan ? Yes, I have. In Tamil cinema, there have been a range of comedians playing to their strengths, starting from NS Krishnan to the very recent Santhanam. But that only resulted in a mix bag of genres over the years. I always felt that original comedy needed a kalam (platform). Comicstaan provided that. What has been your observation about comics, having interacted with them for the show?  That they are eager to learn and unlearn. For instance, we had some suggestions/comments for Abhishek (known for his Janaki teacher videos)... he immediately worked on those in his next act. There is a female comic who is bold, modern and touches upon subjects that are usually brushed aside. What specific genre did you train them in?  I have two acts on the show. Sketch comedy is one genre for which I mentored them; it is where they come together for a joint performance. We had several workshops, which were an ice-breaker for me and for them. What is your equation with fellow mentors, Karthik Kumar and Praveen Kumar?  KK is like our ancestor ( laughs ). At a time when there was little to no awareness about stand-up, he was performing to a packed audience in Narada Gana Sabha for an hour. He is still here and kicking. PK, on the other hand, is like biryani . Everyone likes him. You are in a part journalist, part activist zone with your socially-relevant videos. Is there a dearth of political satire?  Absolutely. In first world countries, you can invite the President and roast him. Here, you cannot even make a joke about a Municipal counsellor ( laughs ). When the families of politicians consume comedy and take them lightly, everything is bound to change. In today’s times, stand-up is mostly associated with a certain section of the audience, particularly the upper class... When we say Tamil Nadu, we invariably think only of Chennai. But that is not the case. There may be comics performing elsewhere. They might not know the aesthetics of a typical ‘stand-up’, but the fact that they exist is something we need to acknowledge. I’m confident that Comicstaan Tamil will open doors and encourage more comics. Comicstaan Semma Comedy Pa drops on Amazon Prime Video tomorrow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/stand-up-and-laugh/article32566272.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Don’t worry. Be crabby||How do you replace all the drama, anticipation and laughter of a dinner party with a plastic takeaway box? Is it possible to replicate and deliver the cheer of a kitchen filling with a tangle of scents as samosas are fried, dips are assembled and pudding chills in the fridge while friends troop in? Sharing food is a powerful, uplifting way to connect and in 2020, with COVID-19 and mandatory physical distancing, people are lonelier than ever before. Takeaway is often mundane and impersonal; so it is encouraging to find small start-ups motivated more by the joy of feeding people than making profits. With packaging that is as endearing as their contents.   Praveen Khanna turns up at my door at dinner time, balancing a heavy mud pot wrapped in the enticing scent of home made crab curry. He is in a rush, as he is dropping off another pot at a friend’s house, as an engagement gift. As with many of the weekend home kitchens — run by busy professionals who dabble in food for fun — I place my order and pay via Google Pay a few days ahead to enable Praveen and his mother M V Salomi to plan their Saturday cooking and delivery (Mud Pot Curries functions only on Saturdays). There is just one item on the menu now: crab in a rich, spicy, coconutty curry. “I keep asking my mom what to call it,” chuckles Praveen, adding that it is a family recipe, inspired by Sri Lankan cooking, with tamarind and chillies sourced from his mother’s home town Kavali, a two-and-a-half hour drive from Hyderabad. The gravy, dark with patiently caramelised onions, highlights the best qualities of the crabs, which are sweet, fresh and flaky. Praveen says he scoured Chintadripet till he found a supplier who was willing to sell him the same quality that is being exported to Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Priced at Rs. 1,499 for a pot of the half kilo crab, Rs. 1,999 for jumbo crabs and Rs. 2,900 for the ‘monster’ (two crabs per pot), it is an indulgent dinner. The jumbo is a satisfying balance of meat, flavour and economics: though admittedly a splurge, it is a satisfying one. “We encourage people to order it for celebrations. Customers are now gifting it to each other,” says Praveen, adding that he deliberately chose to pack the curry in clay pots, “because it is all about the experience. And I want to give people a memorable meal”. Servings are fairly generous for a reason. “It is even better the next day, so I always tell customers to keep it in the fridge for Sunday breakfast,” he says. “With dosas and idlis, it is absolutely perfect.”  Order between Monday and Thursday. Call 9884523464    There is something joyful about plump kozhukattais , reminiscent of festivals and family get-togethers. Recently launched Pidi, celebrates this joy with a fiesta of dumplings, all packed in cute palm leaf boxes. “It is a boxful of nostalgia,” says Rennee Saradha, discussing the brand, which launched — appropriately enough — on Vinayaka Chaturthi. Operating out of the same kitchen as The Bagel Pot (also run by Renee) Pidi collaborates with Better Chances, an organisation supporting people with mental health challenges. After graduating from the Madras School of Social Work, Renee worked in Auroville, then moved to Chennai to start The Bagel Pot. Discussing how she spent lockdown learning about indigenous rice, Renee says it inspired her to launch Pidi, which celebrates heritage rice from around the country. “We have more than two lakh variants of rice in the country. Many of them are highly nutritious and medicinal,” she says, adding that they use about 12 varieties now. The Onam-inspired box (Rs. 450) features more than a dozen pidis , including spongy unniyappams made with karuppu kavuni . There is ada , wrapped in banana leaves, its dough tinted golden by nendran bananas. Coconut palm leaves hug wands of navara rice, laced with jaggery and hill bananas. And, to balance the sweet, shredded coconut fillings, a handful of fluffy ammini kozhukattais , dusted with Kerala chammanthi powder. “It is a very heart-warming process, making kozhukattais ,” says Renee, explaining how workers from Better Chances shape the dough along with her team everyday. “The dough is soft and pliable, it helps you focus.” The boxes, like the product, have been inspired by Renee’s home in Karaikudi. “The pidi is close to my heart,” she says. “My grandmother taught me how to make it, and our recipes are based on hers.”  Order one day in advance.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Mental health, in all its colours||A hand reaching out for help. A visibly sad woman hugging her knees close. A man with his face buried in his hands. Stock pictures of depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions are becoming increasingly predictable. In the past 10 years, our understanding and awareness of mental health has grown by leaps. Why then, must we use the same static images while talking about it? As we mark World Suicide Prevention Day today, Suicide Prevention India Foundation (SPIF) is drawing its Paint Your Blues Campaign to a close. The graphic poster campaign invited artists and designers around the globe to send in their visual representation of key aspects of mental health: from introspection and self care to peer support and therapy. Kerala-based Marva Ramla Kader visualises going to the therapist as crossing a maze, with bizarre social barriers blocking the route. Art by Sanjana Akat and Manan Oberoi focus only on imagery, hoping to convey the confusion and growth in the journey of mental health recovery without any words. Each artwork is posted on the Instagram page @pybs01, where, until August 25, people could vote for (or ‘like’) their favourite posters. The winners, three selected by a curation panel and three selected through community voting, will receive Rs. 10,000 each. Their artwork will be made available for non-commercial use as an open source repository under Creative Commons. “During March, when the lockdown had just begun, we were discussing how it would affect the mental well-being of the society in the long term,” says Anand Nair, Paint Your Blues project lead. “Around this time, we felt the resources available to create good awareness material lacked a certain human touch, visually, and felt we could reach out to the creative community for help,” says Anand. The campaign began in May to coincide with the International Month for Mental Health, and by August, they had received over 400 entries, of which 317 were shortlisted. “The theme of self-care and peer support seemed to resonate the most with the artists,” says Yasmin Paul, lead-outreach, SPIF. While a lot of the art on the theme of self-care is poetic, some like Radhey Kaushik have gone the more literal — and humourous — route. Her take features Dwight Schrute from TV show The Office and a modified rendition of his iconic line: “Mental health is not a joke, Jim. Millions of families are affected every year.” One of the conditions of the campaign was that any text had to be in English. “The primary objective has been to create a repository for universally reusable visual assets,” says Anand, explaining why native languages were not allowed. “The fact that all creatives are attributed to the Creative Common license allows for adaptations and remixes anyway,” he adds.  The winners will be announced on   September 13, visit @pybs01 on Instagram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/mental-health-in-all-its-colours/article32566283.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Doll of hope||Say ‘hi’ to Covida. This plump little doll with a string of beads around her neck and a smiling face brings some cheer amid the pandemic gloom. And that is what its makers intend to. Made by Lambadi tribal women artisans, this scrap doll is a symbol of hope and healing. The Porgai Artisans Association in the Sittilingi valley in Dharmapuri district in Tamil Nadu, gave life to Covida to inspire a sense of positivity in these troubled times. A nomadic tribe, which is believed to have its origins in north-western India, travelled to the southern peninsula, settling down in parts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The women of the tribe have a unique tradition of embroidery, which is thriving in Sittilingi today, thanks to the formation of the Porgai Artisans Association, a collective that empowers the women to earn through their craft. The artisans association was formed in 2006 under the leadership of Dr Lalitha Regi, who along with husband Dr Regi George, set up a Tribal Health Initiative in the valley in 1992, offering basic health facilities in the remote area, where access to health care was a challenge. A registered society, Porgai (which means pride in the Lambadi language), today has over 60 women, in different age groups, the oldest being 75-year-old Jumma. “She still embroiders, I wonder how,” says Dr Lalitha, with a laugh. The women make garments, home décor, hand bags, jewellery and more, which are sold directly through its website. “Though they don’t make fat profits, they make enough to get by,” says Dr Lalitha. “We had fairly good sales until last year,” she adds. However, since the lockdown, the artisans have had no work or income. They could not source fabric even from their usual suppliers. “We had to keep giving these women some work, we had to generate income,” says Dr Lalitha. “All we had left were cloth scraps, which we had saved for upcycling. We decided to sort them out and do something with them,” she says. The bits and pieces of cloth were stitched together to make larger patches, which could have been converted to garments. “But we wanted to respond to the pandemic. We wanted to bring something positive out of this depressing situation. The doll, we thought, could be a link connecting all of us in these extraordinary times,” says Dr Lalitha. Thus, Covida was born. These dolls are affordable and come in pouches of 10, 25, 50 and 100. Each Covida has been priced at Rs. 20. Each weighs about 50 grams and takes about half an hour to make. She comes with a safety pin attached to her, which makes it easy to pin her up to a card or fabric.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Get a front row view||At 8 pm, tonight, designer Tarun Tahiliani will present ‘Infinite’, a collection that embodies his 25-year journey in the world of fashion and touches upon the theme ‘My Identity, My Pride’. The event will stream live on Instagram (@taruntahiliani; @blenderspridefashiontour) and mark the 15th year of Blenders Pride Fashion Tour (BPFT). In July, the designer unveiled the bridal collection ‘Pieces of You’ through an Insta live event. This will be his second digital showcase. “This is the only way to present during the pandemic,” says Tahiliani, who is glad that everyone tuning into the show will get a front seat view without clamouring for invites. The digital streaming of a fashion showcase, Tahiliani explains, makes it possible to engage viewers with better focus on minute detailing on the garments. The show will also explore the idea of ‘India modern’, reflecting on where we stand between embracing a mix of old and new. As the video plays in the background, models will walk the ramp presenting 25 ensembles. To emphasise that the clothes are made to flatter real women, there will be a few women in their 40s and a lady in her 70s on the ramp. Expect to see lightweight sari gowns,chikankarion pant suits, jewelled tights, tulle skirts and more. It will be a non-bridal, women-centric collection. Celebrating India Elaborating on the theme ‘My Identity, My Pride’, Tahiliani recalled growing up in South Bombay, studying in an anglicised environment and being drawn to all things ‘foreign’. After he became a designer, a friend gifted him a book on Indian weaves and crafts. He was fascinated and travelled to weaver clusters, from Lucknow to Kutch and beyond, looking at an India that he never knew existed. He has continued to employ craftspeople from different parts of the country and uses the craft techniques for clothing that befits contemporary Indian women. Moving on to discuss the state of flux in the fashion and textiles sector during the pandemic, Tahiliani admits that it is mostly the brides and their immediate family that come to shop: “Fashion is not a priority at a time when 90,000 new COVID-19 cases are being reported in a day. But, with all the time for reflection, I hope people make sustainable choices and buy clothes that last.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/get-a-front-row-view/article32566316.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Cooked, sealed, delivered||Subashini Reddy was at her wits’ end when a call from her parents in Chennai confirmed her fears. They had tested positive for COVID-19 and were under home quarantine. Being in the UK, Subashini could do little to support them. Till she found the quarantine meal option from Chennai-based Roo’s Food Concepts. In minutes, she booked a week-long meal package for her parents, customised to their needs. Hotels and restaurants across the country are now delivering quarantine meals, much to the relief of those under home quarantine.  What’s cooking?  In June, Gayathri Nandakumar and Rahul Ravi, who run the subscription-based food service Roo’s Food Concepts in Chennai, started receiving a flood of queries for quarantine meals, a majority of those were for 15-day meal packages. “We realised that there is a demand for home-cooked food. Good nutrition is crucial for health, particularly in times when the immune system needs to fight back. So we decided to start our quarantine meal packages,” says Gayathri. While they offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, customers also have the option of subscribing to one meal per day for a 14-day period. Meals include Kerala rice, millets, quinoa, cauliflower rice, aviyal and zucchini roast. There are also non-vegetarian options with chicken, mutton and fish. According to Gayathri, their quarantine breakfast option is popular with children. “Kids are known to be fussy eaters especially when they are down with an illness. Keeping that in mind, we use natural colouring elements like pudina, beetroot and turmeric to make dishes like a simpleidlilook attractive,” says Gayathri. Roo’s Food Concepts now delivers an average of 50 quarantine lunch and 50 dinner orders at the doorsteps of customers every day. “We customise these quarantine meals as well,” she adds. Keeping it simple In Bengaluru, Divya Prabhakar and Vishal Shetty of Oota Company are on their toes every morning catering to the 80-odd quarantine meal orders pouring in from across the city. They call it Lockdown Lunchbox. “I received a call in July from a friend, who along with her whole family tested positive and wanted to subscribe to meals for 10 days. That is when I started offering the quarantine meal options,” says Divya. Oota Company has two kinds of subscription options — five or 10 days. One can opt for lunch or dinner or both. The meal consists of a vegetarian menu with a curry, a dry dish, homemade curd,rasamand rice, chapati or ragi mudde . Packed and sealed in plastic boxes, the meal is home delivered through Dunzo. “We have received a lot of orders from NRI clients whose parents or relatives are in the city and under home quarantine. We also give an option to customise food according to the requirements,” says Divya. The kitchen at Visakhapatnam’s Hotel Rockdale has been working round the clock for the past three weeks, ever since it rolled out its quarantine meal services. “We are delivering nearly 150 meals per day,” says Satish Varanasi, the food and beverages manager of the hotel. Contact-less delivery and a nutritious menu are the highlights of these meals. The restaurant provides a combination ofidli-vada, tomato rice, upma, ragi malt for breakfast, while its lunch and dinner menus consist of phulka , steamed rice, dal and curd rice along with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry depending on the package. “We have a team of four chefs who come up with a different menu daily and have a dedicated staff to package the food,” says Satish. Active meals is what Hotel Minerva in Vijayawada likes to call their quarantine food package. General manager E Nagesh says, “Our food is low in carbohydrates and high in protein. We have relied on native ingredients like different varieties of millets and seasonal vegetables. With each meal we providedrasamwith either garlic, munakkaya (drumstick) or pepper,” he says. Nagesh adds, “We have also tied up with hospitals for food delivery for patients and it has worked well for us.”  (With inputs fromPrabalika M Borah)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cooked-sealed-delivered/article32566612.ece

While baseball is not exactly on India’s sports radar as much as another certain bat-and-ball sport, broadcaster Fox Sports was one of the first to scale out CGI fans at Major League Baseball in August; detailed avatars included families, couples, and college-goers with beers and/or snacks in hand. But the faces were not discernible. Close to the real thing Production houses and broadcasters are the gateway for making CGI fans a thing of ‘reality’ for the fans at home. Often enhancing sports experiences using Augmented Reality, London-based OZ Sports is one of the champions for tech-powered sports. “The idea is to protect the integrity and experience of the game, by turning the attention away from the empty stadium, and instead replacing it with appealing surroundings to make the game more interesting, and as close to reality as possible. These are times to explore and experiment, to make sports even more appealing and to bring it closer to the latest developments in e-sports,” says CEO Gudjon Gudjonsson over email. Creating virtual crowds requires specific rendering technology, of course. Norway-based Vizrt creates this very tech, making it possible for sports players to look a little less alone in a stadium. They have even held virtual interviews by merging independent streams of individuals located in separate countries to appear to be in the same room having a conversation in a live, one-on-one talk show. Year of adaptation Jonathan Roberts, senior vice president of Vizrt Global Sports and Virtual Advertising, says, “2020 for Vizrt’s Sports solutions has been the year of adaptation. When it became clear to us in February and March that there was a chance that crowds would not be allowed into stadiums in the foreseeable future, we had to see how this would affect our business and whether we could adapt any of our technology to help our customers during this time. When the Virtual Fan overlay solution was suggested and we realised that this would be a huge benefit to the sporting world, we diverted all our resources to making it successful. This crisis has helped us to innovate.” Two major sporting events are ahead for us in September: football championship Premier League and, of course, the Indian Premier League. Premier League and Sky Sports are reportedly exploring the potential for CGI fans while IPL is unlikely to take on this additional measure. But other technologies are touted to be a part of games. Recently in May, OZ Sports announced OZ Arena, a way for people at home to include themselves in a sports event, through AR. While not exactly CGI, it does leverage the same core technologies (AI, visual effects, sound immersion) to help bring the fans ‘closer’ to the fun.  Get down to business Virtual advertising boards are a thing of the future too, avers Jonathan Roberts of Vizrt Global Sports. After all, sports attracts a lot of business for sponsors of any scale. “These [virtual boards] replace the physical advertising around the perimeter of stadiums and sports fields, delivering far more flexibility and enlarging the sales window to attract more sponsors,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/glitch-in-the-crowd/article32566614.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||The six-legged globetrotter||We all know of birds migrating over thousands of kilometres, crossing oceans and mountains. The Wandering Glider is a dragonfly known as the world’s longest distance insect traveller. The Wandering Glider ( Pantala flavescens ) is also called the Globe Skimmer or the Globe Wanderer named for its migrating behaviour. It belongs to the order Odonata literally meaning ‘the toothed one’, due to its serrated mandibles, which explains its predatory habits. Libellulidae, the family to which this dragonfly belongs, is the largest dragonfly family in the world, represented by over 1,000 species spread right across the world. The Wandering Glider was first described in 1798 by Johan Christian Fabricius, a Danish zoologist specialising in insects and one of the most important entomologists of the 18th century. This insect-helicoper looks delicate but is one of the most skilled aerial ambush predators of the insect kingdom, intercepting its prey mostly in mid-air using its feet. To avoid the prey escaping, it’ll rip the wings off mosquitoes, termites, beetles, even butterflies and sometimes off other dragonflies, suggesting borderline cannibalism. A large adult dragonfly is capable of feeding on over 1,000 mosquitoes a day, making it a natural pest controller, giving commercial mosquito repellents a run for their money. With an increase in the use of insecticides and pesticides, the population of dragonflies has taken a hit, thereby making mosquito-infestation a problem. Wandering Gliders grow up to 4.5-5 cm in length and have a three-segmented body: head, thorax and abdomen, with their wingspan ranging between 7 cm and 8.5 cm. Their wings are clear, almost transparent, and very broad at the base. The front of the head varies between yellow to red, with the thorax being yellow or golden with a dark line running through it. With a nearly 360-degree vision, the head is all-eyes with two massive globular compound eyes, giving it extraordinary vision. Human eyes exhibit tri-chromatic vision where they see colours as a combination of red, blue and green, but dragonflies far surpass that colour spectrum of vision, studies across the world reveal. Being the most widespread of all dragonflies in the world, the Wandering Glider is omnipresent in all continents except for Antarctica and is sparse in Europe. Considering its long-migrating behaviour, monitoring is difficult and thus their lifespan remains uncertain. In addition to being the insect that travels the longest distance, it is also the highest flying dragonfly, recorded at over 6,000 metres in the Himalayas. After mating, the male and the female remain connected for a while, even while the females are ovipositing (laying eggs) a clutch of about 500-2,000 eggs in a variety of aquatic habitats like puddles, ponds, marshes, rivers, and swimming pools. Like adults, their larvae are voracious predators too, feeding actively on aquatic invertebrates like mosquito larvae, other aquatic insect larvae, tadpoles of frogs, and even on small fish in water. Mostly seen before and after the monsoon season, the Wandering Glider is everywhere these days, in the morning and evening. Certain insectivorous (insect-eating) birds like Bee-eaters and Jacobin Cuckoos tend to follow these swarms for a feast, especially over fields, where they swarm. They also are a delicate part of the food web, where they feed on smaller insects but are eaten by birds, lizards, and frogs. Considering their incredible vision and aerial prowess, they are an inspiration to several new technologies like visual systems and drones.

10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Get a front row view||At 8 p.m. on Thursday, designer Tarun Tahiliani will present ‘Infinite’, a collection that embodies his 25-year journey in the world of fashion and touches upon the theme ‘My Identity, My Pride’. The event will stream live on Instagram (@taruntahiliani; @blenderspridefashiontour) and mark the 15th year of Blenders Pride Fashion Tour (BPFT). In July, the designer unveiled the bridal collection, ‘Pieces of You’, through an Instagram live event. This will be his second digital showcase. “This is the only way to present during the pandemic,” says Tahiliani, who is glad that everyone tuning into the show will get a front seat view without clamouring for invites. The digital streaming of a fashion showcase, Tahiliani explains, makes it possible to engage viewers with better focus on minute detailing on the garments. The show will also explore the idea of ‘India modern’, reflecting on where we stand between embracing a mix of old and new. As the video plays in the background, models will walk the ramp presenting 25 ensembles. To emphasise that the clothes are made to flatter real women, there will be a few women in their 40s and a lady in her 70s on the ramp. Expect to see lightweight sari gowns,chikankarion pant suits, jewelled tights, tulle skirts and more. It will be a non-bridal, women-centric collection. Celebrating India Elaborating on the theme ‘My Identity, My Pride’, Tahiliani recalled growing up in south Bombay, studying in an anglicised environment and being drawn to all things ‘foreign’. After he became a designer, a friend gifted him a book on Indian weaves and crafts. Tahiliani was fascinated and travelled to weaver clusters, from Lucknow to Kutch and beyond, looking at an India that he never knew existed. He has continued to employ craftspeople from different parts of the country and use craft techniques for clothing that befits contemporary Indian women. Moving on to discuss the state of flux in the fashion and textiles sector during the pandemic, Tahiliani admits that it is mostly the brides and their immediate family that come to shop. “Fashion is not a priority at a time when 90,000 new COVID-19 cases are being reported in a day. But, with all the time for reflection, I hope people make sustainable choices and buy clothes that last,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/get-a-front-row-view/article32566615.ece
10 September 2020||September 10 2020 00:00 IST,||Mental health, in all its colours||Stock pictures of mental health conditions are becoming predictable. In the past 10 years, our understanding and awareness of mental health has grown by leaps. Why then, must we use the same static images while talking about it? As we mark World Suicide Prevention Day today, Suicide Prevention India Foundation (SPIF) is drawing its Paint Your Blues Campaign to a close. The graphic poster campaign invited artists to send in their visual representation of key aspects of mental health: from introspection and self care to peer support and therapy. Kerala-based Marva Ramla Kader visualises going to the therapist as crossing a maze, with bizarre social barriers blocking the route. Art by Sanjana Akat and Manan Oberoi focus only on imagery, hoping to convey the confusion and growth in the journey of mental health recovery without any words. Each artwork is posted on the Instagram page @pybs01, where, until August 25, people could vote for (or ‘like’) their favourite posters. The winners, three selected by a panel and three through community voting, will receive Rs. 10,000 each. Their artwork will be made available for non-commercial use as an open source repository under Creative Commons. “During March, when the lockdown had just begun, we were discussing how it would affect the mental well-being of the society in the long term,” says Anand Nair, Paint Your Blues project lead. “Around this time, we felt the resources available to create good awareness material lacked a certain human touch, visually, and felt we could reach out to the creative community for help,” says Anand. The campaign began in May to coincide with the International Month for Mental Health, and by August, they had received over 400 entries. One of the conditions of the campaign was that any text had to be in English. “The primary objective has been to create a repository for universally reusable visual assets,” says Anand.  The winners will be announced on September 13, visit @pybs01     on Instagram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/mental-health-in-all-its-colours/article32566617.ece
