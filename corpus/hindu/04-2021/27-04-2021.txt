27 April 2021||New Delhi,||MHA advises States to impose localised 14-day lockdowns||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked the States to impose localised restrictions and implement strict containment measures for at least 14-days to flatten the COVID-19 curve. In a letter to the States on Monday, Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said that considering the “unprecedented surge,” there is an urgent need for the States and the Union Territories to consider strict COVID-19 management and control measures to bring the situation under control. “States and U.T.s, based on their assessment of the situation, may impose local restrictions at district/sub-district and city/ward level, with a view to contain the spread of COVID 19,” the letter stated. Over the past seven days, new COVID-19 cases averaged around 3.2 lakh daily. The letter said that the Union Health Ministry on April 25 had advised all the States to implement an intensive, local and focused containment framework and the criteria was shared. “In the recent past, a sharp increase in COVID 19 cases has been observed along with high positivity rate. Considering this unprecedented surge, there is an urgent need for States/UTs to consider strict COVID management and control measures, in the surge areas to bring the situation under control,” the letter stated. The Health Ministry had suggested night curfew, closure of malls, shopping complexes and restricting office strength to 50% as some of the measures to contain the spread in areas that required intensive action. “The spread of the infection has to be controlled through restricting the intermingling amongst people, the only known host for the COVID-19 virus,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mha-advises-states-to-impose-localised-14-day-lockdowns/article34419000.ece

27 April 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,||3 COVID patients die as oxygen supply ‘disrupted’ in Vizianagaram hospital||Three COVID-19 patients at the Maharaja Government Hospital in Vizianagaram died on Monday due to disruption in oxygen supply. While two persons died in the hospital, another died after being shifted to a private hospital. Opposition parties alleged that the toll was over 10, but officials said there were only three deaths. Fifteen patients who were in a critical condition among the 290 admitted to the hospital, were shifted to various private hospitals between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. MR Hospital Superintendent Gowri Sankar said the administration acted to shift the patients to nearby private hospitals after observing the sudden drop in oxygen levels at around 3.30 a.m. Vizianagaram Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal told the media that oxygen was brought from industries in Pydibhimavaram of Srikakulam district and Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Karnataka on Monday announced free COVID-19 vaccination for all those aged 18 to 44 years in government hospitals and centres from May 1. Health Minister K. Sudhakar said Rs. 400 crore had been allocated for this. The government had been providing free vaccination to all aged above 45 in government facilities, but there were complaints of vaccine shortage. Asked about vaccine availability, the Minister said stocks based on orders were yet to come. The Karnataka Cabinet on Monday announced a partial lockdown for 14 days starting 9 p.m. on Tuesday. Only shops providing essential services would be open from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. There would be no public transport and no metro trains in Bengaluru. All industries, except manufacturing, would remain closed. The garment industries would also be shut. The Chief Minister said all agriculture activities would be allowed in rural areas, but agricultural markets in cities would be closed. Mr. Yediyurappa said the Centre was supplying 800 tonnes of oxygen and shortage would not occur. Karnataka recorded over 34,000 cases on Sunday, 20,000 of them from Bengaluru urban. Kerala stopped short of imposing a total Statewide lockdown, but clamped down to rein in COVID-19 cases. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said exotic and virulent virus variants had spurred the second wave. “Kerala’s current epidemic situation is similar to that of New Delhi in early April. The government is constrained to impose tough containment measures. It could not allow the outbreak to intensify, and overrun the State’s healthcare resources,” he said. The government ordered shut bars, liquor shops, cinema halls, malls, gymnasiums, clubs, sports complexes, swimming pools, and entertainment parks, and prohibited social, political, cultural, and religious functions and gatherings. The police would allow only election officials, candidates, political agents, and mediapersons into counting centres on May 2.

27 April 2021||MANGALURU,||Knives, other sharp objects found in District Prison||The police recovered knives, clothes stuffed with glass pieces and a few sharp wooden objects in a search at the District Prison here after a group of 21 prison inmates assaulted two inmates and some prison and police personnel in the prison here on Sunday. Talking to reporters on Monday, Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that Sameer, an accused in a robbery case, and 20 others attacked Ansar, an accused arrested last month by the Moodbidri Police and Jainuddin, an accused involved in dacoities. The attack came soon after the barracks were opened at 8 a.m. The group assaulted a couple of the prison personnel who intervened. However, the later sent the the group members to their barracks. Sameer threw rice, kitchen utensils and a few other objects when a team of prison and police personnel went to questioning him about the incident. Mr. Kumar said that two cases were registered against 21 inmates for the assault on Ansar and Jainuddin. Two more cases were registered for the assault on prison and police personnel and also for obstructing them from discharging their duty. During the search, the police recovered few button knives and a set of clothes filled with broken tubelight pieces. They also found a few wooden articles that have been modified into sharp objects. The police also recovered a few mobile phones and some chits containing mobile numbers. The 21 persons involved in the attack, Mr. Kumar said, are accused of bullying inmates and forcing them obey their orders. Sameer was involved in 10 cases of burglary and other criminal cases, including an attack on an Assistant Sub-Inspector. “As it was risky to continue to hold this group in the prison, the members were shifted to Belagavi, Shivamogga and Dharwad prisons on Sunday,” he said. The police will shortly take into custody those involved in the attack. The reason behind the attack is still not known, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/knives-other-sharp-objects-found-in-district-prison/article34419648.ece
27 April 2021||New Delhi,||Daily cases may hit 4.4 lakh by May 8, predicts IIT model||Active cases in the ongoing second COVID-19 wave in India may peak at 38-48 lakh between May 14-18, and daily new infections could hit a high of 4.4 lakh from May 4-8, according to a mathematical model by IIT scientists, who have revised their projections upwards. The scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and Hyderabad applied the Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed Approach (SUTRA) model to predict that active cases would go up further by over 10 lakh by mid-May. Revised upward The latest projection tweaks the time frame as well as the numbers. Last week, the researchers predicted the pandemic may peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total active cases and decline steeply by the end of May. Earlier this month, their modelling approach projected that active infections in the country would peak by April 15, which didn’t come true. “This time, I have also computed minimum and maximum for predicted values and posted it. I am reasonably confident that the actual values will be within the min and max values mentioned,” Maninder Agrawal, professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Kanpur, told PTI . On Sunday, Prof. Agrawal shared the new peak values for active and new COVID cases in a Twitter thread. “Peak timing: May 14-18 for active infections and May 4-8 for new infections. Peak value: 38-48 lakhs for active infections and 3.4 to 4.4 lakhs for new infections,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/daily-cases-may-reach-44-lakh-by-may-8-new-iit-projection/article34418997.ece
27 April 2021||Hollywood,||Nomadland wins big at pandemic Oscars||U.S. road movie Nomadland emerged as the big winner at the Oscars on Sunday with three major prizes, including a history-making award for director Chloe Zhao, as Hollywood celebrated its most glamorous night with a unique pandemic-era gala. Ms. Zhao’s drama about marginalised Americans roaming the West in vans was honoured for best picture, director and actress for Frances McDormand, who now is in elite company with her third Academy Award. No-show Anthony Hopkins pulled an upset to win best actor in the final award of the night, besting sentimental favourite Chadwick Boseman, who died of cancer last year. The unorthodox Oscars ceremony was moved from a Hollywood theatre to a glammed-up downtown train station to abide by COVID-19 protocols, and reunited Tinseltown A-listers for the first time in over a year. Ms. Zhao, who is the first woman of colour ever honoured as best director, thanked “all the people we met on the road... for teaching us the power of resilience and hope, and for reminding us what true kindness looks like”. She is also only the second woman to win best director after Kathryn Bigelow, who broke the glass ceiling in 2010 when she won the prize forThe Hurt Locker. “It’s pretty fabulous to be a woman in 2021,” Ms. Zhao told journalists at a virtual backstage Q&A, adding, “If this win means more people get to live their dreams, I’m extremely grateful.” With movie theatres closed all year and blockbuster content delayed, Beijing-born Zhao’s film captured the pandemic zeitgeist with its stunning portrait of the isolated margins of society. Mr. Hopkins’ win at 83 for his shattering portrayal of a dementia sufferer inThe Fathermakes him the oldest actor to win a competitive Oscar in history. Best supporting actress went to Youn Yuh-jung for the Korean immigrant drama Minari .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nomadland-wins-big-at-pandemic-oscars/article34418998.ece
27 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. clamps down hard on daily life||The State government on Monday stopped short of imposing a total Statewide lockdown. Nevertheless, it has clamped down hard on civic life to rein in the upward spiral of COVID-19 cases. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said exotic and virulent variants of the virus had spurred the aggressive second wave. “Kerala’s current epidemic situation is similar to that of New Delhi in early April. The government is constrained to impose tough containment measures to stem the rising tide of infections. In some aspects, the restrictions are not dissimilar to those imposed during the lockdown. The government had no choice. It could not allow the outbreak to intensify, surpass the surge threshold, and finally overrun the State’s finite healthcare resources,” he said. The government has shut down bars, liquor shops, cinema halls, malls, gymnasiums, clubs, sports complexes, swimming pools, and entertainment parks. It has prohibited social, political, cultural and religious functions, and gatherings. No counting day revelry Mr. Vijayan said political parties had agreed to forego counting day revelry. The police would allow only election officials, candidates, political agents, and mediapersons into counting centres on May 2. However, they should have received two doses of vaccine and tested RT-PCR negative in the past 72 hours. Religious places of worship should not allow more than 50 persons. Worshippers should maintain a physical distance of two metre. Those visiting mosques should carry prayer mats and use piped water for rinsing. Temples should not give edibles or liquid as a sacrament. The government would allow only essential services on the weekend. It has declared Saturday a holiday for government offices. On weekdays, shops and restaurants should down shutters at 7.30 p.m. Home delivery and takeaways are allowed till 9 p.m. The government has opened a control room for migrant labourers. It has exempted agriculture, plantation, animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, forestry, construction sectors, and MSMEs and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme works from the restrictions. However, workers should observe the pandemic protocol. Mr. Vijayan said institutions should shift to online meetings mandatorily. Emphasis was on work from home. Special task forces headed by police officers would enforce the pandemic code. LSGIs would spearhead the containment campaign. COVID-19 patients should mandatorily download the COVID-19 mobile application so the authorities could track their movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-clamps-down-hard-on-daily-life/article34419161.ece
27 April 2021||New Delhi,||Court pulls up police for ‘lack of supervision’ in Delhi riots cases||A Delhi court on Monday pulled up the police over investigations into the north-east Delhi riots last year, saying there was complete lack of supervision of probes by senior officers of the district. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav made the observation while dismissing a revision petition filed by Delhi Police against an order by a magisterial court to lodge separate FIRs on the complaint of a person named Nishar Ahmed. The sessions court noted that instead of filing two FIRs, the police had clubbed Mr. Ahmed’s complaint with another plea, which was related to only a single incident that took place on February 25, 2020, without realising that his complaint disclosed the acts of two dates: February 24 and 25. “I do not find any substance in the present petition filed by the State. The investigating agency has evidently been found to be on the wrong side of law. This court has found in several riot cases... complete lack of supervision of the investigation(s) by the senior police officers of the district,” the court said, adding: “All is not over yet. Senior officers should look into the matter(s) and take remedial measures so that justice can be given to the victims.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/court-pulls-up-police-for-lack-of-supervision-in-delhi-riots-cases/article34419545.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,||ECI failed in making political parties adhere to COVID-19 protocol during campaign: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday expressed its displeasure with the Election Commission of India (ECI) for having failed to ensure that political parties adhered to the COVID-19 protocol during the recent Assembly election campaign in Tamil Nadu. It warned the Commission that the counting of votes, scheduled for May 2, would be postponed if appropriate safety measures are not put in place and the court informed of the same by April 30. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that though polling was, by and large, peaceful in Tamil Nadu, the ECI couldn’t ensure that political parties adhered to the COVID-19 protocol during the campaign, despite repeated observations made by the court, “like a broken record”, in almost every order passed on an election-related case, stressing the need to follow the norms. “The significance of adhering to such protocol may have been lost on the Election Commission, going by its silence as campaigning and rallies were conducted without distancing norms being maintained, and in wanton disregard for other requirements of the protocol,” the judges observed. They said the ECI ought to have come up with strict safety measures at least for the counting of the votes. “At no cost should the counting result in a catalyst for a further surge, politics or no politics, and [irrespective of] whether the counting takes place in a staggered manner or is deferred. Public health is of paramount importance, and it is distressing that constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard. The situation is now one of survival and protection, and everything else comes thereafter,” the Bench said. The observations were made during the hearing of a petition by Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar for following certain regulations while counting the votes in Karur constituency, from where he contested. However, the judges expanded the scope of the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/eci-failed-in-making-political-parties-adhere-to-covid-19-protocol-during-campaign-hc/article34419051.ece

Under any circumstances, any unit other than those producing oxygen would not be allowed [to function].” The meeting also resolved to constitute a monitoring committee, headed by the District Collector to supervise the plant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sterlite-gets-nod-to-run-plant-for-four-months/article34418994.ece

27 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Poll panel draws flak from Madras High Court||The Madras High Court on Monday expressed its displeasure with the Election Commission of India (ECI) for having failed to ensure that political parties adhered to the COVID-19 protocol during the recent Assembly election campaign in Tamil Nadu. It warned the Commission that the counting of votes, scheduled for May 2, would be postponed if appropriate safety measures were not put in place, and the court informed of the same by April 30. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that though polling was, by and large, peaceful in Tamil Nadu, the ECI couldn’t ensure that parties adhered to the COVID-19 protocol during the campaign, despite repeated observations made by the court, “like a broken record”, in almost every order passed on an election-related case, stressing the need to follow the norms. “The significance of adhering to such protocol may have been lost on the ECI, going by its silence as campaigning and rallies were conducted without maintaining distancing norms... They were held in wanton disregard for other requirements of the protocol,” the judges said, adding that the ECI ought to have come up with strict safety measures at least for the counting of the votes.  The observations were made during the hearing of a petition by Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar for following regulations while counting the votes in Karur constituency, from where he contested. However, the judges expanded the scope of the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/poll-panel-draws-flak-from-madras-high-court/article34419550.ece

27 April 2021||Washington,||Modi, Biden discuss COVID-19, U.S. aid||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on the phone on Monday to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in India and U.S. assistance to the country. The conversation comes a day after Mr. Biden and some of his Cabinet members publicly expressed solidarity with India and the U.S. government promised assistance to India in its fight against the pandemic. “Had a fruitful conversation with@POTUS@JoeBidentoday. We discussed the evolving COVID situation in both countries in detail. I thanked President Biden for the support being provided by the United States to India,” Mr. Modi said on Twitter. Their conversation “also underscored the importance of smooth and efficient supply chains of vaccine raw materials and medicines,” the Prime Minister said. TRIPS initiative Significantly, a readout of the call from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) also said that Mr. Modi informed Mr. Biden of “India’s initiative at the WTO for a relaxation in the norms of the Agreement on TRIPS to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries”. A group of 10 Senators had written to Mr. Biden earlier in April asking him to support a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights at the WTO that would enable the production of COVID-19 therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines around the world. The White House readout of the call does not mention the TRIPS initiative. “The President pledged America’s steadfast support for the people of India who have been impacted by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases,” the White House readout said. “President Biden conveyed solidarity with India and affirmed that the United States was determined to support India’s efforts by quickly deploying resources such as therapeutics, ventilators and identifying sources of raw materials to be made available for the manufacture of Covishield vaccines,” the PMO readout said. The Prime Minister “mentioned India’s commitment to contain the COVID-19 pandemic globally through Vaccine Maitri, and its participation in COVAX and the Quad Vaccine Initiatives”, as per the PMO. Mr. Modi and Mr. Biden agreed to remain in touch and directed their officials to coordinate closely on the COVID-19 issue, the PMO said. Lack of resources The telephone call came in the background of not just flagging of supply chain issues with the U.S. with regard to vaccines but also the lack of certain resources in India to fight the pandemic, as the country has been hit by exponentially rising cases and deaths.

27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre controlled truth not pandemic, says Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged that though the Narendra Modi government had failed to contain the pandemic, it had managed to control “the truth of the pandemic” by manipulating the data regarding COVID-19. “As in the case of employment and development, the government is not allowing the actual data about corona to reach the people. They may have not been able to control the pandemic but managed to control the truth about the pandemic,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted. Ahead of the May 1 roll-out of vaccines for every adult in the country, Mr. Gandhi, in a separate tweet, said “All citizens of the country should get vaccine for free” and India should not become “a victim of the BJP’s system”. Speaking to the The Hindu , former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said the Central government had failed to make State governments stakeholders in the fight against the second wave of COVID-19 and suggested that Mr. Modi convene an all party meeting to prepare a concrete road map to fight the pandemic. Mr. Pilot said the current crisis was a result of bad planning by the Central government and alleged that “after centralised decision-making during the first wave, it has left the States to fend for themselves as things spiralled out of control”. He said the Central government needed to take blame for the ongoing “chaos”, unavailability of oxygen and life-saving medicines, and the lack of capacity-building since October last year, when COVID-19 cases were coming down. “They should introspect and think what is going on. Crematoriums are full, people are burning [bodies] on the road and what you see simply wrenches your heart... History will judge which leaders are spending tax payers’ money on advertisement and self-promotion as opposed to building capacities, getting medicines, hospital beds and oxygen beds for the sick,” Mr. Pilot said. “For all these months, should we not have stockpiled all these vaccines in such quantities where we could have covered the entire country in a few weeks... This is a national crisis and we should have a stakeholder approach where scientific inputs are taken. State governments should be brought on board in terms of deciding, allocating and combating,” he added. Arguing for a “one nation-one vaccine price” fixed by the government instead of pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Pilot said, “If there is a clamour on May 1 and people don’t get it, it would not only create frustration and disappointment, but can add to the prevailing sense of chaos.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-controlled-truth-not-pandemic-says-rahul/article34418929.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,||India records 2,762 fresh fatalities||India registered 2,74,994 new COVID-19 cases till 9.30 p.m. on Monday. As many as 2,014 new deaths were also recorded. The country has so far reported a total of 1,75,81,414 cases and 1,97,132 deaths. Maharashtra reported 48,700 infections, followed by Uttar Pradesh (33,574) and Karnataka (29,744). Maharashtra also recorded 524 casualties, followed by Uttar Pradesh (249) and Karnataka (201). The figures do not include cases and deaths from Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Ladakh. The data are sourced from covid19india.org , an independent aggregator of daily figures. The country also recorded a significant drop in the number of tests, with just over 14 lakh conducted on Sunday (results of which were made available on Monday). This is over 3 lakh fewer samples tested compared with the previous day. However, compared with the previous Sunday (April 18), this marks a jump of 46,234 tests. The daily test positivity rate (percentage of positive samples tested) in the country shot up from around 12% on April 10 to nearly 21% on Sunday. During the peak of the first wave in mid-September, the average daily test positivity rate was around 9%. Dip in vaccinations Only 9,95,288 vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Monday, the lowest in almost a month. On March 29, 5.83 lakh doses were given. It is also about 15.4 lakh doses fewer than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. The daily vaccination rate has been on a declining trend in the second half of April compared with the first. Between April 1 and 12, India administered an average of 36.18 lakh doses every day. However, between April 13 and 25, the average daily doses given fell to 25.68 lakh. As many as 2,04,190 new recoveries were recorded on Monday, taking the total to 1,45,00,893. Globally, India’s average daily deaths (2,336) was the second highest, with Brazil continuing to record the most fatalities (nearly 2,500).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-adds-over-2000-fatalities/article34418946.ece
27 April 2021||Ahmedabad,||Data discrepancy widens in Gujarat||Discrepancy between the government data on COVID-19 deaths and those from hospitals and crematoria/burial grounds appears to growing in Gujarat as the State grapples with the second wave of the pandemic. According to the State health bulletin, Gujarat reported 157 fatalities on Sunday, and 152 on Saturday. However, figures from the main government hospitals in Ahmedabad, Surat and a few other districts reveal that the numbers could be many times higher than that being reported by the health authorities. “Around 100 to 125 bodies are sent out from Ahmedabad’s 1,200-bed COVID-19 designated civil hospital daily,” a top source told The Hindu . Similarly in Surat, 67 bodies from the civil hospital and 34 from the Surat Municipal Corporation-run SMIMER Hospital were sent to crematoria by Sunday evening. “Surat continues to witness higher deaths than being reported by the health department officially, because large number of deaths are of those suffering from one or multiple co-morbidities,” a senior official said. In both cities, crematoria have added new furnaces and are almost running round the clock. The situation also appears to have worsened in the rural districts. More than 100 deaths were reported on Saturday in Kutch district alone, indicating the extent of the infection since Kutch is geographically a very large district and has the least population density in the State. “In Bhuj (Kutch district headquarters), there is no space or time to cremate bodies, which are sent to nearby village Sukhpar where additional furnaces have been installed to cremate bodies being brought from Bhuj town,” a local political leader from Bhuj told The Hindu .  The number of obituaries in local newspapers in Gujarat has been rising steadily, possibly indicating a rise in COVID-19 deaths. In another remote district Patan, 17 persons died in Dharpur COVID-19 Hospital on Saturday and Sunday. Six persons reportedly died in the ambulance waiting to be admitted to hospital. A government official serving in one of the districts told The Hindu that people are dying in villages in Patan and Banaskantha districts without even getting tested. “It’s a horrible situation in both districts, which are mainly rural with primary health care almost non-existent in remote villages,” As The Hindu reported earlier, actual deaths being reported from Gujarat far exceed the death figures provided by the State health department. A senior official serving in a top position in one of the districts said that only when the infected person died of ‘viral pneumonia’ would it be classified as a COVID-19 death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/data-discrepancy-widens-in-gujarat/article34418941.ece

She also accused the Prime Minister of insensitivity, alleging “while mass pyres were lit at crematoriums, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy delivering speeches”.  “I am requesting please withdraw the around 2 lakh- strong Central forces drawn from COVID-hit States, who are camping in schools and colleges and safe homes hampering COVID management operations. 75 per cent of them may be infected by the virus. Please withdraw them in the last phase,” she said.

27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India and Japan resolve to jointly fight the pandemic||India and Japan on Monday resolved to fight the pandemic jointly, a press release from the Ministry of External Affairs announced. The observations on COVID-19 featured during a telephonic conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart, Yoshihide Suga. The two Prime Ministers also reviewed the status of ongoing initiatives like the Quad, involving Australia, India, Japan and the U.S., and pledged to complete bilateral developmental schemes. ‘Overcome challenges’ “They highlighted the importance of close India-Japan cooperation to overcome these challenges, such as by working together to create resilient, diversified and trustworthy supply chains; ensuring a reliable supply of critical materials and technologies; and developing new partnerships in manufacturing and skill development,” the Ministry of External Affairs said. Japan is currently under strict measures aimed at containing the pandemic, which has also intensified in an unprecedented manner in India, prompting assistance from several foreign partners. Over the last year of the pandemic, both sides have assisted stranded citizens who were unable to return home. The two leaders agreed to continue with such cooperation. A statement from the Japanese side highlighted Tokyo’s commitment to a “rules-based free and open international order”. Bilateral cooperation “The two leaders confirmed the importance of Japan-India bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation, including the Japan-Australia-India-U.S. quadrilateral cooperation, towards realising a free and open Indo-Pacific,” said a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan. Mr. Suga also expressed “serious concerns” about China’s movements in the East and South China Sea.

27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India likely to receive oxygen, drug supplies from 15 nations||India expects to receive supplies from about 15 countries, including Australia, China, Germany, Russia, the UAE, the United Kingdom and the United States, in the next few days, to help tide over the current crisis for oxygen at hospitals and pharmaceuticals needed to treat COVID-19 cases. On Monday, an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 aircraft transported six cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai, and is expected to airlift six more on Tuesday for the Adani group. A German company is expected to ship 24 more containers later this week. The Australian government said it hopes to send oxygen supplies, non-invasive ventilators, pharmaceuticals and PPE kits as well, and a decision on further aid will be made at a meeting on Tuesday. “India is literally gasping for oxygen,” Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said, speaking to presspersons in Canberra. “And while we can assist with the national medical stockpile, their particular request is for assistance with regards to the physical supply of oxygen,” he added. Government officials denied requesting aid, and said many of the consignments coming in are commercial supplies, while some, including the European Union and Russia, have promised the assistance in the form of grants. However, officials said the grants during the pandemic are exceptional, and India’s long-held policy of not accepting foreign aid is still in place. Most of the donation offers will be routed through the Indian Red Cross, and not the government. As many as 800 oxygen concentrators were also flown in from Hong Kong for Spice Health, a healthcare equipment manufacturing company, amongst a number of shipments expected from China. Meanwhile, Chinese state-owned Sichuan Airlines said it would review its decision to suspend cargo flights to India due to the risk from the pandemic, which would have disrupted exports from China, Global Times reported. “If India raises specific demands, China is ready to provide help and support to the best of capability,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Webin said, but refused to comment on the airlines decision. Indian officials said the priority at present was to fly in as much oxygen-related equipment, including containers, concentrators and generators, as well as COVID-treatment drugs remdesivir and tocilizumab, which were running in short supply. While Russian authorities have reportedly said international patent issues with the U.S. developer of Remdesivir, Gilead Sciences Inc., may delay their plans to export about 3,00,000 injections, New Delhi is hopeful of procuring stocks of the drug from the American company directly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-likely-to-receive-oxygen-drug-supplies-from-15-nations/article34418931.ece
27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vedanta objects to allowing T.N. govt. run its oxygen plant||Vedanta has objected in the Supreme Court to allowing Tamil Nadu government to run its oxygen plant situated in the State. The court had urged the Tamil Nadu government or expert authorities to take over the plant and start the manufacture of medical oxygen to tide over the life-threatening shortage amid the pandemic across the country. Vedanta had recently moved the top court, offering to initiate oxygen production at its Sterlite Copper premises within a week. The company had applied to the Supreme Court, saying it should be allowed to reopen its factory premises, which was closed by the State in 2018 due to environmental problems. Vedanta said it would have its own professionals inspect and maintain the machinery, conduct repairs and have the oxygen plant up and running to cater to the need of the COVID-19 patients. “Petitioner [Vedanta] has oxygen plants with the capacity 1050 MT per day, which was established in the year 1998 and 2004. The quantity of oxygen produced by the petitioner’s plants is significant which can be seen in contrast to the entire oxygen produced in the country which is approximately 7,500 MT per day,” Vedanta said in an affidavit. However, the Tamil Nadu government remained sceptical in court about the company’s intentions. This has promoted the court to ask the State to then take over the running of the oxygen plant. ‘Not advisable’ Now, Vedanta has strongly objected to the State’s takeover of its oxygen plant. “The oxygen plant requires a total manpower of 45 trained personnel to operate it at its full capacity. The plant can be operated by engineers having the expert domain knowledge and by those who are competent and trained over a period of time with an experience of at least 10 years,” the affidavit said. Vedanta submitted that its oxygen plant was constructed at a cost of Rs. 150 crore and the average annual maintenance cost for this plant was Rs. 2 crore. “It is not practically possible or advisable to let any inexperienced personnel to operate the plant,” the affidavit said. The court is scheduled to hear the case on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vedanta-objects-to-allowing-tn-govt-run-its-oxygen-plant/article34418939.ece
27 April 2021||Washington,||‘U.S. govt. orders for vaccine filters diverted to India’||The Biden administration has diverted its pending orders of vaccine filters to India’s vaccine manufacturers, according to White House’s COVID-19 Supply Manager Tim Manning. “Now here’s what we did yesterday: we diverted our pending orders of vaccine filters to India’s vaccine manufacturing effort. This will help India make more vaccine. And it’s only one effort among many to help the their COVID-19 response (e.g. therapeutics, PPE, and oxygen),” Mr. Manning said on Twitter. The U.S. National Security Council had outlined the country’s assistance to India’s COVID-19 battle on Sunday, which included vaccine raw materials. “The United States has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India,” spokesperson Emily Horne had said. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Covishield manufacturer Serum Institute of India, had publicly appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden to lift embargoes on vaccine raw material exports. The U.S. had denied that outright embargoes existed. However, the Defence Production Act (DPA), which former U.S. President Donald Trump and Mr. Biden had invoked, meant that federal government orders had to be prioritised over other orders. Mr. Manning, in his tweets, said there had been “a lot of confusion” around the DPA and its relationship to global supply chains and that the world was working on producing 14 billion vaccines this year, rather than the usual 4 billion. “DPA doesn’t even mean a ‘de facto’ ban. Companies are able to export. In fact, companies that supply our vaccine manufacturing export their product all across the world. We are just one ‘client’ of the raw material companies,” Mr. Manning said. However, Indian manufacturers, some of whose inputs come from the U.S., had experienced shortages of inputs such as filters, bio-reactor bags, microcarrier beads and cell culture media, according to reports in the Indian press.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-govt-orders-for-vaccine-filters-diverted-to-india/article34419457.ece

An official said J&K recorded 25 deaths on Monday, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. “Fourteen deaths were reported in the Jammu division and 11 in the Kashmir division,” the official said. Positive cases continue to show an upward trend, as 2,135 cases were detected on Monday. “J&K is at present treating 20,601 active cases. Such cases had come down to under 600 in March.” The Srinagar administration established an additional 1,300-bed capacity. Seven COVID Care Centers have been established at the Kashmir University, Zakura Campus; the Hyderpora facility; the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar; the Indoor Stadium Haft Chinar Srinagar; the Marriage Hall Sanathnagar; the Haj House Bemina and the IMPA Hostel on M.A. Road, officials said. “Besides these facilities, 1,300 more beds will be ready in the next three days,” Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, Muhammad Aijaz Asad, said. Officials said the patients with mild symptoms will be accommodated in these additional facilities, which will be augmented with low-flow oxygen supply. The National Conference expressed concern over the slow progress on boosting up the availability of oxygen at COVID-19 hospitals across the Union Territory. “We are concerned over the reports of scarcity of critical COVID-19 drugs in hospitals.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-turns-stadiums-marriage-halls-into-patient-facilities/article34418943.ece
27 April 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra, Centre spar over oxygen plants||After row over supply of vaccines and key drug Remdesivir, Maharashtra and the Central government have now locked horns over allotment of money to construct oxygen plants in the State. Congress, a coalition partner in Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, on Monday said the Central government-affiliated Central Medical Services Society (CMSS) that was to set up 10 Pressure Swing Absorption plants in the State according to the January 2021 announcement. “It was a Central government scheme and not a single rupee was given to the State government. The Centre was going to construct those plants. Even though 10 districts had been chosen, the Central government did not move ahead even with the tender process,” said Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe. No actual work According to Mr Londhe, Washim, Satara, Hingoli, Ahmadnagar, Bhandara, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Buldhana, Osmanabad and Sindhudurg were chosen as sites for the plants by the centre but no actual work took place on the ground. “BJP is spreading the misinformation that the money was given to State government and that it was not utilised. Money was never meant for State government as the project was to be set up by an organisation working under Central government,” he added. The BJP while not responding to the Congress’ allegations, repeated the charge that the State government had failed to set up the plants. Minister of State in Centre and former State BJP chief Raosaheb Danve claimed that it has become the habit of Maharashtra government to blame everything on Centre. “Maharashtra is getting the lion’s share in all the allotment from the Central government like 1,784 MT oxygen which is highest in the country,” said Mr. Danve. On Sunday, former CM Devendra Fadnavis had made similar claims. The Congress also questioned the 1,784 MT oxygen allotment also, saying 1,250 MT of this came from Maharashtra’s in-house capacity. “It is nothing but bluff, yet again, by the BJP,” said party’s general secretary Sachin Sawant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-centre-spar-over-missing-oxygen-plants/article34418938.ece
27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||DRDO develops crystal blades for aero engines||In a major technological breakthrough, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Monday said it has developed single crystal blade technology and supplied 60 of such blades to the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as part of their indigenous helicopter development programme for helicopter engine application. “It is part of a programme taken up by the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL), a laboratory of the DRDO, to develop five sets, 300 in number, of single crystal high pressure turbine (HPT) blades using a nickel-based super alloy,” the DRDO said in a statement. The supply of the other four sets would be completed in due course, it said. Critical component Very few countries such as the U.S., the U.K., France and Russia have the capability to design and manufacture such single crystal components, it said. The DRDO has been working for a long time to develop this technology which is a critical component in aero engines. Helicopters need compact and powerful aero-engines for operating at extreme conditions and to achieve this, state-of-the-art single crystal blades having complex shape and geometry, manufactured out of nickel-based super alloys capable of withstanding high temperatures of operation are used.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drdo-develops-crystal-blades-for-aero-engines/article34418906.ece
27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Mask-up at home, says NITI Aayog member||Dr. Guleria said that 85% of those afflicted by the virus would recover without need of any medication and not everyone needed to rush to a hospital. “There is unnecessary panic all around and this is causing more harm than good. This is causing hoarding of drugs and misuse of valuable medical resources. An oxygen level of 94-95 doesn’t need an oxygen concentrator and you shouldn’t try to raise it at those levels. Above 94 means your organs are getting adequate oxygen.” “Before the pandemic, we've managed patients with these machines at 88-90. If it’s below 94, consult with your doctor. For hospitals, it’s important to prevent leakage. The benefits of (antiviral) remdesivir aren’t well established,” he added. Nearly 87% of registered healthcare workers and 80% of frontline workers had been administered at least one dose of vaccine, Mr. Agrawal said. However, only 36% of those 60 and above had received at least one shot, he added. If no one wore masks, there was a 90% risk of an infected person transmitting the disease to someone else whereas were everyone to wear one, that risk went down to 1.5%, Dr. Paul said. He added that other than tocilizumab and remdesivir, for managing mild COVID-19, the guidelines recommended hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol and ivermectin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mask-up-at-home-says-niti-aayog-member/article34418908.ece

Earlier this month, their model projected that active infections would peak by April 15, which didn’t come true. “This time, I have also computed minimum and maximum for predicted values... I am reasonably confident that the actual values will be within the values mentioned,” Maninder Agrawal, professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Kanpur, told PTI. On Sunday, he shared the new peak values for active and new cases in a Twitter thread. “Peak timing: May 14-18 for active infections and May 4-8 for new infections. Peak value: 38-48 lakhs for active infections and 3.4 to 4.4 lakhs for new infections,” he said. Henoted the SUTRA model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic. The first is called beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-nought value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads thevirus to over the course of infection, professor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/daily-cases-to-reach-44-lakh-by-may-8/article34418914.ece

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also issued a clarification to the Sunday’s (April 25) order issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 on liquid oxygen. The order specifically excluded industries manufacturing ampules and vials, the pharmaceutical sector and the defence forces from its ambit. The order had said all liquid oxygen including the existing stock with private plants shall be made available to the government and will be used for medical purposes only. Earlier on April 18, the MHA had written to the States prohibiting supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except for exempted nine industries.  The fresh order issued on Monday, however, reverses the April 18 letter exempting only three specified categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-asked-to-impose-localised-lockdowns/article34418920.ece

Throughout, Draupadi maintains that she has not been won legally by the Kauravas and that she is not bound by the outcome of the game of dice, pointed out Sri B. Damodhara Dikshitar in a discourse. First of all, the entire game was not valid on many counts. It was a plot to entice Yudhishtira to play against the veteran Sakuni, instead of Duryodhana. Everyone knew that Yudhishtira had no chance of winning. She could not understand how anyone could have pledged his wife in the game. So she wanted to know if Yudhishtira had lost himself first and then offered her or whether he pledged her first and then offered himself as the bet. But before she could get an answer, she was dragged to the court. Even in that desperate situation, Draupadi put forth her arguments to the entire assembly fearlessly and appealed for basic justice. How can the assembly allow such a dishonour to be perpetrated against women who are to be treated with respect? Is there no one present to put a stop to this atrocious act that forebodes disaster for all? She proclaimed that when the elders in the assembly, who are the custodians of truth and righteousness, fail to uphold justice, they lose their right to be honoured and venerated. She then asked Bhishma, well known for his wisdom and learning, to clarify whether she was a slave. Bhishma said that he was at a loss to give a proper answer to her question since the subtle shades of dharma are difficult to analyse. One cannot gamble someone after he has already lost himself. But there is also the fact that a man has right over his wife.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/subtle-shades-of-dharma/article34418935.ece

27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors’ body suggests steps to tackle spread of infection||The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association has given several suggestions to contain the spread of COVID-19. It suggested that organisations volunteering to administer vaccines should be given a target to inoculate a certain number of persons through mass vaccination drives. This would help to achieve herd immunity and thereby prevent the spread of the infection, the association said. The government should ensure that groceries and essentials reach the doorsteps of residents, instead of them having to visit shops and market. Shops should be permitted to function for specific hours in the morning and evening to prevent crowding. The association appealed to the government to install plants for manufacture of liquid oxygen in hospitals and sufficient stock of protective equipment, such as PPE kits, N95 masks, gloves and sanitisers for healthcare professionals working in the COVID-19 wards. The government should expedite the promised incentive of a month’s salary to doctors treating COVID-19 patients, the association urged. The Health Department had suspended the annual counselling, citing election. Even those who had completed the process were denied a salary hike due to the imposition of the model code of conduct. Salary not paid Several government medical colleges were yet to pay salary for March, said K. Senthil, association president. Those transferred or promoted had not received their salaries due to administrative issues. The government had also not conducted postgraduate doctors’ counselling yet, he said. Doctors employed in institutions under the Directorate of Public Health had been denied salary as the online biometric attendance was not properly implemented. The association wanted the government to ensure that doctors, who work in COVID-19 wards, were given seven days of quarantine after they complete their ward duty. In many places, they were only given as little as three days, Dr. Senthil added. The association demanded that doctors should not be unnecessarily faulted in the pretext of conducting monthly death audits or audits of those dying due to COVID-19 infection or during childbirth. Such acts of the government were demoralising for the 18,000 doctors working selflessly during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-body-suggests-steps-to-tackle-spread-of-covid-19/article34419509.ece

Some 4,533 people were discharged after treatment, taking the total figure to 2,78,330 and the district accounted for 35 deaths, taking its toll to 4,602. Among the districts, although Kancheepuram recorded far fewer cases (432) than Chengalpattu (1,142), the former accounted for nine deaths, while the latter saw four. Fourteen of the deceased had no co-morbidities. A 30-year-old woman from Chennai, who was admitted on April 19 to the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, tested positive on April 22 and died the following morning. The hospital recorded her death as due to severe COVID-19 bronchopneumonia and respiratory failure. Among those with co-morbidities who died was a 30-year-old man who had hypertension. The patient from Chennai was admitted on April 11 to a private hospital with complaints of fever, cough and difficulty in breathing for three days. He tested positive for COVID-19 on April 21 and died four days later on April 25 due to COVID-19 pneumonia, according to hospital authorities. Over a lakh inoculated As many as 1,15,642 people were tested for the infection on Monday, taking the total figure to 2,17,63,365. The State has so far tested 2,21,26,656 samples.

27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Oxygen production needs to be augmented in State||Tamil Nadu’s current daily oxygen manufacturing capacity of 400 metric tonnes, though comfortable, should be augmented amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, according to industry. The State recently informed the Madras High Court that the current usage of oxygen was to the extent of 250 metric tonnes a day and that it had a storage capacity of 1,167 metric tonnes. On Sunday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said oxygen consumption in Tamil Nadu had already reached 310 metric tonnes, and the State would need 450 metric tonnes soon. “About 20 metric tonnes of capacity is available in industries, but they don’t have the licence to produce medical oxygen. The government should act quickly and issue the licence...,” says R. Kannan, past president, All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association, New Delhi. Oxygen is distributed to private hospitals and nursing homes through a slew of refillers, who purchase liquid oxygen from bulk producers such as INOX Air Products Limited and National Oxygen Limited, he points out. Mr. Kannan runs two plants — TN Oxygen Private Limited, Ayanambakkam, which has a capacity of 8 metric tonnes a day, and Tamilnadu Air Products Private Limited, Gummidipoondi, which has a capacity of 4 metric tonnes a day. “Earlier, the Ayanambakkam plant was setting aside 35% of its production for the medical needs and the rest for the industrial use. The supply to industries was stopped on April 23, and now 100% is going towards the medical requirements,” he says. “The Gummidipoondi plant was under shut-down last year, and we have restarted it only this month and have been running it to full capacity since April 23,” he says. He says the non-availability of cylinders is a challenge. The supply of liquid oxygen to the refillers has been cut down, resulting in a serious shortage of oxygen at private hospitals. Mr. Kannan says the State is not providing financial assistance for augmenting capacity, and it should look at using idle capacity available with the likes of Sterlite Copper. JSW Steel has been supplying liquid medical oxygen from across its plants in India, including Salem. While the company does not share details of Tamil Nadu-specific capacity and supply, it is targeting to supply 20,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen in April from its three plants in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. JSW Steel has said it has been supplying 600 tonnes daily from its plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Kerala, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Marathwada. An industry executive explains that any steel plant requires only gaseous oxygen, and most plants have captive gaseous oxygen units. A fraction can be converted into liquid medical oxygen, he notes. Industry Secretary N. Muruganandam says his Department is working closely with oxygen producers to augment capacity by providing whatever clearances they require. INOX Air Products is setting up a plant at Hosur, which would take a few months to come up, and the Industries Department is doing all it can to support the project. “We are also helping another big firm in land identification at Ranipet. Another firm, called Praxair, wanted some clearances which were pending, and we got it done for them.” Senior officials of the State government whom The Hindu spoke to said that as on date, the situation was manageable. A source said that in the 48 hours. a list of industrial oxygen manufacturers in the State had been collated. “Licences are being given to them to make medical oxygen, and we are procuring from them. The Industries Department has been giving clearances,” the source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oxygen-production-needs-to-be-augmented/article34419067.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Nearly 5,000 passengers took Metro on Sunday||On Sunday, when there was a full lockdown, Chennai Metro Rail had nearly 5,000 passengers using trains, with a majority of them travelling either to take a train or a flight. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), since there was no other mode of public transport available to connect to transport hubs like Chennai Central and Chennai airport, many who had to travel used the trains. Chennai Central Metro Rail station had the maximum number of passengers — nearly 850 — followed by Egmore Metro Rail station, which was used by 500 passengers. Nearly 400 passengers travelled through the Chennai airport Metro Rail station. “Most of the other stations had merely 30-50 passengers at the most. In a few other stations, like Vadapalani, Alandur and Government Estate, there were more than 100 passengers. This explains that apart from those travelling to take flights or trains, many essential workers, too, took the trains,” an official said. Usually, Chennai Metro Rail runs trains every five minutes during peak hours and every seven minutes for the rest of the day. But on Sunday, it ran trains at a very minimal frequency due to the lockdown and in total, only four trains were operated for the services. From Wimco Nagar to Chennai airport, trains were run every hour and from Chennai Central to Chennai airport and from Chennai Central to St. Thomas Mount, every two hours respectively. “We are quite surprised that without any last mile connectivity and during the lockdown, so many commuters used the metro,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nearly-5000-passengers-took-metro-on-sunday/article34419523.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Lessons from the pandemic’s first wave||It was a combination of interventions that slowed the transmission and resulted in the decline of cases, despite the lifting of movement restrictions, during the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai, a pre-print article published in medRxiv by Jagadeesan M., et al, has argued. Authored by Health Department staff at the Greater Chennai Corporation, along with scientists at the National Institute of Epidemiology, an ICMR institution, the paper documents the COVID-19 response by multiple players during 2020 in the southern Metropolis. Chennai mirrored other cities in India by a characteristic lack of compliance to restrictions, unlike in China and Europe, primarily because of the nature of these cities. Highly congested urban slums required a tweaking of strategies. The solution that emerged was a community-centric public health strategy to improve early detection of clusters, access to free testing closer to residences and free hospital-based care, the paper outlines. Strong political will The success of such a programme required strong political will, good governance, extensive public sector hospital and lab infrastructure and adequate dedicated human resources, and its success reflects the availability of support. In addition to these interventions, a dedicated State-level procurement agency facilitated the rapid procurement of PPE kits, consumables and other requirements, the authors outline. An integrated data management system that pooled the information from laboratories, hospitals, and from public surveillance helped tackle the beast. “Unlike rural India, which has a more structured public health care system with an extensive network of community health workers, urban health systems are more fragmented, with many people seeking care in private sector facilities,” the paper says. As a result of this realisation, rather early in the epidemic, additional resources were mobilised for special camps for fever and sample collection and helping with quarantine. “Triaging helped manage the epidemic in a way so that it did not overwhelm the system. The majority of persons went home, stayed quarantined, about 70%. People with moderate disease were referred to COVID-19 Care Centres and others had to quarantine at home,” explains Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, NIE-ICMR. Case fatality ratio dropped from 4.2 in March 2020 to 1.1 in October, for instance. The Reproductive transmission (Rt) dropped from 4.2 in March to below one by the first week of July and remained so until October 2020, even with the relaxation of restrictions. Healthcare infrastructure did not collapse under the weight of the pandemic. In this analysis lie multiple learnings that can become become the gold standard in similar circumstances. Given that the ongoing second wave took a geometric leap from the first wave, how will these learnings work? “The interventions are pretty much the same. This time, we will probably have to scale up much higher,” Dr. Kaur explains. “We know this works for us. The Corporation has started reimplementing some of these interventions again. They should take the load off hospitals and prevent the panic that leads everyone to seek hospital admission,” she added. There are also warnings from such documentation of past experience. For instance, there is convincing data that higher case fatality ratio continues amongst the elderly population. Protecting this group from infection, early detection and preventing severe disease in them must continue to be a priority issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lessons-from-the-pandemics-first-wave/article34419507.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stronger dose of curbs unlikely now||The State government may not be inclined to impose, for the time being, stronger measures than what has been done to contain the spread of COVID-19, although the Health Department favoured severe restrictions. The government order restraining functioning of cinemas, auditoriums, gyms, bars, recreation clubs, big-format shops, shopping complexes and malls came into effect on Monday. E-registration has been mandatory for those entering the State with the exception of those arriving from Puducherry. Explaining the government’s position, a senior official said the Health department wanted tough restrictions to be enforced but “we preferred this to a general lockdown with exemptions and passes.” ‘No drastic changes’ The authorities are aware that the number of cases will keep rising for another two to three weeks. As a new government is likely to take charge in the first week of May, “no drastic changes” are expected till then, said the official. Although the talk of a total lockdown has been doing the rounds in the light of about 340% increase in the State’s daily tally of COVID-19 from April 5 to April 25, there have been suggestions against such a course of action. R. Subash, a financial services consultant, argued that as the government had adequate manpower, it could go in for “localised and targeted containment” instead of a blanket ban on all types of economic activity. Last time, the curve of the disease flattened three or four months after the lockdown was lifted. But this time, “lockdown is not likely to flatten the curve because dynamics of the disease are said to be different,” he said. In his view, in the event of the imposition of a complete lockdown, there would be adverse secondary and tertiary effects on the economy. However, K.E. Raghunathan, convener of the Consortium of Indian Associations, which works in the area of MSMEs, wanted the movement of the public to be allowed only between 7 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. During the restrictions, the police should be told to allow movement of vehicles only for emergency purposes. The government should run free buses within the city for those who have to attend to emergencies and for those without the means of their own transport. “Through such measures, you can save both livelihood and lives,” he said. In respect of people above 45, Mr. Raghunathan suggested that vaccines should to be administered at their door step. K.R. Shanmugam, director, Madras School of Economics, said even the present restrictions reflected 50% of a “total lockdown.” On the question of adopting “localised and targeted containment,” another senior official said it is difficult to implement as “you cannot deploy police everywhere”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stronger-dose-of-curbs-unlikely-now/article34419082.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Consider imposing lockdown on May 1, 2’||The Madras High Court on Monday suggested that the State government could impose a complete lockdown not just on May 2 when the Election Commission of India (ECI) planned to count the votes polled for the Assembly election in Tamil Nadu but also on May 1 to arrest the spread of COVID-19 and curb the movement of vehicles other than those involved in counting and related activities. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote: “If necessary, the State may consider imposing a lockdown on May 1, which is traditionally a holiday, and again on May 2, a Sunday, and only allow the movement of vehicles needed for counting and related purposes, apart from emergency vehicles. If an announcement in such regard is made well in advance, say by April 28, 2021, ordinary citizens may have sufficient notice.” The first Division Bench made the suggestion while passing interim orders on a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) petition taken up by the court last week to monitor the preparedness of the State government to fight the raging second wave of COVID-19. Advocate-General Vijay Narayan and Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan apprised the court of the measures taken so far by the State. After hearing them out, the court directed the State government to monitor and control the prices of drugs such as Remdesivir, rates charged for admissions to private hospitals and prices of oxygen as well as vaccines. The court took note that some private stockists were reportedly sourcing the drugs from Maharashtra and Gujarat and selling them in the black market at exorbitant rates, without insisting upon prescriptions, lung congestion reports and so on. The court recorded the submission of the Health Secretary that squads had already been formed to conduct raids and initiate action against black marketeers. The A-G said the Centre had allocated only 59,000 vials of Remdesivir to Tamil Nadu till April 30, as against the pending orders for 2.5 lakh vials. The State had represented that the supply should be based on the number of active cases in each State. Further, the government had set up an outlet in Kilpauk, Chennai, to sell the drug at cost price to private hospitals as well as patients, on the production of necessary medical records. Pointing out that not all patients would require such drugs, the judges said the relatives of COVID-19 patients sometimes panicked and attempted to procure drugs from the black market. They directed the government to widely publicise the “dos and don’ts” in the media so that people got to understand that not all COVID-19 patients required hospitalisation and drugs. The court also impressed upon eschewing VIP culture in allotting hospital beds. Earlier, the A-G said Tamil Nadu had been conducting over 1.1 lakh RT-PCR tests every day and that it had so far tested 2.17 crore samples, the highest in the country. Of the samples tested, 10.51 lakh (3.94%) had returned positive and 9.43 lakh patients had been discharged from hospitals after treatment so far, which meant that 90% patients had got treated completely. About 90% RT-PCR tests were being done only in government testing centres and Tamil Nadu was the only State to do so, he said. On the availability of vaccines, the court was told that the Centre had so far supplied 55,03,590 Covishield and 10,82,130 Covaxin doses to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consider-imposing-lockdown-on-may-1-2/article34419084.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM urges Centre to procure, supply vaccines to the States||Terming the Centre’s policy on phase 3 of the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination drive “inherently unfair”, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging the Centre to procure and supply the required quantity of vaccines to the States for administering them to all groups, including those aged 18-45. In his letter, Mr. Palaniswami referred to the Centre’s policy of giving the States the responsibility to procure and administer the vaccines to those in the 18-45 years age group. “Such a differential price mechanism is inherently unfair since it places a higher financial burden on the States. It is also iniquitous since the State governments have considerably lesser fiscal resources at their command than the Central government,” he said. As the vaccines would have to be procured by the State governments at pre-determined prices, the rates would be distinctly different from what the Centre had been paying, he said. He pointed out that some manufacturers had already announced higher rates for procurement by State governments. “Further, since a budgetary provision of Rs. 35,000 crore was made in the Budget Estimates for 2021-22 for the COVID-19 vaccination programme, the States have a legitimate expectation that the Government of India would supply the COVID-19 vaccine [for] phase 3,” the Chief Minister said. The Centre could also explore alternative sources of vaccine supply, including imports, to ensure that the roll-out happens smoothly and expeditiously across the country in the coming weeks, Mr. Palaniswami added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-urges-centre-to-procure-supply-vaccines-to-the-states/article34419094.ece

A release from the hospital said the boy, who had Down’s Syndrome, was earlier treated at a private hospital for epilepsy with intravenous drugs. The boy subsequently lost sight in both eyes, possibly because of the drugs, the release added. Mohan Rajan, chairman and managing director of RECH, said the boy was diagnosed with three complications — hypermature cataract, secondary glaucoma and retinal detachment. He said the loss of vision resulted in behavioural changes, with the child becoming more aggressive. The doctor said overcoming the complications involved a three-hour-long surgery after the administration of general anaesthesia. He said the boy regained vision after the surgery. From being aggressive, the boy became more cheerful, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/differently-abled-12-year-old-regains-vision-after-complex-surgery/article34419519.ece
27 April 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||How refineries are aiding hospitals||With hospitals running out of oxygen, oil refineries of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) in Panipat and the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s facility in Kochi are supplying the gas to them.  Is oxygen an important gas in refineries? More than oxygen, refineries require high-purity nitrogen to maintain inert atmosphere in certain processes to prevent air ingress into hydrocarbon-containing vessels and for purging purposes. Nitrogen is mostly produced in cryogenic air separation units. Some refineries have the facility to produce oxygen of 99.7% purity, too, in these cryogenic air separation units. Some of the refineries have VPSA oxygen units that produce oxygen of 90% purity. Where do refineries use oxygen? Refineries use oxygen to enrich the air used in sulphur recovery units and catalytic cracking units. In the former, high-purity oxygen is added to the air for combustion. The latter units help convert vacuum gas oil to value-added products such as LPG, petrol and diesel. What is the process in IOCL, Panipat? IOCL has been supplying oxygen to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. It has a high-purity oxygen production unit, which is used in its mono ethylene glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen. It has reduced production of MEG and is supplying the oxygen to hospitals. What is BPCL Kochi doing? The build-own-operate unit of Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7% purity. When the oxygen crisis started, the facility was put to use. The unit can produce oxygen in both gaseous and liquid forms. So far, it has supplied for free 66 tonnes of oxygen from October 2020. Is the CPCL refinery in Manali supplying Oxygen? No. The CPCL refinery does not supply oxygen to hospitals because it does not have the facility to bottle or store it. It does get a small quantity of oxygen from the unit that produces it. It also procures nitrogen from outside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/how-refineries-are-aiding-hospitals/article34419120.ece

P.C. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the government announced a “complete lockdown” from Saturday 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. on Monday in Chennai. Public were requested to avoid venturing out unnecessarily and not gather on the streets without maintaining personal distancing. No vehicle was allowed to ply on the road on Sunday, except vehicles meant for milk distribution, medical purposes, emergencies and funerals and other essential services. Police checkposts were established all over the city and both law and order and traffic police personnel tightened the security arrangements. The city police said 673 vehicles were seized for violating conditions and 572 of them were two-wheelers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/673-vehicles-seized-for-lockdown-violations/article34419521.ece

But this proposal has been opposed by the State government and a crosssection of the local people. The issue is now subject to further hearing at the Supreme Court. The copper smelter unit in the SIPCOT Industrial Complex has remained idle after the plant was closed in 2018, following the death of 13 protesters in a police firing.

They had arrested five others in connection with the case last week. On Wednesday, personnel at the Fishing Harbour police station received a message about a youth’s body found partially buried in the sands. They began an investigation after registering a case of suspicious death. The deceased was identified as Appunu alias Selvakumar, of Thalankuppam. A few days ago, he and his friends had allegedly assaulted Lokesh, of Ennore, as he refused to rent them a drilling machine. On the night of April 15, Appunu and his friends were drinking near the Fishing Harbour. He reportedly told them that he would be surrendering in connection with the assault. Disagreeing with this, his inebriated friends beat him to death and buried his body before fleeing, the police said. Dinesh, 25, Nishanthan, 25, Muthamizh, 21, Sridhar, 27, and Vetrivel, 33, were arrested last Saturday. On Sunday, the police arrested two more accused M. Santhosh, 29, and Arjun, 27, of Thalankuppam, who were on the run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-more-held-for-murder-of-youth-near-fishing-harbour/article34419515.ece
27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Second shot can be had in any hospital: Minister||The second shot of COVID-19 vaccine, whether Covishield or Covaxin, can be had in any hospital, irrespective of where the first dose was administered, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Monday. Healthcare professionals were instructed to ensure that no person seeking the second dose was turned away for want of vaccine, he told The Hindu.  “We have about seven lakh vaccines and sufficient stock has been made available in all districts. With the current availability, we can sustain about 1.15 lakh vaccinations a day for at least five or six days. Constant efforts are on to get a continuous supply of vaccines,” he said. Instructions given “Doctors have been told to give priority to people coming for the second dose though adequate numbers of vaccines are available,” the Minister said. The Minister said senior doctors, who studied the virulence and profile of the new variant in the second wave, had concluded that it originated from the United Kingdom. “Now, young people are coming with breathlessness since the illness is progressing rapidly, affecting the lungs. Doctors are saying this variant is from London. It is still manageable and we can effectively control the spread of this variant if people cooperate by staying at home unless their stepping out is essential,” he said. Oxygen availability Dr. Vijayabaskar said Tamil Nadu’s position with regard to the availability of oxygen was comfortable. The requirement of oxygen might go up since in many cases, the first or second stage of illness was breathlessness. Even after discharge, many patients had lung fibrosis, requiring oxygen support till complete recovery. Asked about non-essential commercial establishments remaining open, violating the lockdown conditions that came into effect from 4 a.m. on Monday, he said people, particularly from the business fraternity, should cooperate with the government in the management of the pandemic. “We are aware that livelihood is important. But saving lives is even more important. People are seeing what is happening in Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and other States. Instead of allowing such a situation in Tamil Nadu, people should stand up against the virus by strictly adhering to the safety guidelines,” he said. On contact tracing, which was effective in the first wave, not being implemented now, Dr. Vijayabaskar said the number of cases was so high that it would be difficult to do contact tracing in a full-fledged manner. However, the Greater Chennai Corporation had revived the system of door-to door screening.

27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK, allies endorse oxygen production||Many parties in Tamil Nadu on Monday favoured the conditional resumption of medical oxygen production at Vedanta’s sealed Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi in view of the spread of COVID-19. Emerging from an all-party meeting, convened by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, which lasted over two hours, DMK Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi told journalists that all parties in the DMK-led alliance were for allowing Sterlite to produce only oxygen, and not for operating any other unit on its campus. “Moreover, the Tamil Nadu government should provide electricity to the plant only for producing oxygen. This, too, should be temporary, and should not be permanent and not be considered a precedent,” said Ms. Kanimozhi. Replying to a query, she said it should be allowed “under the supervision of the Tamil Nadu government” and “technicians from the plant could be used” with the “cooperation of the people”. A release from the DMK said that its representatives also urged for “providing free supply of oxygen produced from the plant to the people of Tamil Nadu”. The Congress, the BJP and the Left parties also took part in the meeting. BJP State president L. Murugan said the plant should be allowed to produce only oxygen. “Only after exhausting the oxygen needs of Tamil Nadu should it be supplied to others,” he said. MDMK leader Vaiko said, in a statement, that the Tamil Nadu government should take the plant under its control to produce only oxygen since there was a need for the gas. The TNCC, represented by K.V. Thangkabalu and K. Jayakumar, said the plant could be allowed to function on a temporary basis to produce oxygen at a time when saving people’s lives is important. They suggested that an expert committee on environment, headed by the Collector, be constituted to monitor the production and distribution of oxygen from the plant. Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan said it was important to gain the confidence of the people of Thoothukudi, adding that restrictions and measures need to be put in place inside the plant. AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran called upon the High Court to monitor the functioning of the Sterlite plant.  Opposing the move Naam Tamilar Katchi chief coordinator Seeman and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan opposed the all-party meet’s decision. While Mr. Seeman said it was a mockery to claim that a factory that was responsible for environmental degradation would now be producing oxygen for the people, Mr. Haasan asked if there was no other factory that could produce medical oxygen. “The pandemic is getting worse and lives are being lost due to a shortage of oxygen. MNM agrees that the production of oxygen needs to be increased. However, I do not agree with the decision to reopen the Sterlite factory for the production of oxygen,” he said in a statement. Stating that MNM, MDMK, NTK and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi were not invited for the meeting, Mr. Haasan said the parties had participated in protests seeking the plant’s closure. “The families of the 13 people who died in police firing will not pardon these people” he said.  Mr. Seeman said, “When people were suffering from breathlessness, cancer and other ailments, the Sterlite management did not care about anything, except profits. Now, the management is saying that they care about people. This is just opportunistic.” VCK founder Thol. Thirumavalavan said, “This decision to allow Sterlite to function only for the purpose of manufacturing oxygen causes extreme uneasiness and contradictions. However, because it is an all-party decision, we shall abide by the same. We accept this decision despite the contradictions because it has been made with the intent of protecting people’s lives. But the State government must ensure that this does not pave the way for Sterlite to remain open permanently.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-allies-endorse-oxygen-production/article34419086.ece

G.O. issued The Tamil Nadu government issued a Government Order to this effect on Monday. “Since a complete lockdown has been enforced on Sundays, crowding was witnessed in meat stalls on Saturdays with people flouting physical distancing norms,” a G.O. issued by Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said.

27 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea to extend time for filing Form 15G, 15H||With banks in Tamil Nadu operating with reduced business hours from Monday amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, senior citizens have called for extension of time for filing form 15G and form 15H. Form 15G and form 15H are self-declaration forms which individuals submit to the banks or financial institutions, requesting them not to deduct tax at source (TDS) on interest income as their income is below the basic income tax exemption limit. Resident individuals, aged 60 years or more, have to file form 15H at the beginning of each financial year (April) while those below 60 years of age have to file form 15G. “Most senior citizens have savings in fixed deposits, mainly in public sector banks. They need to file form 15H so that tax is not deducted at source. If they don’t file, tax will be deducted and they can claim refund only by filing income tax returns,” Sankaran, a retired bank official, said. He said the Centre could consider relaxations like it did last year. Taking into account the difficulty caused by the pandemic last year, the government had extended the validity of form 15G and form 15H up to June 30. “Another issue is each bank has a different format for the forms. If these forms are standardised across banks, we can send them by post as well. Banks also don’t send reminders about this requirement for filing forms,” C. Selvaraj, a retired State government employee, said. Another senior citizen Rangarajan said while online facilities for filing these forms were available, most of them were not tech savvy and chances of committing errors were more. He also said banks could consider operating in two shifts, which would help both the staff and the customers. Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said that if tax was deducted at source, the senior citizens would have to depend on tax consultants to file their returns and pay a huge fee.  Another issue is each bank has a different format for the forms. If they are standardised, we can send it by post as well C.

They said the ECI ought to have come up with strict safety measures at least for the counting of the votes. “At no cost should the counting result in a catalyst for a further surge, politics or no politics, and [irrespective of] whether the counting takes place in a staggered manner or is deferred. Public health is of paramount importance, and it is distressing that constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard. It is only when the citizen survives that he enjoys the other rights that this democratic Republic guarantees unto him. The situation is now one of survival and protection, and everything else comes thereafter,” the Bench said. The observations were made during the hearing of a petition by Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar for following certain regulations while counting the votes in Karur constituency, from where he contested.

The amount is being provided since fishermen are usually without work during the ban, which is meant for mechanised boats. “The Rs. 5,000 given is not enough to run a family for 61 days. The government is asking us to stay away from fishing, which is why it began giving us the dole. Families that are below the poverty line, are members of fishermen cooperative societies and live in fishing villages are given the assistance,” said Nanjil Ravi, Akhila Indhiya Meenavar Sangam. K. Bharathi, South India Fishermen Welfare Association, said the amount was not enough. “The current amount barely helps cover food expenses. With no income whatsoever, workers and other labourers, who get work due to the mechanised boats, depend on this amount,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-seek-increased-dole-during-ban-period/article34419511.ece

Puram and asked them to start functioning from there on Tuesday. On Monday, the Corporation earmarked places for shops, passage way, installed drinking water and toilets. The day also saw senior Corporation officials inspect the spot. Sources said after the Corporation decided on Sunday to close down the Flower Market to ensure maintenance of physical distance and other COVID appropriate behaviour, the traders had appealed to the civic body to reconsider its decision. But the Corporation decided against it as it was a well thought out move as Flower Market was crowded and the vendors showed reluctance to shift to the new premises, opposite the Market. Left with little choice, the civic body took the move, said the sources. The Corporation deployed earth movers on Monday to level the surface to ensure that the traders and customers conducted their business without difficulty. The vendors would continue to remain there until the Corporation would reopen the Market, which was likely after the city saw a reduction in COVID-19 positive cases, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-rejects-flower-vendors-appeal/article34419534.ece

27 April 2021||Krishnagiri,TAMIL NADU||Surge likely in migrant returnees||With Karnataka announcing a 14-day lockdown starting Tuesday night, the border districts of Krishnagiri and neighbouring Dharmapuri are expected to see a large number of migrants from Karnataka returning to their villages. A large number of youth from Dharmapuri are employed in Karnataka. With the lockdown announced on Monday in the neighbouring State, the Health Department is anticipating a spike in COVID-19 cases because of the return of a large number of migrant workers. Soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced last year, there was a flurry of migrant workers crossing the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border on foot. Monday’s announcement in Karnataka comes in the backdrop of the Bengaluru Urban district recording a sharp increase in the tally of cases. However, till Monday evening, authorities in both districts had not announced any specific plan for quarantining or testing returnees. The health apparatus in both districts are already overwhelmed with the increase in fresh cases. Krishnagiri Collector V. Jayachandra Bhanu Reddy attributed the spike in cases to the increase in testing and tracing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/surge-likely-in-migrant-returnees/article34419085.ece
27 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Vaigai river and AV Bridge as Azhagar would see every year||With a view to creating an atmosphere of Lord Kallazhagar entering the Vaigai, the staff of Lord Sundararaja Perumal Temple in Azhagarkoil have erected a huge flex board depicting Albert Victor Bridge and its environs, where Azhagar usually enters into the river as part of the annual Chithirai festival. Lord Kallazhagar enters into the river, the highlight of the annual Chithirai festival in Madurai, in all grandeur and festivity associated with it for centuries. Lakhs of devotees participate in the event to witness the event near the Albert Victor bridge. Temple Deputy Commissioner T. Anitha said, “We took this initiative as the actual event cannot be held with public participation this year due to the COVID-19 restrictions. So, at least this model will serve as a stopgap arrangement and assuage the feelings of devotees,” she said. On Tuesday, Lord Kallazhagar will be taken through water in a trough kept in front of the ‘Vaigai river scene.’ It will be telecast live on YouTube, television channels and other social media platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaigai-river-and-av-bridge-as-azhagar-would-see-every-year/article34419637.ece
27 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Stilt walkers seek financial aid for their sustenance||A group of ‘Marakkaal Aattam’ artistes staged a performance in front of the Collectorate here on Monday to draw the attention of the authorities to their plight. ‘Marakkaal aattam’ is a folk dance form, akin to stilt walking, where the artistes perform standing on a stilt. R. Mohan, a renowned stilt walker, who has been performing for more than five decades, said that the artistes usually perform in temple festivals that are held for six months in a year. The money they earned during this period will meet their needs for the rest of the year. The lockdown imposed last year owing to COVID-19 pandemic had meant that the artistes had no income for the whole year. “While we had a few bookings this year, the fresh restrictions imposed since April 10 disallowing temple festivals has deeply affected the artistes,” he said. Most of the artistes and their families are totally dependent on this income. “With no income for the second successive year, we will be pushed into the verge of starvation,” said Mr. Mohan. “Unlike other dance forms, ‘marakkaal aattam’ is risky. If an artiste falls down from the tall stilt, he will be injured badly. Unmindful of this risk, the artistes continue to perform, as they have a passion for this dance form,” he said. The artistes submitted a petition to the Collector, seeking a monthly financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 to each artiste during the COVID-19 lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stilt-walkers-seek-financial-aid-for-their-sustenance/article34419644.ece

A press release from the institute said patients suffering from stroke or rheumatoid arthritis were unable to go out and receive treatment under the direct supervision of a qualified physiotherapist due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the professors - M. Maran, T. Kamatchi, N. Dinesh Kumar, M. Vivek Prabhu, and K. Meenakshi Sundar - have designed the equipment to help such patients. The Department of Science and Technology of the Central government sanctioned Rs. 21.43 lakh as research fund in March to develop the device. It had sanctioned Rs. 34 lakh in 2019 for a similar project addressing the hemiplegia and finger rehabilitation of stroke patients. Another research project of the team has been recognised by Biotechnology Industrial Research Assistance Council of the Union government which has granted Rs. 28 lakh in 2018 for the design and development of de-worming drench gun for feeding oral dosages to livestock. Principal N. Suresh Kumar said the department had been taking various initiatives to develop prototypes for domestic, biomedical and healthcare devices and implement innovative ideas to develop marketable products with financial assistance from various government-funding agencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-device-for-ankle-rehabilitation/article34419645.ece

27 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Utilise govt. hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients’||Villupuram Member of Parliament D. Ravikumar has urged the Puducherry administration to ensure that adequate steps are taken to utilise all the government hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients. In a memorandum presented on Monday to Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan seeking steps to tackle the pandemic situation, Mr. Ravikumar said that presently the incidence of COVID-19 in Puducherry was on the rise as could be evidenced by the registration of not less than 1, 000 cases a day. He said 90% of the patients were in home isolation. This is a discouraging sign as the chances of spread of pandemic were strong. This should be reversed and the government should ramp up facilities, he said. The MP also wanted a coordinated approach between the territorial administration and the centrally-administered Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) to tackle the emergent situation. The territorial administration should come out with a transparent approach on the availability of liquid oxygen supply and beds. With bars remaining closed in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and with liquor being available in Puducherry, the influx of people from the neighbouring State into Puducherry would be immense and hence steps should be taken to ensure that such a situation offering scope for spread of COVID-19 was tackled effectively. With economic activity having come to a close following the lockdown, members of middle income and low income families were bereft of sources of income. The government should come forward to provide Rs. 5,000 per family, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/utilise-govt-hospitals-to-treat-covid-19-patients/article34419712.ece
27 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Narayanasamy seeks Centre’s intervention||Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has sought the intervention of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in restoring the suspended elective OPD services at JIPMER. In a letter to the Minister, Mr. Narayanasamy referred to JIPMER's decision of April 25 to temporarily suspend elective physical OPD visits as a transmission containment measure in view of the spate of coronavirus cases recently, and stated that the suspension would totally negate the regular medical treatment for the people of Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and the other adjoining States. He pointed out that JIPMER was catering to the medical care of a large proportion of the South Indian population. The people coming from various states get better free medical treatment as outpatients and inpatients in JIPMER. On the one side, the COVID-19 pandemic was creating health crisis to the people of Puducherry and on the other, there was the closure of outpatient treatment. The denial of OPD services to more than 5,000 would jeopardise the health system in the region. The Covid block was operating in JIPMER with 300 beds but the number of beds could be increased to 600 because of the fast increasing coronavirus cases in the Union Territory. Further, regular supply of medicine should also be ensured to JIPMER. The JIPMER administration has to co-operate with the Puducherry Government for controlling COVID-19, Mr. Narayanasamy said. He appealed to the Minister to intervene to sustain OPD operations and also increase the number of beds from 300 to 600 to provide best medical care to people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/narayanasamy-seeks-centres-intervention/article34419714.ece

27 April 2021||Soma BasuMADURAI,TAMIL NADU||One hundred years of fortitude||While arthritis has restricted her mobility, the pandemic lockdown has confined her to her room. But Dr R Padmavathy has a spirit that refuses to be cowed down. She celebrates her 100th birthday today. Her family unfortunately cannot get togetherin the midst of the pandemic. Blessed with three sons, a daughter, their spouses, eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren spread between the US and Chennai, the matriarch worries about their safety. “We will cut a cake at home and do a video call with the others,” says Dr R. Gurusundar, her eldest son, who lives with her in Madurai. In the 1900s, Dr Padmavathy’s father, a Licensed Medical Practitioner, was perturbed by the plight of women as they chose to suffer than consult male doctors. People from her community — apparently as a mark of protest against her going to school — would often throw Padmavathy's school bag into the well. But each time her father bought her a new set of books and raised her confidence. There was family pressure to get her married at 15 but yet again, her father resisted and got her enrolled at The American College, Madurai, for Intermediate. Later, she completed MBBS from Madras Medical College in 1949 and joined Government Erskine Hospital in Madurai as House Surgeon where her father was working as Senior Civil Surgeon. He welcomed his daughter with an Austin and the 28-year-old woman created a flutter on Madurai’s streets — a woman doctor who could also drive a car was an uncommon combination then. When Dr Padmavathy was posted as medical officer in Kodaikanal GH, there was a tussle between the then-Commissioner of Madurai Municipality, who sought her services, and the District Medical Officer, who would not let her off. Yet again, her father’s word prevailed. And so, she became the first woman doctor to join the Madurai Municipality in 1950. “Nothing baffled her, even high-risk pregnancy cases,” says her eldest daughter-in-law Dr G. Sundari. Dr. Padmavathy talks about her trip to Poland for training in 1969. She remembers the vacuum apparatus she brought from Warsaw and how it was a game-changer for carrying out vacuum-assisted deliveries. Dr. Padmavathy built a 10-bed nursing home-cum-residence with her husband G. Ramaswami, Headmaster of Thiagarajar Model School. The Padmalaya Health Clinic on Perumalkoil Street is the only health centre without a theatre for performing caesarian sections. In later years, her son, a general surgeon, and his gynaecologist-wife established the Padmalaya Medical Centre in Jainhindpuram. Dr. Sundari says her mother-in-law wakes up at the crack of dawn and goes about her day at her pace, singing hymns, reading newspapers, watching television, doing physiotherapy and having her meals on time.

27 April 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Shorter-duration train journey on the cards for Thanjavur commuters||From May 1, train commuters heading for destinations on the main-line section in Thanjavur district are all set to enjoy the benefit of a shorter-duration travel to their respective destinations from Chennai Egmore. The Southern Railway has obtained consent of the Railway Board to try a proposal mooted by the Rail Users Associations in Thanjavur district, for re-scheduling the departure timing of Cholan Express after the arrival time of Tejas Express. In its proposal, the associations had requested the Railways to delay the departure of Chennai Egmore-bound ‘Cholan Express’ (Train no: 06796) from Tiruchi by 10 minutes at Tiruchi so that the commuters arriving to Tiruchi by Tejas Express (Train no: 02613) from Chennai Egmore could use the ‘Cholan Express’ as a link service (except on Thursdays) to reach Thanjavur and other important railway stations on the main-line in Thanjavur district quickly. It would help commuters heading for Thanjavur, Papanasam, Kumbakonam and Aduthurai to reach their respective destinations within five to six hours from Chennai. At present, the Tejas Express leaves Chennai Egmore by 6 a.m. and reaches Tiruchi by 10 a.m. Rescheduling the departure of Cholan Express at Tiruchi to 10-10 a.m. from 10 a.m. would be of immense help to the commuters originating from Chennai Egmore to Thanjavur, Papanasam, Kumbakonam and Aduthurai, said S. Saravanan of Papanasam, secretary, Train Passengers Association, Papanasam and member, DRUCC, Tiruchi Region. Otherwise, the passengers have to wait for about 60 minutes at Tiruchi to board the Coimbatore-Mayiladuthurai Jan Shatabdi (Train no:02084) passing through Thanjavur, Papanasam and Kumbakonam (except on Tuesdays) or switch over to road transport to reach their destinations on the main-line, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shorter-duration-train-journey-on-the-cards-for-thanjavur-commuters/article34419056.ece
27 April 2021||THENI/DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Permit us to operate salons, hairdressers tell State govt.||Hairdressers of Theni and Dindigul districts have submitted petitions at their Collectorates urging the State government to consider their plight and allow them to operate salons. In the wake of the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the government announced a series of restrictions that included closure of salons till further orders. The hairdressers said the move would impact their livelihood. The nationwide COVID-19 lockdown that was imposed last year had impacted them financially and a similar lockdown this year would further affect their livelihood. They said that they were taken aback by the decision of the government. Even the COVID-19 welfare schemes announced by the government last year did not reach all members of hairdressers associations. While only a few benefitted from the scheme, most of them had to suffer financially. They urged the government to allow them to operate the salons and said they would abide by the COVID-19 guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/permit-us-to-operate-salons-hairdressers-tell-state-govt/article34419100.ece
27 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Activists want government to take over Sterlite plant||The Anti-Sterlite Thoothukudi People’s Movement on Monday said the State government must take over the entire Sterlite Copper premises, dismantle the copper smelter unit and “other harmful units” there and “then start operating the oxygen plant under its control”. Warning of intensified protests if the oxygen production is used for backroom revival of operations of the copper smelter unit, Krishnamurthy, a representative of the movement, said, “If it is opened again, the people will uproot it completely through their revolution.” The anti-Sterlite movement was an organic one and not dependent on political support, he said. The police arrested 10 members of the movement after they attempted to stage a dharna in front of the Collectorate in the afternoon, following the government-convened all-party meeting’s resolution to temporarily allow the oxygen plant on the Sterlite premises to operate to meet oxygen needs of COVID-19 patients. They were taken to a marriage hall by the police. “They will be released only if they give an undertaking that they will not indulge in any protest in the future. If not, they will be remanded in judicial custody,” a police officer said. In the morning, the members, led by Mr. Krishnamurthy, submitted a petition at the Collector’s Office. Mr. Krishnamurthy alleged that Sterlite, with an ulterior motive to reopen its closed copper smelter, had proposed to produce oxygen in the guise of helping COVID-19 patients. Even though the public had vociferously opposed the move during the public hearing, the Union Government was keen on giving it permission to reopen, he said. Anticipating unrest, the police, led by Deputy Inspector General of Police Praveen Kumar Abinapu, made elaborate security arrangements in Thoothukudi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/activists-want-government-to-take-over-sterlite-plant/article34419089.ece

The Melakaranthai farmers, led by president of Karisalbhoomi Vivasaayigal Sangam Varadharajan, said the growers, who would usually get the yield of 25 bags of corn per acre, could get only 5 or 6 bags of corn this year due to unseasonal rains in January last and the Fall Armyworm attack. A buyer from Agarathupatti village near Thirumalapuram in Virudhunagar district, who purchased corn from the farmers for Rs. 1,550 per quintal in February with the promise of giving the money within a week, did not keep the promise even after three months. “Three cheques for Rs. 4 lakh each given by the buyer bounced upon depositing in bank. When we met him in his house at Agarathupatti to get the money, he and his henchmen threatened us. Fearing for life, we left the place. When we filed complaint with Masarpatti police station in the district, the police refused to file a first information report and take action against the buyer. Hence, the Collector should take save the farmers who have already suffered hefty crop loss,” said Mr. Varadharajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-want-action-against-maize-buyer/article34419646.ece
27 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Robbers nabbed in Thoothukudi||A police special team has nabbed a gang of robbers, who robbed a TASMAC shop supervisor of Rs. 6.13 lakh on April 12 last. According to Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar, TASMAC retail outlet supervisor M. Murugan, 51, of Anna Nagar Colony near Kulathoor was robbed by three unidentified persons at knifepoint when he was going to the bank in Keezha Vaippaar to deposit the previous day’s collection. The team zeroed in on D. Bharath, 22 of Indrani Main Road, Mudakku Salai, Madurai, and his associates K. Muthu Irul, 29, of Samayanallur in Madurai and K. Manikandan alias Suruttai Mani, 23, of Vallalaar Kovil Street, Millerpuram in Thoothukudi. While Bharath and Suruttai Mani have been arrested, police found that Muthu Irul has been lodged in Srivilliputhur sub-jail after being arrested for allegedly smuggling 21 kg ganja. The police have also seized 3 bikes and a car from them. Mr. Jayakumar lauded the efforts of Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vilaathikulam Sub Division, Prakash, special team leader Inspector Murugan, Sub-Inspector Gangainatha Pandian and others. Mr. Prakash said Muthu Irul, who is facing 66 cases registered in various districts, including Madurai, is the mastermind behind this crime. Though all the three are from Madurai district, Suruttai Mani shifted his camp to Thoothukudi a couple of years ago after being arrested along with Bharath and Muthu Irul quite frequently. “After robbing the TASMAC shop supervisor, they had purchased liquor for Rs. 5,000 and dresses for them the same day. While Muthu Irul purchased a car with his share, Bharath and Surruttai Mani bought new bikes,” Mr. Prakash said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/robbers-nabbed-in-thoothukudi/article34419755.ece

27 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Patronage dries up for tailors stitching school uniforms||Pandemic-induced lockdown for the second consecutive year has crushed the survival of section of tailors who exclusively stitched school uniforms. Prior to the lockdown imposed in March last year, the tailors were busy making uniforms. Materials were sourced and work was under way. However, things went awry once the lockdown was announced. Even when schools reopened after a gap of few months, there was not much business. The tailors had pinned their hopes on the new academic year after a year-long break. “The second wave of COVID-19 has rained on our parade and we are having to incur losses for a second year in a row,” a tailor rued. Some tailors could never deliver uniforms they had stitched last year. Their shops have undelivered stocks of a variety of uniforms - shirts, trousers, blazers of various designs including stripes, checks. P. Radhakrishnan, a tailor in Srirangam, said that he had been forced to make minute alterations for small amounts to make ends meet. “I keep my shop open and charge Rs. 10 for those works. At the end of the day, I make enough for a square meal,” he said. At Vijay Process, a large-scale uniform supplier in Tiruchi, matters have turned worse. Once a busy unit with 25 tailors and 10 salespeople, there are now only two salespersons. “We had to send all our tailors home because we had no orders and were unable to pay them,” said the proprietor K. Ganesan. The supplier used to make at least 10,000 to 15,000 uniform sets every season, but in the last two years, they have not been able to get even 2% of the orders. The absence of an active association of tailors and garments suppliers has made matters worse. “We do not have any representation to seek assistance. There was a Welfare Board, but due to in-fighting, many tailors withdrew their membership. With proper leadership we would have sought solatium at least,” Mr. Radhakrishnan rued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patronage-dries-up-for-tailors-stitching-school-uniforms/article34419066.ece
27 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Covaxin stock runs dry in Tiruchi district||Despite repeated assurances by Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, vaccine stocks in Tiruchi district ran low on Monday. With Covaxin stocks running nearly dry, some people were turned away from the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. In the morning, when the vaccination site at the MGMGH opened, a source said that there was no Covaxin stock, while nearly 1500 doses of Covishield were available. Many people were turned away and told to return the next day, while those taking the first shot were given Covishield. However, it was a little later in the morning that 150 doses of Covaxin were delivered to the center, another source at the GH said. “We are giving the vaccine only to those taking the second dose”, he said. By noon, that stock too ran dry. All those approaching the GH for their first dose were administered Covishield. The vaccinators were of the opinion that following the death of actor Vivekh, the number of people taking the vaccine had fallen. “While we were inoculating up to 1,000 people a day then, for two to three days following his death, we only administered 200-300 shots,” he said. However, following the sudden spike in COVID-19 cases, the number of people showing a willingness to take the vaccine was increasing again. On Monday evening, 900 doses of Covaxin were delivered to the Tiruchi MGMGH and the stock would be put to use from Tuesday onwards, senior health officials said. Meanwhile, 1,100 doses of Covishield were in stock and would last at least two days at the GH, they said. Tiruchi MGMGH and the Manapparai Government Hospital are the only two session sites in the government set up for inoculating Covaxin. All Primary Healthcare Centres, Mini Clinics, and the Srirangam GH too, are stocked with Covishield.

27 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||14 residential areas turn containment zones||The Tiruchi Corporation has categorised 14 residential spots as containment zones. Two streets in Thillai Nagar, Kammala Street and Sangiliyandapuram figure among the containment areas. While the sanitary workers of the Corporation will disinfect the residences of those who had tested positive for the virus, the streets, where they live, will also be cleaned up. “Most of the areas where COVID-19 cases have surfaced are urban slums and thickly-populated areas. Some of them are located on both the sides of East Boulevard Road, and we have stepped up our vigil in the vulnerable areas,” said S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation. He said instructions had been given to the City Health Officer to conduct fever camps in areas where three or more cases of COVID-19 virus were detected. At the time of first wave of the pandemic, each fever camp covered about 50 patients. Every fever camp being conducted now in different parts of the city covers 100 to 125 patients. Besides the basic parameters, the patients are screened for fever, cold and cough. The oxygen level of the patients was also measured. Mr. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that about 50 fever camps were being conducted daily in the city. Out of 4,500 samples lifted in the district on Sunday, 2,600 were from Tiruchi city. On an average, the number of positive cases hovered around 300 daily in the district. Nearly 50% was from Tiruchi city. “COVID-19 cases are stable in Tiruchi. The daily case count in the Tiruchi has been hovering between 150 to 160 for the last one week. There is no abnormal or steep increase in COVID-19 cases in the city. It is a positive development. We hope that the fresh cases can be contained,” Mr. Sivasubramanian said. He said that the number of sample collection would be increased from 2,600 to 3,000 a day. It would enable the health authorities to bring all asymptomatic or patients with mild symptoms under the COVID-19 treatment plan. If they were not tested for the virus, they would spread the virus to others unknowingly.  Most of the areas where COVID-19 cases have surfaced are urban slums and thickly-populated areas S.

As per the new restrictions issued by the State government to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus, which came into effect from Monday, no restaurant is allowed to offer dining services to customers. They were allowed to offer take away services only. Except for small restaurants, most of the bigger ones confined their business to take away orders. Restaurants have made announcement about take away service through notice boards placed at the entrance. Though the restrictions evoked mixed reaction from the public, many outbound and inbound travellers found it difficult to find restaurants to eat. Following the closure of dining services, several commuters, who had bought food items were found sitting on platforms and eating. “All buses are being operated as usual in day time and hundreds of passengers travel from one destination to other. Where will they eat when dining services have been denied in the restaurants?” says M. Vengatesan of Palakarai in Tiruchi. The closure of dining service has evoked strong reaction from restaurants. “We are disheartened. The impact of the fresh restrictions will have great ramifications.

27 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Hairdressers in districts seek permission to serve public||Assuring that they would adhere to the COVID-19 norms on their premises, members of Tirunelveli District Hairdressers’ Welfare Association submitted a petition at the Collectorate on Monday. The petitioners, led by district president S. Shanmugavel Murugan, said the State Government, as part of the revised COVID-19-induced lockdown, had announced that the salons under the Corporation and municipal areas would remain closed until further orders in the wake of the ‘second wave’ of COVID-19 spread. When the salons were locked a few months during the same period last year, the hairdressers, having lost their livelihood, suffered a lot to feed their families. The relief of Rs. 2,000 per family announced by the Government was accessible only to a few. “We were starving, along with our children, after the sudden closure of the salons. Plight of the hairdressers’ families, which had taken loans from the banks, private financial institutions and the moneylenders, was worse. Most of us could not get the relief announced by the government. Unable to bear with the situation, some of our members had committed suicide,” said Mr. Shanmugavel Murugan. He said the salons, on resuming operations after the relaxations, had kept sanitizers in their shops to clean all the instruments and the premises after engaging every customer. However, the latest announcement had reminded them of the worst situation they had to encounter just a year ago even as the hairdressers’ families were struggling to bail itself out of the situation and the loan they had availed. “The announcement has panicked our members and their families. We don’t need relief… If you can allow us to work with restrictions, it will be enough to feed our families in this difficult phase. We assure the government that we would strictly follow the COVID-19 norms while serving the public and will play our part effectively in fighting the viral infection,” Mr. Shanmugavel Murugan said. In Thoothukudi, district president of the association M. Esakkimuthu and its members staged demonstration in front of the Collectorate and submitted a petition at the Collectorate. They demanded Rs. 15,000 as relief to every hairdresser’s family if permission was not given for opening their salons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hairdressers-in-districts-seek-permission-to-serve-public/article34419757.ece

27 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Collector appeals to people to get vaccinated||The Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya on Monday appealed to residents above 45 years of age to get vaccinated. Ms. Divya told journalists that the district had recorded the highest percentage of people above 45 years of age who had been vaccinated, at 47%. She said there was evidence that people who had received both vaccine shots were less likely to contract COVID-19. “So far, people who have received both shots and who have developed full immunity have not been recorded to have contracted COVID-19. Even people who have received just a single dose are less likely to be infected, with only 10 people getting infected. These people too are not showing severe symptoms,” said the Collector. “There are enough vaccines in the district available for people to get vaccinated, with 9,000 doses available as of Monday and a further consignment arriving on Tuesday,” said Ms. Divya. After an all-time high of 85 cases were recorded in the Nilgiris in a single day on Saturday, the number of cases was decreasing each day, with 57 people testing positive so far on Monday. There were 430 active cases in the Nilgiris, with only 54 people having symptoms and 376 people being asymptomatic. In the Nilgiris, there were 110 beds with oxygen support at government hospitals. The Collector said steps were being taken to ramp up facilities to get more than 1,120 beds with oxygen support ready. “Currently, 19 patients, who tested positive, and six patients who are suspected to be infected, are under oxygen support,” she said. Ms. Divya said the district helpline number 1077, would be active round the clock, and urged people exhibiting symptoms to get tested early so that they could be treated before their symptoms got worse. Patients, who were asymptomatic and were isolating at home, could reach out to the district contact center and request further assistance at any time of the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collector-appeals-to-people-to-get-vaccinated/article34419536.ece
27 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||MP for priority to the differently abled||Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore has asked the Central government to take steps to provide COVID-19 vaccination to the differently abled at their doorstep. Besides, the government should give priority to them in vaccination irrespective of their age. In a letter written to Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Thaawarchand Gehlot, the Congress MP said the Ministry should constitute a team of experts to identify differently abled persons and take appropriate action to provide vaccination to them at their doorstep. Stating that COVID-19 infection was higher among the disabled, he pointed out that they were unable to access any immediate medication without help. “People with disabilities cannot maintain physical distance and wear masks amid the pandemic. In addition, certain categories of persons with disabilities are at greater risk of being infected,” he said. As per 2011 Census, 2.21% of the people were disabled and the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities (2006) sought to create an environment that provided equal opportunities and protection of their rights, the Congress MP added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-for-priority-to-differently-abled-persons/article34419113.ece
27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||New restrictions in place across districts||With new restrictions imposed by the State government came into force from Monday morning, it seemed like just another day for people in the western region. In Salem, groceries and pharmacies restricted public entry on their premises. Only takeaway services were allowed in tea shops and other eateries. Though restaurants were opened for takeaway services, hoteliers lamented that very a few customers turned up. Hoteliers demanded that they should be permitted at least 50% dine-in facilities. P.L. Palaniswamy, Secretary, Salem District Hotel Association, said that they are operating hotels just to keep the business running. Buses were operated as per government protocols. Following curfew imposed in Karnataka, buses services to Karnataka would be affected from Tuesday afternoon. Temples remained closed as per the State government’s guidelines. According to Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments officials, anadhanam was packed and distributed. Officials said that no permission has been granted to conduct festivals. A private school in Salem had called in students regarding class 11 admissions. Education department officials immediately instructed the school to disperse the students. Chief Education Officer T. Ganesh Moorthy said that all schools have been instructed not to invite students to school unnecessarily. Erode In Erode, temples, theatres, gyms, recreation clubs and shopping malls remained closed while only takeaway services were allowed in tea shops, restaurants and hotels. Since only takeaway service is available in tea shops and hotels, business was very poor throughout the day. A tea shop owner on Surampatti Four Road said that business was hit by over 70% as only a few preferred for parcel services. “We have stopped preparing snacks,” he added. Departmental stores, fruit stalls and groceries stores operated without air conditioning while saloons and beauty parlours in corporation limits downed their shutters. Patronage in both TNSTC and private buses continues to be poor throughout the day as more commuters opted to travel by their own vehicles to reach work place. Since temples were closed, devotees offered prayers at the entrances Since business hours at bank branches were restricted from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m..  Krishnagiri The partial lockdown passed off as a normal affair in Hosur and Krishnagiri. However, departmental stores, gyms remained closed. Vegetable and flower markets continued to draw crowds.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Commercial activities remain largely unaffected despite restrictions||The restrictions announced by the State government to control the spread of COVID-19 had a mixed impact on commercial activities in Coimbatore district on Monday. Retail outlets, except some of the large format ones, remained open and industries operated as usual. Shopping malls remained shut. Stalls at the food courts at the malls were open for takeaways ordered through mobile applications. Many large format stores that were open on Monday morning were closed in the afternoon. Trade sources said retail outlets that were more than 3,000 sq.ft should not be opened. According to the jewellers, there was no clear guideline on the type of stores that should be closed. Hence, all the jewellery outlets were opened on Monday. The jewellers appealed to the government to restrict movement of customers or timings, but to permit the shops to be functional. The supermarkets in the city were also open. “There was not much rush on Monday. If the footfall increases, we may look at regulating customer entry into the stores,” said one of the owners of a supermarket here. Bakeries, cafes, and tea stalls saw customers walking in as usual. However, hotels were closed for dining. Only parcel service was open. M. Sivakumar, secretary of Coimatore Hotel Owners’ Association, said restaurants located on highways / transit routes would not have parcel orders. Hence, these outlets would not have any business. “We need to pay the workers, bank loans, and rents. Hence, the government should look at financial package for the hotels,” he said. Bank branches were open only till 2 p.m. “If there is a rush, branches will have to regulate entry of customers,” said a banker. The Corporation’s health wing officials and flying squads went around the city to check for violations. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Hair Dressers Union petitioned the Collector seeking relaxation of the restriction imposed on them. There were 1,500 shops and the owners had no alternative means to livelihood. They appealed to the Collector to permit them to open shops from 7 a.m. to noon. The Kovai Mavatta Sunath Jama-ath Kolgai Kootamaippu (a federation of Muslim organisations) had appealed to the district administration to permit Muslims to pray at mosques. In a petition submitted on Monday, the federation said the new guideline that religious establishments should be closed had come as a shock as it was the holy month of Ramzan. They appealed to the government to allow prayers at mosques and they would comply with all COVID-19 safety protocols. Of the 293 liquor outlets run by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac) in the district, 292 functioned on Monday, said officials. But bars attached to none of the outlets operated. In Coimbatore south division, all the 135 liquor outlets were open. Of the 158 liquor outlets in north division, one located at Brookefields Mall was closed. Private bars across the district were shut. All the gyms and health clubs in the district did not function on Monday. In the Nilgiris, all bars and clubs were closed. The district administration said any recreational spaces that remained opened could be reported to the police.  (with inputs from M.

Special puja and deeparathana were held at the temple in which a limited number of people were allowed to take part. Temple Fitperson Ravichandran and Executive Officer A. Elangovan were present. The specially made garland worn by the Goddess, along with a silk vastram and doll parrot, were taken in a basket by temple authorities to Madurai. As per tradition, all three would adorn Lord Kallazhagar, who would stay at Sri Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple at Tallakulam before making the grand entry into the Vaigai river. As part of COVID-19 containment measures, authorities cancelled the Chithirai festival and the ritual would be performed at Lord Kallazhagar Temple in Azhagarkoil without the presence of devotees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/goddess-andals-garland-sent-to-adorn-lord-kallazhagar-in-madurai/article34419110.ece
27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Over 200 bars closed in Virudhunagar||A total of 147 bars attached to TASMAC retail shops and 62 FL-2 and FL-3 private bars have been indefinitely closed down following an order from the district administration in a bid to contain raising COVID-19 cases. The closure comes into effect from Monday morning though TASMAC shops and bars have remained closed since Sunday’s lockdown. According to an official, customers will not be allowed to consume liquor in all 147 bars attached to TASMAC shops, but run by private parties. The bars will be closed and neither snacks nor food will be served. Similarly, other bars attached to recreational clubs and hotels have also been closed. While bars at recreational clubs and hotels have limited seating arrangement, TASMAC shops attached with bars allow more customers than the seats available. The presence of customers for longer hours in bars, where they use furniture, cutlery and utensils used by other customers, is likely to lead to spread of the viral infection. Besides, the employees are also exposed to people coming from different places. Also, the air-conditioned halls are conducive for spread of the infection. However, a police officer says closure of bars will create new law and order problems as groups of people may start drinking in open places. “They can cause inconvenience to other residents by occupying the streets. Similarly, they can also sneak into schools and temples premises.” The State government has already banned serving of food in hotels. Only take-aways are allowed. Similarly, cinema theatres and malls have been closed and entry into temples has been prohibited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-200-bars-closed-in-virudhunagar-district/article34419111.ece

27 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Citizen support groups and others join hands to help tackle COVID-19||Several non-governmental organisations, industry associations and citizen support groups are working to help people affected by COVID-19 and the curfew in Belagavi. Some of them are well organised. Concerned citizens from various backgrounds have come together to provide assistance in different ways. They have joined online groups using social media handles. A WhatsApp group, COVID 19 Response Bgm — has been created to establish a gang plank communication system among officers and policy-makers. This group has senior officers including the Deputy Commissioner, the Superintendent of Police and officers from the Health and other departments. Government circulars and region-specific orders are circulated there, seeking immediate action and coordination between officers. The COVID-19 Citizen Response Bgm group has philanthropists, NGO members, volunteers and experts. Vivek Coelho, a disaster management expert, coordinates activities in these groups. The supply of drugs and medicine is being regulated through this group. “As of now, we are answering queries about drug shortage. Whenever we get requests for drug delivery, we ask the nearest pharmacist or officer to ensure door delivery of tablets or injections,” said Assistant Drug Controller Raghuram Nidavanda, a member of this group. Kiran Nippanikar, a hotelier and NGO member, said that they were building a network of hotels and catering services to answer calls for food supply. Belagavi has a lot of college-going students who are away from home. “We are planning to supply them cooked food either free or on no profit no loss basis,” he said. IT professional Hitesh Dharmadasani, data service provider Ajit Patil and media professional Uday Kinjwadkar have set up https://covid.allaboutbelgaum.com, a portal to share real time data on availability of beds and oxygen in hospitals. “We are seeking voluntary submission of data from hospitals. The Health Department has promised to share daily data with us. We hope to have volunteers who will call hospitals to get this data on an hourly basis,” Mr. Kinjwadkar said. The portal now has details of around 25 hospitals that provide COVID care in the city. Another initiative is the Covid Support Belgaum Group that had worked during the first wave of the epidemic too. It has some NRI doctors, NGO members and working professionals in Belagavi city. It offers online health advice from doctors for minor and mild COVID-19 symptoms, oxygen and medicine supply, diagnostics, plasma therapy, ambulance and cremation and burial services. “We have set up a round-the-clock helpline [18001022716] and centralised the availability of all our services,” said Mudassar Ternikar, a member of the group. Doctors Kumail Sayyed, Nabeel Ghadi, Nadeem Attar, Samir Naik, Maqsood Punekar, Saif Memon and NGO members Faheem Madiwale and Mudassar Ternikar are part of this group. This group works with NGOs Al Iqra, Khadeemin and Anjuman-e-Islam, all based in Belagavi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citizen-support-groups-and-others-join-hands-to-help-tackle-covid-19/article34419140.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||On the eve of lockdown, rise in demand for bus tickets to NK||Barely a few hours after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced a lockdown including travel restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19, people started thronging bus stands. While the surge in passengers was nothing compared to the exodus during the national lockdown in 2020, demand for buses to various parts of northern parts of the State such as Haveri, Kalaburagi, Ballari, Raichur, and others increased considerably on Monday evening. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), which will not be operating during the 14-day lockdown, added 500 additional buses to destinations in north Karnataka on Monday evening. Passengers were seen coming to Majestic KSRTC bus stand, lugging heavy bags. Many were accompanied by their children. People hoping to leave the city were also seen waiting for buses at various points such Yeshwantpur, Goraguntepalya and Jalahalli Cross, among others. Many said they had no option but to leave as they will not be able to work during the lockdown. “Instead of sitting idle for days, it is always better to go to our native place. My wife works as a maid and she has been asked to come only after the lockdown ends. Last year too, we went home during the lockdown and returned after a few months,” said a passenger heading to Haveri with his family. Yelahanka resident Pranesh N., who works for a private firm, said: “I am currently working from home. After the State government made an announcement about extending the curfew even during weekdays, I decided to go to my village. I will return when COVID-19 cases drop.” A senior official of the KSRTC said: “After the State government made an announcement imposing strict rules to curb the spread, footfall of passengers at terminal 2 in Majestic increased. Besides scheduled operations, we are running additional services considering the demand to various destinations in the northern part of the State. For other routes such as Mangaluru, Hassan, Shivamogga, we received moderate demand”  Private operators were quick to cash in on the government’s decision, and started fleecing passengers. Those who tried booking tickets online got a rude shock when they saw the exorbitant rates. For instance, many operators were charging as much as Rs. 3,900 for a ticket to Belagavi, Rs. 1,999 from Benglauru to Hubballi, and up to Rs. 2,000 for a trip from Bengaluru to Mangaluru.  Divisional Railway Manager of Bengaluru division Ashok Kumar Verma said there was no unusual rush at KSR–Bengaluru or other stations in the city. “Trains within the State operated at 50%-60% occupancy. However, there is demand for certain destinations in northern parts such as Howrah, Danapur and Gorakhpur. This week, we are running additional five trains to these destinations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/on-the-eve-of-lockdown-rise-in-demand-for-bus-tickets-to-nk/article34419490.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rs. 493 cr. for ‘One District, One Product’ initiative||The State government on Monday decided to implement the ‘One District, One Product’ (ODOP) policy for exploiting the potential of unorganised micro food processing units during the next five years, on an estimated cost of Rs. 493 crore. Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, the Centre will provide 60% of the allocation, while the rest will come from the State government. Briefing presspersons after a Cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the fund was aimed at making the unorganised sector more organised by offering credit, marketing of products, and technical know-how. The products in each district have been chosen on the basis of their availability and scope for marketing. Under the policy, one product has been identified in each district and entrepreneurs involved with these products will be eligible to get credit-linked capital subsidy at 35% of the project cost, with a maximum ceiling of Rs. 10 lakh per unit. The maximum credit is Rs. 30 lakh per project. A State-level committee, headed by Additional Chief Secretary and Development Commissioner, and district-level committees headed by Deputy Commissioners will be monitoring the implementation of the project. For acquiring 122 acres of the government-owned New Government Electrical Factory (NGEF) in Bengaluru, the Cabinet has decided to give Rs. 61.98 crore to the Germany-based partner company. NGEF was started in 1956 on collaboration with the German company, which holds 9.7% shares in the factory. The price of these shares is Rs. 61.98 crore. After giving the share money, the entire land of the factory will belong to the State government, Mr. Bommai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-493-cr-for-one-district-one-product-initiative/article34419311.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lockdown will bring down revenues by 80% a day: FKCCI||The fortnight-long lockdown will bring revenues down by 80% and the economy that has been seeing slight signs of recovery in the last three months will tumble again, according to trade body FKCCI. “Every day, Karnataka earns around Rs. 1,000 crore in terms of exports, local sales, GST collection, excise and other duties. Some 80% of our revenues will be lost during this lockdown,” said Perikal Sundar, president, FKCCI. A lockdown was required as it is the government’s responsibility to ensure safety and save the lives of people. But it is appalling to see top politicians in this country attending public functions and rallies without masks or complying with any social distancing protocol, he further added. Mr. Sunder said, “It is not the business community and industries spreading the virus. It is certain politicians, callous people who are attending elections rallies, weddings, social gathering or religious events, who are responsible for the virus spreading”. He wondered how lakhs of MSME workers would reach their work places when public transport and movements are restricted. “This 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. window for shopping is too little and too early in the day and therefore hardly 10% sales only may happen. The government should provide at least one additional window post noon,” he insisted. The Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (KASSIA) asked the government to allow BMTC buses to ply at least to and from industrial hubs in the State as a large percentage of factory workers rely on public transport to commute. “We assure total cooperation to the State government and will encourage all industries in the MSME sector to comply with the Covid guidelines and help the government to arrest the surge in the number of coronavirus cases and restore normalcy,” said K.B. Arasappa, president, Kassia. T.R. Parasuraman, president, BCIC said, “It is critical that all workforce communities should be vaccinated on priority to ensure industries are working without interruption. Such a move is also important to make sure our economy is not suffered again.”  It is not the business community and industries spreading the virus. It is certain politicians, callous people who are attending elections rallies, weddings, social gathering or religious events who are responsible for the virus spreading.

27 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Going global: U.N. declares 2023 International Year of Millets||The humble millets are set to go global. Karnataka’s initiative as well as the Centre’s efforts to get international recognition for these nutrient-rich crops have yielded results with the United Nations (U.N.) declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets. The U.N. General Assembly recently adopted a resolution, sponsored by India and supported by more than 70 countries, declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets. The resolution is intended to increase public awareness on the health benefits of millets and their suitability for cultivation under tough conditions marked by climate change. The adoption of the resolution elated Karnataka’s farm sector as the State, spearheaded by the then Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, had put in efforts to give a push to the idea after its experiments in organising international organic and millets trade fairs yielded encouraging results. The Centre, which was convinced about such a proposal, had played a decisive role in building consensus among the other countries. However,the initial euphoria about the resolution getting adopted is now slowly paving way for anxiety among experts in Karnataka’s farm sector, which is one of the prominent cultivators of millets. This is because of the alleged lack of preparation and plan of action, both on the part of the State and the Centre, to capitalise on the U.N.’s declaration. “The main intention behind the initiative is to help Indian millet farmers get decent revenues by capitalising on their crop getting international recognition. But they cannot get such a benefit unless we play a proactive role. The real success of observing international millet year comes only when we take measures to help our farmers reap the benefits,” said Mr. Gowda. “To do this, we must form a technical group of subject and policy experts to coordinate as well as lobby with the U.N., along with our diplomats concerned.” In fact, India must now take a lead in popularising the theme in a strong manner at the international level through various campaigns, he said. “So far, only spices and basmati rice are dominating the Indian exports. But now there is a golden opportunity to add millets to the export basket. But this can happen only if we really evolve a meticulous plan andwork accordingly,” he said. What is disappointing is that Karnataka appears to be doing nothing about this issue. There was no mention of it even in the State Budget and other forums, including the recently concluded legislature session. “The State should play a key role in at least taking up the issue with the Centre,” Mr. Gowda said. He also sought to counter the argument that 2023 was still far away. “At the international level and on forums like the U.N., the calendar of events is drawn and finalised at least an year in advance. We are bound to lose the opportunity if we keep quiet now.” Three dimensions T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, agricultural economist and former chairman of Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission, observed that millets have three different dimensions of climate, nutrition, and cultural quotient. “This is because they are climate-resilient and suit dryland farming. Similarly, they have high nutritional value. They are also related to culture since they are an integral part of food habits,” he said. Apart from holding an international campaign, there was a dire need to focus on production aspects, he said, pointing out that the area under cultivation of millets had decreased both in the State and the country. “If we need to capitalise on the opportunity of the U.N. declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets, we need to plan well to expand the area under cultivation of millets by creating awareness among growers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/going-global-un-declares-2023-international-year-of-millets/article34419318.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Time limit on essential stores will lead to overcrowding’||The government’s decision to impose a two-week lockdown from Tuesday night triggered a spate of ‘panic buying’ as people thronged to grocery stores to pick up essentials. Many argued that the “tough rules” imposed by the State for the next two weeks seem to be more restrictive than the three-week national lockdown imposed by the Union government in March 2020. While essential services were allowed to function through the day during lockdown last year, this time around, grocery stores and dairy and meat shops will be open for a narrow four-hour window from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. This will lead to overcrowding during these hours. “On Saturday and Sunday, stores were full. I went to buy tomatoes, but on seeing the crowd at my local grocery store, I decided not to buy them,” said Priya S. from Banashankari III Stage. Panic buying Given essential services won’t be available through the day, the city witnessed panic buying on Monday evening. “We saw increased footfall in our store, probably because of the announcement of a lockdown. People were buying bread, biscuits, condiments, and other groceries,” said Rajashekhar, who runs a supermarket in Vidyaranyapura. Even vegetable and fruit vendors did brisk business on Monday evening. “I purchased staples like dal, flour and rice in bulk, enough to last two weeks. This way, I won’t have to keep going to the local market every morning. The timing is also inconvenient because I start work by 7.30 a.m. Last year, I would go in the afternoon to buy fresh produce,” said Anjana. The other place that saw visibly long queues were liquor stores. Worried that the government would not allow alcohol to be sold, many queued up outside wine shops. It was later announced that they would also remain open in the morning for a few hours. “Last year during lockdown, there was a ban on sale of liquor making many habitual drinkers desperate. Since the media has been going to town over another lockdown, many queued up to replenish their stocks at home,” said Somashekhar, who runs a bar and restaurant in Yelahanka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/time-limit-on-essential-stores-will-lead-to-overcrowding/article34419495.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Hospital admission has to be based on protocol’||Health Minister K. Sudhakar said on Monday that strict directions have been given on the right of admission in hospitals to ensure bed availability to those in need. “Not just anyone who tests positive, however influential, can be admitted. It has to be based on protocol announced by our clinical team only. Today, a lot of patients with mild symptoms are admitted and those who really need treatment are in trouble because of them. Also, in some cases where the RT-PCR result is negative but they have other COVID-19 symptoms, hospitals have been told to treat it as COVID-19 syndrome and take them for treatment under SAST,” he said. He also added that 250 beds will be added in Victoria and Bowring hospitals within 10 days in addition to the makeshift hospitals with 2,500 to 3,000 beds planned equipped with ICU, high flow oxygen, and ventilators.    Apart from making it clear that those who recover or are discharged soon will be kept in step-down hospitals or CCCs to make the beds available for other patients, the nearly 90% home isolation patients will be given medical kits along with regular calls from the call centre everyday. To enhance the call centre, CII is pitching in, he said. Ravi, HOD, Department of Medicine, BMC (Victoria), who also spoke, urged people not to panic if they test positive, saying only 10% need hospitalisation. “People are panicking thinking they all need oxygen, Remdesivir. Look out for saturation. If it is less than 94, it can still be improved at home,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospital-admission-has-to-be-based-on-protocol/article34419152.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fear of job losses again as govt. asks garment units to close||Just when the garment industry, which supports close to 8 lakh employees in Karnataka, had started receiving good orders in the last few months, the State government’s order for closure is expected to hit those dependent on the industry harder. Most of the employees, who had been severely affected during the 2020 lockdown, are yet to receive their salaries for the lockdown period, and this is expected to continue during the current restrictions too. “Barring employees in a few industries, employees in most garment industries did not receive wages between March 25, 2020 and May 23, 2020. Those who reported to work on May 4 received about 50% salaries and in a few cases full salaries. However, a large section of the workforce could not join work after May 4 as there was no public transport,” Garment and Textile Workers’ Union president Jayaram said. In fact, in some cases, employees had to work and compensate for the absence during lockdown in the later months. About 6 to 8 lakh employees, mostly women, are employed in garment, textile, silk, and dyeing and printing in Karnataka, of which an estimated 4 lakh are employed in Bengaluru. The rest are employed in Mysuru, Shivamogga, Mandya, Tumakuru, and Chickballapur districts. During the 2020 lockdown, the Bengaluru garment industry contributed hugely in the production of PPE kits that was in short supply in India then. The industry had seen a high incidence of job losses in the wake of cancellation of orders from European and U.S. companies. In several cases, the companies folded up. The situation started improving since August last year, and most industries had started hiring again, Mr. Jayaram said. “I really do not know why the government closed the garment sector while allowing other manufacturing activities. Several companies are using guards between machines,” he said. However, a government source argued that the shop floor in a garment factory is crowded. “Workers sit at a gap of two to three feet. There have been spurt in cases in factories,” the source said. Meanwhile, the Karnataka Employers’ Association urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to permit operation of garment industries with 50% attendance during the period. Association president B.C. Prabhakar said that the garment industry had received good order from Europe with strict timelines. “If there is a delay, it will result in huge penalty, losses, and also employment loss. Foreign buyers may divert orders to countries such as Bangladesh,” he said. Further, he said that raw materials dispatched by suppliers are in transit, and 50% operation would help clear the materials. The suppliers, who source raw materials from cotton growers, will also be affected, he added. “Total closure can lead to people returning to their hometowns and they may not return for some time. This will put industry in further trouble,” he said in a letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fear-of-job-losses-again-as-govt-asks-garment-units-to-close/article34419154.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pvt. hospitals hit by vaccine shortage as demand rises||A well-known hospital in the city exhausted its stock of COVID-19 vaccine within a few hours of opening its doors to the public on Monday. The situation is so bad that the multi-specialty hospital is unable to cater to walk-ins and is only administering the vaccine to those who have registered. This has been a daily occurrence since the spike in cases. According to a hospital spokesperson, the demand for the vaccination had more than doubled over the past few weeks. “We have been asking for more vaccines. The authorities concerned claim there is a shortage everywhere,” said the spokesperson. Admitting to a shortage in vaccine stock, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Special Commissioner (Health) P. Rajendra Cholan told The Hindu that the vaccines are supplied to the civic body based on the average vaccinations achieved over the past three days. “We are able to achieve around 40,000 vaccinations a day. We currently have a stock of 48,000 doses. The vaccines are given to us on a daily basis, and they are then sent to different zones,” he said. Following the second wave and spurt in COVID-19 cases, however, the demand for vaccines, especially from the private medical establishments, had increased multi-fold. He said there were a total of 400 vaccination sites in the eight different zones, in primary health centres, government hospitals, and private hospitals. Nearly 400 private hospitals had registered with the BBMP to administer vaccines. “We need to give at least 100 doses to each centre. But with the increased demand, private hospitals are seeking additional doses, which we are not able to meet. Some of the big private hospitals are demanding nearly 2,000 doses a day,” he said, and added that the civic body had now urged the government to release at least 1 lakh doses a day for Bengaluru. Week’s stock The BBMP had failed to meet targets earlier due to lack of awareness and hesitance of citizens in taking the vaccines. “We had earlier given one week’s stock to the hospitals. Now, private hospitals are exhausting the stock for the day in just a couple of hours,” Mr. Cholan admitted. Many centres also ran out of Covaxin faster than Covidshief. “At a BBMP vaccination centre in Chandra Layout, people who came to get their second dose of Covaxin were turned away on Monday because health workers said there was stock of only Covishield. Many people were told about this only when their turn for registration came. Also, the authorities should provide documentary evidence of the vaccine given at least for those taking the first dose,” said Girish, 40, who took his parents to the centre for their second shot of Covidshield Senior health officials, on condition of anonymity, said that the vaccines are released based on the average vaccinations achieved over three-four days. But with the demand for extra vaccines not being catered to, the BBMP has not been able to increase the daily average. “Unless additional doses are allotted to the BBMP, the daily average will not increase. The daily average should not be the criteria for vaccine release any more, given the demand from private hospitals,” a senior official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pvt-hospitals-hit-by-vaccine-shortage-as-demand-rises/article34419149.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kannada producer Ramu succumbs to COVID-19||Ramu, Kannada film producer, succumbed to COVID-19 in the city on Monday. He was 52. He is survived by his actor-wife, Malashri, and two children. Mr. Ramu’s rise in the film industry is one from rags to riches, when he started out as an office boy at a film production firm in Gandhinagar, the hub of Kannada film industry in the city. In 1993, he produced an action thriller, Golibar , which was a super hit. His second film Lockup Death earned him the epithet ‘Koti’ Ramu, as it was one of the first Kannada films produced on a budget of over Rs. 1 crore, which also went on to be a blockbuster, establishing him as a leading producer of Kannada cinema with a penchant for action thrillers. He then went on to marry Ms. Malashri, a leading Kannada actor. In a career spanning nearly three decades, he produced 39 films, including a few starring his wife. He, however, suffered losses over the last decade and was mired in financial issues, sources close to the family said. Mr. Ramu was diagnosed with COVID-19 a week ago and had isolated himself at home. He was rushed to a hospital three days ago when his health started deteriorating.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kannada-producer-ramu-succumbs-to-covid-19/article34419159.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP gets BMTC help for ambulance management||To optimise the usage of available ambulances and ensure that citizens are not left wanting when in need of the service, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has sought the help of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). Twelve officials from BMTC with experience in fleet management have been deputed in BBMP to manage the ambulance fleet. Of the 12, one official is deputed to each of the eight zones, while the remaining four are stationed in the head office, monitoring and supervising the operations in the zones. Nagendra Naik, nodal officer for ambulances and hearses, told The Hindu that there was a total of 468 ambulances with the BBMP currently. The civic body had fitted all these vehicles with GPS trackers. “The BMTC officials have the experience of fleet management. The objective is to ensure there is no delay in the ambulances reaching the needy in time,” he and added that the officials have been helping out for the past three days now. Explaining the procedure of allotment of ambulances, a senior official said that the ambulance drivers get messages through the Transfer Dynamic App. They then pick up the patients and shift them either to the hospital assigned or COVID care centres. Similar procedure is followed for hearses. The vehicles are sent following calls made to the special control room established for the same. There were a total of 49 hearses available with the BBMP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-gets-bmtc-help-for-ambulance-management/article34419466.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hoysala police rescue abducted businessman||A patrolling Hoysala police team rescued a businessman who had been abducted by a rowdy sheeter at Hennur on Saturday night. The victim, Irfan Ahmed, from Thanisandra, runs a packing material firm and had been arrested and jailed for 60 days over non-payment of commercial taxes. He was released in January. “During his time in Parappana Agrahara, he met the accused, Mansoor, rowdy sheeter from Shivaji Nagar who shared the barrack with him. On Saturday, while Irfan was returning from evening prayers from a mosque near his house, Mansoor confronted him in an autorickshaw and asked him to spare Rs. 1,000 to pay the driver,” said a police officer. Irfan gave him the money. A few minutes later, Mansoor called Irfan on his mobile phone and set up a meeting at a local shop. The duo bought some cold drinks and sat in the same auto. “While Irfan was having the drink, Mansoor told Irfan that he had a lot of pending cases against him and the police were on the lookout for him. He asked Irfan to give him Rs. 2 lakh and his car. The victim refused stating he did not have that much money and the car belonged to his brother,” the sfficer said. In response, Mansoor began physically attacking Irfan and asked the autorickshaw driver to start driving. He tortured the businessman in the moving autorickshaw, and forced him to give his ATM card pin details, which he used to withdraw Rs. 14,000. During the ride, Mansoor forced Irfan to call his brother Ameen Ahmed for the money and the car, and set up a meeting at Ashwath Nagar. However, while they were waiting for the brother, the hoysala police became suspicious when they saw Irfan’s condition. His face was swollen and his shirt stained with blood. They asked the driver why he had parked the vehicle at an isolated location. “Mansoor told the driver to drive away, but the police gave chase. The auto got stuck in slush and the police caught up with them,” said the police officer. They arrested Mansoor and the auto driver.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hoysala-police-rescue-abducted-businessman/article34419491.ece

27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC relief for elderly woman who served govt. for 25 years||A 72-year-old woman, who served the State government on a temporary basis for 25 years, has got relief from the High Court of Karnataka 14 years after she retired from service on attaining the age of superannuation. The court has directed the State government to regularise the services of G.P. Sarojamma, a native of Lingsugur taluk in Raichur district, with retrospective effect from 1992 and to pay her all the retirement benefits, including pension. The court, however, said that the government cannot now be mulcted with payment of back wages. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing a petition filed in 2011 by Ms. Sarojamma seeking directions to regularise her service and pay her all the retirement benefits. She was initially appointed to the Taluk Development Board, Sindhanur, in 1982 and subsequently deputed to the taluk panchayat and later to the Social Welfare Department. She retired on attaining the age of 58, the then age of superannuation, on January 1, 2007. The court observed that the petitioner was entitled to regularisation of her services, but it was not done even after taking her service for 25 years even as the services of scores of people were regularised, similarly situated in terms the apex court’s judgment in Umadevi’s case. The court also said that after taking the service of the petitioner for 25 long years without interruption and without any intervention of judicial fora, “the action of the State in not paying the petitioner even a pennyon her retirement would not behove the status of the respondent being a model employer”. ‘ Exploitation’  “The action of the State in extracting employment from the petitioner, not considering her case for regularisation, and retiring her without a penny would amount to exploitation of human labour at the hands of the State, which can never be countenanced,” the court observed while directing the government to regularise her service with effect from 1992, when she completed 10 years as a temporary employee. The court also directed the government to calculate her terminal benefits on the basis of the applicable pay scale to similarly situated employees with effect from March 1992, and pay the terminal benefits within a period of four months.  The HC has directed the State government to regularise the services of G.P. Sarojamma, of Raichur district, with retrospective effect from 1992 and to pay her retirement benefits, including pension||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-relief-for-elderly-woman-who-served-govt-for-25-years/article34419315.ece
27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State govt. to file SLP on dues to MML||The Cabinet on Monday decided to file aSpecial Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court seeking dues of Rs. 1,172.79 crore to Mysore Minerals Ltd. (MML) from JSW Steel Ltd. MML and JSW Steel have been fighting a legal battle over an alleged breach of the MoU existing between them since 2012. In another major decision, the Cabinet decided to execute lease-cum-sale agreement for 3,667 acres with JSW Steel in Toranagal of Sandur taluk in Ballari district. The controversy related to allotment of land had arisen when the previous coalition government, led by H.D. Kumaraswamy, in May 2019 decided to execute an absolute sale deed in favour of JSW Steel, which operates the 12-million-tonne steel plant in Toranagal, saying that the firm had fulfilled all the commitments under the lease-cum-sale agreement. The JD(S)-BJP coalition government, also headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy in 2006-07, had executed the lease-cum-sale agreement with JSW Steel. Opposition Present Minister in the BJP government, Anand Singh, had quit the Congress and resigned from the Assembly in 2019 opposing the Kumaraswamy government’s decision to sell as much as 3,667.31 acres to JSW Steel. In 2019, both the BJP and the Congress had opposed the absolute sale of lands to the steel giant and sought revocation of the decision. Congress MLA H.K. Patil had flagged the issue first when the Kumaraswamy government decided on absolute sale of land. Briefing presspersons on the Cabinet’s decisions on Monday, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the Advocate General has been asked to file the SLP before the Supreme Court. The BJP government had set up asub-committee to look into the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-to-file-slp-on-dues-to-mml/article34419316.ece

27 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two private labs sealed||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has issued show-cause notices to four private laboratories, besides sealing two as they had failed to upload RT-PCR test results on the ICMR portal on time. This, despite the civic body directing them to upload the results within 24 hours. The long wait is not only a source of anxiety for citizens at a time when Bengaluru is tackling an unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases, but is also resulting in people losing precious time seeking treatment. The delay in uploading the RT-PCR test results on the ICMR portal is affecting the generation of BU number by the civic body, said officials. Hospitals require a BU number to admit patients. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta acknowledged that they have been receiving complaints regarding delay in BU-code generation due to COVID-19 test results not being uploaded on the ICMR portal by a few labs. The KPME registration of Medall Laboratory, Aarthi Scans and Labs, RV Metropolis laboratory, and BGS Global Medical College lab has been suspended with immediate effect and the issue has been referred to ICMR to revoke the approval for COVID-19 testing in these labs. These labs have been given show-cause notice and asked to provide an explanation within 48 hours as well, said Mr. Gupta. Pvt. hospitals under fire The BBMP is also actively monitoring hospitals. Over the last 10 days, it has filed police complaints against the top management of two well-known hospitals. Based on a complaint, the police have booked six people from Apollo Hospital on Bannerghatta Road under the Disaster Management Act for allegedly manipulating the data of COVID-19 patients. Nagendra Kumar S., medical officer, Bommanahalli zone, who conducted a surprise inspection, unearthed a racket where the hospital was denying admission to new patients by updating the SAST portal to show that beds were booked even after recovered patients had been discharged. During the inspection, Mr. Kumar found that bed availability data had been manipulated in three instances. A 71-year-old patient who was admitted on April 14, was discharged on April 20. However, the records on the portal showed the discharge date as April 24. In another case, a 79-year-old patient referred by BBMP succumbed to COVID-19 on April 20. The hospital charged the family to Rs. 2.4 lakh and continued to show him as admitted. A third patient was discharged on April 22, but was shown as admitted on April 25. The Puttenahalli police on Sunday registered an FIR against senior hospital officials for cheating and also under sections of the Disaster Management Act. “We will issue a notice to the hospital seeking an explanation. Based on the investigation, legal action will be taken,” said a senior police official. In another similar case, the police last week registered an FIR against Fortis Hospital on Bannerghatta Road under the Disaster Management Act and also under section 304(a), death due to negligence and section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), of IPC. BBMP officials said the hospital had violated guidelines by allocating only 46 beds against the actual 169 beds to the civic body. “As per the complaint, on April 20, a patient was taken to the hospital on the recommendation from the BBMP. The hospital refused admission, citing non-availability of beds. Due to this, treatment for the patient at the critical three hours was delayed following which he succumbed by 6 p.m,” said the BBMP in the complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-private-labs-sealed/article34419321.ece

27 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Queues grow outside vaccination centres||Following an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths, the number of people standing in queues outside vaccination centres has gone up. The Department of Health and Family Welfare is struggling hard to manage the supply of vaccine to the centres. There were long queues at HIMS in Hassan and other centres on Monday morning. Staff at the city primary health centre located at Beerenahalli Kere Extension had issued 100 tokens to those in the queue early. Many were asked to come on Tuesday. However, till 10.30 a.m. the vaccine stock had not reached the centre. Many aged people were in queues at the centre at HIMS, with no clue when they would get vaccinated. There were separate queues for Covaxin and Covishield. However, with no one to guide the public, the people who got Covishield in the first dose were standing in the queue for Covaxin. “Can’t the department depute one person to guide us,” asked a senior citizen. Moreover, people hardly maintained social distance at the centres. Some approached private hospitals to get vaccinated against payment. However, the private hospitals too had no stock. District Health Officer K.M. Sathish Kumar told the media that there was a delay in the supply as the demand for the vaccine had gone up. “The vaccination drive was hit in some centres due to the delay in supply. However, the supply will be normal by Tuesday,” he said.  New cases As many as 10 people died of COVID-19 in Hassan on Monday, taking the tally to 536. Besides, 738 new cases were reported in the district. With this, the total number of cases rose to 36,360. Of them, 30,926 have recovered and 4,898 are under treatment. The number of people in ICUs is 70. Curfew violations The Revenue Department staff and the police penalised those violating the night and weekend curfew guidelines. More than 200 vehicles were seized during the last weekend curfew in the district. Arkalgud tahsildar Renukumar slapped a fine of Rs. 100 on a bride getting married in a choultry without a face mask. He also ordered closure of a marriage hall in Arkalgud for allowing more than 50 people against the guideline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/queues-grow-outside-vaccination-centres/article34419287.ece

27 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||425 more beds with oxygen in Hubballi-Dharwad||In addition to the 2,000 beds with oxygen supply to be made available in Dharwad district, the district administration has initiated the process of making available 425 beds with oxygen supply at Mother and Child Hospitals in Dharwad and in Hubballi. On Monday, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi inspected the progress of work at Mother and Child Hospital which is under construction on Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) premises in Hubballi. The hospital is being built at a cost of Rs. 20 crore and already, oxygen supply pipelines have been got ready for the wards in the basement, ground and first floors of the hospital. And, it has been planned to make the hospital available for emergency use for COVID-19 patients by providing fire and safety measures, electricity and water supply. After going around the hospital, the Minister asked the contractor to complete the work on basic amenities by May 1 and make the hospital available for emergency use. Later, speaking to presspersons, Mr. Joshi said that hospitals in Hubballi and Dharwad were sanctioned under National Urban Health Scheme in 2017. “While the hospital on KIMS premises is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 20 crore, a similar hospital will come up in Dharwad at a cost of Rs. 26 crore. The Dharwad district administration has taken steps to set up a temporary COVID-19 hospital,” he said. On the availability of medical oxygen, the Minister said that the Union government has allocated 802 tonnes of medical oxygen and steps have been taken for its supply. “Of this allocation, around 90% is produced within the State and supplied. The State government has requested for supply of the remaining allocation from within the State. The Centre is extending all necessary cooperation and supplied 1.22 lakh vials of Remedisvir injection,” he said. To a query, Mr. Joshi said that funds have been released from PM Cares Fund for setting up oxygen plants and the State governments should take interest in getting the plants established at the earliest. Oxygen plants could be set up within a month and once commissioned, these plans would be able to provide oxygen support to 60 patients, he said. Nothing wrong The Union Minister said that there was nothing wrong in paying for vaccine by those who could afford it. He said that already, the Union government has given free vaccine to COVID warriors, frontline workers, senior citizens and those aged above 45 years with co-morbidities. The remaining inoculation drive would be conducted by the State government in partnership with the Union government, he said. The Union Minister also appealed to the people to adhere to the COVID-19 protocol as the mutant virus was spreading at a fast pace. The Union government would distribute foodgrains to the needy for two months and people should impose self-curfew to save their own lives, he said. Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil, KIMS Director Ramalingappa Antaratani and others were present. Subsequently, Mr. Joshi, along with his wife Jyothi, took the second dose of Covishield vaccine and appealed to people to get themselves inoculated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/425-more-beds-with-oxygen-in-hubballi-dharwad/article34419143.ece
27 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Tolanakere works to be completed in four months||The Tolanakere (tank) development works taken up under the Smart City Scheme will be completed and dedicated to the public in the next four months, while the development work on Unkal Lake is expected to take 18 months. Speaking to presspersons after visiting both the water bodies on Monday, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi said that as per the directions given during Smart City Scheme review meetings, sewage entering the water bodies is being plugged. “A sewage treatment plant has been set up near Tolanakere and every day, 10 lakh litres of treated water is being let into the lake. Water will be cleaned completely in the coming days. Although the lake was developed earlier, lack of maintenance has resulted in damage to several amenities. But this time, a five-year maintenance clause has been included in the contract,” he said. Mr. Joshi said that a Smart City committee would be set up for maintenance of parks and recreation facilities in the twin cities. The revenue generated from entry fee and other activities would be utilised for maintenance of the parks and the lake-parks, he said. He was accompanied by MLA Arvind Bellad and others. Earlier, he visited Unkal Lake Park and sought details from the officials on development work which has been taken up at a total cost of Rs. 42 crore. He said that the idea was to transform Unkal Lake Park into a tourist destination. “For the purpose, the cleaning of the lake is being taken up. Beautification works will follow and also a children’s park will come up,” he said. Aeration Managing Director of Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Scheme Limited (HDSCL) Shakeel Ahmed said that in the first phase, works on cleaning and improving the quality of the lake water had been taken up. “Sewage is entering the lake from four sides and all these points are being plugged in the first place. To improve the quality of the water, aerators and raptors have been installed. The water quality will improve slowly,” he said. He said that in the second phase, the plan was to develop the lake park into a Bio Diversity Park. “In the second phase, the whole lake, which is spread over 270 acres of land, will be fenced. We will have a five-kilometre-long fencing. There will be a walking track, proper illumination apart from other amenities,” he said. Mr. Shakeel Ahmed said that on the Western side of the lake, nearly 250 species of birds inhabited and they wanted to convert that area into a sort of bird sanctuary. “We plan to have an arrangement for watching birds and there will also be a view point,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tolanakere-works-to-be-completed-in-four-months/article34419145.ece

27 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Shastri Circle Flyover thrown open to traffic||The Shastri Circle Flyover on the National Highway 66 in Kundapur town of Udupi district has been thrown open to traffic. The National Highways Authority of India (NHA) began work on it a decade ago. On Sunday evening, the NHAI started allowing vehicles on the flyover without any formal inaugural function. With this, a long wait of the people has come to an end. The flyover was part of the four-lane project of the highway from Kundapur to Talapady in Dakshina Kannada. The deadline for completing the flyover was May 2020 but work at the project site came to a standstill due to the nationwide lockdown. Several organisations had held protests seeking early completion of the flyover work. The Rashtreeya Heddari Horata Samithi, Kundapur, has said that the responsibility of the NHAI does not stop at readying the flyover, but the service roads in the town needs to be completed at the earliest. At a meeting in Kundapur last week, the samithi resolved to invite Udupi Deputy Commissioner and officials of the NHAI to inspect the service roads of the highway passing through the town so as to address their concern about shoulder drains, median openings and other issues. According to samithi convener Kenchanoor Somashekhar Shetty, KSRTC buses coming from Udupi have to take travel an extra 2 km to reach the bus stand located on the right hand side of the highway. They have to travel till Sangam Circle and take a U turn there to reach the bus stand. Again, they have to use the carriageway towards Udupi, take a U turn beneath Shastri Circle flyover to go towards Byndoor and beyond, he said. Mr. Shetty said that there was no proper rainwater drainage facility all along the service roads on both the sides. NHAI Concessionaire Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd. has not completed work on service roads and drainages throughout the project highway — from Talapady to Kundapur — and similar haphazard work is being repeated in Kundapur town too. Kishore Kumar from the samithi said that initially, only a vehicular underpass was proposed at Shastri Circle and following protests, it was changed to a flyover after three years. The inordinate delay in completing the flyover and related infrastructure work was solely due to the indifferent attitude of people, their representatives and the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shastri-circle-flyover-thrown-open-to-traffic/article34419662.ece
27 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Ivan D’souza asks State government to improve health infrastructure||While condemning the State government’s action of imposing weekend and day curfew, All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary Ivan D’Souza on Monday asked the government to focus on strengthening health facilities for treating the increasing number of COVID-19 patients. Talking to reporters here, Mr. D’Souza said that instead of addressing the need for oxygen and beds for COVID-19 patients the State government has announced weekend curfew, “partial lockdown” and restricting the number of people attending marriages and funerals. “There is a dire need to increase beds and make other arrangements for COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, the State government and the MLAs are not addressing these pressing issues,” he said. “Oxygen and ICU beds in three major private hospitals in Mangaluru are full. There is an urgent need to increase the number of oxygen and ICU beds in Mangaluru,” he said. Dakshina Kannada is reporting around 500 new cases every day for the last few days and there are only 300 ICU beds and 274 oxygen beds. The district administration should take steps to arrange for about 5,000 ICU and oxygen beds in the district. The State government should release a White Paper on the plan of action taken to tackle the surge in COVID-19. The Union government should shelve the proposed expansion of Bengaluru Metro at Rs. 20,000 crore and the proposed purchase of aircraft for Prime Minister at an estimated cost of Rs. 8,500 crore. This amount should be used to give free vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ivan-dsouza-asks-state-government-to-improve-health-infrastructure/article34419666.ece
27 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Oxygen plant to be set up on Wenlock Hospital premises||An oxygen production plant will be set up on the premises of the Government Wenlock Hospital here within the next 50 days, according to Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath. A statement from the MLA said here on Monday that the plant will produce oxygen in huge quantities. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and the MLA held a meeting with oxygen suppliers, Indian Medical Association authorities and other officials to discuss issues related to oxygen supply and the status of supply in private and government hospitals.

27 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||DYFI condemns State government decision||The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) has condemned the two-week-long curfew imposed by the State government. DYFI State president Muneer Katipalla said in a release here on Monday that instead, the government should take tough safety measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The government should take alternative safety measures by increasing medical facilities. It should have taken adequate precautionary measures such as supply of enough oxygen and arranging for more beds in hospitals. It has now imposed curfew to cover up its lapses in taking precautionary measures in advance. The government has imposed the curfew as in an anarchy, the DYFI said. Mr. Katipalla said that the government’s irresponsibility and laziness have resulted in the spike in COVID-19 cases. It did not take suggestions given by experts seriously. The government did not learn lessons from the spread of COVID-19 last year. The DYFI said that the mafia of pharmaceutical companies and private hospitals are exploiting COVID-19 patients. It is due to the irresponsibility of the government. The government should control private hospitals and it should take steps to provide free treatment to all COVID-19 patients. It should take immediate steps for the supply of oxygen and arrange for beds in hospitals. Mr. Katipalla said that the curfew will only increase unemployment and economic instability. The life of the common people will be in jeopardy. It will push small traders and workers in the unorganised sector into deprivations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dyfi-condemns-state-government-decision/article34419657.ece

Mr. Harish and Mr. Vijaykumar, who are attached to the Mangaluru Rural Police Station, were on patrolling duty during the weekend curfew on Saturday night. At around 1.30 a.m. on Sunday, they saw Siddiq, his pregnant wife and two of their family members, all from Guruvanayakere, stranded at Yashashwini Hall near Arkula Gate after their car in which were coming to the city broke down. “The pregnant woman was in pain and her three family members were in tension without finding any help,” said Mr. Harish. He and Mr. Vijaykumar asked the pregnant woman and her family members to rest in the patrolling vehicle. “We passed on information to the control room and took them to the private hospital at Kuntikana Junction. We are happy to see that the woman gave safe birth to a baby,” said Mr. Harish. Appreciating the two policemen, Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that the two, instead of waiting for an ambulance, quickly shifted the pregnant woman to hospital. “The safe delivery of the child brings so much joy,” he said and showed the picture of the newborn to reporters on Monday.

27 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||No shortage of oxygenated beds in Mysuru: Deputy Commissioner||Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri on Monday said there is no shortage of oxygenated hospital beds in the district, but appealed to the mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients not to occupy the beds in hospitals out of anxiety. In a Facebook Live programme, Ms. Sindhuri said the second wave of COVID-19, which started in the second week of April, had resulted in the district reporting around 700 to 800 cases every day against the less than 100 cases that were reported during March this year. “The surge has been steep and sudden,” she remarked. Expressing concern over mildly symptomatic patients occupying hospital beds out of anxiety, Ms. Sindhuri said hospitalisation is necessary only for severely sick COVID-19 patients with breathing difficulties. “In 90 to 95% of cases, patients will recover with home isolation and treatment. Essential drugs will be prescribed and are available in the market,” she said, while adding that the patients should go to the hospital only if their oxygen saturation level dips below 94. If hospitals beds are blocked by mildly symptomatic patients, the severely sick patients with breathing difficulties will be denied hospitalisation and necessary medication, she bemoaned. She cited the examples of young COVID-19 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Care Centre at KSOU Academic Building in Mandakalli, that can accommodate 650 patients on general beds, seeking oxygenated beds even though their oxygen saturation level was 99. As per a death audit in the district, Ms. Sindhuri said about 80 to 85% of the dead were patients above 60 with co-morbidities. However, there have also been instances of younger people dying, she added.  The district had about 7,000 hospital beds including 3,000 in the private sector. The 200-bed trauma care centre started three days ago had about 60 patients, besides there were 150 beds available in K.R. Hospital. The district administration has requested the State government for an additional 700 oxygenated beds, expected to be made available in about 7 to 10 days, she said. Super speciality hospital Already, the district administration had written to the Principal Secretary, Medical Education Department, seeking approval for operationalising a super speciality hospital with 250 beds (oxygen) and 50 oxygen ICU beds in the Stone Building, besides adding another 300 beds - 250 oxygenated beds and 50 oxygen ICU beds – to the existing 200 beds at the Trauma Care Centre, making it a 500-bedded facility. Also, permission has been sought to start a 100 oxygenated bed facility at PKTB. Oxygen requirement Mysuru’s oxygen requirement, which was 12 metric tonnes per day, has now risen to 17 metric tonnes. It has been anticipated that the daily oxygen requirement will go upto 22 to 25 metric tonnes per day in the coming days and the district administration has made arrangements for the same, she said. However, she said the district was facing a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators and added that the government has been urged to ramp up ventilator facilities for the district.  COVID-19 helpline The district administration has opened a COVID-19 helpline for the district – 0821-2424111. The helpline will be manned by ten persons, who will be available 24x7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-shortage-of-oxygenated-beds-in-mysuru-deputy-commissioner/article34419290.ece
27 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Canal work: Activist alleges scam||Sand and gravel extraction from a village not existing on the map, presentation of bills for repairs not required or carried out, and the claiming of funds by showing a completion report within three days of issuance of work order... These are some of the allegations that find mention in a two-volume file of 570 pages submitted to the Lokayukta and the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) by an activist belonging to the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha. Though the complaint was filed in March and there are allegations of fraud to the tune of crores of rupees, the activist, Nage Gowda, says the authorities were yet to take cognisance of it or initiate any action. He has also drawn the attention of the Governor, the Chief Secretary, and other officials in the bureaucracy to what he suspects to be a scam. “I have lodged complaints with the departments concerned, the Lokayukta, the ACB, Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd., and the Chief Secretary of the State along with documentary evidence,” says Mr. Gowda. Citing specific cases, he says that the construction of a retaining wall and repair of the sluice canal of Hosaholalu Dodda Kere were ostensibly undertaken within a few days of a flash flood in K.R. Pet, and the value of the works was pegged at around Rs. 2.7 crore. Furnishing various documents, he says that the flooding took place on October 21, 2019, as per the records, and the repair work was approved on January 28, 2020. The estimate received technical approval on March 27, 2020, and the order was issued the same day. But what is intriguing is that the completion report pertaining to the work was issued by the contractors on March 31, 2020. Mr. Gowda has sought an inquiry into how a work of such nature could be completed within three days. In addition to this, there are seven other works pertaining to canal repair for which bills to the tune of Rs. 3.8 crore have been passed, though in reality none of them were damaged in the rains, according to Mr. Gowda. With regard to lift irrigation works in Godehosahalli, of Kikkeri taluk in Mandya, he says the cost of the project was pegged at Rs. 212 crore. Though Rs. 10.36 crore was released on December 21, 2019, to the contractor as advance payment towards mobilisation expenses, Mr. Gowda alleges that there was no proof of any work being undertaken so far. With regard to the modernisation of canals in K.R. Pet, Mr. Gowda says the authorities, while approving the work, had stated that the gravel for the canal works was extracted from Chowdalli village in the taluk. But there is no village by that name and hence an inquiry is necessary to ascertain the veracity of the claims being made by the department officials and the contractors, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/canal-work-activist-alleges-scam/article34419308.ece
27 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Surge in rural hinterland in Chamarajanagar a concern’||The impact of the second wave of COVID-19 is being felt more in rural hinterland than in urban areas in Chamarajanagar district which has raised concerns for the district administration. A review and analysis of the last few days of the COVID-19 cases indicated that Chamarajanagar district reported 2,255 cases between April 1 and 25 of which 1,697 were from the rural hinterland most of which escaped the brunt of the first outbreak last year. The urban areas in Chamarajanagar had reported only 558 cases. Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar M.R. Ravi told media persons on Monday that equally worrying was that the age group of those testing positive was below 45 years. Of the 2,255 cases reported in the last 25 days, 1,061 cases were between 21 and 40 years. The DC said youth seem to be more complacent about the pandemic as evident in their reluctance to wear masks and this was reflected in the increase in COVID-19 cases among them. He suspected that the surge in rural areas could be the graded unlocking and the series of events that were observed as in pre-pandemic days. This could be festivals, weddings and jathras, etc which enabled transmission and hence called upon people not to lower their guard. Also, only 68% of those who are testing positive are asymptomatic where as 90% used to be asymptomatic when the pandemic broke out last year. The surge in rural areas and the age group of the majority of the patients indicate that the youngsters may not be following the appropriate behaviour and hence this calls for more caution and greater vigil among the youth, said Mr. Ravi. What is significant is that the number of people above 60 years testing positive – suspected to be among the more vulnerable section of the population – was not high. Only 215 people aged above 60 had tested positive and this could be due to the vaccination coverage in this group when the drive was first rolled out in January, Mr. Ravi added. In the same period, 13 deaths were reported none of whom were vaccinated, he disclosed. “In the light of the above it is evident that vaccination was a must and hence I appeal to all above 45 years to volunteer to take the jab and protect themselves,” said Mr. Ravi. In all, there were 1,492 COVID-19 cases in Chamarajanagar district including 283 new cases that were added on Sunday and 125 people have died due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/surge-in-rural-hinterland-in-chamarajanagar-a-concern/article34419292.ece
27 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Remdesivir supply to improve by May 1||Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri on Monday said the supply of Remdesivir, being used in the treatment of COVID-19, will improve by May 1. On a Facebook Live, Ms. Sindhuri, however, added that there was no shortage of Remdesivir in government hospitals in urban and taluk centres. However, more than 100 private hospitals, which had not been registered with Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST), a separate entity under the Department of Health and Family Welfare, were not receiving Remdesivir from the government. “Only 35 out of the 140 private hospitals in the district were registered with SAST portal. Only private hospitals registered with SAST are given the medicine,” she said. Meanwhile, there were was an increase in the number of false negatives in RT-PCR test results in the second wave. She said about 15 to 20% of the results were showing negative even though the patient was infected. There had been delay in the announcement of COVID-19 test results, particularly if it was negative. About 7,000 tests were being conducted every day and the samples were sent to laboratories in Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) and CFTRI. However, two staff members at each of the laboratories had tested positive, leading to a delay in the announcement of results by four to five days particularly for negative reports. However, the positive cases were communicated as soon possible, she said, adding that the authorities had replaced the staff who had tested positive, with alternative personnel.  Vaccination Ms. Sindhuri said the progress of vaccination drive against COVID-19 in Mysuru was proceeding well with more than 57% of the eligible persons above 45 years in the district receiving a jab. In a few taluks, the achievement was between 70 to 75%, but in Mysuru city, which had 3.5 lakh people above the age of 45 years, the achievement was 47%. She appealed to the people to get vaccinated. “Now, persons between 18 and 44 years had also become eligible for the vaccine from May 1. It is free of cost in government hospitals,” she said. Seeking to allay fears about vaccination among a section of the people, Ms. Sindhuri said there ws no need for people to harbour any doubts about the vaccination as some had tested positive for COVID-19 even after two doses. Even if people test positive after receiving vaccination, she pointed out that they would not suffer any complications. “There have been absolutely no instances of death after complications of any person after receiving both the doses of vaccinations,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/remdesivir-supply-to-improve-by-may-1/article34419289.ece

27 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||No shortage of hospital beds, oxygen, says Ravi||There is no shortage of hospital beds or oxygen in Chamarajanagar and the district administration has planned to handle any surge. This was stated by Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi who said that as per experts not all who test positive for COVID-19 need to be hospitalised and only 10% may need admission. Of these, only 5 to 6% would need oxygen and hence the public should not be perturbed over the possible shortage of oxygenated beds. Calling upon the media to desist from creating fear, the DC said arrangements were also in place to handle the worst-case scenario during the current wave. He said there was a 6 kilolitre oxygen tank in Chamarajanagar. In addition, the authorities will procure additional oxygenated beds for Santhemarahalli hospital so as to meet the local requirement besides procuring oxygen concentrators.  More beds Mr. Ravi said the administration was also augmenting the total number of beds in Chamarajanagar town. The medical college and hospital will vacate two floors which will be converted to CCCs and the auditorium will have 150 beds. A similar capacity has been created by taking over a few hostels of various educational institutions that are now closed all of which will shore up the number of beds that will be available in the district. Given the current rate of increase of the patients the peak demand has been pegged at around 970 to 1,000 beds and the district is preparing for it, said Mr. Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-shortage-of-hospital-beds-oxygen-says-ravi/article34419288.ece

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Fewer beds given this time compared to first wave: Sudhakar||As stories of the battle to find beds and oxygen continue, the State government has accused private hospitals of giving fewer beds under the government quota in the more severe second wave compared to the first wave. This, even as the government ordered private healthcare facilities to reserve 75% of beds for COVID-19 patients under the government quota. Health Minister K. Sudhakar, who chaired a meeting with private hospitals here on Monday, said though the pandemic has reached a serious stage now, private hospitals have so far only given around 3,500 beds to the government quota, compared to the 4,500 beds given last year during the peak of the first wave. He added that some hospitals had not given beds even under the 50% quota. “Experts say this is the beginning of the curve. That’s why today, the Cabinet decided on curbs. Last year, during the peak, 4,500 beds were given for government recommended COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, this year, despite discussions and the situation, patients are being turned down and private hospitals have given almost 1,000 beds fewer than last year. I agree these are subsidised rates. There may be losses. But the situation is bad,” he said. Apart from this, panic has set in, and aided by miscommunication, anyone who tests positive is rushing to the hospital, he said. “Today, we don’t have any other option but to discourage non-COVID elective procedures by two to three months. Only serious and emergency cases need to be taken in,” he added. Dr. Sudhakar also said though he was yet to discuss this with the Chief Minister, patients being admitted under the 75% quota under SAST “belong to the Karnataka government”. He also urged the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) to appoint a representative from the association for beds and oxygen as allegations were made that many are not cooperating with the Arogya Mitra. Stressing on the need for strict implementation of admission and discharge policies, he said: “When all parameters come back to normalcy, even if it just five days, patients can be shifted to COVID Care Centres or step down hospitals, which we had asked large corporate hospitals to set up. As for incentives to hospitals, I’ll discuss it with the CM,” he said. However, private healthcare representatives, who denied resistance, said unlike last year, the situation was different now as hospitals, since November, when cases began to drop, have been taking in non-COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fewer-beds-given-this-time-compared-to-first-wave-sudhakar/article34419151.ece

27 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Expo a shot in the arm for artists||More than a year after the COVID-19 pandemic crippled the art sector, the ‘Lokame Tharavadu’ contemporary art show, being held in Alappuzha across multiple heritage venues, has come as a shot of optimism to the artistic community in the State. The show curated by artist and Kochi Biennale Foundation president Bose Krishnamachari features the works of 267 artists who trace their roots to Kerala and by scale is considered to be the biggest art event to be held in India. The individual art works number well over 3,000, presenting a unique opportunity for art enthusiasts and connoisseurs to experience the richness and diversity of art practised by contemporary Malayali artists. ‘Staggering’ “It's absolutely amazing and something that should have been conceived before the Kochi biennale. ‘Lokame Tharavadu’ has a staggering number of highly talented and dedicated artists, some of them with out of the box thinking,” says Radha Gomaty, a participating artist in the show. Many of these artists, she says, are not on the gallery grid and often miss out any kind of security or standard of life that comes from the art that they make and have to keep doing other things to meet their both ends. “To learn that they continue in their dedicated pursuit of art despite these odds is something that is amazing. There might be historical, cultural reasons that contributed to this kind of flourishing number of practitioners,” says Ms. Gomaty. She also feels that the organisers have gone the extra mile to include a greater number of female artists. The ‘Lokame Tharavadu’ show features works of 56 women artists, some of them virtually unknown. T.R. Upendranath, another artist, says he was sceptical of the show initially. “But when I made a visit, my perception changed altogether. The way the works have been displayed and the efforts that have gone behind felt like magic to me. The awareness that so many artists are working in different styles was inspiring and some of the works enough to invoke a sense of jealousy,” says Upendranath, who is exhibiting a series of drawings in the show. “I am sure I feel a tinge of sadness that it's happening when the pandemic situation has again turned worse but the message of the show, ‘The World Is One Family’ seems relevant than ever,” Manoj Vyloor, a participating artist and Principal, Fine Arts College, Thiruvananthapuram. This show would create a powerful ripple and set the bar high for future growth of art in the State, he said. Strict protocols The entry to the show is governed by strict protocols including registration at the COVID-19 Jagratha portal of the State government and availing passes after uploading RT PCR Negative certificate or COVID-19 vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/expo-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-artists/article34419238.ece
27 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Eco-friendly products to replace plastic||Every year lakhs of saplings are being planted across Kerala, but it also often generates a huge volume of plastic waste. EichhoTech, a student startup based in SD College, Alappuzha has come up with a novel range of eco-friendly products made of locally available resources as a replacement for harmful plastic and PVC based nursery trays and pots. A team of researchers and students led by G. Nagendra Prabhu, Associate Professor and Principal Investigator of the Centre for Research on Aquatic Resources at SD College launched eco-friendly nursery/seed germination pots using leaves such as coconut palm leaf, leaf of jackfruit, wild jack, arecanut palm fronds as well as pulp from the harmful aquatic weed water hyacinth. Inspiration The team members say the inspiration for this innovation came from a report which appeared in The Hindu in June 2018, which had highlighted the issue of plastic waste generated by the ‘sapling planting’ activities. “Our research team had earlier developed biodegradable water hyacinth pulp-based nursery pots as part of our initiatives on value addition of aquatic weeds. The current innovation reinforces our commitment to nature conservation through a decentralised people participatory model. The idea is to utilise locally available natural materials, human resources and combine it with the traditional wisdom of our ancestors,” Mr. Prabhu says. Adopted He says the concept of using leaves of jackfruit tree for preparation of ‘cups’ or ‘baskets’ for making a traditional delicacy (Hittu, steamed idli batter in jackfruit leaf cups or baskets) of the Gowda Saraswath Brahmin Community (Konkanis) was adopted by the startup team in developing similar baskets for a different purpose altogether. “These can be produced by unskilled workers and children and has a huge market in the country and abroad due to the increased demand for green products,” Mr. Prabhu says. Anoop Kumar V., CEO, EichhoTech, says they aim to provide training on this innovation to rural communities, NGOs, students and entrepreneurs and will offer a ‘buy-back’ scheme for the products. After the launch of nursery/seed germination pots, the team is now developing bigger sapling pots for use in social forestry and similar programmes. Hareekrishna, Arya S., Nivedita Prabhu and Lakshmi K. Babu are other members of EichhoTech. They have recently secured financial assistance from the Government of Kerala under the Young Innovators Programme of Kerala Development, Innovation and Strategic Council (KDISC) for their work on the value addition of aquatic weeds like water hyacinth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/eco-friendly-products-to-replace-plastic/article34419236.ece

Based on a complaint filed by Susheela’s mother, the police arrested her husband Manjunath (25) on Monday and produced him in court which remanded him. He has been accused of assaulting his wife constantly. Koothuparamba Circle Inspector M. Sunil Kumar is investigating the case.

A resident, who were unaware of the death and got to know about it when an ambulance brought her body to the house, alerted the police. Manjunath and his relatives claimed that that Susheela had a bout of epilepsy and they had rushed her to a nearby hospital but she had died in the hospital.

Today, he is drawing adulation from across the State for donating his life savings of over Rs. 2 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) for funding the COVID-19 vaccine drive. Accepting the ‘challenge’ posed by Left-affiliated groups, seeking contribution to the fund, he donated Rs. 2 lakh from his bank account, leaving just Rs. 850 as savings. He had expressed his wish to the bank to remain anonymous, but the news spread soon. On his decision, Mr. Janardhanan said the Union government’s move to charge for the vaccination was inhuman. “I felt it was a move to defeat the Chief Minister’s promise to provide free vaccination to all,” he said. The intention was just to help those who would be severely affected if asked to shell out money for vaccine, he added. “I had a joint account with my wife in the bank. She died a year ago. I decided to donate the amount so that the fight against the pandemic will be kept alive,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-rs-2-lakh-ticket-to-many-hearts/article34419264.ece

27 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Gaps in scientific treatment of municipal solid waste revealed||Nearly 164 tonnes of municipal solid waste out of the estimated 1,199 tonnes generated daily in Ernakulam remain untreated, according to official estimates. The gaps in the scientific management of solid waste came to the fore after the Local Self-Government Department collated data submitted by local bodies as on February this year. A detailed picture of the status of municipal solid waste management was submitted before the National Green Tribunal in the case related to the compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 by States. Of the 1,199 tonnes per day of solid waste, the quantity of dry waste was 370.57 tonnes. An analysis of the quantity of waste generated showed that 592 tonnes were treated through composting and other decentralised facilities. Nearly 349 tonnes were either recovered or recycled/co-processed. As much as 93 tonnes of waste were dumped in landfills. WTE plant proposed On the measures proposed to plug the widening gap in the generation and treatment of solid waste, the authorities proposed the setting up of waste-to-energy plant of 300 tonnes per day capacity at Brahmapuram. Nearly 20 acres are available for the common treatment facility. The report also cited that panchayats and municipalities were yet to submit the data on the compost pits provided on their premises for treatment of biodegradable waste. The district has one major and four minor sites for dumping municipal solid waste. The report said the Kerala State Industrial Corporation had floated an e-tender to identify a suitable agency for the rehabilitation of municipal solid waste dumping site at Brahmapuram. The Local Self-Government Department had asked the Kochi Corporation to examine the quantity of legacy waste assessed and rate quoted by the bidder in consultation with the State Pollution Control Board. The corporation had asked the National Institute of Technology-Kozhikode to carry out a drone study to assess the actual quantity of old waste lying in heaps at Brahmapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gaps-in-scientific-treatment-of-municipal-solid-waste-revealed/article34419619.ece

27 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Second wave triggers anxiety disorders||Ever since the second wave of the pandemic hit the district, a retired teacher in her 60s from Thripunithira had been suffering from sleeplessness and gastro issues, the treatment for which has brought little respite to her. Eventually, she was found suffering from psychosomatic illness where the person develops symptoms of a disease while not actually having it. “It turned out to be a classic case of gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], cases of which have increased considerably since the resurgence of the pandemic. It is a manifestation of anxiety and stress, and the symptoms include heartburn, indigestion, lack of appetite, and sleeplessness. In severe cases, it could even lead to depression,” said V. Sudarshana Manoj, counselling psychologist. Fear of death According to her, anxiety-driven issues have surged of late, especially among aged people who constantly live in fear of death. “That they [the elderly] are restricted to their homes with little social interaction and are active on social media that is bristling with pandemic-related forwards do not help. Television channels and newspapers painting an explosive situation also trigger their anxiety,” Ms. Manoj said. Media critic Sebastian Paul felt that a clear separation had to be made between social media and conventional media. “While the former is throbbing with misinformation, the latter has by and large done a commendable job. In a pandemic situation, there needs to be a constant flow of credible and verified information, the absence of which could have disastrous consequences like what had happened during the Bengal famine. I don’t fully agree with the observation that media reporting has triggered anxiety,” he said while reminding the media to be judicious about the choice of words used in reporting. Mr. Paul added that the reportage of the pandemic would only improve as the media evolved a code on their own as it did in the eighties when the phenomenon of AIDS exploded. The media adopted a code on protecting the privacy of the infected. “Any such code should be evolved out of experience rather than imposed by the government, which could turn out to be disastrous,” he observed.

27 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Having a fruitful time during pandemic||When the pandemic-induced lockdown was declared last March, two young entrepreneurs running mango orchards at Muthalamada in Palakkad were left staring at a crisis of sorts. With the movement of their product beyond the borders no longer an option, they had to forgo their clients predominantly from Mumbai and Delhi and look for new clientèle for the highly perishable goods. Thus was born the idea of marketing it within the State with the help of social media. “We publicised our mango varieties initially through Instagram, which was done mostly as status. As we found the response encouraging, we started an Instagram page,” said Amal Eldhose, who is doing MBA. Last year, the sale was mostly confined to Ernakulam, especially Kochi city and nearby areas, since the demand was mostly from there. Orders were mostly received through WhatsApp, and the youngsters hired a truck and an employee to deliver the fruits. At times, they even personally did the delivery. Christened Lush Haven, their firm mostly deals in six varieties of mangoes – Alphonso, Imam Pasand, Banganapally, Sindhooram, Totapuri, and Nadasaala. “Quality fruit devoid of any kind of preservatives remains the main attraction of our products. That is also the reason why we were able to win regular customers,” said Amal Tom, an youngster from Pala who is now doing engineering graduation. Both had met in school in Standard 10. The duo did considerable business for a pandemic-hit year, logging sales of 4,100 kg. Buoyed by that, they have now expanded their business beyond Ernakulam to across the State, with orders already coming in from Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Kozhikode districts. They have also engaged an agency for the delivery of fruits. From being restricted to social media, they have now launched a dedicated portal, which was launched by Hibi Eden, MP. “We have now kind of reoriented our business, with focus now being within the State. Plans are also being explored to join hands with our friends in the same business,” said Mr. Eldhose. Apart from mangoes, they also deal in cardamom and pepper.

27 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Anguished expatriates rue loss of another vacation||Reshmi Rajesh chokes up with emotion every time she talks about her octogenarian father . He had suffered a stroke and was on ventilator support before making a courageous comeback. Sitting in her apartment in Abu Dhabhi, where she has been working for close to two decades, Ms. Rajesh rues not having seen her frail father and mother back in Aluva for two years now. “He hardly comes online, as he is not comfortable with it. Though my siblings are nearby, even they are staying away for fear of infecting our aged parents. He does not have anyone to talk to him, and that thought kills me,” she says. With more countries imposing travel ban on India, Malayali expatriates are staring at yet another missed trip back home. The annual vacation is the most anticipated event for most of them, and the frustration of missing it for two back-to-back years is taking its toll. Sanjay K.V., who works in Muscat, says life has been nightmarish for his wife and children who have rarely stepped out of their apartment in the last more than a year. “For our aged parents, not being able to see their grandchildren is too painful. Children are the ones suffering the worst in this locked-up life here, as they have to video-call even their friends next door, whereas back home they could have at least taken a stroll around the house,” he lamented. Takkine Francis, living in Muscat, remains quarantined after he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. “It was risky to fly back home even before the travel ban, for there was always the possibility of getting stranded there, endangering my job,” he said. Pradeesh R. Nair, an expatriate in Muscat, rings his aged mother back home every day, as she is only getting used to video calls. “She had to be taken to hospital out of anxiety during the first wave of the pandemic last year, and I could not make it there, as the lockdown was in place. As things stand now, it is anybody’s guess when I will be able to meet her again,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/anguished-expatriates-rue-loss-of-another-vacation/article34419621.ece
27 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Video calls being used to trap people in sleaze videos||A woman in her 30s from Kakkanad recently got a WhatsApp video call from an unknown number. She attended the call only to be shocked by the nudity on the other side. The next moment she got a video clip of that chat with her face captured along with the obscenity with an extortion bid, to stop the video from being sent to her friends on social media. To prove the point, a screenshot of the image shared with one of her friends was also sent to her. Panic-stricken, she approached a police officer who advised her not to pay the money and to report it to the cyber cell. The practice of trapping unsuspecting victims in such sleaze videos to extort money has become so widespread and indiscriminate that even a police officer received such a video call. Being aware of the danger, he masked the camera before attending the call. “Most victims choose to remain mum the first time fearing humiliation and seek help only when threatened repeatedly though even then they insist on not lodging a complaint. The modus operandi is rather simple as the caller trains the camera on some nude video on a computer screen when the call gets connected and uses the interim before a shocked victim regains composure and reacts to capture the video or image, which is then used for extortion,” said cyber police sources. Nandakishore Harikumar, who runs a cybersecurity start-up and is actively associated with the Kerala Cyberdome, said that even lodging a formal complaint would be of little help as the perpetrator would be in some other State where the police would be hardly interested in pursuing the case even if the Kerala police were to diligently follow it up. He said there were many variants of the same fraud like the perpetrators forging social media accounts and inviting women in the friends’ list of the original account holder to video-call them. “There is no solution other than not attending video calls from unknown numbers. Falling for extortion bids would be a folly as there would be no end to it. For instance, a law professional paid Rs. 1.50 lakh in several lots under duress. It all boils down to data privacy and framing a law to ensure it. Since people leave digital footprints everywhere, it is easy for unscrupulous elements to access data and exploit it,” said Mr. Harikumar.

27 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||A heart-stopping race for pulse oximeters||Pulse oximeters used for measuring blood oxygen level, otherwise superfluous equipment considered surplus to the needs of households and were mostly used by health care facilities alone, are flying off the racks of medical shops that there is now a shortage of the machines thanks to the panic triggered by the sweeping second wave of the pandemic. The demand for the equipment had died down considerably following the COVID-19 breakout last year. Not anticipating an even intense resurgence of the pandemic, medical shops and surgical equipment dealers stocked thin, and what little stock was available dried up in no time. “The supply of pulse oximeters to the State mostly came from Delhi and Maharashtra and because of the raging pandemic and the rising demand there, the supply has dried up. “Our members have reported the shortage, and we are now looking at arranging them from alternative sources like Bengaluru. The equipment is not always in demand, and some who stocked it considering the demand during the first wave had to even dispose them at a loss later on,” said A.N. Mohan, State president, All Kerala Chemists and Druggists Association. Costly equipment The equipment with a price ranging from Rs. 900 to Rs. 10,000, depending on the quality and brand, has also witnessed a surge in price owing to the supply shortfall. It is easy to operate by attaching it to a finger to measure the blood oxygen rate. Rajan Pillai, State secretary, All Kerala Scientific and Surgical Dealers Association, said the demand for the mostly imported equipment had soared with the corresponding surge in infections and the consequent rise in home isolation rate. “The equipment came in handy with the health machinery recommending home isolation and encouraging hospitalisation only if necessary. It helps check the blood oxygen level and thus enables people to approach the health authorities when the level drops beyond the acceptable threshold,” he said. The association exuded confidence in replenishing the stock by next week. Manoj Gopinath, senior consultant (medicine) at the Ernakulam General Hospital, said the pulse oximeter was recommended for those with mild symptoms of COVID-19 and those having mild symptoms with co-morbidities. “The oxygen level between 98 and 100 is considered normal. At 95, medical help should be sought, and if the level drops below 90, then it is alarming, and the person should be immediately hospitalised,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pulse-oximeters-in-short-supply-as-pandemic-rages/article34419632.ece
27 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Dose shortage, portal glitch hit vaccination||The COVID-19 vaccination drive in the district seems to be marred by shortage of doses and glitches on the COWIN portal. A 60-year-old who registered on Friday for the second shot of the vaccine and was allotted a slot on Monday morning at the Thrikkakara Co-operative Hospital, was asked to return without taking the jab. She was told that only a limited number of doses could be administered on the day, since stock was not available. There have been instances of repeated visits to vaccination centres increasing the anxiety of exposing oneself to the virus, and multiple attempts to reschedule bookings even when booking a slot on COWIN does not guarantee availability of vaccine at the site. Dr. M.G. Sivadas, nodal officer for vaccination, said glitches on the COWIN app might mean that slots were allotted even when vaccines were not available. Besides, the vaccination drive in the district has slowed down considering the low availability of vaccines. “We were able to administer around 10,200 doses on Monday, and we have stock of around 10,000 doses for sessions on Tuesday. Once tomorrow’s [Tuesday] sessions are over, we will have no stock left,” said Dr. Sivadas, adding that there was no clarity yet on when the district was likely to receive more doses. Since doses are not available in sufficient quantity, users might be able to register on the COWIN portal but might not be able to schedule slots and see when and where they might be able to take it, he said. Eden writes to Centre Hibi Eden, MP, has written to the Prime Minister and the Union Health Minister, requesting their urgent intervention to deal with the shortage of vaccines in the district. Considering the extent of the spread of infection in Ernakulam and the large number of cases being reported daily, additional doses should be made available immediately, according to Mr. Eden. So far, around 8,24,500 doses have been administered in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dose-shortage-portal-glitch-hit-vaccination/article34419626.ece

The control room numbers are 90723-03275, 90723-03276, and 90372-20187. In the first three days since it turned operational, the control room operating out of the civil station has clocked an average of 100 calls a day. It has successfully managed to ensure proper dissemination of information on pandemic restrictions and stave off misinformation campaigns targeting migrant workers. Fears of a potential lockdown in the wake of the new restrictions have triggered a reverse migration from the district. The control room is also facilitating medical help for those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and for the hospitalisation of infected migrants. Four languages Significantly, control room assistance is available in four languages — Assamese, Bengali, Odiya, and English — to maximise the reach. The control room has been set up under Athithi Devo Bhava, a migrant welfare project, in association with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences and an NGO working for the well-being of migrant workers.

27 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Metro union demands better accountability||Close on the heels of a High Court directive on the appointment of a key official in the human resources wing of Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) and the mounting losses being incurred by the metro, individual employees and those under the banner of Kochi Metro Employees’ Union (KMEU) have sought higher level of accountability in the agency’s functioning. There have been allegations of nepotism in many appointments made by the metro agency. Permanent employees of the metro had aired their opposition to such appointments, said an office bearer of the union. Union secretary Sibi M.M. said the appointment of the official in the HR wing must be reviewed as directed by the High Court. It was important to uphold the dignity of KMRL, he said. Decisions taken by a couple of senior officials regarding the metro and Water Metro had also attracted flak from experts. The metro agency can directly appoint personnel and need not rely on the Public Service Commission. It must be through a transparent process, and the HR wing must work as per strict norms, said sources. In many cases, officials having little commitment to the city or to the State had used Kochi metro as a stepping stone for them to get higher posts in other metro-rail firms, they added. On the opposition from a section of the metro workforce to personnel on contract being made permanent, sources said contract personnel must not be compared with empanelled workers. “With this attracting criticism, the norms were changed, including on their salary and allowances,” they said. Responding to this, KMRL sources said a decision would be taken shortly to ensure higher levels of transparency in appointments and to augment the revenue of the metro agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/metro-union-demands-better-accountability/article34419614.ece

Ltd., Erode, for the construction of the Cochin Cancer Research Centre (CCRC), Ernakulam. Justice N. Nagaresh passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by the company against the contract termination. The company contended in its petition that the prescribed period for completion of the project as per the agreement was 730 days from the date of handing over of the project site. The construction commenced on July 25, 2018, and was expected to be completed by July 23, 2020. However, several unexpected incidents, including floods and COVID-19 outbreak, led to delay in completing the project within the time period. Moreover, the failure of Inkel, a special purpose vehicle for the project funded by the Kerala State Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), clearing pending bills and resolving labour issues led to further delay, the company said. Inkel’s version Inkel refuted the allegations and contended that the petitioner had been delaying the work from the beginning and had completed only 35% of their work. The progress of the work was and its quality were found wanting. Therefore the contract was terminated. Dismissing the the petition, the court observed that the writ petition lacked in merits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-dismisses-firms-plea-against-deal-termination/article34419615.ece
27 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||KIIFB insists on 23-m width for Kochi road||The Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB) and the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) will shortly take a call on whether to widen the Thammanam-Pullepady road and extend it to M.G. Road and the NH Bypass on either side at 22 metres width as was envisaged or develop it as a 23-metre-wide corridor as per KIIFB norms. A decision on width will reflect in the detailed project report (DPR), which is expected to be readied by the project preparation unit by June. The Kochi Corporation, which initiated the road development work over two decades ago, and subsequently the PWD, which had readied plans to take over the stretch from the civic body, had drawn up plans to limit the width of the four-lane road that was envisaged to 22 metres. The KRFB, which readies infrastructure projects in accordance with KIIFB norms, took over the execution of the project earlier this year. The KIIFB had permitted the development of the 28-km Thripunithura (S.N. Junction) - Poothotta Road as a 22-metre-wide corridor, as had been envisaged by the PWD. Heavy traffic It has to be seen whether the agency will permit this relaxation for the impending road development project in the city, considering the heavy traffic that is expected once four-laning is done, official sources said. The width of the road median will have to be reduced from two metres to one metre if the road is developed as a 22-metre-wide corridor. A wider median will help accommodate elevated structures like the metro viaduct within while also augmenting the safety of motorists who wait to take U-turn by providing more space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kiifb-insists-on-23-m-width-for-kochi-road/article34419743.ece

The committee will include a senior officer from the regional office of the Central Pollution Control Board in Bengaluru, a senior officer / scientist from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, a scientist from the department of soil science and agricultural chemistry, Kerala Agricultural University, Thrissur, and a senior soil conservation officer from the Department of Soil Survey and Soil Conservation as nominated by its Director. The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member K. Satyagopal issued the directive on the case pertaining to the allegation that effluents and hazardous waste from Edayar Zinc Ltd. were responsible for the contamination of the paddy fields. The petitioner had said that the plant and machinery of the company, which is now shut, should not be allowed to be shifted before remitting its liability as per the ‘polluter pays principle’ for remediation of the affected sites. The State Pollution Control Board had fixed Rs. 47.88 crore as the share of the company towards remediation of the contaminated site and had served notice on the management in 2018-19, asking it to remit the amount. However, the company claimed that they were not the only industry functioning in the area. They had requested the court to fix the liability only on the basis of proper evidence stating that they were responsible for the pollution of the sites. The Bench has asked the expert committee to submit its report before May 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ngt-panel-to-probe-edayar-pollution/article34419622.ece

The TPR for the day stood at 19.54 %. With 286 recoveries during the day, the district currently has 18,753 active cases while 43,959 people are under surveillance. Kottayam municipality, which reported 186 cases, continued to witness a spurt in cases, followed by Puthuppally with 53 cases. Kurichy panchayat reported 50 cases, while Changanassery , Karukachal and Chirakkadavu reported 44 cases each. With the test positivity rate in 54 out of the 77 local bodies crossing the 20% mark, the health authorities in Kottayam have been on their toes to contain the spread.As per estimates, 13,822 people out of the 58,176 people who were subjected to testing from April 19 and April 25, have tested positive for the disease. The test positivity rate reported during the period was 23.34 %, as against the highest TPR of 11 % during the first wave. TPR of 56.26 % is the highest in Chembu near Vaikom , followed by Maravanthuruth (45.5%), Thalayazham (45.3 %) and Udayanapuram (41.99 %). Of the 389 people examined in Maravanthuruth, 177 were found to be infected while 150 out of 331 in Thalayazham and 262 out of 624 in Udayanapuram too were tested positive. The TPR, meanwhile, hovers between 30 and 40 % mark in as many as 10 panchayats including Arppokkara, Kumarakom , Meenadom and Pambady . The rising number of cases appears to have put the treatment capabilities of Kottayam under severe stress. For instance, the Taluk hospital in Pambady and the FLTC that functions at an engineering college campus here are fast running out of bed space. Similarly, the General Hospital in Pala reported a shortage in oxygen for the second time in a week on Monday though the issue was settled soon. When contacted, District Medical Officer Jacob Varghese said such shortages could be just a temporary phenomenon. “New oxygen supply units have been opened in Kottayam General Hospital and the Vaikom Taluk Hospital while arrangements are also in place in the hospitals at Uzhavur, Mundakkayam, Pala and Pambadi,” the official said. Alappuzha The district reported 1,183 COVID-19 cases on Monday. The new cases include 1,180 patients who contracted the disease through local contact.

As many as 1,074 persons recovered from the illness. Collector’s directive In his latest directive, District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao asked all private hospitals in the district to improve the existing treatment facilities for attending to more COVID-19 patients. He made the call while addressing an online meeting with their representatives on Monday. Mr. Rao asked hospital managements to start COVID-19 help desks to assist patients and their relatives and update the daily case details on the official COVID-19 Jagratha portal. Apart from increasing the total bed capacity, there should be separate labour rooms for COVID-19 patients, he said. The Collector also appealed to the public to strictly follow quarantine rules in the wake of the Health Department’s reports that there were many who were found roaming around the streets without waiting for test results. “Those who await their test results or are suspected of suffering from COVID-19 symptoms should strictly stay indoors,” he said. Taking stock Health Department officials said there would be an online meeting on Tuesday to review the district-level situation and adopt further preventive measures. It would be attended by State Ministers, people’s representatives and leaders of various political parties, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-reports-3251-fresh-infections/article34419183.ece
27 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Price hike of raw materials hits construction sector again||The pandemic-induced spike in prices of essential construction materials and the shortage of stock with wholesale traders have emerged as a challenge for many small and large-scale construction projects in Kozhikode district. Many housing projects, which were resumed after the first wave of the pandemic, are likely to come to a standstill again owing to the new crisis. Contractors of small-scale housing projects pointed out that the price hike had come at a time when many projects were already pending because of the shortage of labourers. Functionaries of the Confederation of Construction Industry (CCI) said the price of cement manufactured by a leading company had already increased from Rs. 390 to Rs. 460 in the State. Same is the case with steel products with a straight increase of Rs. 15 a kg, they added. According to Subair Kolakkadan, chairman, CCI, the State government is seemingly ignoring the confederation’s call for the formation of a regulatory board to monitor and control the prices of construction materials in the market. The alleged laxity on the part of a public sector cement manufacturer in making proper market intervention also led to the situation, he says. Meanwhile, some of the wholesale dealers in the city say prices of some of the essential raw materials were increased by manufacturers citing the high transportation cost in the wake of COVID-19 related regulations. Leading dealers in the city also point out that the situation was almost the same during the first wave of the pandemic. According to them, the cost would increase again with the intensified regulations on vehicular movement and functioning of shops. The shipping cost had already been hiked by many private operators citing operational hurdles and shortage of labourers, they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/price-hike-of-raw-materials-hits-construction-sector-again/article34419176.ece
27 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Cyberdome to crack down on false info on social media||The Kozhikode Police Cyberdome with the support of cyber forensic experts has started tracking the source of a number of social media profiles, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which were found propagating false information related to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken by Union and State governments to control the pandemic. Details of such accounts will be handed over to the Kozhikode Cyber Police Station for further legal action. Though one of the suspects involved in creating such a Facebook post has already been arrested, police officials confirm that stringent action is on the cards for many having bigger involvement in spreading fake information, hatred, communally inciting comments and threats. Random profile analysis is in progress under the supervision of Kozhikode cyberdome, they add. “The cyber police station within the city limits is empowered to proceed with suo motu action based on digital evidence gathered by the Cyberdome. Based on the nature of violations, there are also occasions when we hand over the cases to local police stations,” said a senior police officer attached to the Kozhikode Cyber Police Station.  As of now, the majority of the cases related to cyber offences are registered under section 120 (O) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 which is meant to penalise persons who cause nuisance through any means of communication including anonymous call, letter, emails or through a messenger. More grave sections will be added based on the nature of the social media content and the threat it creates for society. Cybercrime investigators in the city say those who like or share fake contents related to the pandemic outbreak will also be accountable for facing legal action like the creators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cyberdome-to-crack-down-on-false-info-on-social-media/article34419181.ece

Guruvayurappan, stopped the destruction of the natural ecosystem on the banks of the Sokanasini river at Chittur on Monday. Mr. Guruvayurappan and his team intervened to save a large number of trees and bushes carefully preserved for over three decades on the banks of the river.

27 April 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Dairy societies shift to solar power||Dairy cooperative societies, which play a vital role in upholding the milk production in the district, have begun to tap solar power with the support of the Dairy Development Department. Four cooperative societies have installed solar power generation system in recent weeks and have begun to supply the excess power to the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The dairy cooperative societies of Menonpara in Chittur block, Menontharissu and Madanpara in Alathur block and Akathethara in Malampuzha block have become the first beneficiaries of solar power with the government support. “They are running it successfully. It should be a model for the other dairy cooperative societies in the district as well,” said Jayasujeesh J.S., deputy director of the Dairy Development Department. He said that the department subsidised 75% of the expenses, while adding that the panels installed were capable of producing up to 55 KW power a month. Apart from office and other purposes, milk cooperative societies utilise a good amount of power for bulk cooling of milk. Most cooperative societies have been paying the KSEB up to Rs. 15,000 a month by way of power bills. “Solar power generation will not only help them save in power bills, but also make some profit through the excess power generated,” said Mr. Jayasujeesh. Top position Dairy farmers in the Palakkad district supply about three lakh litres of milk every day, which is more than one-seventh of the State’s total production. Palakkad enjoys the top position in milk production in the State. There are 330 dairy cooperative societies in the district. While 20 of them are traditional milk cooperative societies engaged in both collection and supply of milk, the remaining 310 are affiliated to the Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma). Out of the three lakh litres of milk produced in Palakkad, about 2.25 lakh litres reach Milma, while 75,000 litres flow towards local sale. Chittur block in Palakkad produces the largest share of the milk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dairy-societies-shift-to-solar-power/article34419172.ece

Joint teams of personnel from the police, the Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) and the Excise Department had been checking vehicles coming from across the border. Special Branch DySP P.C. Bijukumar said that the police had raised the guard at Walayar, Meenkashipuram, Govindapuram, Gopalapuram, Chemmanampathi, Ozhalapathi, Naduppuni, Velanthavalam, Ellappettamkovil, Mulli and Anakkatti checkposts. Thorough inspections Motorists were inspected for online registration for travel and RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 before allowing entry to the State. Those who failed to do so were given the facility to register online on the spot at the borders, while others without RT-PCR test results were instructed to go into quarantine for two weeks. The information collected through online registration would be monitored by the Health Department, which follows up those going into quarantine and ensures that they show strict compliance. Mr. Bijukumar said that station house officers of respective police stations were given the charge of the checkposts. He, however, maintained that no entry point into the State was closed. A 484-member police team led by district police chief Viswanadh R. was out on the field coordinating the COVID-19 protocol compliance in Palakkad. Among them are six DySPs, 11 inspectors, 30 sub-inspectors, 99 assistant sub-inspectors. They will be coordinating COVID-19 restrictions in 35 police station areas across the district.

Councillors across all parties will lead the measures at the local level. A 25-member volunteer force will be formed in each of the wards, to work in coordination with the ward-level monitoring committees. Volunteer force “The volunteer force is being formed as a precautionary measure for future needs. As of now, our situation is not yet comparable to the previous year’s, when community kitchens and several other systems had to be taken care of. The volunteers will be registered in an online portal and provided identity cards. They will be used for help in shifting patients to hospitals, to track events in wards, or to provide other help. In addition, we have five teachers in each ward to trace the primary contacts of each positive case and to upload in the COVID Jagratha portal,” Mayor Arya Rajendran told The Hindu . Series of meetings The Mayor, the Corporation Secretary, and Health Standing Committee Chairperson, is chairing a series of meetings with 10 councillors at a time, to collect their suggestions on various issues at the ground level. Two of these meetings were held on Monday and eight more will be held in the next two days. The suggestions will be collated and a report placed at a meeting to be chaired by the Mayor with the District Collector, District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram city), District Medical Officer, and other officials on Thursday. The public will be required to register weddings and other events in the Corporation’s portal too, in addition to the Jagratha portal. Control room The COVID-19 control room set up by the civic body for the public to reach out for any information regarding the pandemic will be expanded with more awareness on the control room numbers (0471-2377702, 2377706) being spread through zonal offices and health circle offices.

27 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Chaos at vaccination centre||It was chaos everywhere at the Jimmy George indoor stadium as large crowds jostled each other for the COVID-19 vaccine on Monday. The crowd control measures put in place by Health authorities came undone when the public violated time-slot management yet again and threw caution to the wind amid the worsening pandemic situation. By the time the police intervened, a serpentine queue had formed outside the vaccination centre. It did not take long for the situation to get out of hand with several senior citizens complaining of unease and four of them requiring immediate hospitalisation after collapsing while waiting in the queue. The searing heat and the absence of potable water on the premises only made matters worse. Despite the repeated calls made by the district administration to stick to time slots issued while booking for vaccination sessions on the Co-WIN portal, a large number of people turned up at the centre as early as 7 a.m. Making matters worse, the Health authorities had opened up 2,000 slots in place of the 600 slots that were available during the last few days. Besides, not many paid heed to the district administration’s move to confine inoculation at the Jimmy George indoor stadium to those requiring the booster (second dose) alone. While volunteers initially distributed tokens among even those who had come much ahead of their time slot, officials soon sensed danger as the crowd began to mount in quick time. While the situation appeared to go haywire, a large police posse rushed to the scene, albeit only by 11 a.m. Kowdiar native Janardhana Pillai, who along with this wife, came 10 minutes ahead of the 11 a.m.-12 p.m. slot that he had opted for, was left with little option but to return home on seeing the long queue that had built up around the stadium. “Situations as this are bound to spread the disease like wildfire. The government must ensure priority for aged people and those requiring the second dose of the vaccine while accepting bookings,” he said. Blame-game The blame-game went on with the police accusing the District Health authorities of failing to anticipate the uncontrollable situation and seeking police assistance well in advance. A senior Health official, however, claimed helplessness with the public showing utter disregard towards attempts to streamline the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chaos-reigns-supreme-at-capitals-vaccination-centre/article34419243.ece
27 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Stick to time slots: Collector||District Collector Navjot Khosa has urged the public to adhere to their time slots while arriving at the COVID-19 vaccination centres. Special arrangements have been made to inoculate everyone who have received appointments for specific days. Those arriving to receive the doses must strictly adhere to social distancing norms at the centres. In the aftermath of the commotion that disrupted the vaccination process at Jimmy George indoor stadium, Dr. Khosa appealed to the public to utilise the facility to choose convenient time slots and report for vaccination at the particular period alone. Addressing concerns Referring to concerns regarding the availability of vaccine, she said all those who had received appointments would be provided doses without fail. The Collector added that adequate seating facilities would be put in place for senior citizens and others at all centres. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order, Traffic) Vaibhav Saxena also called upon vaccine-seekers to stick to their time-slots to avoid a repetition of what had unfolded at the stadium on Monday. The officer cautioned against violation of the COVID-19 protocol that could prompt the police to book offenders under charges of the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020. Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan blamed the government for its alleged failure in controlling the crowd at the vaccination centre. In a statement, he said the incidents that occurred brought shame to the State’s health sector. He also claimed that the government failed to learn from his mistakes following similar instances that were seen in vaccination centres across the State last week. According to him, the State government was hell bent on criticising the Centre, even while it was yet to address issues that persisted in its COVID-19 management and vaccination strategy. The government has also been unable to rectify the problems faced while accessing the Co-WIN portal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stick-to-time-slots-collector/article34419735.ece
27 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Demand for pulse oximeters up||The constant reports of shortage of medical oxygen in north Indian States and the many reports of sudden fall in oxygen levels in COVID-19 patients seems to have led to a rise in demand for pulse oximeters, which lets people check the oxygen saturation levels or the level of oxygen in their blood easily at their homes. When The Hindu approached various medical stores in the capital city, quite a few of the owners said that they were waiting for fresh stock. At the Karunya pharmacy in Thycaud, a stock of 50 pulse oximeters that arrived on last Friday was completely sold off by Monday. “We sold the last item just a while ago. Since we are located near to a hospital, there is demand from patients too. We have ordered for another batch of oximeters, which is expected to arrive on Tuesday,” said a sales person at the pharmacy. Yet to arrive The manager of the Sevana medicals in Peroorkada too said that distributors had informed them that the new stock was yet to arrive. While waiting for the stocks to be replenished, the shop was now selling a Chinese-made oximeter, but it did not have a warranty, usually provided with the other products. Many of the medical stores, like the Neethi medical store inside the Kedaram shopping complex, procure the device based on the orders from the customers. The manager of Venad surgicals, a wholesale distributor, said they had ordered for new stocks two weeks ago, which was yet to arrive. The price of oximeters show wide variations depending on where you buy it from. One of the cheapest options is the Karunya pharmacy, which sells it at around Rs. 700. Discounts Sevana medicals too gives major discounts and sells it at around Rs. 1,000-1,100. At many other medical stores, the prices start at Rs. 2500 and go up to Rs. 4,000-5,000 per piece. In online shopping sites, the oximeters that were selling below Rs. 1,000 a while back have all disappeared, with the minimum prices now starting at Rs. 2,000 and going up to Rs. 5,000. Online market “After the COVID-19 outbreak last year, the demand for pulse oximeters and N95 masks shot up. The fluctuation in prices in the online market is reflective of the rise in demand,” says Vinod, manager of Vanchinad surgicals, a wholesaler. The pulse oximeter can be clipped on to the finger to measure oxygen saturation levels, and lets the person know whether more treatment is necessary. An oxygen saturation level of 95% is considered normal.

The move comes within three months of Kerala agreeing to the demand of Railways to bear 50% of the estimated Rs. 2,815.62 crore of the 116-km Angamaly-Azhutha Sabari Rail. The Cabinet had already decided to make available 50% of the estimate from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) to Railways. The State had informed the Centre that Railways would be responsible for construction and maintenance of the 116-km line while en route station development would be through public-private partnership. The income would be shared 50:50 between the State and Railways after deducting the expense. Responding to the KRDCL’s interest, Railways have asked it to update the estimate as the present one was taken in 2015. Official sources told The Hindu that the KRDCL had commenced steps to revise the estimate and undertake a LiDAR survey to get clarity on the alignment along the 40-km Ramapuram-Erumeli corridor. Bids floated The KRDCL had floated bids for selecting the agency for undertaking LiDAR, an aerial remote sensing survey method. A similar aerial survey was carried out by the KRDCL for the proposed 531.45-km semi high-speed rail line from Kochuveli to Kasaragod. The estimate of the rail line had gone up from Rs. 550 crore to Rs. 1,234 crore in 2005, to Rs. 1,566 crore in 2011, and then to Rs. 2,815.62 crore. In the 2019-2020 Budget, Rs. 1 core was allocated. Although Railways have not ‘defreezed’ the project despite Kerala agreeing to share 50% of the cost, only Rs. 1,000 was provided in the 2021-2022 Union Budget. As much as 470.77 ha is needed for Sabari Rail that passes through Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam, and Pathanamthitta districts.  The move comes within three months of Kerala agreeing to the demand of Railways to bear 50% of the estimated cost||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/krdcl-keen-to-execute-sabari-rail/article34419249.ece
27 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||21,890 persons test positive||For the sixth day in a row, Kerala reported over 20,000 new COVID-19 cases. When the results of 96,378 samples tested in 24 hours came in on Monday, 21,890 persons tested positive for the disease. The test positivity rate was 22.71%. The slight dip in cases is because of the weekend phenomenon, when the number of people who come forward for testing is fewer. It should in no way be mistaken that the epidemic curve could be showing signs of decline. The curve is not expected to relent before mid-May, unless the State adopts drastic measures like a lockdown. ICU admissions The active case pool, which crossed two lakh on Sunday, has risen to 2,32,812 patients. Disease transmission is intense and uniformly rising across all districts, though the northern districts have a higher active case load now. At least five northern districts reported over 2,000 new cases each. ICU admissions rose again on Monday, adding 150 more critically ill persons. The State now has 1,462 critically ill patients being cared for in ICUs, while those requiring ventilator assistance rose to 451. The cumulative case burden of the State now stands at 14,27,545 cases. 7,943 recoveries The number of recoveries reported on Sunday was 7,943, taking the total recoveries to 11,89,267. On Monday, the State added 28 deaths, taking the cumulative COVID fatalities to 5,138. Kannur reported six deaths, Kozhikode and Alappuzha four each, Kollam and Thrissur three each, Thiruvananthapuram, Malappuram and Kottayam two each while one death each was reported from Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam. Hospitalisation Ernakulam district has the highest active case pool in the State with 37,324 patients. However, less than 6% of the patients – 2,232 – have been hospitalised. In sharp contrast, in Thiruvananthapuram, which has an active case load of 16,677 patients, has the highest hospital admission, with close to 14% of active cases hospitalised. Five districts – Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode – have 2,000 or more hospitalised patients Kozhikode reported the highest number of new cases with 3,251, followed by Ernakulam 2,515, Malappuram 2,455, Thrissur 2,416, Thiruvananthapuram 2,272, Kannur 1,618, Palakkad 1,342, Kottayam 1,275, Alappuzha 1,183, Kasaragod 1,086, Idukki 779, Kollam 741,Wayanad 500, and Pathanamthitta 457 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/21890-persons-test-positive/article34419269.ece

The Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), under the Department of Space, and the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Ulloor, are collaborating on a research project to map the contours of the country’s evolving space economy. The decision is viewed as coming at the right time, not less for the fact that Central policies envision an expansion of the space sector with private participation. This, along with the emergence of private companies and start-ups involved in space tech-based products would make it the proper time to track the space ecosystem, IIST director V.K. Dadhwal said. Attempts in this direction had been made in the past, such as the work by U. Sankar (The Economics of India's Space Programme). But the times were different then and the space economy was not evolved as it is today, Dr. Dadhwal said. Under the research project, the institutions would seek to map the size of the country’s space economy using internationally-accepted methodologies and determine its impact on the socio-economic fabric, CDS director Sunil Mani said. In the long run, it would aid the formulation of policies on evidence-based data and realistic comparisons with other space economies, he said. The space economy went beyond the annual budget of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and encompasses the direct and indirect economic benefits accruing from the use of space technology in multiple sectors, pointed out Shaijumon C.S., Associate Professor of Economics, IIST, who initiated the project. “'We are trying to measure it, and how it has developed the economy,” he said. Autonomous An autonomous institute under the Department of Space, IIST was inaugurated in 2007 for offering high-quality education in space-related subjects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/getting-to-know-the-nuances-of-space-economy/article34419166.ece

District Collector Navjot Khosa said oxygen availability would also be ensured in the ambulances. All the ambulance owners and drivers as well as owners of taxis with partitions needed to register with thewww.covid19jagratha. kerala.nic.inweb portal, said the Collector. The vehicles, which were already registered, had been retained in the list. Special teams, which would function round-the-clock, had also been formed at the taluk levels to ensure efficient coordination. The team would consist of a Revenue officer, a medical officer from a primary health centre or community health centre, health inspector, an official of the Motor Vehicle Department, and two ministerial officials. Each team would have a control room. The MVD would have the responsibility of ensuring the number of ambulances required for each taluk. The medical officers would allocate the necessary number of ambulances to testing centres and COVID first-line treatment centres. A special ambulance base would be arranged at each taluk. Strict disinfection of the vehicles would be carried out. A special team had been formed to coordinate between the taluk-level ambulance teams and the war room set up at the District Collectorate. ‘Kanivu’ 108 ambulance In the past tem days, the ‘Kanivu’ 108 ambulances in the State have operated 7,451 trips for COVID-19-related services.

27 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||All-party meeting rules out lockdown, backs harsh curbs||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said Opposition parties argued against a Statewide total lockdown. The government had propounded a similar opinion at the all-party meeting held via video link. The meeting backed the government’s move to strictly restrict social life, commerce, group entertainment, and collective recreational activities, including indoor and outdoor sports, to staunch the tide of new infections. Mr. Vijayan chaired the conference. He said that highly infectious variants from the United Kingdom and South Africa had caused the pestilence to beset the State again. The U.K. variant accounted for 40% of the infections in northern Kerala. The State was also wary of an emergent strain that had undergone multiple mutations and was worryingly impervious to drugs. Mr. Vijayan said people had to endure the limitations for their safety. It was incumbent upon the civil society to halt the plague. “We have lived alongside the COVID-19 threat for a year-and-a-half. The road ahead is long. Society could not afford to drop its guard any time soon,” he said. The meeting decided to shift education totally to online. Mr. Vijayan said Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had flagged the scarcity of supplemental blood. Hence, the conference urged citizens between 18 and 45 to donate blood before getting vaccinated. It said blood banks required to be replenished quickly given the public health crisis. Mr. Chennithala asked the government to be mindful of the difficulties faced by manual labourers, construction workers, motor vehicle employees, and other daily wage earners. The restrictions would further whittle down their meagre income. Free rations, food kits The State should bring them under a welfare safety net. He asked the government to distribute free rations and food kits. The government must regulate the fee charged by private hospitals. Bharatiya Janata Party State president K. Surendran urged the government to ramp up vaccination. The government should reduce the fee for the RT-PCR test. Central funds must be used to set up more medical oxygen plants. Political parties should refrain from creating a vaccine shortage scare. He urged the administration to give parole liberally to prisoners to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19.

27 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Patient discharge policy revised||With the increasing number of patients in the second wave of COVID threatening to breach the health system’s surge capacity, the State government has taken a long-pending decision to discharge COVID-19 patients from hospitals without insisting that they test negative in a rapid antigen test. In the initial days of COVID, a patient could be discharged only after he tested negative in two consecutive RT-PCR tests between a fixed interval. But in June last, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revised its guidelines that patients with mild/moderate disease could be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset if there was no fever for three days, without a COVID test. The State continued to insist on a negative antigen test on the 10th day, prior to discharge. Even though all clinicians as well as the expert committee pointed out that this was waste of resources, the State refused to change the guidelines. The argument was that it was important to reassure the patient that he was no more infectious, before letting him into the community. Faced with the prospect of hospitals getting choked with COVID patients, the government has now revised the guidelines. The new guidelines say that patients with mild and moderate COVID disease can be discharged to home isolation, if they have been symptomless for the past 72 hours, without an antigen test. Conditions Moderate cases should be haemodynamically stable, should not require supplementary oxygen, and there should be no breathlessness or excessive fatigue. These patients will continue to watch out for red flag signs while in home isolation and perform the six-minute walk test daily to pick up exertion desaturation signs (defined as fall in oxygen levels below 3% of the baseline after the six-minute test). Freeing up beds Public health experts point out that the total subsiding of clinical illness is usually taken as an indication that the virus is no longer active. The government’s decision to do away with the antigen test will thus help clinically stable patients to be released early, freeing up hospital beds faster. However, they also point out that it makes no sense that in the case of patients who are seriously ill, the State is continuing to insist on a negative antigen test 14 days from symptom onset before discharge, even if they are clinically stable. If they are antigen positive on day 14, the test will be repeated every 48 hours, the guidelines say.  Patients to be discharged without insisting that they test negative in antigen test||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/patient-discharge-policy-revised/article34419271.ece
27 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Arrangements to curb crowding at Jimmy George stadium||Striving to prevent unruly scenes that disrupted the vaccination drive on Monday, the district authorities have chalked out a strategy for streamlining the public headed to the Jimmy George indoor stadium. Armed with additional deployment from the Armed Police camp, the police will permit entry only on the basis of the appointment time slots. Those arriving much earlier will be sent back to avoid unnecessary crowding. No request for spot registration will be entertained. Museum Inspector Prajeesh Sasi said the public would also be required to park outside the premises of the stadium. The parking area of the stadium would be converted as a waiting area. A pandhal would be erected there for the benefit of those awaiting their turns. Meanwhile senior citizens can be dropped off close to the venue, cars would have to be parked on the premises of the Kanakakkunnu palace or other dedicated spaces nearby. Facilities have also been made to provide drinking water at the vaccination centre. Nevertheless, Mr. Sasi appealed to the public to carry water and snacks as much as possible to ensure no one faced uneasiness as seen on Monday. On Monday The vaccination camp on Monday lasted until 8.30 p.m. by when 2,867 people were inoculated. The count was higher than what had been anticipated by the district health authorities. While all of the 2,000 available slots on Co-WIN were booked, Health officials were taken off-guard when many turned up with appointments obtained through the Aarogya Setu app. District Collector Navjot Khosa also delegated Special Tahsildar N. Balasubramanian as special nodal officer to coordinate the vaccination camp at the stadium. District Development Commissioner Vinay Goyal would oversee the efforts. The move assumes significance as it comes on a day when the 30-odd volunteers attached to the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) came under intense public pressure. Besides being on tenterhooks for most part of the day, one of the volunteers was also allegedly assaulted by a person who had come for the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/arrangements-to-curb-crowding-at-jimmy-george-stadium/article34419736.ece

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which entrusted the Kozhikode-based ULCCS with the reconstruction work, had, in addition, strengthened the pillars of the structure by concrete wrapping. Official sources said the reconstruction cost could be recovered from RDS Projects, since the flyover developed cracks on its girders and a few pier caps within a year of its commissioning in 2016. The defect liability period of the structure was three years. ULCCS was awarded the contract to reconstruct the structure at a cost of Rs. 23 crore in 2020. The initial contract cost was Rs. 19 crore in 2019. A year’s delay The escalation occurred following a year’s delay in commencing the reconstruction work, after contractor bodies approached the High Court seeking a load test on the initial structure before deciding to pull it down. The State government went in appeal before the Supreme Court, which in October 2020 permitted the government to go ahead with its plans. The DMRC is working out the additional expenses incurred while executing the project. They include expenses of finalising the design and establishment cost. The DMRC had delayed the winding up of its office in Kochi after commissioning the Aluva-Pettah metro corridor in 2020 owing to its commitment to rebuild the damaged flyover, it is learnt. Traffic rearrangement The project cost included that for innovative traffic rearrangement along Civil Line Road, by routing vehicles through a pair of underpasses at road level beneath the flyover. The DMRC built the flyover using funds it had saved while executing preparatory works like building bridges and the Edappally flyover for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). The State government must take a call on recovering the flyover reconstruction cost from the builder firm, by invoking the defect liability clause. The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK), which had awarded the work to RDS Projects, has initiated measures in this regard, official sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flyover-decision-on-recovering-cost-from-builder-soon/article34419742.ece

BJP cries foul Photographs of the function showed the volunteers and other invitees sitting in violation of social distancing norms. The BJP and TDP leaders have criticised the Minister for organising such a gathering, saying that the event could turn out to be a venue for the spread of COVID infection. Even as the number of positive cases were insignificant in the past two weeks in Penukonda, the infection count has been witnessing a spurt for the past three days. The highest single-day tally of 98 was recorded here on Sunday. “At a time when people are finding it difficult to get treatment for COVID19, the Minister, instead of reviewing the situation, organised such a gathering. The government is holding awareness programmes on social distancing and wearing masks. Being a Minister, holding such an event at this crucial juncture is atrocious,” said BJP leader Duddukunta Venkateswara Reddy. The YSRCP govcernment in Andhra Pradesh does not bother about the COVID19 patients by not deploying sufficient staff at the designated government Super Specialty Hospital in Anantapur, he said. “This issue came to the fore when YSRCP Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy made a surprise visit on Monday,” alleged Mr. Venkateswara Reddy. Two events to honour the volunteers have been organised in Anantapur and Singanamala Assembly constituencies on a massive scale in the past two weeks , he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/r-b-minister-draws-flak-for-holding-event-amid-pandemic/article34419006.ece

The inter-district bus services between Bhadrachalam and Wazed in Mulugu district were operated only up to Venkatapuram within the stipulated time till late in the afternoon. The inter-State bus services between Bhadrachalam-Konta-Vijayawada were suspended until Tuesday in view of the volatile situation along the inter-State borders with Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, TSRTC sources said. The night bus services were already suspended due to the night curfew in force to stem the spread of coronavirus infections. Villagers of several remote tribal habitations in Bhadrachalam Agency had to face severe hardships due to the suspension of bus services and are forced to spend extra money for their daily commute due to the alleged hefty fare charged by the private vehicles, mainly autorickshaws, sources added. An uneasy calm persisted in the forested border region spread across Charla and Dummugudem mandals, adjoining Chhattisgarh, during the Maoists’ bandh even as a large posse of police personnel maintained a strict vigil at vantage points along the forest stretch to deal with any eventuality. The recent escalation of Maoist violence in the trouble-torn pockets of neighbouring Chhattisgarh triggered tension in the forest fringe tribal habitations lying close to the inter-State border in Dummugudem and Charla mandals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/maoist-bandh-paralyses-bus-services/article34419607.ece

Addressing a press conference at the Press Club in Tirupati, he said that Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah had hatched a conspiracy to win the elections by manipulating the EVMs manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited in connivance with the paramilitary forces. He further alleged that the YSR Congress Party’s victory in 22 MP seats and 151 MLA seats in Andhra Pradesh in 2019 was possible only through “electoral fraud” with the support of the two BJP leaders. Expressing doubts over the holding of the West Bengal and Assam Assembly elections in eight and five phases respectively but with a single phase in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Mr. Mohan alleged that once again the BJP leaders had repeated the same strategy in northern States, fearing a rout. “In Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection too, the YSRCP took to casting of over 3.5 lakh bogus votes by deploying thousands of outsiders in seven assembly segments with the support of Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah. The ruling party had bribed the polling officials, police and volunteers,” Mr. Mohan alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-won-in-2019-by-electoral-fraud-alleges-chinta-mohan/article34419689.ece
27 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Botcha refutes TDP charges on COVID-19 measures in State||Asserting that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has been taking stringent measures to contain COVID-19 in the State, Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana has said TDP leaders Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh are creating tension and confusion among the public for their political interests. Speaking to the media at the party central office here on Monday, the Minister said the State government has laid special focus on bed availability, oxygen and medicines and taking measures to ensure 50,000 beds are available across the State. The government, through the 104 call centre, has been providing beds to the required patients within two hours. A state command control centre has been set up and higher officials are alert and monitoring the situation closely, he said. While the State government has been running from pillar to post to fight the pandemic, Mr. Naidu and the ‘yellow media’ are propagating falsehood to create unrest in the State. While the employees have been striving hard in the fight against the pandemic, the comments of Mr. Naidu and Mr. Lokesh are damaging the their confidence, the Minister said. The officials became alert following the oxygen supply issue in a hospital in Vizianagaram and saved lives with great effort, he said, and slammed Mr. Naidu for not praising the doctors for their efforts and, instead, criticising the government over the issue. He said the government would welcome any reasonable suggestions from the Opposition and accused Mr. Naidu of not giving even one responsible suggestion to the government. The Minister criticised Mr. Lokesh for demanding cancellation or postponement of Class 10 and Intermediate exams. He said the State government had taken the decision to conduct the exams to save the future of the students. How could the students compete for national-level institutions without writing the board exams, he said. Why didn’t Mr. Naidu and Mr. Lokesh comment or react when Prime Minister Narendra Modi said lockdown was the last option, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/botcha-refutes-tdp-charges-on-covid-19-measures-in-state/article34419691.ece
27 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Guntur overwhelmed by second wave||Overcrowded hospitals, long queues in front of labs and diagnostic centres and a sense of panic writ all over faces of anxious family members. The nights are filled with uncertainty and the eerie silence is broken frequently by the piercing sound of an ambulance siren. These are the sights across Guntur, which is battling a vicious second wave of COVID-19 that has led to a sudden spurt in cases over the weekend. Adding to the woes of patients is the lack of oxygen at many hospitals. The apparent shortage of Remdesivir — hailed by many as a wonder drug — is also adding to their fear. For a city that bore the brunt of pandemic during the first wave, it is surprising to see it struggling to tackle the second wave which began sweeping the country from April 1, say experts. “We have beds available but there is no guarantee on the supply of oxygen. We are asking the patients to get antiviral drugs. We are helpless and unable to manage the surge of patients,” said a hospital administrator. With the situation worsening, some patients have shifted to neighbouring districts. “The situation in our hospitals is worsening. The scarcity of oxygen has made the situation worrisome. We had to run helter-skelter for a bed for a 70-year-old man. We managed to find one at a hospital, and then managed to procure an oxygen cylinder too. However, there was no flow meter to use and it. We finally managed to set it up by midnight, and we are hoping that he will recover,” said a doctor. The healthcare infrastructure in the district is bursting at its seams as the explosion of the COVID-19 cases continues. The district recorded 1,576 cases on Sunday, out of which Guntur city alone recorded 445 cases, the highest caseload in recent times. The district administration, which successfully managed to overcome the first wave, has swung into action and allotted 6,000 beds at 54 government and private hospitals to treat patients affected by the virus. Collector Vivek Yadav constituted nodal officers to monitor every hospital. A daily dossier on hospital preparedness and current status of hospitals and occupancy is being released. As of Sunday, a total of 3,906 beds are available at hospitals, out of which 629 are ICU beds, 1,984 are non-ICU beds, 1,293 non-ICU and non-oxygen beds, and 307 ventilators. The district’s overall caseload has crossed 1.03 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/guntur-overwhelmed-by-second-wave/article34419770.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has come out with an action plan to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Guntur district. During a review meeting on the COVID-19 situation here, Mr. Srinivas said the number of beds allotted for COVID-19 care had been raised to 6,000 and a COVID Care Centre had been set up in every constituency. People could call 104 and register their names for COVID treatment. The government further intended to regulate oxygen supply and 12,000 vials of Remdesivir were being supplied to hospitals across the State. “If any one wishes to complain against any issue relating to COVID treatment, they can call 1902 and lodge a complaint. We will take action against the hospitals denying bed or treatment. The supply of Remdesivir to government hospitals has been regulated and we will ensure the private hospitals also have access,” said Mr. Srinivas. The Minister asked the people to follow COVID appropriate behaviour such as wearing a mask always, ensure social distance and sanitising hands frequently. He asked the district administration to ensure that sufficient publicity was given to COVID appropriate behaviour. Minister for Home and Disaster Management M. Sucharita said the Chief Minister was monitoring the situation on a hourly basis and added that the issue of shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir woud be resolved soon. She appealed to people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Mayor Kavati Manohar Naidu, Principal Secretary, Revenue, V. Usha Rani, District Collector Vivek Yadav, Joint Collectors P.

27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Six oxygen tankers return from Odisha after refilling||Six out of the nine tankers, which had been airlifted to Angul in Odisha through Indian Air Force aircraft (C-17s), returned to Telangana by road on Monday. The six tankers carried over 90 metric tons of oxygen. The remaining three are expected to reach here by Tuesday morning. It was learnt that eight more tankers would again be airlifted on Tuesday morning. Of the six, four were sent to government hospitals in Hyderabad, and one each to Khammam and Karimnagar. In Hyderabad, the tankers were sent to the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences, Government General and Chest Hospital and District Hospital in King Koti. 310 MT needed daily Put together, the nine tankers were expected to bring 150 metric tons of oxygen. This would meet half the daily requirement of around 310 metric tons in the State. Of the 310 metric ton allotment, around 125 metric tons is produced in the State and the rest 185 has to be brought in from other States, including from a steel plant in Angul, located around 1,040 km from Hyderabad. To cut down the time, the nine tankers were airlifted from Hyderabad in two IAF aircrafts on Thursday morning. After three days, they were driven backl to Hyderabad and other places in the State by drivers of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation. Teams of officials from various departments including Health and Transport were part of this operation. There is severe requirement of oxygen as small scale private hospitals are not able to admit patients in requirement of the medical resource. If there is no shortage of it, more beds will be available at hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/carrying-oxygen-six-of-nine-tankers-return-from-odisha/article34419578.ece
27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anxiety over COVID status leads to auto driver’s death||A moving scene was witnessed near the primary health centre (PHC) at Renjal in Nizamabad district on Sunday morning when a 28-year-old autorickshaw driver died even as he burned up with fever and sat leaning against a tree. Minutes earlier, Ashok Batri had got himself tested for COVID-19 at the PHC and was waiting for the reports as he rested by a tree. The result, which turned up negative, came out just as he passed away. PHC medical officer Christina Renjal said she did not expect Ashok to suffer a heart attack as he was very young, but added that the exact reason would have been known if the family members volunteered for a post-mortem examination. However, they took the body back to their village and buried him. Dr. Renjal said Ashok was too tense about his health which may have had an adverse impact. Ashok was said to be running a temperature of 103 degrees C, and was scared of having contracted COVID. He again rushed to the PHC with his mother Gangamani, a sanitation worker, and brother Gangadhar in an autorickshaw from their village Borgaon. He had been suffering from fever for a week. On arrival, the PHC staff conducted a rapid antigen test for COVID which turned out to be negative. Not satisfied with the result, he exerted pressure on the staff to test him a second time and they obliged, using the same technique. They asked him to wait for the result outside while he faced a silent death. Heart-rending scenes were witnessed as Gangamani held her dead son and pleaded him to come back to life, so that they could return home together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anxiety-over-covid-status-leads-to-auto-drivers-death/article34419584.ece

Education department special Chief Secretary Chitra Ramachandran issued the orders a day after Education Minister Sabita Indra Reddy directed the officials concerned to promote students from classes I to IX to the next higher level without the conduct of examination. The minister recalled that there was no detention system for classes I to IX and there was no need to conduct exams. All the students had accordingly been promoted to the next higher level to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The development follows the government decision to close all educational institutions, allowing online/distance learning mode. The department had announced summer holidays to schools and junior colleges starting Tuesday till May 31 in view of the hardships faced due to the pandemic. The Director of School Education has been directed to take necessary action in this regard. Last year also, during the first wave of COVID-19 disease when there was a lockdown, the government had promoted all students studying from classes I to IX to the next higher level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-promotion-for-students-of-classes-i-to-ix/article34419572.ece

27 April 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Plea in Kerala High Court against vaccine pricing||A writ petition was on Monday filed in the Kerala High Court challenging the Union government’s Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, which prescribes differential pricing for COVID-19 vaccines. In his petition, C.P. Promod, State secretary of the All India Lawyers Union (AILU) owing allegiance to the CPI(M) pointed out that differential pricing for vaccines was not scientific. Fifty per cent of the vaccines was made available to the Union government at the rate of Rs. 150 a dose. The price of the remaining 50% of vaccines being made available to State governments and others could be decided by the manufacturers, leaving it to the compulsions of market forces. Thus, the health concerns of the majority of the citizens were given a short shrift. The strategy of the Centre was based on the assumption that liberalised vaccine prices would incentivise manufacturers to rapidly scale up their production and attract new manufacturers. Such strategy was erroneous, especially when the country was dealing with a pandemic situation. The Centre should have directed the manufacturers to scale up production, instead of liberalising the prices. The petitioner said the Centre should have followed the principles of the National Vaccination Policy for universal immunisation programmes. According to it, the Centre was bound to procure vaccines from manufactures at a fair price and distribute it to the States. No reasons had been cited for deviating from this policy.  India is the only country where the pricing of COVID-19 vaccines has been left to the discretion of manufacturers C.P.

The active cases rose to 13,946 as 1,592 persons in Nellore district and another 522 persons in Prakasam district contracted the infection in 24 hours ending at 9 a.m. on Monday, according to a health bulletin released by the State government. With six deaths in Nellore district and two in Prakasam district, the toll in the region rose to 1,197. So far 612 patients in Prakasam and 585 others in Nellore have succumbed to the virus.  14 teachers, students test positive Fourteen teachers and students of the Zilla Parishad school at Gowravaram, near Kavali, tested positive and the demand for cancellation or postponement of the SSC and intermediate examinations grew louder. Meanwhile, patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome at the Gudur government hospital had a harrowing time owing to the alleged shortage of oxygen. In a desperate bid to save their lives, their relatives arranged oxygen concentrators from private suppliers. The cumulative tally increased to 1,44,805 in the region. Those getting infected outnumbered those getting cured by over 1,600 during the period as a little more than 450 patients won the battle against the virus during the period. Meanwhile, patients at the Government General Hospital in Ongole poured out their woes to Prakasam Collector Pola Bhaskar, who visited the hospital. The bed strength was being augmented to 1,500 by bringing under the GGH fold the adjacent Tribal Welfare building, the Collector said.

27 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Intense spread of mutant variants in Kerala?||Genomic sequencing studies of SARS-CoV-2 samples from across the State done in national as well as State scientific institutions have indicated wide and intense transmission of various mutant variants, including variants of concern (VOC), confirming the worst fears of many public health experts. “Sequencing of samples from across all districts as on April 1 done by the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, has revealed the presence of the variant B.1.1.7 (first detected in the U.K.) and B.1.617 (“double mutant” reported from India) in 40% of the samples. Given the high infectivity potential of these variants, we project that this proportion would have now increased to 70%. In about 2% samples, the presence of B.1.351, first reported in South Africa, was also found. A few samples analysed from Thiruvananthpuram district at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology has indicated the presence of B.1.1.7 as well as a variant with a different double mutation,” a senior member of the expert committee on COVID, told The Hindu . Lockdown suggested “The situation is quite alarming. Disease transmission has reached a point wherein mass testing alone is not going to make a difference. Our recommendation would be that the State go in for a two-week cyclical lockdown to bring down disease transmission immediately,” he added. The B.1.1.7 variant is 43% to 90% more contagious than the original wild-type virus, researchers from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had reported. Hazard of death The same team reported in Nature on March 15, 2021, that the hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7 is 61% (42–82%) higher than with pre-existing variants. Virus samples from Kerala from the first half of March, analysed by the IGIB had not revealed the presence of any VOC. However it is the State-wide samples in the second half of March and some current samples (last week) from Veeranakavu, Kuttichal, Kattakada areas in the capital district which revealed the presence of circulating virus variants. As the State’s case graph began rising the government issued orders last week, asking Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) and the multidisciplinary lab at the Kozhikode MCH to take up virus sample studies, involving amplification of the virus’ spike protein receptor-binding domain, to assess if any mutations had taken place. 10 current samples Accordingly, the State public health lab and the microbiology lab at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College had handed over 10 current samples each to the RGCB. It is learnt that of the 10 samples provided by MCH, three had the N501Y mutation found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The remaining samples had a combination of two mutations, L452R and T478K. It might be recalled that L452R is one of the mutations found in the “double mutant” B.1.617 variant found predominantly in Maharashtra. According to a pre-print in biorxiv.org, L452R can reinforce the virus’s affinity to the ACE2 receptor, increase viral replication and escape even T cell immunity. The mutation T478K is predominantly found in the variant B.1.1.222, first detected in Mexico in April 2020. The L452R and T478K mutation together had been found earlier in SARS-CoV-2 samples from Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Bihar. The B.1.351variant carries two spike protein mutations, N501Y, which makes it very contagious, while the E484K mutation renders the virus powerful enough to dodge the body’s immune system response and blunt the efficacy of vaccines against it.  The State has decided to continue the current genome sequencing studies and to analyse more samples from districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/intense-spread-of-mutant-variants-in-kerala/article34418957.ece

Many of them, industry sources say, are selling away the apartments at cost price or with meagre margins to pay the loan instalments. Industry sources say that banks had liberally sanctioned loans and many construction projects took off between Vijayawada and Guntur in a grandiose manner as there was a good response from buyers. The sentiment, however, nosedived with the government announcing its plans to shift the Capital. The projects were high-end and big with 200 to 600 flats per venture in the price range of Rs. 60-80 lakh per unit. According to a rough estimate, loans to the tune of Rs. 2,000 crore were sanctioned by banks. “There was no demand for many months due to the COVID-induced lockdown last year. The bankers are mounting pressure to clear the loans,” says a senior builder. The developers are finding it tough to avoid defaulting on their interest payments with sales and cash flows drying up. Consequently, they are willing to seal deals even if the margin is meagre, explains another builder, who did not want to be quoted. Concessions sought When contacted, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) public relations committee chairman R.V. Swamy says even before builders could come out of the impact of the last year’s COVID pandemic, the second wave has struck. In 2008, there was a recession. The banks had then extended the loan repayment facility beyond one year. Similar measures have to be taken now, he opines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/builders-struggle-to-pay-emis/article34419696.ece

In the affidavit, APCLA joint secretary Boddepalli Mohan Reddy said the government has not prepared an action plan as per Sections 11 and 23 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. “As per the website of the A.P.

Chandrababu Naidu has expressed shock and grief over the death of COVID patients due to lack of timely oxygen supply at Maharaja Hospital in Vizianagaram. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Naidu said the State government’s inefficiency came to the fore with its inability to provide oxygen to the patients battling for their lives in the government hospitals. The Ministers had remained silent spectators. The situation was deteriorating in all the 13 districts with scarcity of oxygen beds, he said. The government was not providing the correct information with regard to the facilities for COVID patients in hospitals. On the COVID dashboard, it was being shown that oxygen beds were vacant and plenty of them were available. But when patients were taken to the respective hospitals, they were not being admitted citing oxygen shortage, he said. The officials should focus on providing beds, oxygen and Remdesivir injections in order to prevent the situation from going out of control. A new confidence should have to be created among the people, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-blames-govt-for-deaths-in-hospitals/article34419697.ece

Only 3% students said that there was no need to go to the court but stressed the need for taking preventive measures, he said. The TDP MLC deplored that there was no proper explanation from the State government as to why it was going ahead with the exams at a time when other States had cancelled the examinations. Even in those States, where the virus cases were comparatively far lesser, they had cancelled the exams.

27 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Remdesivir to be supplied through drug controller||To streamline the supply of Remdesivir, a vital drug in the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 cases, the State government has passed an SOP (standard operating procedure) to route its supply through the Assistant Director (AD) of drug control in every district. Visakhapatnam has been facing a severe shortage of Remdesivir for the past one week, and black marketers have been flourishing, during this period. The district is facing a shortage of at least 40%, says health officials. The issue has been taken up with the Health Minister and the Principal Secretary, health, and it has been decided that from Monday all private hospitals that are registered under Category A and B for treating COVID-19 cases, will put up an indent for Remdesivir with the AD on a daily basis and the latter will forward it to the Director General (DG) of drug control, said Collector V. Vinay Chand. The Director General will place the demand with Hetero Drugs, the manufacturers, and the supply to the districts will be routed through the DG. This is expected to solve the shortage in private hospitals while there is no such issue in the government hospitals, said Mr. Vinay Chand. On the other hand, the unregistered hospitals that are treating COVID patients can approach the DMHO and get registered under any of the categories and then place their indent for the drug,” said Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College. Not OP drug Saying Remdesivir cannot be bought over the counter, Dr. Balaraju, a senior pulmonologist, said, “Remdesivir cannot be administered at home or to patients under home isolation. It is not an OP (out-patient) drug.” Remdesivir is given to the patients whose oxygen saturation drops below 95% and are hospitalised with symptoms of hypoxia or dyspnea or other complications. It is given to the patients with moderate to severe conditions under hospital environment, said Dr. Sudhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/remdesivir-to-be-supplied-through-drug-controller/article34419701.ece

He said that the Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) had witnessed 20 deaths on April 24 even as another 30 patients were waiting outside the hospital for beds. The BJP leader alleged that those, who required ventilator support, were dying on the streets. Mr. Raveendra alleged that around 100 patients were waiting for beds. Quoting the Nodal Officer of the Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), Mr. Raveendra said though there were 40 ventilators at GHCCD, they were not working. He demanded that the State government immediately arrange beds at private hospitals. Saying that generation of test reports was taking four to five days, he said that delays could lead to more fatalities. Referring to the shortage of Remdesivir injection, he said that the delay in supply could result in hoarding and black-marketing apart from selling the drug at high rates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/arrange-beds-at-private-hospitals-for-patients-bjp/article34419780.ece

Kumar has called upon people to oppose the move of the Central government to privatise Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, Visakhapatnam Port and other PSUs. The CITU leader was addressing the participants on the 25th day of the relay hunger strikes, being organised at the Gandhi statue, near the GVMC, on Monday. Mr. Kumar alleged that at a time when people of the nation were battling for their lives due to the pandemic, the Union government was issuing statements that privatisation would not be stopped. The VSP was supplying oxygen to Andhra Pradesh and other States and coming to the rescue of COVID-19 patients even as the Centre was planning to privatise the plant, he said. Similarly, the Union government was planning to privatise public sector ports by introducing the Major Ports Bills, Mr. Kumar alleged. He said that privatisation was leading to loss of jobs and the employment prospects would be bleak in future. He alleged that the Centre failed to do justice to the farmers, who were feeding the nation. CITU leaders M. Subba Rao, Penta Rao, D.

The hospital was an ultra-modern facility to get added to the health infrastructure of Anantapur during the first wave of the COVID pandemic. The MLA, along with the GGH Superintendent K.S.S. Venkateswara Rao, visited the hospital after receiving complaints from several patients and their kin on the poor amenities. The MLA found that there was no drinking water facility in the ward. The food for the patients did not arrive till 2 p.m., while it was supposed to be served before 1 p.m. “There is a paucity of paramedical staff as the COVID19 patients are being attended by their kin. No doctor is visiting the COVID Care Centre at JNTU, Anantapur situated next to the Super Specialty Hospital and the morale of the positive persons is low,” the MLA said. Mr. Venkatarami Reddy spoke to Collector Gandham Chandrudu and asked him to set the things right. The Collector, along with the R&B Minister, were visiting the Hindupur Hospital at that time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sorry-state-of-affairs-at-covid-facilities-mla/article34419009.ece

27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Minister flays private hospitals, urges people not to self-medicate||Health Minister Eatala Rajender expressed “serious concern” over the rising COVID-19 deaths but said it was also because people were reaching government healthcare facilities very late, and after self-medication. Besides, he also pointed an accusing finger at private hospitals for moving terminally-ill patients to government hospitals to escape blame for the deaths. Rising deaths Admitting that Gandhi Hospital and Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences have been witnessing a rise in the deaths in recent days, the Minister explained, “Private hospitals after treating patients to a certain extent and if and when condition is deteriorating are informing family members that they are running short of oxygen and lack Remdesivir injections. That is causing a rush to these two government hospitals, which are already full with COVID patients. Our doctors’ best efforts to save such patients go in vain,” he said in an exclusive interaction on Monday. Mr. Rajendra also stated that many people after testing positive for coronavirus are self-medicating despite doctors’ advice to be cautious in using certain medicines. “The condition of such patients is suddenly turning grave and they are being rushed to tgovernment hospitals and some are even declared dead on arrival. We have to understand these prevailing conditions before criticising the lack of adequate healthcare facilities in the government sector and rise in deaths,” he maintained. However, Mr. Rajender admitted that there was a shortage of Remdesivir injections, and said that against the requisition for four lakh vials, the Centre has been releasing around 30,000 injections every day. “The black marketing of this much sought-after injection is being furthered by some hospitals, which have neither registered for receiving the drug nor signed an agreement. These hospitals are fleecing patients, forcing them to pay more claiming the drug is not available”, he said. Oxygen supply The oxygen supply is much better when compared to other places and the government has already taken steps to overcome the situation. And, in order to control the rush towards city healthcare facilities, the government had issued instructions to the districts to treat critically-ill patients at the headquarters hospitals only. “This is to avoid choking in the hospitals. Some of our hospitals have fairly decent facilities and can treat the critical patients,” he said and also pointed to the reluctance of many patients to get discharged even after they have recovered. “We can admit more patients into hospitals if the recovered patients are discharged on time. These patients can also be shifted to COVID care isolation centres for post-discharge recovery,” he said. The medical colleges, too, would be roped in soon to handle the rising patient load by way of providing more beds, he said. Mr Rajender was also confident of sorting out the vaccine shortage in the next couple of days.  The black marketing of Remdesivir is being furthered by some hospitals, which have neither registered for receiving the drug nor signed an agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/minister-flays-private-hospitals-urges-people-not-to-self-medicate/article34419582.ece
27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Include COVID treatment under Aargoyasri: Seethakka||Congress legislator from Mulugu D. Anasuya alias Seethakka has requested Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to include COVID-19 treatment under the Aarogyasri scheme so that members of many poor families succumbing to the virus infection due to their inability to bear the hospitalisation expenses could get cashless treatment. Ms. Seethakka, along with State president of National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the students wing of Congress, B. Venkat launched an indefinite hunger strike at the Indira Park protest camp here on Monday demanding inclusion of COVID treatment under the Aarogyasri scheme and arranging free ambulance facility to bring COVID-positives to hospitals. Speaking at the protest held under the aegis of NSUI, she said the State government had agreed in the past to include COVID treatment under the Aarogyasri scheme after the first wave of the pandemic last year, but had been keeping silent on it since then. “There’s nothing valuable than people’s lives to any government and development does not mean building unwanted monuments – office complexes. It lies in the improved living standards of people,” she noted. Such basic decisions were expected from any responsible government at a time when the coronavirus infection was on the upswing , the Congress leader said adding that most of the working class were facing the threat of contracting the virus infection as part of their livelihood activities but they had no resources to bear the huge hospitalisation expenses. People who were not in a position to afford medical expenses need some assurance on treatment in the event of they getting infected with COVID-19 and getting hospitalised, Ms. Seethakka said. She stated that people had no faith in public health facilities including Gandhi Hospital as no known elected representative had got admitted there or taken treatment for COVID-19 infection in spite of all the tall claims by the government. She alleged that the government had washed off its hands on the COVID issue last year by declaring after the lockdown period that it was inevitable for the society to live with coronavirus. She made the demand in July last too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/include-covid-treatment-under-aargoyasri-seethakka/article34419588.ece

27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID cases cross 4 lakh||The total COVID-19 cases in Telangana has crossed 4 lakhs on Sunday. Number of people who died of COVID-19 has breached 2,000. With 6,551 cases and 43 deaths on April 25, the total cases from March 2 last year has reached 4.01 lakh and deaths stand at 2,024. The last set of 50,000 cases were recorded in only eight days (April 18-25). This is the shortest duration taken to record 50,000 cases. The earlier sets of around 50,000 cases were recorded in longer time. Comparatively less number of COVID-19 cases were detected in Telangana on Sunday as number of tests dropped. At least over a lakh samples were tested in a day in the past week leading to spike in cases. On Saturday, 1,08,602 tests were conducted and 8,126 cases were detected. However, 73,275 samples were tested on Sunday and 6,551 cases were recorded. The total tests drop on every Sunday. While cases dropped, COVID-19 deaths continue to increase unabated as 43 patients died on Sunday. The highest of 1,418 cases were from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, followed by 554 in Medchal Malkajgiri, 482 in Nizamabad. The lowest of 25 were from Mulugu. So far, a total of 1,25,66,674 samples were tested and 4,01,783 cases were detected. Of the total, 65,997 were active cases, 3,34,144 have recovered, and 2,042 have died.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-cases-cross-4-lakh/article34419576.ece
27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Abuse, misuse of medical infra and drugs, says TSHA||Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association (TSHA) president B. Bhaskar Rao, who is also managing director of KIMS Hospitals, has observed that unwanted admission of a large number of COVID-19 persons has been denying hospital beds to those in dire need. In addition to the shortage of medical infrastructure, including oxygen supply, there was abuse and misuse of drugs such as Remdesivir which was helping further mutation of the virus, Dr. Bhaskar Rao said speaking to newspersons in a virtual meet on Monday. “We should have been better prepared for the second wave of the pandemic after suffering the worst in the first wave, but unfortunately we did not,” he felt. ‘Heed doctors’ advice’ Requesting people, particularly the family members and COVID patients themselves to heed to the doctors’ advice on the line of treatment and use of drugs, Dr. Rao said in many cases they (doctors) were under heavy pressure from either the patients or their family members to administer drugs such as Remdesivir, which was not required in the health condition they were in. Even the hospital beds were being occupied by many of those who were not in need, by using their influence at different levels. Giving the example of KIMS Hospital in the City Dr. Rao said of about 500 COVID patients admitted in the hospital over 200 were not in need of hospitalisation with oxygen facility and they could recover either in home isolation or institutional isolation such as hotels with regular medical supervision. Such patients were not heeding to the doctors’ recommendation to get discharged from the hospital with a request and some times pressure to allow them to be in-patients further with the argument that they would recover faster in the hospital, Dr. Rao explained. On the condition of hospitalised COVID patients, the TSHA president said with the mutated variants of the virus the requirement of medical oxygen had gone up by even 10 folds in some cases. “In our hospital, 20,000 litres of oxygen storage would have been lasted 3-4 days or even longer in then normal course but it is being refilled every day now as some patients requiring only 3-4 litres oxygen supplement are requiring 40-50 litres and even 60 litres in some cases this time,” he said. He suggested the patients and their family members to take doctors into confidence and go for high-end treatment only if the chances of recovery were 90% or more. He also suggested hotels and high-rises to embed oxygen supply infrastructure at the time of construction to face the pandemic like situations in future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/abuse-misuse-of-medical-infra-and-drugs-says-tsha/article34419574.ece
27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Follow ‘social vaccine’, say scientists||With COVID-appropriate behaviour — three-layer face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene and vaccination — along with current restrictions on movement or gatherings, it is quite possible to bring down the caseload in the next two-three weeks. “But, we could also see a lot of damage during this time,” said CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra. “We know how this virus spreads and how to stop this. With more vaccinations, we are hopeful of controlling the pandemic and perhaps, we can manage better and ensure there won’t be disastrous peaks like what we are experiencing now, in two months. The virus is smart and is certainly not going to vanish but could become like the common cold. We may be getting drugs to treat it sometime ahead,” he observed. Along with the ‘social vaccine’, the miracle of medical vaccines which have come out within a year should offer protection for several months and even up to a year, so, unless someone has been seriously ill in recent times, the jabs should be taken, he asserted. In a virtual discussion thrown open to the public over the weekend, Dr. Mishra and fellow scientists Divya Tej S, and Karthik Bharadwaj explained about the nature of the coronavirus, transmission, mutations, common myths and vaccinations in more than an hour-long interaction. They were clear that the infections are predominantly transmitted from person to person through air and to a much lesser extent from touching steel or plastic surfaces where the virus can stay for at least a day. COVID does not spread through air outside but indoors in closed environment of rooms, restaurants, cinema halls, etc., and certainly not through drinking water. More infections have been happening among the younger people this time because of the opening of educational institutions and other sectors of the economy as this section was not infected last year, they said. The director said “masks can not only protect you from COVID-19 but also from many air-borne diseases, common cold, pollutants in this second wave. The symptoms and mortality rates among those infected is not significantly different from what was noticed in the first wave last year”. “Avoid indoor places where there is no air circulation like restaurants, bars and cinemas. Even if you have to go, get out of there fast and strictly avoid any kind of parties whether a wedding or birthday, religious and political gatherings or events are a strict no-no. Don’t talk to anyone without mask outside. Don’t bother much about virus variants and take the vaccine as it is safer compared to the COVID-19 infection,” said Dr. Mishra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/take-the-vaccine-urges-ccmb-director/article34419602.ece

The section connecting northern with southern region of the country will provide continuous third-line facility for train operations along a stretch of 64 km between Potkapalli – Mandamarri, including the third line on Godavari bridge between Manchiryal and Peddampet, informed SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya. Kazipet – Balharshah route majorly comes under Telangana and a minor portion in Maharashtra. This main line provides crucial rail connectivity to many cement clusters, coal screening plants and power houses situated in this section. Due to the continuous increase in both freight and passenger services in this route, the section had become over-saturated. To decongest this high-density section, tripling and electrification for 202 km (Telangana-159 km and Maharashtra-43 km) has been sanctioned in 2015-16 at an estimated cost of Rs. 2,063 crore. The third line work is being taken up simultaneously in different sections and progressing at a fast pace, he explained. Salient features in the line commissioned of late, Potkapalli yard has been remodelled with distributed electronic interlocking system consisting of 113 routes, 46 signals, 26 points and 50 track circuits, modern signalling etc. The work has been taken up with minimum impact on train operations and once the entire project is completed, more trains can be run in an efficient manner, informed chief public relations officer Ch.

27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court stays Telangana State Medical Council elections||Telangana High Court on Monday passed an order staying its earlier direction to hold elections to Telangana State Medical Council (TSMC). A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said elections to the TSMC should not be held till the issues relating to reduction of number of directly elected members were not finalised. The bench was hearing a petition filed by Dr. B. Arundhathi and two others challenging the government’s decision to reduce the number of directly elected members from 13 to five. Interestingly, the number of nominated members of the council was not changed. The petitioners’ counsel Sama Sandeep Reddy informed the court that in the State of Andhra Pradesh 13 members were directly elected while six were nominated. In the case of TSMC, the number of directly elected members was brought down so that the government can have a dominant role since the nominated members are more. Additional Advocate General J. Ramchandra Rao argued that the State government had the prerogative of amending the Acts pertaining to the erstwhile united State. The bench headed by the Chief Justice however sought to know what was the justification behind bringing down the number of elected members in the council. It directed the government to file a counter affidavit within four weeks. The matter was posted to June 17 for further hearing. In a separate matter, Justice K. Lakshman of Telangana High Court ordered notices to CBI seeking to know the role of Arjun Singh Oberoi, director of Trident five star hotel, in the alleged scam of Rs. 1,285 crore relating to securing loans from a consortium of banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-court-stays-telangana-state-medical-council-elections/article34419600.ece

27 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Implement Ayushman Bharat, demands BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday charged that it’s because of the negligence of the State government which is causing COVID-19 to spread fast with more than 7,000 positive cases being detected every day in the past six days. Around 5,500 are being treated in government hospitals whereas 13,500 are getting treatment in private hospitals, hence it is important to immediately take up implementation of the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ - the Centre’s medical insurance scheme, said senior party leader Gudur Narayana Reddy “Thousands of poor and middle class patients have been denied the opportunity of getting free treatment for COVID due to non-implementation whereas scores of people across the country are getting benefitted through cashless treatment in private hospitals,” he said in a statement. In fact, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh had dovetailed the Centre’s medical insurance through ‘Arogyasri’ scheme, he said and pointed out that the Telangana government had informed the Centre of implementing the Ayushman Bharat in December itself yet orders to this effect were not issued till now “The government neither added the treatment of COVID to Arogyasri nor implemented the Ayushman Bharat - leaving the poor and middle class people in the lurch when private hospitals are fleecing them with exorbitant bills. There is no control on charges for tests like CT scan and others, treatment in general wards and in the intensive care units either. People are being forced to sell their assets to pay the bills,” claimed Mr. Reddy. Had COVID-19 treatment been added to Arogyasri scheme, several patients would have got treatment without any financial burden and if Ayushman Bharat Scheme was implemented, it would have covered treatment costs but now hundreds of families are slipping into poverty with each passing day, he regretted. The BJP leader accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of making “tall promises but forgets their implementation”. The Rs. 2,500 crore for free vaccination too falls into the same category as no steps have been initiated to take it up in right earnest, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/implement-ayushman-bharat-demands-bjp/article34419603.ece

However, the bulletin issued by the district authorities claimed that the cumulative number of fatalities due to coronavirus since last year was only 74. The officials repeatedly claimed that there have been no deaths due to coronavirus in the district since beginning of the second wave.

Officials at the field reported that a 32-year-old woman at Nagadhar in Kalher mandal and a 52-year-old man at Chimnapur in Kandi mandal and another person from Manoor also succumbed to COVID-19. However, these numbers did not figure in the bulletin released by the in-charge District Medical and Health Officer Gayatri Devi on Monday. On their part the officials in the Health department are saying that they are releasing figures provide by State authorities. Numbers don’t add up Similarly, it has been claimed in the bulletin that only two persons are getting treatment at private hospitals in the district and one person getting treated at the government hospital in the district. However, the reality is very different. There are more than 100 persons who are being treated at various private hospitals in the district headquarters alone, leave alone other private hospitals in the district. According reliable sources, three deaths occurred in the district headquarters hospital due to complications arising out of COVID-19 in the last one week.

27 April 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Poll campaign peaks in Siddipet||The campaign for the election to Siddipet Municipality peaked with only 24 hours remaining for campaigning for the civic body elections. As far as the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi is concerned, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has taken up the total responsibility right from selection of candidates to ensure their victory at the hustings. From BJP it is Dubbak MLA M. Raghunandan Rao who has taken the onus of steering his party through the elections while it is former MLA T. Narsa Reddy of the Congress party who is working hard to ensure his party wins the elections. The campaigners are focusing on house-to-house campaign rather than public meetings in view of COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings. However, at some places considerably large number of people gathered to attend the campaigning and many of them not wearing masks and social distancing going for a toss. Mr. Harish Rao campaigned in ward numbers 8, 9, 12, 27, 29, 30, 41, 42 and 43. “Siddipet become a model for the State and we have to continue this. Your complete support is essential to continue the development. There is no drinking water problem now and every house is being supplied with safe drinking water. Underground drainage works, taken up with a cost of around Rs. 300 crore, is nearing completion and 80 % of the work was over. Rs. 1,100 crore was spent on double bedroom houses in the district headquarters alone. Chose between who work for you and who come at the time of polling only and seek votes,” said Mr. Harish Rao while addressing voters. As part of election campaign, BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar participated in election campaign rally in the town. He claimed that Centre has contributed major chunk of funds for the development of Siddipet and dared Mr. Harish Rao to come open with a white paper on the source of funds. He said that 2,977 double bedroom houses were sanctioned for Siddipet by the Centre and the TRS is claiming as if it was given by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/poll-campaign-peaks-in-siddipet/article34419725.ece

27 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi court grants bail to Deep Sidhu in Red Fort violence case||A Delhi court on Monday granted bail to actor-activist Deep Sidhu, arrested in connection with the violence and resultant damage at the Red Fort during the Republic Day farmers’ rally earlier this year. Mr. Sidhu was arrested on February 9 in connection with an FIR registered on January 27. He was granted regular bail on April 16. However, before he could be released from prison, the police arrested him in connection with another FIR, which was registered on January 28 pertaining to the same incident. Metropolitan magistrate Sahil Gupta said, “The need and timing of the arrest is highly questionable because despite knowing that the accused [Mr. Sidhu] has been lodged in JC [judicial custody] since February 09, 2021, he was arrested only on April 17, 2021, when he was granted regular bail.” “This clearly suggests that it was an attempt to defeat the bail order dated April 16...and is a grave affront to personal liberty of the accused and runs foul of rights guaranteed under Article 21,” the court said. “Such vicious and sinister action of investigative authorities amounts to playing fraud with established criminal process and shows scant regard to constitutional protections enshrined, protected and cherished under the Constitution on India,” the court remarked. Noting that Mr. Sidhu’s “further incarceration in the present case would bear no fruit and therefore would be unjustified”, the court granted bail but ordered him to join the investigation as and when called.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-court-grants-bail-to-deep-sidhu-in-red-fort-violence-case/article34419552.ece

It had been lying closed for years. The Chief Minister said this after visiting the medical college. He said the doctors at Gold Fields Institute of Medical Sciences and Research would be deputed from the Indian Army and the hospital would be functional in the next two or three days. ‘Two more hospitals’ Mr. Lal, while interacting with the media persons, said that as the number of COVID-19 patients in the State had increased, undoubtedly the pressure on hospitals too had increased. “There was some difficulty regarding oxygen supply but we are leaving no stone unturned to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen. We are going to build two hospitals having a bed capacity of 500 each in Panipat and Hisar with the help of DRDO. Both the hospital sites have also been inspected,” he said. He also said there is no shortage of medicines in the State. “There is no shortage of Remdesivir injection in government hospitals. There have been some problems in private hospitals. For this, the government has now started supervision of dealers who are supplying the medicine to private hospitals as well,” said Mr. Lal. Haryana Health and Home Minister Anil Vij said that amid ongoing COVID-19 situation, 20 vehicles each of “DIAL 112” would be deployed in all the districts to be used as ambulances. He said the MBBS and final-year PG students studying in medical colleges would also be deputed in hospitals. The State government employees suffering from COVID-19 infection would be provided with the facility of cashless treatment in private hospitals. Gurugram district administration claimed that it was working round-the-clock to ensure hassle-free oxygen supply to all major hospitals listed onhttp://covidggn.com.

27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Shortage of beds, oxygen, cremation slots leaves Capital in a shambles||With the issue of shortage of beds continuing in the national capital, search for beds and then long wait at hospitals have proved to be agonising for attendants and relatives of patients, they rued. For Veena, one such attendant waiting outside the emergency wing of Moolchand Hospital, battling helplessness and hoping for a miracle is all that goes on throughout the day, she said. “My husband tested positive around nine days back and he was completely fine all these days. On Sunday his oxygen saturation dipped suddenly and then began our search for hospitals. It was not easy and after facing a lot of difficulties we reached Moolchand Hospital. He has been kept in the emergency ward as there are no vacant beds,” she said. The Jungpura Extension resident added, “This hospital has also asked us to look for beds elsewhere but where do we go now? We have checked everywhere and there does not seem to be any vacancy anywhere. All I have been doing is pray for him. I do not know what else to do.” South Delhi resident Sonam, who admitted her father at Irene Hospital in Kalkaji, said: “His saturation levels were not right so we had to admit him immediately. Finding a bed itself was a huge task and we had to go to several other hospitals before we finally got a bed here.” While a steady stream of cars and ambulances kept visiting the emergency wings of hospitals, several also had to leave due to the paucity of beds. For Gurugram resident Yogesh Rajpal, the painful experience did not seem to end with the lack of beds – rather it continued to the lack of slots in crematoriums as well. “My father passed away on Saturday night and even though it has been almost two days, the body has still not been released. On Sunday, we were told that the Lodhi Road crematorium is full so the hospital cannot release the body. As of Monday morning we were informed that we need to take the body to a crematorium in Sarai Kale Khan, but it has been two hours and the ambulance has not yet arrived,” said Mr. Rajpal. Recounting his plight over the past few days, Mr. Rajpal added, “My dad did not even get a chance to get shifted out of the emergency ward. He ideally needed a ventilator but none were available and we finally lost him. The situation is terrible as the entire city is in a shambles. There are no beds, no ventilators, no oxygen – the list of issues being faced by patients is endless.” At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), patients on stretchers bordered the entrance of the emergency wing. Sharib Khan, a resident of the Batla House area, said: “My uncle met with an accident and when we got him here we found out that he had tested positive. It has been three days that we are waiting outside. We are helpless as we cannot do anything from outside.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/shortage-of-beds-oxygen-cremation-slots-leaves-capital-in-a-shambles/article34419225.ece

Mohammed Shamim, a third-generation grave-digger of Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, said that on Sunday and Monday, he has asked people to take bodies to cemeteries in Yamuna Khadar, Mangolpuri, and Shastri Park.

We are almost out of space and barely being able to manage,” he said. “ Jab tak chalaya jaega tab tak chalaenge, fir bandh kar denge [We will continue till we can...then we will shut it],” he added. The grave-digger had written to his committee members regarding the space crunch earlier this month and they had written to the Lieutenant-Governor and the Chief Minister via email regarding the matter, he said. The committee members demanded that they be allowed to use the space near Millenium Park, which was allegedly shut at the time of the outbreak of the pandemic. However, there is no movement on the issue, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-gate-cemetery-diverts-bodies-citing-space-crunch/article34419218.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh directed the government to decide the representation, by a nursing officer, in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case and keeping in mind earlier directions passed by the government on the issue in June 2020. The court said, “The decision be taken as early as possible and practicable.” With the observation, the Bench disposed of the plea by nursing officer Sinu John who has alleged in her plea that there have been instances of denial of beds by hospitals to patients who were in a critical state and needed immediate medical attention. In her petition, filed through advocates Robin Raju and M.P. Srivignesh, the nursing officer has said that in the wake of the alarming rise of COVID-19 cases in the country and Delhi in particular, the demand for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders has also increased like never before and there are queues outside many hospitals. “Many have lost their lives because they neither got proper medical attention nor accurate information regarding availability of beds. The present situation thus warrants some new measures that will help withstand this new wave of COVID-19... there is a dire need to direct all the hospitals in the city to place big display boards preferably digital boards outside their hospitals, which gives the information about the total beds in the hospital, the available beds, data regarding availability of ventilators and oxygen cylinders,” the petition had said. Ms. John contended that such a measure would ensure transparency with regard to availability of beds, oxygen and ventilators in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/govt-told-to-decide-on-displaying-bed-availability/article34419216.ece

27 April 2021||Pune,||Cong. unhappy at NCP leader’s announcement of free vaccines||A day after senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Minister Nawab Malik said that the Maharashtra government was in favour of providing free vaccination to its citizens above 18 years, the announcement has triggered a schism within the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government, with the Congress on Monday expressing displeasure over the NCP leader’s statement. Revenue Minister and senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said that while the Congress too was eager that all citizens between 18 and 45 years must be given free vaccines, the declaration should not have come at a time when the matter was under active consideration by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. “We did not like the fact that someone who was eager to take credit should have made a premature announcement. The Congress expresses its displeasure over this,” Mr. Thorat said, . The Shiv Sena too chose to tread warily to Mr. Malik’s pronouncement. Minutes after tweeting about “free Covid-19 vaccination in Maharashtra” as his government’s duty to protect citizens from the virus, State Cabinet Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Sunday immediately deleted his tweet and apologised for creating “confusion.” In his new post, the younger Mr. Thackeray said he did not wish to create any confusion regarding the “official vaccination policy of Maharashtra that would be fully ensuring fast, efficient vaccination and would leave nobody behind.” Meanwhile, the Opposition BJP pounced on Mr. Aaditya Thackeray’s deleted tweet, with Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis questioning its meaning at a time when the MVA allies were speaking in different voices over the provision of free vaccines. “There are different statements being made by leaders of the three alliance parties … Mr. Aaditya Thackeray deletes his tweet after declaring that providing free vaccines to Maharashtra’s citizens is his government’s duty. What does all this signify?” Mr. Fadnavis said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-unhappy-at-ncp-leaders-announcement-of-free-vaccines/article34419227.ece
27 April 2021||Pune,||Supriya Sule appeals to Uddhav for fire prevention and control policy||In the wake of recent hospital fires in Bhandup and Vasai-Virar that resulted in the deaths of several COVID-19 patients, Baramati MP and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Supriya Sule has written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray urging him to formulate a fire prevention and control policy. Importantly, Ms. Sule has put forth an innovative plan to overhaul the structure of the Fire Safety Department while making it more responsible. Stating that despite the Assembly having enacted the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act in 2006 that set provisions and established institutions to control fires, Ms. Sule said that zilla parishads and gram panchayats in the rural hinterland lacked fire brigades as opposed to their urban municipal counterparts. “There is also no standardisation in the implementation of fire audit protocols across the State,” she said, pointing to understaffing and poor training in local fire departments. Attributing the poor upkeep in equipment to small budgets and competing priorities of local urban bodies, the NCP leader urged Mr. Thackeray to empower the director of the Fire Department to raise a State Fire Control Force. She has suggested that the director of Fire Safety be upgraded to the rank and scale of a departmental commissioner and be made a cadre post of the Indian Administrative Service at a junior administrative grade while the directorate be overhauled and given responsibilities of implementing fire safety rules. The Maharashtra Fire Control Force could be headed by an officer of the IPS cadre of the rank and scale of Director General of Police by adding more responsibility to the position of DG (Civil Defence) and all fire brigades in the State be brought under his command, the MP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/supriya-sule-appeals-to-uddhav-for-fire-prevention-and-control-policy/article34419231.ece

27 April 2021||Moscow,||Russia suspends Navalny group’s activities||Russian prosecutors on Monday suspended the activities of Alexei Navalny’s regional offices, in a move his team said would essentially shut down the jailed opposition figure’s movement. The move comes after Mr. Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic, ended a hunger strike last week that he had launched to demand proper medical treatment in prison. A court in Moscow on Monday began proceedings into designating Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and its regional offices “extremist” after prosecutors requested they be added to a list run by Russia’s Anti-Terrorism Committee. “The activities of Navalny’s offices and FBK were immediately suspended,” FBK’s director Ivan Zhdanov wrote on Twitter, attaching screenshots of a prosecutor’s decision. The Moscow City Court confirmed that the activities of the group’s regional network were suspended, but clarified that prosecutors had the power to make the decision and said a final decision designating the group as extremist was due. Mr. Navalny’s office in Moscow said in a statement the group will already “no longer be able to work” as usual. “It would be too dangerous for our employees and for our supporters,” it said. The team promised to continue fighting corruption, the ruling United Russia party and President Vladimir Putin “in a personal capacity”. “It will not be easy to fight, but we will win absolutely, because there are many of us and we are strong.” Germany condemned the order, with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert saying that “using the instruments of fighting terror against politically undesirable opinions is in no way compatible with the principles of the rule of law”. Prosecutors on Friday said they had requested the extremism label for FBK and its regional offices because they are actively “creating conditions for the destabilisation of the social and socio-political situation.” Routine arrests It also accused them of working to alter “the foundations of the constitutional order”. There are currently 33 organisations on Russia’s extremism list, including the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda. The groups are banned from operating in Russia and participating in their activities can result in lengthy prison terms. FBK’s members had already faced routine police searches and arrests for their activism, with the pressure ballooning since Navalny returned to Russia in January from Germany where he had been recovering from a poisoning attack. The 44-year-old was arrested on his return and is now serving two-and-a-half years in a penal colony for violating parole terms on old fraud charges he says are politically motivated. Most of his top allies have since been placed under house arrest or left the country, with several announcing publicly their were quitting FBK after prosecutors requested the extremism tag. Earlier this month, a Russian court jailed FBK cameraman Pavel Zelensky for two years on charges of inciting extremism online. It cited two tweets saying that he hated Mr. Putin, among other officials, adding they did not deserve to be alive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-suspends-navalny-groups-activities/article34418883.ece
27 April 2021||London,||For Hopkins, a second Oscar cements legacy of greatness||Anthony Hopkins has spent a glittering career exploring the full depths of human experience, whether playing the sadistic Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs or a frail and frightened dementia sufferer in The Father . But long before making the transition from psychopathic cannibal to a weakened man facing his own death, the Welsh-born naturalised American had earned his place in acting’s halls of fame with decades of stage and screen performances. “I keep it simple. Just learn the lines and show up,” was how the 83-year-old described his method of acting, preferring to endlessly go over his script so he could “do it without thinking”. On Sunday, he added another shiny award to his trophy case — his second Oscar for best actor. Mr. Hopkins was not present in Los Angeles or at a separate London venue to accept the golden statuette. But with it, he became the oldest actor in Oscars history to win a competitive award, surpassing the late Christopher Plummer, who won at age 82.  Nomadland star Frances McDormand joined Hollywood’s most elite tier on Sunday with her third acting Oscar — for a characteristically unglamorous portrayal of a grieving widow living in an old van. Ms. McDormand becomes only the seventh actor with triple Academy Awards, and the fourth woman after Meryl Streep, Ingrid Bergman and Katharine Hepburn, who stands alone at the pinnacle with four Oscars. She also shared the best picture Oscar for the film, as she was one of its producers. “I have no words. My voice is in my sword. We know the sword is our work. And I like work. Thank you for knowing that. And thanks for this,” Ms. McDormand told the limited audience at Union Station in Los Angeles. Daniel Kaluuya won best supporting actor for his portrayal of slain 1960s Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah , which also won best song for multiple Grammy winner H.E.R. References to racism and police violence were threaded throughout the show’s speeches, starting with actor-director Regina King’s opening monologue, in which she mentioned the conviction of a former police officer for the murder of African-American man George Floyd.  Promising Young Woman won best original screenplay, the night’s first award.  Soul became Pixar’s latest Oscar winner for best animated feature, and also picked up best score while South African aquatic wildlife feature My Octopus Teacher won best documentary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/for-hopkins-a-second-oscar-cements-legacy-of-greatness/article34418889.ece
27 April 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka braces for third COVID-19 wave||Preparing  for a possible third wave of the coronavirus following a recent spike in cases, Sri Lanka on Monday said all schools in the Western Province, where capital Colombo is located, and the North Western Province will be closed. Over the last few days, Sri Lanka recorded about 800 cases or more a day, taking the total number of cases reported in the island to over one lakh, and the number of fatalities to 644, as of Monday morning. Over 6,000 cases are currently active. The National Operations Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak reported 892 positive cases on Monday. Several public health commentators attributed the recent surge in cases to gatherings around the Sinhala and Tamil New Year that was celebrated on April 14. With a near 22 million-strong population, Sri Lanka made news last year for effectively containing the pandemic’s spread, with a stringent lockdown. However, subsequent clusters emerged, posing a huge challenge for the government, which is also faced with a severe economic blow since the pandemic. “We are carrying out research to see if these [recent cases] are of a new variant,” the country’s Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera said. “Hospitals are reporting that they are receiving many younger patients who are in need of oxygen support or ICU beds,” he told The Hindu . President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Sunday said “the only solution to the pandemic is vaccination”, while appearing to rule out lockdowns or curfews that “developing countries such as Sri Lanka cannot take,” as the economy would be obstructed. It is with the aim of reviving its economy and boosting foreign earnings that Sri Lanka opened its borders earlier this year. Earlier this month, Sri Lanka began a “travel bubble” with India that authorities said will continue despite the raging wave in India, despite earlier announcing a postponement of the arrangement. Vaccination drive Sri Lanka has so far administered the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine to 925,242 people, the President’s office said in a statement. Sri Lanka commenced its vaccination drive in late January, after India gifted 5,00,000 doses of Covishield vaccine. Sri Lanka has placed further orders with India, and is sourcing the Russian made ‘Sputnik’ vaccine, Sinopharm from China. In addition, the State Pharmaceutical Corporation has already signed the preliminary agreements required for the importation of the Pfizer vaccine and the Government is in the process of importing the vaccine as soon as possible,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-braces-for-third-covid-19-wave/article34418885.ece
27 April 2021||London,||Johnson under fire over ‘let bodies pile high’ comment||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a call to resign on Monday after claims he dismissed the prospect of thousands dying from COVID-19, as a row over government “sleaze” escalated. In a front-page headline, the Daily Mail newspaper reported Mr. Johnson had said he would rather see “bodies pile high in their thousands” than impose a third coronavirus lockdown. Ultimately, Mr. Johnson did order a new round of restrictions in January. But he is now locked in a damaging war of words with his former top aide Dominic Cummings over his coronavirus policies last year and financial dealings. Asked if he made the remark, Mr. Johnson told reporters: “No, but I think the important thing I think people want us to get on and do as a government is to make sure that the lockdowns work.” The main opposition Labour party wants an urgent inquiry into Mr. Cummings’ claims made in an explosive blog post. “We cannot go on like this day after day with the drip, drip, drip of allegations,” said Labour leader Keir Starmer. “We need to get to the bottom of it because I think for a lot of people, this is beginning to feel very strongly like one rule for them and another rule for everybody else.” ‘Utterly abhorrent’ But the Scottish National Party (SNP)’s leader in the U.K. Parliament, Ian Blackford, went further, demanding Mr. Johnson step down if his comments are confirmed. “These comments are utterly abhorrent. If they are true, @BorisJohnson has a duty to resign,” he tweeted. “The Prime Minister must now come to Parliament to give a statement, and face questioning on these shocking claims and the growing Tory sleaze scandal engulfing Westminster.” Mr. Johnson has faced sharp criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. In Britain, one of the countries worst hit in the world by the disease, more than 1,27,000 people have died from COVID-19. But increasingly the Prime Minister is facing questions over his wider judgement and integrity, following weeks of stories about alleged inappropriate lobbying and special favours. Mr. Cummings, the strategist behind the 2016 campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, quit Downing Street in December under a cloud of acrimony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/johnson-under-fire-over-let-bodies-pile-high-comment/article34418887.ece
27 April 2021||Mogadishu,||Somali opposition fighters cordon off parts of capital||Somali opposition fighters took up positions in parts of the tense capital on Monday, a day after clashes with government troops erupted over the President’s bid to extend his mandate. Witnesses reported that armed men and vehicles mounted with machine guns were stationed in opposition strongholds, while key roads in Mogadishu were blocked. “Both the Somali security forces and the pro-opposition fighters have taken positions along some key roads,” witness Abdullahi Mire told AFP. Somalia, already fragile after decades of civil war and an Islamist insurgency, is facing its worst political crisis in recent years after the failure to hold planned elections in February. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, best known by his nickname Farmajo, has faced harsh criticism from foreign allies after signing a law approved by parliament which extended his mandate by two years. On Sunday night, sporadic bursts of heavy gunfire rang out across the capital after fighting broke out between government forces and soldiers allied to the various opposition leaders. The clashes — mainly in the northern neighbourhoods of Sanca and Marinaya and the busy KM4 crossroads in the centre — began after dozens of opposition supporters marched in protest against Mr. Farmajo’s term extension. There were no immediate reports of casualties.- ‘Stop the fighting’ - Tensions remained high on Monday, with some people trying to leave their homes in tense neighbourhoods. “People are starting to flee from Bermudo area where the pro-opposition fighters have taken positions last night, the situation is tense and there can be an armed confrontation anytime if the situation remain the same,” Fadumo Ali, a resident of one of the tense neighbourhoods told AFP. Mogadishu residents urged both sides to stop fighting, and complained that electricity and water had been cut. “We need both sides to stop the fighting, have sympathy with the children and elderly,” said Farah Hassan. Witnesses elsewhere reported roads blocked by sand and logs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/somali-opposition-fighters-cordon-off-parts-of-capital/article34418894.ece

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Undermining ‘vaccination for all’||Just when the spread of COVID-19 has reached catastrophic proportions, with the daily case-load rising faster than that seen anywhere in the world since the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Government of India has acted by unveiling  a completely revamped vaccine strategy. Two key elements are the hallmark of this new strategy, which will be implemented from May 1. First, the phased roll-out of the vaccination drive initiated on January 16 under which the vaccine-eligible sections of the population were gradually increased, has now been extended to the entire adult population, namely, to those above 18 years. Second, and more importantly, a significant deregulation of the vaccine market has been effected and vaccine manufacturers have the freedom to sell 50% of their vaccine production to State governments and private hospitals, and at prices that can be substantially higher than that hitherto fixed by the government. A third element of the vaccine strategy, which was not announced formally, is a grant of Rs. 45 billion to the two vaccine manufacturers, the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, to boost their capacities. Handing over the reins The new vaccine strategy raises a number of questions, not the least from the manner in which the central government has given up its control over the market for vaccines, a key feature of the vaccine roll-out plans thus far. This issue assumes further significance since the Government of India is well aware, as all public authorities around the world are, about the significance of vaccinating every citizen in the country; “none of us will be safe until everyone is safe”. It is, therefore, vitally important that public health authorities in the country take an objective view of the realities of the country before adopting strategies for vaccine availability, for this is absolutely critical for resetting lives and livelihoods disrupted by the pandemic. Several facts suggest that this has not done while rejigging the extant vaccine strategy. Vaccine exports The phased roll-out of the government’s ambitious vaccination drive, beginning with health-care and frontline workers in January, followed by the gradual inclusion of senior citizens and people above 45 years in March and April, respectively, was in sync with the availability of vaccines in the country. Although SII, the largest vaccine producer, had initially promised to supply 100 million doses of vaccines a month, in reality it could provide between 50 million to 60 million doses. But, given that India too saw a degree of “vaccine-scepticism”, the Government of India found itself in a situation where it could promise exports of vaccines to 95 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia. As of April 26, these countries have received more than 66.4 million doses of vaccines from India (https://bit.ly/3eAvGYW). Until now, nearly 142 million vaccine doses have been administered in the country, the third highest in the world. However, in terms of population share, less than 2% has received both vaccine doses, while less than 9% has received one dose (https://bit.ly/3aFvO8A). But there is one worrying facet, which is that a demand-supply mismatch has begun to appear as the coverage of the vaccine-eligible population expanded. The largest supplier, SII, gave two explanations for its inability to meet its commitments. The first was that the United States Government had used a Cold War piece of legislation, the Defense Production Act, to restrict exports of vaccine culture and other essential materials. Second, the company complained that it lacked the financial capacity to expand its production, requesting a grant of Rs. 30 billion from the government (https://bit.ly/2S8z3iB). Onus on States It is the face of this vaccine supply-crunch that the government has announced the new vaccine strategy, by opening vaccination to all adults in the country, and allowing vaccine producers to sell 50% of their production directly to State governments and private hospitals. The new strategy shifts the onus onto the State governments, which have to take decisions regarding free vaccination for people above 18 years, while the central government would continue to support vaccination for people above 45 years, and health-care workers and frontline workers. The government has not fixed the vaccine prices and has allowed the producers to pre-declare the prices they would charge from the State governments and private hospitals, a sharp departure from the extant strategy. Thus far, government facilities have provided vaccines free of cost, while private facilities are allowed to charge no more than Rs. 250 per dose. The central government played the role of a sole procurement agency that helped in driving down prices, thus addressing the issue of affordable access to vaccines. However, the new strategy abandons this mechanism and fragments the market into three layers namely, central government procurement, State government procurement and the private hospitals. This layering of the market would allow the producers to charge high prices from the State governments and private hospitals. In fact, both SII and Bharat Biotech have immediately announced their intentions to raise vaccine prices. SII will sell Covishield to State governments and private hospitals would have at Rs. 400 and Rs. 600 per dose, respectively (https://bit.ly/3gFCFmf), while the corresponding figures for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin are Rs. 600 and Rs. 1,200 per dose (https://bit.ly/3t1sb3j). The new strategy would shift the burden of vaccination of the young population, namely, those between 18-44 years, entirely on the State governments. This implies that the vaccination of a significant section of the population depends on the financial health of each State government, resulting in inequitable access to vaccines across States. Moreover, given their poor state of finances, most State governments may not be able to procure the required number of vaccine doses to meet the demands of the targeted population. In such a situation, a large share of the vaccine quota (50% of domestic production) earmarked for the State governments and the private hospitals could end up with the latter. In the U.S. The decision to substantially deregulate the vaccine market raises serious questions in view of the reported advance of Rs. 45 billion made by the Government of India to the two vaccine producers in India for expanding their production capacities (https://bit.ly/3eveFzr). The Federal government in the United States has done similarly, providing financial support to vaccine producers, who are now set to rake in their billions by charging high prices. Several public interest groups in the U.S. have asked questions as to why the tax-paying public should bear the high prices of vaccines when Federal taxes have been used to beef up the vaccine producers. This question is more pertinent in India, where access to affordable vaccines is critical for ensuring “vaccination for all”. More open licensing needed It is somewhat ironic that the new vaccine strategy, which could undermine “vaccination for all”, comes from a country that has long championed the cause of access to affordable medicines in international forums. Rather than hand over the reins of price determination to the duopoly in the vaccine market, the government should have urgently addressed the serious doubts over affordability of vaccines by ensuring a competitive market for vaccines. According to recent estimates, existing producers in India will be unable to meet the country’s vaccine requirements by some distance, and therefore, India needs more vaccine manufacturers to ensure uninterrupted supply. One positive step that the government has taken in this direction is to increase production of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine through the involvement of three public sector undertakings, including Haffkine Institute. We would argue that there is a need for more open licensing of this vaccine to scale up production. This would enhance competition in the market, enabling the vaccines to reach every citizen in the country.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||An idea on taxation that is worth a try||United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen’s proposal for global coordination of corporate taxation has huge implications. She has proposed a global minimum tax rate. If the major world economies agree and the U.S. Congress approves the increased tax rates, it would constitute a reversal of the trend in tax policies since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc 30 years back. Would Ms. Yellen succeed in convincing OECD countries and the U.S. Congress? David R. Malpass, President of the World Bank, representing the interest of global capital, has voiced his opposition. He was shooting from the shoulders of the poor countries when he said the proposal “...would hinder poor countries’ ability to attract investment”. The initiative which has been long overdue is being forced on the rich countries by the impact of the pandemic. Presently, governments need resources to help people through transfer of incomes, provision of more public services and also prevent business failures. But their resources have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn. Consequently, fiscal deficits have reached record high levels. In the pre-pandemic era, such levels of deficit would have led to the tanking of the stock markets but now they are booming in anticipation of demand being pumped in by these high deficits. The result is a massive increase in inequality between those who have gained in the stock markets and those who have lost employment and incomes. Massive deficits in the budget The Joe Biden administration is proposing a massive $3 trillion package to boost the economy. A large part of this will be spent in 2021 but some of it will be staggered. This will be in addition to the $1.9 trillion package of relief already approved soon after the Biden administration took office. This package came after former President Donald Trump signed on the $900 billion stimulus package in end December 2020 and more than $2 trillion in mid-2020. Thus, in addition to the pre-existing deficits in the budget an additional 15% of GDP is being added in both 2020 and 2021. These are unprecedented levels. Additional tax collections can help reduce these large deficits and that is the reason for the U.S. administration’s current proposal. But businesses and conservative legislators will resist. However, some rich Americans like Jeff Bezos have supported the idea of taxing the rich more. Such proposals have been around since 2011 when many of the rich in the U.S. and Europe had supported higher taxation on the rich. Warren Buffet had floated this proposal to strengthen capitalist economies after the global financial crisis of 2007-09. Subsequently, this proposal has come up several times. But, instead of raising the tax rate on corporations, the Trump administration cut the highest marginal tax rate from 35% to 21% with effect from January 1, 2018. This gives a hint as to why it is both difficult to raise corporation tax rates and why Ms. Yellen has proposed a global agreement on corporate taxation. When the Soviet Bloc collapsed in 1990, nations in east Europe were badly hit and needed capital infusion to overcome their economic woes. To attract global capital, they cut their tax rates sharply. This resulted in a ‘race to the bottom’. Nations in Europe were forced to cut their tax rates one after the other to not only attract capital but also to prevent capital from leaving their shores. This had global implications. Nations became short of resources and cut back expenditures on public services and encouraged privatisation. Governments lacked resources for education, health and civic amenities. The developing countries followed suit even though private markets do not cater to the poor. Thus, disparities increased within nations. BEPS and loss of revenue The world experienced Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS). Namely, companies shifted their profits to low tax jurisdictions, especially, the tax havens. For instance, many of the most profitable companies like Google and Facebook are accused of shifting their profits to Ireland and other tax havens and paying little tax. EU has levied fines on Google and Apple for such practices. Former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009 had said that the U.S. was losing $100 billion in taxes due to such practices. Since all the OECD countries have suffered due to cuts in tax rates and BEPS, initiatives have been taken to check these practices. But they will not succeed unless there is agreement among all the countries. Any country facing economic adversity can cut its tax rates to attract capital and force others to follow suit. India has also cut its tax rates since the 1990s. Most recently in 2019 the corporation tax rate was cut drastically to match those prevailing in Southeast Asia. Such cuts have implications for both inequality as well as for funding the schemes for the poor and the quality of public services. The regressive tax structure Another implication of the reductions in direct tax rates has been that governments have increasingly depended on the regressive indirect taxes for revenue generation. Value-Added Tax and Goods and Services Tax have been increasingly used to get more revenues. This impacts the less well-off proportionately more and is inflationary. Direct taxes tend to lower the post-tax income inequality. The rising inequalities result in shortage of demand in the economy and to its slowing down which then requires more investment and that calls for more concessions to capital. However, that does not guarantee revival because investment in response to a tax cut is uncertain. Instead, increased government expenditures are sure to raise demand. Global financial capital which is highly mobile has effectively used tax havens and shell companies to shift profits and capital across the globe. This mobility has enabled it to extract concessions from countries by making them compete with each other to match the concessions given by another — that is the ‘race to the bottom’. So, without global coordination, corporation tax rates cannot be raised. The U.S. is crucial to this coordination — without its cooperation and agreeing, other countries cannot raise the rates. Now that the U.S. is taking the lead, perhaps this will happen even though it will not be easy given the clout of global capital in the corridors of power in all countries. There will also have to be cooperation among countries to tackle the lure of the tax havens by enacting suitable global policies. The impact of all this will be far-reaching impacting inequalities, provision of public services and reduction of flight of capital from developing countries such as India and that will impact poverty. So, a global minimum tax rate is worth a try in spite of the objection raised by the World Bank President.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Another wave spells more nutrition loss||The political and social handling of the COVID-19 pandemic have added to the persisting issues of food insecurity faced by millions in India even prior to the novel coronavirus pandemic India consistently has ranked poorly in all international rankings on hunger (ranking 102 among 117 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2019). With the second, more vigorous wave of COVID-19, the inability of those already on the brink of subsistence to absorb a second economic shock cannot be overlooked even as the current health crisis is creating havoc. Rural distress specifically needs closer examination and urgent policy attention. Data collection, findings The Rapid Rural Community Response, or RCRC (https://bit.ly/3etWSsE) to COVID-19, a collective of over 60 non-governmental organisations has collected three rounds of data since the lockdown. The data provide crucial evidence of the nature and persistence of food and financial insecurity among the poor residing in rural areas. The third round conducted between December 2020-January 2021 has collected data from 11,766 households across 64 districts, in Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. Cutting down on food The most recent data suggest a persistence of cutting down on food even nine months after the first lockdown, during the seeming “revival” period. While 40% of the sample cut down on food during the first lockdown, an alarming 25% reportedly continued to cut down on food during the most recent survey conducted between December and January 2021. Households reported cutting down on nutritious food — 80% cut down on milk, vegetables, pulses and oil (around 50% reported cutting down on pulses alone). Disaggregating the figure, we find that the poorer, socially marginalised Dalits, and those with lesser access to food security schemes (such as migrants) faced more severe food insecurity. Comparing similar households, we find households in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand were faring among the worst performing States. These reductions will undoubtedly further accelerate the impending effects on children’s nutrition, as highlighted in the National Family Health Survey or NFHS-V (2019-20) and the Global Food Policy Report, 2021. The loss in nutrition may have come as a consequence of people losing their jobs and/or being pushed into lower income brackets over time due to the nature and handling of the pandemic. Reduction in incomes Pew Research Center has indicated that the middle class in India has shrunk by over 32 million households in the past year (https://pewrsr.ch/2R3J3sU). We find an indication of a downward shift in incomes even among a much poorer sample of households. Our survey suggests an over 70% reported reduction in incomes post the pandemic, with many falling into significant precarity. While 55% of households recalled earning less than Rs. 5,000 per month prior to the pandemic, around 74% reported doing so in December 2020-January 2021. It is thus unsurprising that around 30% households were also seeking loans, and among them, at least half of them reported needing loans for food, all indicative of the debilitating food and financial insecurities that poor households continue to face. Migrants on the margins The second wave of the pandemic comes on the back of an uneven recovery and persistence of crippling food and financial insecurity among the poorest households, especially migrants. Migrants who have travelled to cities only months ago are again travelling back to their villages. In our sample, 74% households had migrant members who had returned to the village during or after the lockdown (in mid-2020); 57% among them had gone back to the destination city by December-January, with 59% of those remaining also wanting to go back. It was the relatively disadvantaged who had not been able to find their way back to the cities. There was limited support for migrants even in existing social protection schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). For example, among the poorest, households with migrants were more likely to seek work than those without (43% versus 32%), but less likely to get work (49% versus 59%) under the scheme. It is clear that households have not had a chance to rebuild, and with many completely exhausting their savings and facing massive debt, they are bound to be more severely hit than last year. In the face of such a threat, including high unemployment that is steadily rising again, the state must ensure immediate, sustained action. Food security is a must The Government has promised to restart the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) with 5 kg of rice/wheat per person per month for the next two months (https://bit.ly/3gE4xqQ). The government needs to provide similar support for stabler longer periods; expand the current offering to include nutritious foods like pulses; address issues faced in existing schemes such as MGNREGA (like delays in wages and rationing); and new schemes such as a potential urban employment scheme should be explored. Food security schemes such as ration provided to children through anganwadis , Public Distribution System and mid-day meal scheme in primary schools need to be ramped up systematically and urgently. For migrants stuck in cities without work, community kitchens (such as Amma canteens) are required. The most vulnerable will need more predictable and stable support than ever before.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||COVID-19’s triage challenge||The second COVID-19 wave has hit India with great ferocity. It’s déjà vu and more. Family, friends and colleagues are infected, hospitals are flooded with patients, there is a shortage of beds, and ambulances are screaming through the streets. There are curfews and lockdowns, and death is in the air. But there is something different about this wave. Apart from the difference in the disease pattern (infectivity is higher and younger people are being affected), a larger proportion of the elite has been infected. In Mumbai, high-rises have been more affected than slums. The elite have been rudely exposed to the dysfunctionality of our healthcare system which the poor have endured for years. The secure world of the privileged has been exposed. Imbalance between demand and supply of healthcare facilities is not peculiar to India. But there is something in our social DNA that could be making it worse. Categorising patients based on severity A time-tested, effective strategy to face the challenge of a sudden large load on the healthcare system is the concept of ‘triage’. This means that when there are a large number of people needing urgent care and there are limited resources, the victims are divided into multiple categories based on severity of disease. The most severe are treated first as any delay will cost lives. The rest are treated later as per their level of severity. This idea was first introduced by Napoleon’s military surgeons to treat battlefield injuries and showed immediate impact. It is now standard practice in many countries when treating mass casualties. It has also been used effectively during COVID-19. But triage is not a sterile, mechanical protocol insulated from its surroundings. Its wide acceptance and implementation are based on the powerful but complex principles of justice and solidarity. It is where the interests of everyone are put above the interest of an individual; where those who need care first are prioritised over those who can wait, irrespective of who they are. It works when there is social consensus on a level playing field. Right from the first wave, Mumbai has witnessed a rather unique effort by the Municipal Corporation to set up a single-window portal of helplines for hospital beds. For the first time, this includes both the public and private sector. There is, of course, an inherent bias in that the public beds are free but the private ones are paid though the charges are capped. A tiered system of observation, oxygen and ICU facilities is in place on paper. However, a few weeks ago, a rather exasperated Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai said that the system is under strain because people are insisting on private hospital beds. It would be unfair to fault a new Commissioner for a duality that has been cultivated over the years. I doubt whether many of us would easily use a public hospital today. After all, by design or habit, the sanitised world of private medicine is what the privileged have inhabited for years. Moreover, it is hard to remember any senior bureaucrat, politician or even doctor who has chosen to be treated in a public hospital in Mumbai for COVID-19. Even as the Municipal Commissioner was complaining, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people such as Sachin Tendulkar, Akshay Kumar and Rashmi Thackeray were admitted to large private hospitals as “abundant precaution”. There are many individuals admitted to private hospitals because they fear that they won’t get a bed if they need one suddenly. Serious triage doesn’t only prioritise the sickest over the less sick. It also discourages futile treatment for the very sick who are unlikely to benefit from the treatment. Thus, a 90-year-old who maybe otherwise bedridden could be refused admission or someone with an advanced untreatable cancer who develops COVID-19 may be put lower in priority . It’s the same principle of justice applied in the reverse. Executing triage in its truest sense is a big collective leap and needs a certain social sanction. It needs to be perceived to be fair and transparent. The person who gives up a bed does it with the understanding that as and when she really needs it, she will get it. Everyone falls in line towards a greater common good. Challenges In an unequal world, however, the challenges to this idea are immense. In India, a social triage based on class, caste and other hierarchies is everyday practice. Also, whatever the severity of the crisis, it is hard to imagine a determined neutral state implementing a strict triage. Finally, given the current dominance of the private sector, especially in intensive care, triage has to involve state control over the private sector. But if there was ever an opportune moment in this nation’s history to muster courage to implement genuine triage, it is now.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Protecting the police||Before the police could get fully vaccinated, the second wave of COVID-19 hit India more severely than anyone could have expected. Curfews and lockdowns have been imposed again in some regions to break the chain of transmission, but the challenges for the police are more varied and serious now. Challenges for the police Last year, most of the problem was limited to migrant labour following the nationwide lockdown — providing them ration, transport, and inter-State passes. The pandemic being the first of its kind for the current generation, the police faced a tough time enforcing the rules that came with various lockdowns. The punishment for violating COVID-19 protocols and lockdowns was kept mild. The police had other challenges too: there was a spurt in cases of cyber-fraud, particularly those relating to online purchases and phishing. The Supreme Court, in pursuance of a suo motu petition, ‘In Re: Contagion of Covid-19 Virus in Prisons’ (2020), instructed High Courts to decongest prisons in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak by releasing convicts on parole and under-trial prisoners (charged with offences punishable with maximum punishment up to seven years) who were in jail for three months or more on temporary bail. Except for a few instances of criticism here and there, the police received appreciation for its perseverance and sympathy for others. The situation appears to be more fearful and grimmer this time. With the steep spike in cases in just a fortnight, the number of hospital beds, ICU beds, medical oxygen, and drugs seems to be short of the rising demand. Though the administration is trying its best to defuse the situation by coordinating with various stakeholders, panic in certain pockets doesn’t appear to subside. The role of some mediapersons and social activists needs special mention here as they have kept the hopes alive for many desperate people by extending a helping hand in time. Another area of concern has been the disposal of bodies by the State authorities as per COVID-19 protocols. This is sometimes delayed due to the limited capacity of cremation grounds. Relatives are not able to bid adieu to their loved ones and perform their last rituals. Their agony is beyond redemption. Facing the brunt Needless to say, apart from healthcare workers of course, the brunt is being faced by the police, whether it is in tackling the menace of people hoarding scarcely available medical products or maintaining public order in front of hospitals. In addition to enforcing lockdowns and maintaining order, the police continue to perform their regular duties as well. In case an apprehended criminal is found COVID-19 positive, he needs to be quarantined before being produced before a magistrate. In heinous offences like murder and rape, arrests cannot be deferred. According to the prevalent jail protocol, criminals are permitted entry only if they test COVID-19 negative. The probability of policemen who are effecting arrests catching the infection is very high. So, for a policeman, being safe while being on duty is becoming difficult. Many policemen have succumbed to COVID-19 and numerous others are getting infected while helping others. According to a tweet on March 16, 2021 by the Indian Police Foundation, 1,207 security men (including policemen of the State police and Central Armed Police Forces personnel) have died of COVID-19 and more than 2 lakh have been infected. Their families also remain at a higher risk. The scheme of special insurance cover of Rs. 50 lakh, notified for the medical fraternity last year for a limited period of three months, must be revived and extended to all front-line workers (including the police) this time. The challenges during the second wave of this pandemic have increased manifold. But despite facing various hardships, the police consider themselves fortunate enough to have been entrusted with the solemn duty to serve the needy and poor in difficult times. R.K.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Unfair and dangerous||In the midst of a raging second wave, which is touching new peaks each passing day, the Central government has abdicated its responsibility to ensure vaccine equity through free vaccination for the poor across all age groups. While State governments were never consulted or given prior notice about the change in vaccination policy, giving the two vaccine manufacturers a free hand to decide the price at which vaccines will be sold to State governments has made universal COVID-19 vaccination a difficult task to achieve. A large percentage of those aged 18-44 years does not have the resources to pay for vaccines and hence will fall through the cracks. So, the States will have to take a leading role in the free immunisation programme. While nearly two dozen States have already committed to vaccinate for free the target population, it remains to be seen if they use any criteria to identify the beneficiaries. Never before has universal immunisation of nearly 600 million people been left to State governments and the private sector while the Union government restricts itself to vaccinating for free just 300 million. With this precedent, States will probably be required to vaccinate children too, when vaccines become available, thus burdening them even further and thereby actively promoting vaccine inequity. If making States pay for vaccines is an ill-conceived idea, forcing them to shell out more than what the Union government pays for the same vaccines is a sure recipe for exacerbated vaccine inequity. With vaccination being the only safe way to end the pandemic, undertaking any exercise that leaves a large population unprotected will cost the country enormously in terms of lives and livelihoods. While the Union government has already allocated Rs. 35,000 crore for COVID-19 vaccination in this Budget and also committed to provide further funds if required, it will spend less than Rs. 10,000 crore to vaccinate for free all above 45 years. While the sudden change in policy is therefore not due to lack of financial resources, the State governments, which have not factored in funds for vaccination, will now be required to garner funds for the same. There is hence a great compulsion to make pricing more transparent and allow States to collectively bargain for a lower price and assured timelines to receive supplies. The current policy, which has earmarked 50% supplies to State governments and private hospitals, takes the States and the companies to a completely uncharted territory leading to competition among States, and between State governments and private hospitals. Vaccine shortage from both manufacturers is likely to last a few months. The combination of policy pandemonium, profiteering by vaccine manufacturers in the thick of the pandemic and vaccine shortage is unlikely to result in a smooth roll-out of vaccines for the target group. This could lead to a dangerous situation where containment and mitigation measures become even more difficult.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/unfair-and-dangerous/article34418864.ece
27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A stream of awards||After last year’s Oscar sweep by Parasite , there were those who peddled the myth that lightning will not strike the same place twice. It kind of did in the 93rd Academy Awards, when the Best Supporting Actress award went to South Korean Youn Yuh-jung, for her role as granny Soon-ja in the heart-warming Minari , beating off competition from Glenn Close’s mad-haired Mamaw in Hillbilly Elegy . Anthony Hopkins winning his second Best Actor Oscar (he first won for The Silence of the Lambs ) for The Father was disappointing, even if deserving. The sentimental favourite was the late Chadwick Boseman, who turned in an incendiary performance as the mercurial trumpeter, Levee Green, in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom . As expected, Nomadland won big with Best Picture, Best Director for Chloé Zhao and Best Actress (Frances McDormand). It is a historic win for Zhao as she is only the second woman to win the award and the first woman of colour to do so. While elegiac in its beauty, Nomadland should have looked at privilege. Only a white person can feel safe enough to drop off the grid. Wandering white people, even if they are hulking ex-military policemen, are enlightened and definitely not lost, while a homeless black person will always be looked at with suspicion. In this year of pandemics and lockdowns, the old rules of movies playing for a certain amount of time in theatres to be considered for the awards was relaxed. Movies directly released on streaming platforms made the cut. David Fincher’s Mank got 10 nominations and won two — for cinematography and production design. Other favourites such as Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom , Sound of Metal , Pieces of a Woman , Hillbilly Elegy , One Night in Miami and The Trial of the Chicago 7 were also streamed. One gem of a film was Two Distant Strangers , which won for Best Live Action Short. The film effectively marries two burning issues — violence against black Americans by white policemen and being caught in a time loop. Black graphic designer, Carter James, just wants to get back to his dog and he is shot every time by a white policeman, Merk. The film brings alive memories of police brutality at home as well. Every time Carter wakes up after being shot, to live the day again, it is a reminder of the year of blursdays that passed by. One should, however, be thankful for blursdays — if one cannot distinguish one day from the next, it means nothing hideous happened to make the day stand out. That, in these days of shock and dread is definitely something to be grateful for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-stream-of-awards/article34418865.ece
27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Detecting super heavy elements||Indian scientists have found evidence confirming the existence of super heavy elements, so far unknown to scientists. This was stated here [New Delhi] to-day [April 26] by Prof. M. G. K. Menon, Director of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay and Chairman of the Electronics Commission who was delivering the founder memorial lecture of the Shri Ram Institute for Industrial Research. Prof. Menon said a group of scientists led by Prof. Dr. Lal of the Tata Institute made this discovery by studying extra-terrestrial materials such as meteorites and lunar samples using the fossil track technique. He said the group found evidence for the existence of plutonium-244 and also of extremely heavy elements of charge 115 and mass 300 in both lunar and meteorite samples. Such super heavy elements had not yet been synthesised in the laboratory, he said. Prof. Menon said beyond the heaviest element uranium with a charge of 92, only extremely unstable transuranic elements of charge upto 105 had been discovered by scientists so far. He said studies by the Tata institute group suggested that super heavy elements that went even beyond these transuranic elements could have been produced in appreciable quantities during nucleo-synthesis or the “stellar cooking” of elements. The studies were of “remarkable interest” for both nuclear physics and astrophysics, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/detecting-super-heavy-elements/article34418877.ece

27 April 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Hasten vaccination, boost health infra’||Amid a massive rise in COVID-19 infections during the second wave, the only way forward is speedier vaccination, ramping up of health infrastructure and observance of pandemic protocols, an RBI article said. In an article on the state of the economy, an RBI bulletin said India is battling a spurt in new infections and mortalities, perhaps the fastest for any country of continental dimensions. Observing that healthcare infrastructure and vaccine supplies are strained, financial markets are reeling and earnings forecasts face downgrades, the article said, “Yet this too shall pass. We have seen off the first wave, and have largely adapted. “Pandemic protocols, speedier vaccination, ramping up hospital and ancillary capacity, and remaining resolutely focussed on a post-pandemic future of strong and sustainable growth with macroeconomic and financial stability is the way forward,” said the article authored by RBI Deputy Governor M.D. Patra and other officials. The article said as India battles the ferocious rise of new infections, a strong policy response is building. Economic activity in India is holding up against COVID-19’s renewed onslaught. Apart from contact-intensive sectors, activity indicators largely remained resilient in March and grew beyond pre-pandemic levels. The resurgence in COVID-19, if not contained in time, risks protracted restrictions and disruptions in supply chains with consequent inflationary pressures,” it said. The central bank said views expressed in the article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the RBI. The article also said early results of corporate performance in January-March indicate strong growth in revenue and net profit. Unlike in preceding quarters, this was driven by a pick up in demand and order inflows. “Rising digitalisation is the engine powering a stellar performance of IT companies in the quarter. Capacity utilisation is steadily rising, and the latest round of the RBI’s Industrial Outlook survey envisages further expansion through the first three quarters of 2021-22,” it said. The authors said electricity consumption, a real-time indicator of economic activity since it cannot be stored, has risen sharply in April on the top of steady growth in seven preceding months. Also, merchandise exports have posted a robust uptick in the first week of April. “It is not out of place to hope that these positive monthly developments reinforce each other and extend into a continuum that spans the medium-term.  The outlook for the economy is bright by any projection, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hasten-vaccination-boost-health-infra/article34419449.ece

These directives form part of the instructions issued by the RBI on Monday with regard to the chair and meetings of the board, composition of certain committees of the board, age, tenure and remuneration of directors, and appointment of the WTDs. The RBI said it would come out with a Master Direction on Corporate Governance in banks in due course. “The post of the MD & CEO or WTD cannot be held by the same incumbent for more than 15 years. “Thereafter, the individual will be eligible for re-appointment as MD & CEO or WTD in the same bank, if considered necessary and desirable by the board, after a minimum gap of three years, subject to meeting other conditions,” it said. It added that during this three-year cooling period, the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly. With regard to upper age limit for MD & CEO and WTDs in the private sector banks, the RBI said that no person can continue in such positions beyond the age of 70. The maximum age limit for chairman and non-executive directors has been fixed at 75 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-caps-age-at-70-for-bank-md-ceo-director-positions/article34418855.ece
27 April 2021||Hyderabad/Mumbai,||‘Logistics is key to easing oxygen crisis’||The oxygen shortages at hospitals treating COVID-19 patients leading to multiple deaths, which has turned the spotlight on the production and supply of the life-sustaining element, may start easing in the coming weeks, challenges notwithstanding, officials in the logistics and gas production industries said. “The government has a grip on the situation and things are getting more and more under control,” said Varun Agarwal, Director of Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases. “I am hopeful that by next week we will not see headlines of people dying [for want of oxygen],” Mr. Agarwal added. A sector with just a clutch of producers, who operate on a model of plants at their locations and at key customer sites, particularly steel plants, the demand for medical oxygen was thus far a fraction of total output. The ratio changed with the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the second, deadlier wave that has seen hospitals running out of oxygen, beds and key drugs. With an estimated daily production capacity in excess of 7,000 tonnes of oxygen, much of the present situation could have been averted with better preparedness and planning, a senior executive with a leading oxygen producing firm said, pointing out that the road transportation of the element had inherently unique challenges. This includes the high investment that is required on the specialised containers, of capacities ranging from 3-20 tonnes, and could cost upwards of Rs. 45 lakh, the official added, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The Centre, for its part, has ordered stopping supply of oxygen for non-essential industries, advised producers to enhance output, taken measures to speed up road movement as well as explored rail and air movement. It has also sanctioned funds for setting up PSA oxygen plants at hospitals. Transporters have been working 24/7 to reach oxygen to hospitals on time, said P. Senthil Kumar of Namakkal-based Kongunadu Road Lines, which operates a fleet of cryogenic tankers. These vehicles are being operated with two drivers so that they are always on the move, he added. With an estimated 1,000-1,200 such oxygen tankers in operation and any addition to the fleet being slow given the limited market they cater to and the high investment required, the emphasis has been on managing with existing resources. Abhishek Gupta, joint secretary of the All India Transporters’ Welfare Association said the government should task a central team to monitor cylinder availability as the requirement will be high over the next few months. LNG tanker operators had also been advised to repurpose their vehicles, Mr. Kumar said, signalling that the sector was now on a war footing to help boost supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/logistics-is-key-to-easing-oxygen-crisis/article34418857.ece

Consequently, the corresponding wastage in India will be $484 million, as per PMI’s estimates. Further, poor management practices alone may lead to global losses of $11 billion, that is 11.4% of the total investments of $98 billion. India’s individual share in the losses would be $81 million, based on data shared by the professional body.

27 April 2021||GUATEMALA CITY,||Atanu and Deepika clinch gold||It was a family affair as Atanu Das and his wife Deepika Kumari won the men’s and women’s individual recurve gold medals in the Archery World Cup Stage 1 here. Atanu beat Daniel Castro of Spain 6-4, while Deepika defeated Mackenzie Brown of the USA 6-5 (9-9), via the tie-breaker, in the gold medal matches. Atanu, who was trailing 4-2 in the third set, restored parity in the fourth before claiming victory in the fifth. Hard work paying off “It feels amazing. Dreams are coming true. I’ve worked so hard for so many years, and now this is paying off,” Atanu told www.worldarchery.org . After taking a 2-0 lead, Deepika saw Mackenzie equalise in the third set. The Indian regained her lead before the American made it 5-5 to force a tie-breaker. Deepika’s shot was closer to the centre than her opponent’s as the two scored a nine each. “It has been a long time since I shot in the finals. It feels great and, at the same time, I’m happy and nervous. It gives me confidence and pushes me to give better performances,” said Deepika. It was Atanu’s first gold medal in the event, while it was Deepika’s third individual gold in a World Cup. She had triumphed previously in 2012 (China) and 2018 (USA). Prolific Deepika, who earlier claimed the team gold with Ankita Bhakat and Komalika Bari here, had been part of triumphant teams in 2011 (China), 2013 (Colombia and Poland), and 2014 (Poland). Till date, she has collected 32 medals (eight gold, 16 silver and eight bronze) in World Cups and World Cup Finals. Atanu also won a mixed team bronze with Ankita.

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Collective bowling effort sets up facile KKR win||Kolkata Knight Riders came up with a spirited performance when it desperately needed one. The men from the eastern metropolis had arrived at Ahmedabad after losing their last four matches. On Monday night at the Narendra Modi Stadium against Punjab Kings, they redeemed themselves in some style. They had to survive some anxious moments, though, before chasing down a modest target of 124. They won with five wickets and 3.2 overs to spare. Second win It was KKR’s second win at IPL-14, the first having come over a fortnight ago, in its opening fixture against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The way it started its chase, a fifth straight defeat wasn't entirely out of the question. KKR lost three wickets inside the first three overs. But just when it seemed as if the batsmen might fail their bowlers, who had given a splendid display earlier in the evening, Eoin Morgan put his hand up. The captain, who has struggled for runs this season, played a fine innings under pressure. He remained 47 not out (40b, 4x4, 2x6). It was his fourth wicket stand of 66 with Rahul Tripathi (41, 32b, 7x4) that led his team towards victory. In dire straits KKR was in dire straits, at 17 for three, when Morgan joined Tripathi. Nitish Rana was out off the fourth ball of the innings, hitting a full toss from Moises Henriques to cover, where a grateful Shahrukh Khan dove to his right and took a two-handed catch. In the next over, Mohammed Shami ensured that Shubman Gill would have to wait longer to return to form, trapping him lbw, the opener missing the line. Out came Sunil Narine, but KKR's move didn't work — thanks largely to a superb catch from Ravi Bishnoi, who covered some distance running from deep mid-wicket and timed his dive to perfection. Earlier, the KKR attack justified its captain’s decision to bowl first. It was a disciplined effort from seamers Pat Cummins, Shivam Mavi and Prasidh Krishna as well as the spin duo of Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine, as they choked the PBKS batsmen. Cummins provided the breakthrough in the last over of the PowerPlay, with K.L. Rahul — after a six over third-man — skying a catch to a patient Narine at mid-off. Then Mavi had Chris Gayle caught behind for a golden duck and Prasidh removed Deepak Hooda. It took an 18-ball 30 (1x4, 3x6) from Chris Jordan down the order to lift the asking-rate over six.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/collective-bowling-effort-sets-up-facile-kkr-win/article34418983.ece
27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Royal Challengers eager to reassert title credentials||Still recovering from a 69-run rout at the hands of Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bangalore faces another big test in the form of a strong Delhi Capitals at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. While RCB suffered a first loss in five outings on Sunday, DC edged out Sunrisers Hyderabad in a Super Over thriller on the same day. Level on points RCB and DC are level on eight points, with the latter boasting of a better net run rate. The DC top order — consisting of Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant and Steve Smith — did well to find runs on a slow Chennai pitch, and will relish the chance to go all out in more batting-friendly conditions at Ahmedabad. In the absence of R. Ashwin, who has withdrawn from the tournament to be with his family in the fight against COVID-19, the spin bowling duties rest on Axar Patel and Amit Mishra. Underwhelming The pace attack is led by Avesh Khan — the team’s highest wicket-taker (11 wickets). South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has not been as impressive, with four wickets in as many outings. RCB will be keen to forget the horrors of the previous match. Seamer Harshal Patel, normally a safe bet at the death, was blasted for 37 runs by Ravindra Jadeja in the final over. Faced with a stiff target of 192, the RCB batsmen folded. The likes of Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and Glenn Maxwell — all of whom are in good touch overall — will hope that the CSK fixture was but a minor blip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/royal-challengers-out-to-reassert-credentials/article34418967.ece
27 April 2021||Madrid,||Atletico hands initiative to rivals||Atletico Madrid’s title hopes suffered a setback on Sunday as a shock 2-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao handed Barcelona the upper hand in a thrilling race at the top of La Liga. For Athletic, Alex Berengeur nodded home Ander Capa’s cross in the eighth minute before Stefan Savic’s flicked header found its way into the back post and made it 1-1 with 13 minutes left. However, Athletic’s Inigo Martinez darted free in the box and powered a superb header past Jan Oblak with four minutes remaining. Sevilla has largely been overlooked as possible champion in Spain but it got back into the mix with a 2-1 win over Granada. Tight race Atletico has 73 points (33 games), Real 71 (33) and Barcelona 71 (32). Sevilla is fourth with 70 (33). In Serie A, Atalanta kept its push for Champions League football on track with a 5-0 rout of Bologna following an impressive display from striker Luis Muriel.

27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||A learning experience, says Ankita Raina||The health of Indian women’s tennis has often been reflective of Ankita Raina’s game, especially in the Billie Jean King Cup. It is no surprise that the 28-year-old Ankita played the best tennis of her career, in the World Group play-off tie against Latvia in Jurmala. Chatting with Olympian Vishnu Vardhan on Instagram, Ankita, along with teammate Rutuja Bhosale, raved about the enriching experience of the ‘historic tie’. Historic because India reached this stage of the Cup for first time ever. It was an inspiring performance by Ankita, as she tormented former World No. 5 and French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, before letting her escape to victory. A win, very much possible as Ostapenko served to stay in the match at 4-5 in the decider, would have catapulted Indian women’s tennis to a different sphere. Ankita put things in perspective. “During crucial points or games, they played very solid and produced the winners. That is the reason why they are, where they are,” said Ankita. Ankita also had an opportunity to extend the fight against former world No. 11 Anastasija Sevastova. “There is so much to learn. “It was a great experience,” said Ankita. Acknowledging Sania Sania Mirza has been a beacon for Indian women’s tennis with six Grand Slam titles, world No. 1 in doubles for long and reaching a career best No. 27 in singles and multiple Asian Games medals. Both Ankita and Rutuja, who paired up with debutant Zeel Desai to record a morale boosting doubles victory in the dead rubber against Latvia, heartily acknowledged Sania’s splendid role. “When I got into the team in 2013 as a 16-year-old, I was in awe of Sania. I still feel the same. When Ankita and Karman were playing, Sania used to explain things to us on the sidelines,” said Rutuja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-learning-experience-says-ankita-raina/article34419045.ece

Hazard successfully returned to the squad this weekend and impressed as a substitute in the Spanish league match against Real Betis on Saturday, raising the prospects of a reunion with the London club he left two years ago.

After 10 rounds, Vidit (5 points) was 10th while Praggnanandhaa (4.5) was sharing the 11th spot.

However, in the last two rounds of the day, Vidit lost to Wesley So and Shakhiryar Mamedyarov.  Pragnanandhaa could not add to his overnight tally, of three points, after losing to Le Quang Liem and Leinier Dominguez Perez. He matched wits with Vidit for over 50 moves and managed to survive a third straight defeat after Vidit missed a possible win.

The rollout of the second edition of the so-called “Playbooks” — an IOC guidebook explaining how the games can be pulled off — comes as several areas have been placed under a third state of emergency as coronavirus cases surge. Organisers are expected to announce daily testing for athletes. They are also expected to drop a 14-day quarantine requirement, allowing athletes to train when they arrive. Athletes will be required to stay within a “bubble” consisting of the Olympic Village on Tokyo Bay, and venues and training areas. Japan’s Kyodo news, citing unnamed sources, said that athletes and staff will have to be tested twice within 96 hours before leaving home. They will also be tested upon arrival in Japan. The Playbook for athletes is to be updated on Wednesday, with Playbooks for media and others unveiled on Friday. A final edition of all Playbooks will be published in June.

BCCI secretary Jay Shah didn’t respond to a query by The Hindu , but a Board official privy to developments said on condition of anonymity that “the tournament will continue as planned, at least for now”. It is understood that the BCCI is tracking developments on a daily basis but with the authorities having granted permission, the Board will not voluntarily call the IPL off. “We do understand these are tough times and we will try and facilitate travel of players who are leaving for various reasons and their replacements, if any, in consultation with the franchises,” the official said. So far, R. Ashwin (Delhi Capitals), Andrew Tye, Liam Livingstone (Rajasthan Royals), Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa (Royal Challengers Bangalore) have left because of either biosecure-bubble- or COVID-related concerns. With the IPL caravan having moved from Mumbai and Chennai to Ahmedabad and Delhi, the authorities are hoping that the list of departures doesn’t grow substantially and the teams aren’t weakened too much. RR, for instance, doesn’t have a back-up overseas player at the moment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ipl-to-continue-at-least-for-now-bcci-official/article34418963.ece

Vijayanand said on Monday that they would hand over an ex-gratia of Rs. 5 lakh to the bereaved family members of Ashwin Yadav, former Ranji fast bowler who passed away couple of days ago. In a statement, he said HCA felt it was the minimum moral responsibility to help the family members in this hour of crisis. “We deem this as a token gesture in recognition of the contribution of Ashwin to the game as a player and as a mentor to some of the young cricketers,” he said. Vijayanand added that Ashwin was a lion-hearted cricketer and a wonderful character who was always helpful to youngsters. It will be interesting to see whether the family of Ashwin, who was named as HCA junior selection panel member at the recent AGM by Vijayanand’s group, will also get an additional Rs. 7 lakh, which is the fee for a selector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ex-gratia-to-ashwin-yadavs-family/article34419568.ece

27 April 2021||April 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Your vaccine questions, answered||I am experiencing terrible headaches and body pains after getting the vaccine. Is it okay to take painkillers? What painkillers are okay to take, in what dosage?  GK: About one-quarter to one-third of all people who receive SARS-CoV2 vaccines have some side effects. These include fever, headaches, body ache and fatigue. These symptoms usually last not more than a couple of days. Lie down, rest, and take plenty of liquids. It is okay to take painkillers such as paracetamol for these side effects, up to three times per day. Stop taking it or reduce it as your symptoms subside.  CL: If the pain is very severe, especially headache, and if it lasts longer, then inform the healthcare facility where you got vaccinated. You should also consider checking with their physicians or any doctor nearby. It is not advisable to take any ‘prescription drug’ for such situations. Does the vaccine have any gender- or age-related effect? After getting the vaccine, my mother-in-law and my mother showed a lot of pain, but my father and father-in-law did not.  GK: For some of the widely used COVID-19 vaccines for which data is available, it appears that women show more side effects than men. This has actually been noted for other vaccines, such as influenza, as well. It is possible and plausible, based on data from human and animal studies, that hormones may play a role in the side effects that each person experiences. We do not know yet whether this applies to all vaccines or some vaccines. Is it also true that young people experience more side effects?  CL: You need to remember that this is only a comparative response. As an example, two COVID-19 vaccines, Oxford AstraZeneca and Pfizer, have shown to have slightly higher rates of adverse events in the younger population. As such, these adverse events are always at a low rate and this risk is far lower than the benefits offered by these vaccines. Are the side effects a sign of the vaccine working? What does having no side effects at all mean then?  GK: The side effects are a sign that the vaccine is inducing a biological response, but it is not necessary to have side effects for the vaccine to work. Everyone reacts to infection and vaccination in different ways and some people show more reactions than others.  CL: The adverse events are dependent upon multiple factors such as age, allergy to any component of the vaccine, or just a normal reaction. Why are we being advised not to take non-vegetarian food for a day or two after the vaccine?  GK: There is no reason to change our diet following vaccination. The possible reason why advice on not eating non-vegetarian food is given might be because some kinds of meat (red and processed meat) may induce a low level of inflammation. However, there is no data to indicate that eating non-vegetarian food changes the response to the vaccine. Does drinking alcohol after getting the jab reduce its effectiveness?  GK: Drinking alcohol to excess also leads to inflammation. However, there is no data to indicate that drinking alcohol after getting vaccinated reduces the effectiveness of the vaccine. My relative developed COVID-19 10 days after we got the vaccine together. Is there a chance that he can spread the infection to me?  CL: An individual is protected only two weeks after the completed schedule. The completed schedule for COVID-19 vaccines in India is two jabs at the recommended interval. Therefore, your relative getting an infection 10 days after the first jab is very similar to someone who has not received the vaccine. In fact, we know that COVID-19 vaccines prevent a severe form of disease and mortality. A fully vaccinated person can still develop an infection; however, that is more likely to be asymptomatic or mild. A fully vaccinated person can also transmit the infection to another healthy person. That’s why even after vaccination COVID appropriate behaviours of face mask, physical distancing, and hand washing should be followed. How long will immunity last from vaccines? Considering there are so many variants now, why should I get vaccinated now? Why shouldn’t I wait?  SS: We are learning something every day, from all the different clinical trials of the vaccines that have been undertaken, especially those that are now approved for use. What we’ve seen so far is that a majority of the vaccines are extremely effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalisation, and death. We must also remember that the more people get vaccinated and build up their immunity against the virus, the less the chances of the virus replicating, growing, increasing, and spreading from person to person, and thereby we are actually reducing the chances of more mutations and more variants. After I got vaccinated, I did not experience major side effects. But two weeks after that, I developed an upset stomach, though I have only eaten at home. Is this a delayed side effect of the vaccine? How many days later can the side effects show up?  GK: Usually, side effects of the vaccine manifest themselves in the first few days after vaccination. It is very unlikely that your upset stomach is due to the vaccination. The only side effect that we know so far that may appear later (and this is not completely confirmed yet) is the risk of clotting with a low platelet count, a very rare side effect that may occur between four and 20 days after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine.  CL: Since all COVID-19 vaccines are new to use, their safety profile of adverse events is still evolving. Reporting of such events to healthcare facilities is logical and that will be your contribution to promoting vaccine science. Should I take a blood thinner a few days before taking the vaccine, given reports of blood clotting caused by the shot?  GK: There is absolutely no need to take a blood thinner before taking the vaccine. If there is a risk of blood clotting, which has not been completely confirmed yet, it is at a rate of one in 1,00,000 to one in 2,50,000. It is not possible to predict who will have this very rare side effect, just like it is not possible to predict who will win the lottery. The blood clotting with low platelets, which is the syndrome being described occurs four to 20 days after vaccination, so severe symptoms that happen in that period may be vaccine related.  CL: If somebody is already on blood thinners for different health reasons, they should consult their doctor before taking a vaccine. If your health situation allows, in consultation with a doctor, you can consider stopping the blood thinners two days before vaccination and not using two days after vaccination, just to prevent any form of bleeding.  How do vaccines work? World Health Organization member epidemiologist Dr. Katherine O’Brien explains how the COVID-19 vaccine works. Vaccines are a part of the germ that our body can recognise and develop an immune response to, so that the next time that we see the real germ, there are already fighters (antibodies) in our body to protect us against the infection. In the case of COVID, she says, the vaccine has a part of the outside of the coronavirus — the spike protein. If we have fighters against the spike protein, we will have a much lower chance of getting a serious disease from coronavirus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/your-vaccine-questions-answered/article34419197.ece

27 April 2021||New Delhi,||Man made to wait for 2 hours at COVID Care Centre dies||Around 2 p.m., outside the Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre, two women were crying aloud next to a 45-year-old man, who was lying on the back seat of a car. He was not moving or responding to their calls. “We have been waiting here for two hours. Now there is no pulse. They even refused to check him even after we said that there was no pulse” Megh Singh, 60, his relative said. As 500 beds opened on Monday at the Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre, there was a queue of cars and ambulances outside the centre for admission. But only 123 patients were admitted, though 500 beds were installed, as per ITBP. Many went back without getting an admission. Many people complained of the District Surveillance Officers (DSOs), who are supposed to approve admission to the COVID Care Centre, not responding to calls. Some waiting in the queue in ambulances were scared when the oxygen level in the cylinders dipped, as they waited restlessly for more than two hours. It gave away to heated scenes outside the centre as people argued with security forces for a bed. Despite beds being available, many left without getting admission as they couldn’t get a response from the DSO. “Admission is only through the DSO. Walk-in patients are not allowed. Talk to your DSO. If the officer doesn’t attend your call, please message your details to him. Admission is only through DSO’s recommendations. There are no ICU beds here,” a recorded message from a loudspeaker outside the centre said. The officials on Sunday had announced that the admissions will be only through the DSOs. When contacted, a Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the situation. No oxygen Mr. Singh was waiting at the crematorium around 9.30 p.m. for doing the last rites of his relative, who died outside the centre. “He was critical, but still responding to us when we reached there. Now he is gone. No hospital attended to him,” he said over the phone. “Sir, please help. No one is picking up the phone. No one is helping. He’ll die here,” Harshlatha Sharma, wife of a COVID-19 patient, said outside the centre. The patient was breathing heavily and quivering outside the COVID Care Centre. “We went to multiple hospitals before coming here. There are no beds anywhere,” his 16-year-old son said. Finally, the patient was rushed in after complaints were made to the ITBP and the wife broke down in front of the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/500-beds-available-but-only-123-admitted-at-sardar-patel-centre/article34419562.ece
27 April 2021||New Delhi,||Free vaccine to those above 18 years, announces Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the government had decided to provide COVID vaccination free of cost to every citizen above 18 years of age. In a digital briefing, he told the Delhi government had approved the purchase of Rs. 1.34 crore vaccines and said he would appeal to the Centre to ensure that all governments got vaccine doses at the same price. “Vaccine is emerging as a solution to this pandemic. Those who have been administered the vaccine are either not contracting the virus or contracting only mild forms of it,” he said. Moderate pricing However, they are differently priced. “Different vaccine manufacturers have priced the vaccine at Rs. 400 and Rs. 600 for State governments and at Rs. 150 for the Central government. I believe the price should be the same for everyone,” he also said. Now was not the time to look for profits, asserted Mr. Kejriwal, but to come together to help humanity. At a time when Central and State governments were capping the rate at which medicines and other facilities should be made available to people, vaccines also needed to be moderately priced, he said. “It is also my appeal to the central government, if need be, please cap the rate of the vaccine and ensure it is made available at standardised rates to everyone. If special vaccines are required for children below the age of 18, I hope they are manufactured soon and can be swiftly administered to the children of the country,” he said. He also appealed to the manufacturers to bring the price of vaccine down to Rs. 150 for everyone. Ramping up facilities He further said that the Delhi government was in the process of ramping up hospital beds across the city. “We are also trying to increase oxygen beds in Delhi. Today morning, I visited the centre that has been created at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas. It has started functioning from 10 a.m. today [Monday] morning,” he said. While there were 150 beds as of now, in the next 2-3 days this number would be increased to 500, then 2,000 beds and finally 5,000, he said. “We are also creating a 200 ICU bed facility at the centre. We are creating several such centres in Delhi and hope they aid the people of Delhi,” he also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/free-vaccine-to-those-above-18-years-announces-kejriwal/article34419558.ece
27 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Weekend lockdown imposed in Punjab||Amid rising COVID-19 cases across the State, Punjab on Monday decided to impose weekend lockdown and extend the timings of night curfew. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh announced the decision of the Cabinet on Twitter. “Due to continuous and rapid rise of#Covid19cases in Punjab, Cabinet today has decided to impose daily lockdown from 6 PM to 5 AM and weekend lockdown from Friday 6 PM to Monday 5 AM. Urge you all to stay at home & step out only if absolutely necessary. Seek your full cooperation,” he said a tweet. The Cabinet also gave approval to allow the recruitment of 473 posts of staff nurses in Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, and Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar, attached with Government Medical Colleges of Patiala and Amritsar respectively by taking these posts out of the purview of Subordinate Service Selection Board to Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot through the written test on the basis of merit, according to an official statement. Bed scarcity The number of beds to treat COVID-19 patients at the government hospitals is close to saturation in Chandigarh, forcing the administration on Monday to make a clarion call to various groups and associations to come forward in scaling up the capacity. On April 26, the total number of dedicated COVID-19 beds at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) was 337 of which 286 were occupied — among these 222 patients were occupying the non-ICU oxygen beds while the other 64 were occupying the ICU beds, including ventilator beds) — according to official data. The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector -32, has 95 COVID-19 beds and 79 of those were occupied till the morning of April 26. The capacity of COVID-19 beds is intended to be increased to 155 beds soon. In the south campus of GMCH, there are 100 COVID-19 beds with 57 being occupied. Apart from this, at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector-16, there are a total of 200 dedicated COVID-19 beds where 168 were occupied, the data showed. Fresh cases Chandigarh reported 821 new COVID-19 cases on April 26 and reported five deaths. Asim from Panchkula, who was accompanying his mother-in-law — a COVID-19 patient at GMSH — expressed anguish against the ruling government at the Centre. He said it was over an hour and the patient was still waiting in the campus as the staff is completing formalities at a snail’s pace, pointing to a shortage of beds. “They [staff] told me that they don’t have a bed right now. Also, they don’t have non-rebreather mask... I am trying to arrange the mask but so far haven’t got it from nearby chemists. When they know the cases are rising why they don’t keep necessary items in stock?,” he said, adding that his mother-in-law was referred from a hospital in Manimajra. Pramod Sharma, Founder of Yuvsatta, an NGO involved in healthcare for marginalised women, said: “It’s high time for government to shun theatrics and streamline the basics of medicines, oxygen supply, adequate number of beds, health facilities and free vaccines for all adults.” V.K. Nagpal, Medical Superintendent, GMSH-16 said: “We need to increase the number of beds. The patients, however, should not panic.” Arun Gupta, Principal Secretary (Health), said: “We are trying to shift certain ICU beds from non-COVID to COVID and also increasing the number of oxygenated beds in all government hospitals, including PGIMER almost on daily basis.” Chandigarh Adviser Manoj Parida made an appeal: “To reduce pressure on government infrastructure, groups and associations like those of advocates, architects, CAs, traders, Public Sector Undertakings should set up small covid care centres with 10 or more beds for their members, under supervision of available health workers from private-government sources.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/weekend-lockdown-imposed-in-punjab/article34419208.ece
27 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC cautions on obstructing oxygen tankers||The Delhi High Court on Monday cautioned that obstructing cryogenic tankers carrying medical oxygen for COVID-19 patients will tantamount to endangering human lives, after it was informed about stoppage of oxygen tankers in Rajasthan. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli also asked the Delhi government to act tough on black marketing of oxygen cylinders, which it said are reportedly being sold at Rs. 1 lakh per unit in the Capital. “We hope and expect the State of Rajasthan to honour the orders passed by the court and the Central government. An obstruction in the matter of liquid oxygen at this stage will tantamount to endangering hundreds of human lives. Stoppage of tankers by one State could have a snowballing effect,” the High Court said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that strict action would be taken against any persons involved. During the hearing, several private hospitals objected to the manner in which oxygen supply to hospitals has been handled by the Delhi government. The Hospitals said they are being kept in the dark by the Delhi government with regard to the exact time and amount of oxygen supplied to them. “This anxiety is killing us,” said one of the lawyers representing the hospitals. Solicitor General Mehta objected to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal writing to Sajjan Jindal, Managing Director of the JSW Group, seeking oxygen and tankers. Mr. Mehta said any surplus oxygen produced by the industries in India has to go the Central corpus for disbursement to States according to their needs. Delhi government, represented by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, said it had only asked for assistance in procurement of oxygen cryogenic tankers and to get information on any surplus oxygen being produced by the industry. The court also said it was not in agreement with the SG that there was no shortage of oxygen. “We know there is oxygen shortage on the ground,” the Bench said. The court further directed the Centre to take steps to prioritise the clearance of customs for the import of RT-PCR testing kits from abroad. Mr. Mehra informed the High Court that the Delhi government was in the process of importing 18 tankers, which shall be arriving soon and that four new tankers are also coming from another supplier. The court also directed the Delhi Chief Secretary, who was present at the hearing, to hold a meeting with oxygen suppliers, refillers and hospitals during the day to work out a distribution plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/high-court-cautions-on-obstructing-oxygen-tankers/article34419554.ece
27 April 2021||New Delhi,||In 6 days, COVID-19 accounts for 3,500 deaths||Almost 3,500 COVID patients were laid to rest in the city during the six-day lockdown by the Delhi government to contain the pandemic’s spread between April 19 and April 25, according to official data recorded by the Capital’s three civic bodies. The Delhi government data, however, recorded a total number of 2,127 COVID deaths during the period with the BJP Opposition, which administers the civic bodies, accusing it of attempting to “suppress” the very occurrence of the deaths of 1,345 citizens due to the pandemic. Left with no other option given the death toll, which rose incrementally every day, the Municipal Corporations of Delhi had to affect an increase of over 50% of the capacity at 28 crematoriums and burial grounds spread across the 11 municipal zones in the city. By the time Delhi entered its second, week-long lockdown on Monday, the total count of cremations and burials undertaken over the six-day period stood at 3,472 and the capacity at such sites, which was 505 on April 19, had been increased up to 773 till the evening of April 25. Fully stretched Despite the increase, most facilities were stretched to their limits on a daily basis as the week progressed and, towards the end of the lockdown, many were performing last rites well over their capacity. On April 20, for instance, the PK Road Cremation Ground saw 24 cremations opposed to its capacity of 15. Beri-Wala facility,which has a capacity of 12, saw 14, while 27 were performed at the Dwarka Sector 24 facility, which had a capacity of 23. Three days later, on April 23, 29 cremations were performed at PK Road against a capacity of 15, 18 at Beri-Wala and 40 at Dwarka Sector 24 despite upgrading capacity to 32. Till 6 p.m. on April 25, the PK Road facility recorded 35 cremations, Beri-Wala 24, and 41 in Dwarka Sector 24. At Ghazipur, 27 cremations took place against a capacity of 25, 44 against a capacity of 36 at the Seemapuri Cremation Ground and the Paschim Vihar facility saw 57 cremations over three times its capacity. Spokesperson fumes “Why is the Delhi government, which claims to be transparent, trying to hide these deaths?” asked Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana. “The city’s cremation and burial grounds are overflowing with the bodies of COVID patients according to official civic body figures. There should be an investigation to ascertain the reason behind the government’s clear attempt to hide these figures,” he demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/civic-body-data-show-3472-deaths-in-6-days/article34419560.ece
27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Five arrested from across the city for black marketing Remdesivir||Five persons were arrested from different parts of the city for their alleged involvement in black marketing of Remdesivir injection amid its high demand due to surging COVID-19 cases, police said.

27 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||5 COVID patients dead, oxygen shortage blamed||Five COVID-19 patients under treatment at a private hospital in Haryana’s Hisar district died in the early hours of Monday with the hospital authorities attributing the deaths to the shortage of liquid oxygen. The administration denied the allegations and ordered a magisterial probe into the matter. Five men, aged between 40-60 years, in a critical condition, died at Soni Burn Hospital around 4 a.m. The hospital’s owner, Rajat Soni, told The Hindu that an ambulance from his hospital went to fetch liquid oxygen from the plant in the city, but there was a long queue and the patients died before he could get the supply. “A hospital staff went to fetch liquid oxygen around 11 p.m. on Sunday, but he could not get the supply till 4 a.m. on Monday. I also arranged a couple of cylinders from other hospitals, but it was not enough,” said Mr. Soni. He said the situation was similar on Monday and the hospital authorities had already received a message that the supply of oxygen would be 15% less today and they were told to admit patients accordingly. “We received a message around 5 a.m. saying five patients had died at the hospital. The cause of death is a matter of investigation, but the family members of the deceased blamed the deaths on lack of oxygen supply and negligence,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police (Hisar-1) Rajbir Singh. Deputy Commissioner Priyanka Soni denied the allegations, saying that the city had surplus liquid oxygen on Sunday. “We have ordered a magisterial probe into the matter. The matter has also been referred to Medical Negligence Board. The hospital concerned did not call or inform us about any alleged short supply of oxygen,” said Ms. Soni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/5-covid-patients-dead-oxygen-shortage-blamed/article34419209.ece
27 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC dismisses plea challenging travel exemption to govt. functionaries||The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed a plea challenging the exemption given to constitutional and government functionaries and their staff from either showing negative RT-PCR report after travelling by air or undergoing a 14 day quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh declined to entertain the petition by a Delhi resident, saying the constitutional and government functionaries and their staff were working on a “war footing” in the prevailing pandemic and such pleas amount to interfering with the same. The court said often the officials would have to go from one place to another overnight and in such a situation a test report cannot be insisted upon. The court said the instant plea has been filed “unnecessarily” in “publicity interest” and said it will dismiss the same with costs if not withdrawn. The petitioner’s lawyer, thereafter, sought permission to withdraw the petition. “Dismissed as withdrawn,” the Bench said. The petitioner had contended that the exemption granted to government functionaries “has the effect of invalidating the RT-PCR report of the entire batch of passengers who shall travel with them”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-travel-exemption-to-govt-functionaries/article34419676.ece
27 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Seized oxygen cylinders provided to hospitals||Oxygen cylinders that were seized by the police during a recent raid are now used to meet the requirements of hospitals in South West Delhi following court orders. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South West) Ingit Pratap Singh said: “It was purely my idea and I am proud of it”. Recalling the episode, he said that a team from Sagarpur Police Station seized 48 oxygen cylinders on Friday evening. “Given the acute shortage of oxygen, it was only natural for the oxygen to be used. I consulted our public prosecutor and told him that I was in a moral dilemma and how do I get these cylinders immediately released to hospitals to save lives?” the DCP said. Process fast-tracked The application was then drafted, which stated that these cylinders are life-saving equipment, the formalities of seizure completed, photographs taken and the police station doesn’t require it. The application said these may immediately be released to needy hospitals. Therefore, when the man who was arrested for allegedly hoarding these oxygen cylinders was produced before the court, this application was also moved. The court granted permission after which four hospitals — Ansari Hospital, World Brain Centre, Aarya Hospital, and Bhagat Chandra Hospital — were provided with cylinders after they called police. “A request letter is taken by them regarding this and they are asked to return the cylinders after use. There are 32 cylinders with 67 litre liquid oxygen each and 16 cylinder with 10 litre and we get SOS calls from smaller hospitals every day,” Mr. Singh said. Accused Anil Kumar was arrested from Dashrathpuri on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/seized-oxygen-cylinders-provided-to-hospitals/article34419557.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh also asked the Delhi government to put in place necessary infrastructure to streamline the sample collection process. The High Court’s direction came after several lawyers said they were facing difficulty in getting tested as labs were saying they will carry out sample collection after 2-3 days.

The submissions were made during the hearing of a petition seeking directions to the Delhi government to order hospitals not to insist on COVID test reports to hospitalise patients who show symptoms of virus infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ramp-up-testing-centres-hc-to-govt/article34419555.ece

A senior police officer said Lieutenant Colonel Soumen Mondal called at the office of Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) for urgent help regarding cremation of his father-in-law who died of virus infection.
