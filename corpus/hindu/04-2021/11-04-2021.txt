The incidents sent shockwaves across West Bengal, which still has four more phases of voting. Four persons were killed when Central forces opened fire at polling booth number 126 at Amtali Madhyamik Siksha Kendra under the Jor Patki gram panchayat. Voting was then suspended at the booth. Superintendent of Police, Cooch Behar, Debasish Dhar said about 300 to 350 people, including women, attacked guards at the polling station with crude weapons following rumours that security personnel had beaten up a person who had allegedly fallen ill. “The CISF personnel sought reinforcement from QRT (quick response teams) teams, and the scuffle continued. When they [the people] tried to forcibly enter the polling booth and started snatching weapons, the CISF personnel opened fire, which killed four people,” Mr. Dhar said. Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) for West Bengal Aariz Aftab said the Commission had sought a detailed report on the incident from the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police. The incident evoked strong reactions from the Trinamool Congress, with party chief Mamata Banerjee blaming Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the incident and stating that the manner in which polls were held were a “ shame on democracy”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the other hand, accused Ms. Banerjee of inciting people against the central forces. In another incident under the same Assembly constituency, an 18-year-old youth was killed when miscreants opened fire on him when he was returning from polling booth number 285 at Pathantuli under Bolenhati gram panchayat. Two persons have been detained in connection with the incident, the CEO said. Sitalkuchi, an Assembly segment bordering Bangladesh in Cooch Behar district, has been on the boil over the past few days and the convoy of BJP president Dilip Ghosh was attacked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/violence-mars-fourth-phase-of-polling-in-bengal-5-killed/article34293118.ece
11 April 2021||Ahmedabad,||Gujarat not in favour of lockdown: CM||The Gujarat government is not in favour of imposing a lockdown in the State considering its impact on the poor despite the rise in COVID-19 cases, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said on Saturday. However, he welcomed the voluntary imposition of lockdown at a local level by villages or market associations in cities. “The State government is not willing to impose a lockdown considering the problems faced by the poor people. We have already imposed a curfew for 10 hours daily to restrict the unnecessary movement of people,” Mr. Rupani said when asked if the government was thinking of clamping a lockdown in view of the rising cases. Mr. Rupani was speaking to reporters after flagging off 20 new ‘Dhanvantari’ vans which will conduct coronavirus tests in public places and also suggest treatment. “If any market association imposes a lockdown at a local level or if any village imposes such a measure, it is welcome to do so,” the Chief Minister said. Amid the upswing in cases, many villages, housing societies and market organisations have declared lockdowns in their respective areas. The market organisation of Sola road in Ahmedabad has also decided to impose a lockdown on Saturday and Sunday to break the chain of transmission. A ‘janta’ curfew for two days is also being observed in Palanpur city, but some traders kept their shops open. With the latest addition of 4,541 fresh COVID-19 cases, the tally of cases in Gujarat reached 3,37,015 on Friday, as per the State Health Department. The Chief Minister denied reports that the State government was hiding the true data on the number of fatalities due to COVID-19. As per the State health government, Gujarat’s overall COVID-19 toll stood at 4,697 as on Friday. Mr. Rupani further said the State government has made arrangements for hospital beds, oxygen, Remdesivir injections and other facilities to treat patients. Civic polls put off Meanwhile, the Gujarat State Election Commission (SEC) on Saturday decided to postpone the elections to the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation scheduled for April 18, according to an official statement. “Taking in view the grave situation caused by the pandemic, to maintain public health and to ensure that voting is held in a free and fair environment, the State Election Commission has decided to postpone this election till further orders,” the SEC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gujarat-not-in-favour-of-lockdown-cm/article34293923.ece
11 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Vaccine paucity may hit mass drive||The State government’s ambitious plan to vaccinate all individuals above 45 years in 45 days to contain the second wave of COVID-19 transmission could be put on hold because of the fast-depleting vaccine stocks. While health officials are tight-lipped about the vaccine stock position, many district health administrations have openly expressed their anxiety about the precarious stock position, given the fact that mass vaccination camps are being planned in all districts in the coming weeks. “We have adequate vaccine stock to manage for three days. An additional 68,000 doses we might receive next week. But this is not enough to run mass vaccination camps as is being planned. Right now, we have about 40,000 doses in stock in Thiruvananthapuram district,” an official said. Slow pace Vaccine shortage is being felt acutely in other regions too. The slow pace of vaccination and the apparent disinterest shown by the public have been giving anxious moments to the Health Department. The pace of vaccination was expected to pick up after the elections. With the COVID-19 case graph beginning to soar, the department has called for a two-pronged strategy to beat the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccine-paucity-may-hit-mass-drive/article34293303.ece

11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccinations cross 10 crore doses despite the recent dip||Amidst complaints of vaccine shortages raised by several States, India crossed a milestone of administering 10 crore doses as on Saturday. The Health Ministry claimed that India had administered these doses within 85 days, faster than the United States’ 89 days and China’s 103 days. However, the 29 lakh doses administered within the last 24 hours were a significant decline from the 45 lakh doses — an all-time record — administered on April 5 (Monday). Since that high, the country’s daily vaccinations have seen a decline every day of the week, except for April 8, when it registered a moderate jump to 36 lakh doses and declined again on April 9. Data from the CoWin database, which displays vaccination trends over a monthly timeline, shows that except for the weekends, the number of vaccinations on a given day is usually more than the previous day. This particularly coincides with a steady increase in daily vaccinations that went down to 6.2 lakh on March 29 but then accelerated everyday to reach 41 lakh on April 3. However, from March 29 to April 10, the number of daily infections has zoomed from about 58,000 to over 1,15,000. This also coincides with vaccinations being opened for everyone above 45. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday that 13.5 crore doses of vaccines were available, of which 10 crore had been administered until Saturday. The rest were either in the ‘pipeline’ or in stock. With India administering 30 lakh to 40 lakhs doses every day, it suggests that the existing stockpile should be available for 10-13 days, though every State gets varying replenishments based on past usage, vulnerable population and requirement. Covishield, which constitutes around 90% of the doses administered in India, is facing serious supply constraints. Cutting across party lines, several States have flagged shortages in the last few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccinations-cross-10-crore-doses-despite-the-recent-dip/article34293116.ece
11 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Man with single-digit oxygen level dies struggling to find bed||A 31-year-old resident of Shivajinagar in Bengaluru died early on Saturday after being denied admission by two hospitals, prompting the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to order an inquiry. Authorities at Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital in Vasanth Nagar and the hospital’s branch in Girinagar did not admit the patient although ICU bed allotment was done through the State’s 108 centralised bed allotment portal. Mohammed Ismail from the Emergency Response Team (ERT), a volunteer group, who coordinated all through the night’s ordeal, said the case showed that bed shortage was again becoming an issue. “There is no guarantee of their availability even when bed allotment is done through the government,” he said. Ordeal begins It all began around 6.15 p.m. on Friday when the patient’s condition deteriorated after he was forced to leave a smaller hospital in Madiwala where he had been admitted for non-COVID treatment. He later tested positive, but the hospital did not have COVID-19 beds. The family hired an ambulance to take him home till a bed was found. The patient had been put on oxygen, but in the absence of an oximeter they did not realise the situation was deteriorating, Mr. Ismail told The Hindu . He coordinated with 108 to get a bed allotted and a High Dependency Unit bed was blocked at Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital at 8.15 p.m. However, on reaching the hospital around 8.30 p.m., the family was told there were no beds. “Although the central bed allotment portal showed the availability of beds, the hospital said they did not have beds and the same was not updated on the portal,” he said. Meanwhile, the oxygen cylinder was depleting. At 9 p.m., 108’s bed allotment team found another bed at the Jain Hospital branch in Girinagar. “But when the patient reached the hospital at 9.50 p.m., he was refused admission again on the basis that there were no beds available,” Mr. Ismail said. The hospital told officials from the war room that they had not yet started taking government patients. But the portal showed the hospital had beds. “They, however, checked his vitals. His oxygen saturation had plummeted to 25%. We managed to convince the hospital to keep him in the ER and give him oxygen till another bed was found, and by the time they took him in the saturation had dropped to 7%,” he said. “However, after he was started on oxygen the saturation rose to 57%, but he needed a ventilator. At 12.40 a.m., the family managed to get anICU bed at a hospital in Koramangala and he was shifted. After battling all night, the patient, a father of two, breathed his last around 4 a.m.,” Mr. Ismail said. He highlighted the issue of the portal not being updated with the right information. Nishant Hiremath, nodal officer for COVID-19 at Jain Hospital, said the hospital was not informed by the BBMP team that a critical patient was being sent. “They used to call us prior to sending a critical patient to avoid any hassles, but they did not call in this case. Also, all three of our ICU beds set aside for BBMP patients were full,” he said. The civic body has issued a show-cause notice to the hospital for denying bed to the patient in spite of a bed being blocked through the portal. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta told The Hindu that an inquiry has been ordered. “This was a case of late referral and the patient’s condition deteriorated rapidly within hours. People should not ignore any symptoms and should get tested at the earliest,” he said.  There is no guarantee of bed availability even when allotment is done through the government Mohammed Ismail, member of Emergency Response Team||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/man-with-single-digit-oxygen-level-dies-struggling-to-find-bed/article34293271.ece
11 April 2021||Mangaluru,||Night curfew: ‘No exemption for religious events in public places’||Ruling out any exemption to yakshagana, kola, nemotsava, and other rituals in public places, Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar on Saturday said all such events in the city should end by 10 p.m. with the ‘corona curfew’ in effect from Saturday night. Mr. Kumar told reporters here that the ‘corona curfew’ would be strictly enforced in the Mangaluru City Corporation area between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Except for health and four other exemptions provided by the State government, none will be allowed to violate orders restricting movement of people between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. “Those organising kola, yakshagana, nemotsava, and other public programmes should end them by 10 p.m. Right now, the government has not exempted performance of such events,” he said. Following announcement of ‘corona curfew’ in Mangaluru, Udupi-Manipal and three other areas in the State, MLAs from Mangaluru D. Vedavyas Kamath and Y. Bharath Shetty and Udupi MLA K. Raghupathi Bhat had demanded relaxation for religious programmes being held during the night. “Last year, all programmes were cancelled. If the programmes are cancelled this year too, it will have negative impact on society. Hence, yakshagana, nema, kola, and nagaradhana programmes be allowed by following COVID-19-appropriate behaviour,” Mr. Kamath said. Mr. Shetty said he would talk with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and seek exemption for holding religious events in the night. Mr. Bhat said as cases in Udupi-Manipal were very less there was no need for ‘corona curfew’. Mr. Kumar said as many as 45 check-posts had been set up to prevent unnecessary movement of people in the night. Each of these check-post would be manned by an assistant sub-inspector and eight other police personnel. Those violating the norms would be booked under the National Disaster Management Act, he said. Mr. Kumar said those picking up their relatives from airport, bus terminus, and railway station in the night should carry copies of travel documents. Those working on night shift should reach their workplace by 10 p.m. Loaders and unloaders of material at the APMC yard at Baikampady should report to duty early, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/night-curfew-no-exemption-for-religious-events-in-public-places/article34293905.ece

11 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assamese Muslims plan ‘mini NRC’||Assamese Muslims have decided to prepare their own “mini NRC” in order to distinguish the indigenous followers of Islam from Bengal-origin migrant Muslims residing in Assam. This, the Janagosthiya Samannay Parishad (JSP) said, was necessary to “overcome an identity crisis” indegenous Assamese Muslims have been facing because of being bracketed with migrant Muslims. It has created a portal where Assamese Muslims must submit relevant documents for this purpose. The JSP represents three categories of indigenous Muslims — Goriya, Moriya and Deshi. The Goriya converted from various indigenous groups and tribes, the Moriya’s ancestors were brought by the Ahom kings to make weapons and utensils, and the Deshi converted specifically from the Koch-Rajbongshi community. “We are undertaking the exercise from April 15 on the Assamese New Year day. Applicants will be required to apply online for the inclusion of their names in the list of indigenous Muslims. The draft will be published following verification of documents,” JSP’s chief convener Syed Mominul Aowal said. The exercise would be similar to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that left out 19.06 lakh of the 3.3 crore applicants, he said. “We left out the Jolahas, who were converts from among the tea plantation workers, because we consider the pre-British era Muslims as indigenous,” Mr. Aowal told The Hindu . He said the exercise was felt necessary as some migrant Muslims had undertaken an initiative to bring all Muslims living in Assam under one umbrella. “Our religion and names may be the same but the indigenous Muslims have a distinct identity, given by the Ahom and Koch kings,” he said. “It is unfortunate that in the name of Islam, the Goriya, Moriya and Deshi communities are being merged with the Miyas (Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims). We have to keep our identity distinct,” Mr. Aowal said. The JSP has created a portal with a three-month window (from April 15) for some 40 lakh Assamese Muslims to submit all relevant documents given by the organisation and competent government authority. The organisation will publish the draft following verification of documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assamese-muslims-plan-mini-nrc/article34293172.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The ‘armed struggle’ that goes nowhere||Hurt by incarcerations and “encounter” killings of senior leaders, facing desertions due to surrenders by cadres to security forces in various States, unable to build a workable organisation in new areas, and hemmed into what seems to be their last stronghold — South Bastar — such has been the status of the Indian Maoists lately. But this did not deter the insurgent group’s audacious ambush and killing of more than 20 paramilitary personnel in the Tarrem area in the Bijapur-Sukma district border in southern Chhattisgarh in early April, suggesting that the Communist Party of India (Maoist) might be down but was certainly not out. The Tarrem attacks is believed to have been led by the heavily armed Battalion 1 belonging to the Maoists’ People Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) and is led by a tribal guerrilla leader, Hidma. This ambush raised the number of security forces killed in the Bastar region to more than 175 since the killing of 76 CRPF personnel in the Chintalnar attack in April 2010. Turning point The Maoists have also been at the end of strong attacks by paramilitary and police forces in areas such as the Andhra-Odisha border that is close to south Chhattisgarh, in Gadchiroli in Maharasthra and even as far as the western ghat forests in the tri-state junction between Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The Chintalnar attack might have marked a turning point in the offensive by the Indian state against the insurgents — with a focus on a no-holds barred military campaign against the guerrillas even as governments sought to increase developmental work and infrastructure building in the remote areas with a strong presence and influence of the PLGA and Maoist organs to undercut any popular support. The CPI (Maoist) came into being following the merger of two of the strongest Naxalite groups — the Peoples’ War Group (PWG) and the Maoist Communist Centre — in 2004. The PWG was formed in 1980 by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah from the splinter groups that had broken away from the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), led by general secretary Charu Mazumdar in the early 1970s. The PWG had a sizeable following in the 1980s and 90s in undivided Andhra Pradesh as it had led mass agitations on various issues, including peasant wages and land struggles. It had also graduated into a military force by forming guerrilla zones in northern Telangana, extending up to the Nallamalla forests. Anticipating state actions, a group from the PWG had already moved to present-day Chhattisgarh in the early 1990s and had formed mass organisations in the tribal areas in the southern part of the State. Mass organisations of the PWG included the Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (DAKMS), which focussed on mobilising tribal villagers for rights to collect forest produce, besides some developmental work. While doing so, armed cadres of the PWG also used the difficult terrain to build guerrilla zones. Today, in places such as the Abujmarh forested areas in southern Chhattisgarh, the Maoists claim to have set up “janathana sarkars” — local government units. The merger with the MCC, another armed Naxalite group that was founded by Kanai Chatterjee in 1975 and had strongholds in the Jharkhand forests, gave a fillip to the newly formed CPI(Maoist). By 2010, the Indian government already identified the Maoists as the “single biggest internal security challenge”. Military force While the PWG, in its initial years, combined mass activism with guerrilla warfare and violent attacks on police, the group, especially after its merger into the CPI(Maoist), had largely evolved into a military force. The Indian Maoists have steadfastly held that violent armed struggle is a must in its aims to achieve a socialist revolution in India and have sought to follow the Chinese path to revolution in the 1920s that sought to mobilise peasants in an armed struggle to overthrow the state and to form a one-party communist government. The CPI(Maoist) rejects Indian democracy and electoral politics as they terms India to be a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country and the Indian state beholden to “imperialism, comprador big bourgeoisie [big business that is subordinate to foreign big capital] and feudalism” and which necessitates its recourse to armed struggle from the countryside to later encircling cities and capturing power. This is right from the playbook of the Chinese communists led by Mao Zedong in the 1920s. Yet, far from mobilising peasantry or even gaining their sympathies, the Indian Maoists have been reduced to seeking refuge in remote forested areas which offer them the camouflage and difficult terrain to engage in guerrilla warfare and to seek support from tribal people living in areas that are either under-developed or have limited access to the institutions of the Indian state. In Bastar, the Indian government’s recourse to counter-mobilisation of tribals into armed resistance groups such as Salwa Judum was brought to a closure by the Supreme Court in 2011 following the resultant militant backlash that severely affected the tribal population. Tribal disenchantment with both severe state repression as well as Maoist violence had increased in the last decade, a fact that is also lamented by the Maoists in their internal documents and has limited their support and growth. Despite severe reversals and setbacks — the capture and deaths of influential senior leaders and desertions by activists — the Maoists remain committed to militant insurgency even as they reject any call for a recourse to peaceful agitations or to enter the democratic process to further their goal. The elevation of Nambala Keshava Rao, a senior leader of the Maoists’ Central Military Commission, to the general secretary of the party in 2018 after replacing aged leader Muppala Lakshmana Rao was an indication that the proscribed outfit will continue to focus on military tactics and what it terms “strategic defence”. This is despite its inability to graduate from guerrilla warfare and to build base areas where they could offer alternative governance — a key step for advance that has eluded them for decades. In other words, the Maoists refuse to change their understanding of the nature of the Indian state and continue to deny that conditions and aspirations of the poor necessitate alternative political work that do not draw from revolutions elsewhere. The Maoist movement in India seems headed in the same direction that several violent and failed insurgencies, inspired by the Chinese revolution, went — from the Shining Path in Peru to the Communist Party of the Philippines. There have been exceptions — the Nepali Maoists, for example, managed to partake in power after peacefully ending the civil war — but if the Indian Maoists’ denunciation of these steps taken by their Nepali counterparts are any indication, such a step does not seem to be in the offing.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Mamata blames Shah for Bengal deaths||The death of four persons in Cooch Behar during the fourth phase of polling in West Bengal on Saturday triggered a strong reaction from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who blamed Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the incident and demanded his resignation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addressed two public meetings in the State, accused the Chief Minister of inciting people against the Central forces. Four persons were killed when the Central forces opened fire at polling booth number 126 in Amtali Madhyamik Siksha Kendra at Jor Patki gram panchayat at Sitalkuchi Assembly segment. “Central forces have opened fire and killed four persons. From the very first day, I have been saying that Central forces are not my enemy, but they are conspiring under the instructions of the Home Minister. They fired at voters who were standing in queue to cast their vote,” Ms. Banerjee said addressing a rally at Bongaon in North 24 Parganas district. What self-defence? While the Chief Minister appealed for peace, she refuted the claims of the police and the Election Commission of India officials that the Central forces had fired in self-defence. “What kind of self-defence? Who is injured?” Ms. Banerjee asked, addressing a press conference later in the day at Siliguri. She alleged that video footage of the incident had been deleted. Ms. Banerjee will visit the site at Sitalkuchi on Sunday, and has called for State-wide protests against the firing. Emphasising that law and order is a State subject, Ms. Banerjee said all the political parties in the Opposition should take a note of the manner in which elections were conducted. “It is a shame on democracy,” Ms. Banerjee said. The Chief Minister said West Bengal was witnessing an “undeclared imposition of Article 356”, and all police officers, including the Superintendent of Police, Cooch Behar, had been changed at the instruction of the Election Commission. Ms. Banerjee said the Crime Investigation Department would conduct an investigation into the matter. Earlier in the day, a Trinamool Congress delegation, comprising senior leaders, visited the office of the Chief Election Officer and demanded an investigation into the matter. ‘CM providing training’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Chief Minister was providing training on how to “gherao and assault security forces”. Speaking at a public rally in Kalyani, Mr. Modi said security forces conduct elections across the country. “The issue is not with security forces but in the politics of violence perpetrated by you,” Mr. Modi said, targetting Ms. Banerjee. “With defeat staring Didi at her face, she is inciting violence,” Mr. Modi alleged. Earlier in the day, addressing a public meeting at Siliguri, Mr. Modi urged the Election Commission of India to take stern action against those responsible. “What happened in Cooch Behar is unfortunate and sad. I extend my condolences to the bereaved families and urge the Election Commission to take stern action against those responsible for the incident,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-blames-shah-for-bengal-deaths/article34293045.ece
11 April 2021||Mumbai,||Decision on lockdown soon: Uddhav||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said the government will be announcing the decision to call for a lockdown in the State within two days, hinting at a week’s shutdown to break the chain of spiralling coronavirus cases. The Chief Minister also hinted that citizens may have to face few hardships in the coming days. At an all-party meeting called by Mr. Thackeray to discuss a possible lockdown, a consensus was reached on the need to call for the stricter lockdown at least for eight days. All parties also asked the administration to ensure adequate time for preparation before announcing lockdown. The Chief Minister will also meet with the State’s Task Force on COVID-19 before the decision is announced. The opposition BJP while agreeing to the Chief Minister’s stand, said the government must think about announcing a special package for daily wage labourers as they will be most affected. “We discussed the present situation in the State. We are running out of vaccines, hospital beds and ventilators and the number of patients continue to rise. Drastic steps need to be taken to counter the spread of the disease. Lockdown is one such step. But final decision will be announced by Chief Minister,” said Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Ashok Chavan, after the meeting. He said the lockdown is mainly aimed at breaking the chain and should not be long-lasting. “After initial lockdown there will be phase-wise relaxations,” he said. All three parties of the MVA, namely Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress stood together giving Mr. Thackeray a free hand to take the final call on a lockdown. Congress ministers, who had previously attended a video-meeting with party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi and leader Rahul Gandhi, also stressed on the need to ensure that daily wage labourers do not suffer as it happened last year during the lockdown. BJP’s state unit president Chandrakant Patil said his party sought a comprehensive plan to counter the possible financial effects on the people of Maharashtra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/decision-on-lockdown-soon-uddhav/article34293060.ece
11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||CSIR removes Rakesh Kumar as NEERI Director||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has divested Rakesh Kumar, Director, National Environment Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur of his post and transferred him to its headquarters in Delhi. Sources confirmed to The Hindu that this was after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) ordered an inquiry into allegations of corruption against Mr. Kumar and other employees at the institute. The allegations were levelled by a former employee of NEERI. NEERI is one of the CSIR’s most important institutes and works closely with the government as a consultant to multiple environment related projects and gives expert opinion in several disputes involving government and private companies on matters of air, water and land pollution. It also works in technology developments such as making “green firecrackers”, under the directives of the Supreme Court to improve Delhi’s air quality, and specialised air purifiers. Based on the CVC’s directions, a three-member fact-finding commission was constituted by the CSIR Director General’s office in August 2020. Mr. Kumar, through a petition in the Delhi High Court, had challenged the formation of such a commission, primarily on the grounds that it didn’t consist of members with the required technical expertise. The commission’s findings aren’t known but based on it the CSIR leadership, that includes Minister of Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan and the Prime Minister, decreed that Mr. Kumar cease to be Director and report to Delhi. The orders were passed on Friday evening and Mr. Kumar is expected to report on Monday. S. Chandrashekhar, Director, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, has been given additional charge of the organisation, the CSIR’s orders note. “The fact-finding commission’s findings are a prelude to the investigation,” sources familiar with proceedings told The Hindu . Shekhar Mande, Director General, CSIR, told The Hindu that Mr. Kumar’s transfer “was in public interest” though he didn’t discuss reasons for the transfer. Mr. Kumar, in a text message to The Hindu , confirmed he’d been divested of the charge but didn’t respond to additional questions. Whistle-blower move Documents filed with the Delhi High Court detailing the case suggest that in December 2019, a whistle-blower complaint to the CVC alleged that Mr. Kumar led a “syndicate of influential corrupt officials” and had formed active and shell companies to ‘grab’ consultancy projects. Mr. Kumar has denied these allegations and attributed them to a disgruntled employee who was transferred out of the CSIR-NEERI. This person, he alleged, had created a “nexus of suppliers” and indulged in multiple instances of misconduct. Mr. Kumar, it is learnt, has withdrawn his petition challenging the constitution of the commission but said he reserves the right to challenge, if any, its findings. The High Court dismissed the petition on April 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/csir-removes-rakesh-kumar-as-neeri-director/article34293032.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Fall from the top||When Anil Deshmukh met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar offering his resignation following the Bombay High Court order for a preliminary probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him, it was accepted in an instant without hesitation. But more than his exit, many believe, his appointment as Maharashtra’s Home Minister in 2019 was a bigger surprise. Since becoming an MLA for the first time in 1995 till his first loss in 2014, Mr. Deshmukh, hailing from one of the strongest political families of Vidarbha, had always been a Minister. His feud with his cousin Ranjeet Deshmukh made sure that he did not join the Congress. The 70-year-old Anil babu, as he is affectionately known in Nagpur, is now the NCP’s face in Vidarbha. Many were surprised by Mr. Pawar’s decision to pick him to handle Maharashtra’s Home Department when the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government was sworn in. Among those who were discussed for the job were NCP state president Jayant Patil and senior leader Dilip Walse-Patil. As per local reports in 2019 from Mr. Deshmukh’s Assembly constituency Katol in Nagpur district, the NCP leader had second thoughts on contesting the Assembly election on NCP ticket. Prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, several Congress and NCP leaders had joined the BJP. Mr. Deshmukh was said to be among those interested to switch sides as Ashish Deshmukh, his nephew and political rival who had defeated him in the 2014 Assembly polls, rejoined the Congress from the BJP, leaving no winnable candidate for the saffron party. However, things did not go as planned for the BJP. Mr. Deshmukh filed his nomination at the last moment as the NCP candidate. With no strong candidate against him, he managed to reclaim his home-turf. Mr. Deshmukh first won the Katol Assembly seat in 1995 as an Independent after the Congress declined him ticket. The then Shiv Sena-BJP government in Maharashtra survived on the support of Independents and Mr. Deshmukh was made Minister of State for Education. NCP entry In 1999, when Mr. Pawar floated the NCP, he joined the party. Since then, Mr. Deshmukh maintained his winning streak till 2014. Since 1995 to 2014, he worked under all Chief Ministers and handled departments such as Public Works, Excise, Food and Drug Administration, and Food and Civil Supplies. According to party insiders, one of the key reasons why he got the Home Minister’s job was his administrative experience and lack of political ambition. In his first year as Home Minister, Mr. Deshmukh walked a tight rope, especially with incidents such as the lynching of sadhus in Palghar district and the implementation of lockdown during the pandemic. The year became eventful with high-profile cases such as the arrest of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, the TRP scam case and finally the Antilia case where gelatine sticks were found near the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. And there were talks that Mr. Deshmukh was struggling to master control over the IPS lobbies within the police force. All hell broke loose when a letter-bomb was dropped by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, accusing the Home Minister of asking suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect extortion money of Rs. 100 crore. Mr. Pawar who chose him for the job held two press conferences in his defence, a rare gesture by the veteran politician. But the Supreme Court’s go-ahead to the CBI in this case cast a dark shadow on Mr. Deshmukh’s future in politics. The flamboyant politician who loves his caps is forced to go silent for now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fall-from-the-top/article34293072.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The rebel prince||When Jordan’s King Hussein was on his deathbed, fighting cancer, he surprised the nation by dismissing his brother Hassan bin Talal as Crown Prince in favour of his son Abdullah. Prince Hassan had been Crown Prince for more than three decades and was almost sure to ascend the throne. But he accepted the King’s decision and when Hussein died on February 7, 1999, Abdullah became the new monarch. As per the dying wishes of his father, King Abdullah II appointed his half brother Hamzah bin Hussein as the new Crown Prince. Hussein, who sacked his brother from the line of throne for his son, may have hoped that power would transfer from his one son to another in the future. But history repeated in a few years. In 2004, after consolidating power both within the royal court and the Hashemite family, King Abdullah stripped Hamzah of the Crown Prince status. In 2009, the King named his 15-year-old school-going son, Hussein bin Abdullah, the new Crown Prince. Prince Hamzah, like his uncle Hassan, accepted the King’s decision. But he did not stay silent forever. He occasionally raised criticism over the way the country was run. The growing discord in the royal family burst into the open last week when Prince Hamzah and a few other officials were detained for targeting the country’s “security and stability”. Intelligence sources told western media that the Prince was put under house arrest over a plot to unseat the monarch. Born in 1980 to King Hussein’s fourth wife, the American-born Queen Noor, Prince Hamzah was one of the favourite sons of the late monarch. King Hussein often described him as “the delight of my eye”. He attended Harrow School in England and then joined the U.K.’s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He also attended several military courses in Jordan and is holding the rank of Brigadier in the Jordan Arab Army. Over the years, Prince Hamzah, who has a strong resemblance to his father Hussein, has also cultivated strong ties with the Bedouin tribes of the East Bank, the core support base for the monarchy. And he often amplified the voices of dissent and criticism in the Kingdom. ‘Stable kingdom’ The Hashemite Kingdom has long projected itself as an oasis of stability in a volatile region. Jordan has been an important American ally for years. The palace feud has cut open the long-simmering wounds within the Hashemites, who claim their ancestry to the Prophet Mohammed. A key challenge King Abdullah faces is the growing anger among Jordanians about government policies. There are widespread corruption allegations. As a stable country in the middle of a conflict zone, Jordan has accepted millions of refugees from around the region over the years, which has stretched its finances. The economic woes mounted in recent months after COVID-19 struck the country. About 7,000 died due to the virus in a country of 10 million people. When nine COVID-19 patients died after a government hospital in Salt, a hillside town near Amman, ran out of Oxygen last month, anti-government protests broke out. Later Prince Hamzah visited the town, met the families of the deceased and consoled them. Local people invited the Prince for a traditional feast two weeks later. Within a few weeks, the palace crackdown on Prince Hamzah unfolded. King Abdullah now says the crisis has been resolved. But it is unlikely so. Even when he was detained, Prince Hamzah remained defiant, as the leaked messages show. He refused to keep quiet and accused the government of corruption, nepotism and misrule. The monarch may have bought peace for now. But can he keep Prince Hamzah away from politics forever?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-rebel-prince/article34293076.ece
11 April 2021||New Delhi,||Assam a testing ground for poll managers of Congress||The move by the grand alliance, or Mahajot, in Assam to shift their “potentially winning candidates” in the just concluded Assembly election to the Congress-ruled Rajasthan indicates the minute details being worked out by the Congress’s election managers. The thinking within the party seems to be that if it manages to reclaim Assam, once its stronghold, then the same campaign model can be replicated in Uttar Pradesh. The party has already named Rajesh Tiwari, a close aide of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, as a secretary in Uttar Pradesh, a State handled by Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra. Apart from being a a sign of things to come, it also indicates the importance attached to Uttar Pradesh where the party has not been a major player for more than three decades. An electoral success in Assam will also be crucial for Mr. Baghel’s standing in the party as his team has been closely involved in election planning in the State. The Chhattisgarh Chief Minister, who was appointed as the party’s observer, not only ensured that the Congress didn’t face any “resource crunch” but also provided crucial manpower to carry out ground surveys and voter feedback. He is also credited with the strategy to involve Ms. Vadra to campaign among women tea workers in Upper Assam, a traditional voting segment that had deserted the Congress in 2016. The party, in its assessment, believes a swing in the tea garden votes will change its poll fortunes, catapulting Mr. Baghel to the Hindi heartland of Uttar Pradesh. “The next area of exploration for Team Chhattisgarh will be Uttar Pradesh if things go as per plan,” a senior leader said. Success in Assam will also cement Mr. Baghel’s position as Chief Minister — a post that was originally meant to rotate between him and his Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo, who had helmed the party’s campaign in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-pulls-out-all-stops-to-return-to-power-in-assam/article34293042.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||‘India, U.S. differ on rules-based order’||On April 9, India protested against a U.S. decision to conduct a patrol in the Indian Ocean in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near Lakshadweep. The U.S said it had conducted the “freedom of navigation operation” (FONOP) to challenge India’s “excessive” maritime claims. The latest FONOP underlines both countries have “huge differences” when it comes to what a “rules-based order” means for the region, says Manoj Joshi , Distinguished Fellow, Observer Research Foundation. Excerpts:  What does UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) tell us about the statements from India and the U.S.? UNCLOS is fairly straightforward on this. You have a 12 nautical mile territorial sea, an additional 24 nautical miles as a contiguous zone where you can have some law and order, policing etc., and a 200 nautical mile EEZ which you are free to exploit, with fisheries or sea-bed mining but where you do not have territorial rights. Military ships can go through even territorial waters on what is called innocent passage. But India insists on notification not only for its territorial waters but even its EEZ. In Lakshadweep, there is another complicated issue called Straight Baselines, which allows countries to claim a larger area of water around an island group. The U.S. has challenged that as well. UNCLOS does not permit continental states like India to claim Straight Baselines, but only archipelago states like Indonesia or the Philippines. So there is a dual challenge here, including to the Straight Baselines, which makes this latest FONOP different. So India’s claims, both on notification and on Straight Baselines, are not backed by UNCLOS? Absolutely. I must preface this by saying the U.S. of all countries has itself not ratified UNCLOS. At the end of the day, when the U.S. talks about a rules-based international order, India is not following it. Neither the Straight Baseline claim nor notification is rules-based. I wonder whether there is a message to both China and India. The message to China, whose extravagant claims the U.S. has challenged in the South China Sea, is ‘we don’t do this only to you’. To India, it is ‘straighten out your rules-based order business’. How does all this sit with the Quad — India, U.S., Australia and Japan — advocating a rules-based order for the region? I presume when you say rules-based order, you’re talking about UNCLOS. I can’t see on what basis the Quad can implement UNCLOS. Do we do it on the U.S.-based understanding or Indian understanding? There are huge differences. At the end of the day, international law is about might being right. What the U.S. does as FONOPs, only the U.S. can do. When a Chinese surveillance ship came near the Andamans, the Indian Navy allegedly chased it away. Now, you don’t chase away the U.S. Navy. The other future scenario to consider is, will the Pakistan Navy come by and send a ship through India’s EEZ, or the Chinese and Pakistanis carry out a joint exercise there? Perhaps UNCLOS itself needs revisiting.  At the end of the day, international law is about might being right||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-us-differ-on-rules-based-order/article34293027.ece
11 April 2021||Gurugram,||Farmers block KMP Expressway in Haryana||Traffic on the 135-km-long Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway in Haryana, connecting the Delhi-Agra and Delhi-Ambala highways, was completely hit on Saturday after farmers staged protests against the three contentious agriculture reform laws at several points, in response to a call by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) for a 24-hour blockade. “There is no traffic on the road at all since morning. Farmers have been holding agitations at several points, including Kundli, Badli, Nuh and Palwal,” Vijay Tiwari, senior project manager, Path India, the toll collection agency for the KMP, told The Hindu . However, there were no reports of protests on the stretch of the road passing through Gurugram. All-India Mewati Samaj president Ramzan Chaudhary said 10 farmer leaders in Nuh were detained by the police while they were holding a demonstration at Rewasan. “Almost an hour after we began the protest, the police took us to the police station in a bus. We were let off after four hours,” Mr. Chaudhary said. Nuh SP Narendra Bijarniya denied that the farmers were detained, and said they were taken to the police station for “talks” after they blocked the Gurugram-Nuh road. Farmers thronged the toll plazas in large numbers around 8 a.m. and sat on dharna . The police were also deployed in large numbers to prevent any law and order situation. ‘Full support of people’ “Farmers blocked the Dasna plaza and Ghazipur border. They managed the langar and water on this highway itself. Farmers protesting at the Tikri border also blocked the KMP and set a stage. Led by agitating farmers of the Singhu border, farmers blocked the KMP at three sites. Due to the full support of common people, this programme was a complete success,” a press statement issued by the Morcha said. Cutting through five districts of Haryana — Sonipat, Jhajjar, Gurugram, Nuh and Palwal — the KMP Expressway has 11 toll plazas with an average traffic of around 25,000 vehicles per day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-block-kmp-expressway-in-haryana/article34293050.ece
11 April 2021||New Delhi,||Centre mismanaged situation: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in a virtual meeting with Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States on Saturday, charged the Narendra Modi government of “mismanaging” the COVID-19 situation by allowing exports of vaccines that has resulted in a domestic shortage. Stating that mass gatherings for elections and religious events had accelerated the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, Ms. Gandhi called for cancellation of public events. She said priority should be given to “test, track and vaccinate”. The Congress chief also took stock of the farmers’ protests, and of approval not being given by the President of India for State laws that negated the Central farm laws. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel were among those who participated in the meeting. Senior Congress Minister in the Maharashtra government Balasaheb Thorat, and Rameshwar Oraon of the Jharkhand government also participated in the meet. Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States expressed concern at the vaccine shortage, with Mr. Baghel claiming that Chhattisgarh had stock to last for only three days. Punjab’s Captain Amarinder Singh said that the State had stocks to last five days at current levels of vaccination. If it scaled up the vaccination target to 2 lakh shots a day, Punjab, too, would have vaccine stock for only three days, he said. Mr. Singh also claimed that the “anger” against the Centre over the farm laws had impacted the State’s COVID-19 vaccination drive. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said the shortage of vaccines was a reality that could not be wished away and asserted that “the Centre must take States on board as stakeholders and not as adversaries”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-mismanaged-situation-sonia/article34293065.ece
11 April 2021||Chennai,||Protection from reinfection may last only months: study||A longitudinal cohort study in India has found that some people who had COVID-19 lacked meaningful immunity against the novel coronavirus to prevent reinfection months later. The study found that 20-30% of infected people had declining virus neutralising activity despite having stable seropositivity six months later. The declining neutralising activity seen in 20-30% of infected people would mean that they might be vulnerable to reinfection. Studies are now under way to understand the presence and activity of memory T cells which can prevent the infection from progressing to severe disease. The first serosurvey was carried out in August-September 2020 and the six-month follow-up was carried out from the end of January to February 2021. Widespread asymptomatic infection when the daily cases peaked in the middle of September 2020 and the subsequent decline in new cases may be attributable to increased population immunity. By September 2020, a large pool of people who had recovered still had at least partial immunity. However, the reduced neutralisation activity six months later shows that the “respite may be temporary”, says a paper that has been accepted for publication in the journal eLife . Dr. Shantanu Sengupta, from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and one of the corresponding authors of the study says, “The study shows that if previously infected people are exposed to high viral loads months after infection, then 20-30% of people may not have immunity against the virus as they are unable to neutralise the microbe and might get reinfected. Similar observations have been made in a study undertaken in Denmark.” This would mean that one in five or even one in three people may get reinfected months after the first infection. Follow up “A large number of people showed neutralising activity below the first observed level at six months follow-up. At three months follow-up, a large number [40-50%] showed neutralising activity above the first observed level,” says Dr. Debasis Dash from IGIB and the other corresponding author of the paper. “The IgG antibodies [that can neutralise the virus] continue to increase and peak weeks after infection and then begin to decline. This is the reason the neutralising activity is higher than the first observed level in a significant number of people at three months follow-up. Since the IgG levels tapers after some time, a significant number have the neutralising activity below the first observed level at six-month follow-up,” says Dr. Sengupta. The serosurvey to understand the spread of the virus in the community was carried out by 136 researchers from 31 CSIR labs across the country. In all, 10,427 people from 24 cities in 17 States and two Union Territories were included in the serosurvey. Of the nearly 10,500 people included, 1,058 tested positive. Repeat serology tests were carried out three and six months later and included 607 and 175 people, respectively. Of the 607 infected people who were followed up at three months, the nucleocapsid antibody levels were similar or higher for most. While only 17 (2.8%) of them turned seronegative, 34 (5.6%) of them did not have neutralising activity at three months. At five-six months, of the 175 people followed up, eight (4.6%) turned out to be seronegative and neutralising activity was not present in 31 (17.7%) people. “We found that when 20% neutralisation cut-off was used, 17-18% people had lost neutralisation activity six months after the first serosurvey study. But if we use a stringent neutralisation cut-off, then 30% of them have lost the ability to neutralise the virus,” says Dr. Sengupta. “Our data show that while anti-nucleocapsid antibodies provide long-lasting evidence of viral exposure or infection, about 20% of seropositive individuals lack meaningful neutralisation activity after five-six months. Using more stringent measures (more than 30% inhibition of surrogate receptor-spike protein binding), the loss of neutralisation may be even higher. We speculate that this may be related to recurrence of outbreaks in March 2021, after the peak in September 2020,” the authors write.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/protection-from-reinfection-may-last-only-months-study/article34293067.ece
11 April 2021||New Delhi,||SC hears plea to decriminalise begging||The Supreme Court has asked the Centre and four States to file their response within three weeks on a plea seeking a direction to repeal the provisions criminalising begging. A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R. Subhash Reddy noted in its order on Friday that though a notice was issued to Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Bihar on the plea on February 10 this year, only Bihar had so far filed its response. The top court has posted the matter for hearing after three weeks. The top court, in February, sought a response from the Centre, and five States on the plea which claimed that the sections of the statute criminalising begging were violative of constitutional rights. The plea filed by Meerut resident Vishal Pathak has referred to the August 2018 verdict of the Delhi High Court which had decriminalised begging in the national capital and said provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, which treats begging as an offence cannot sustain constitutional scrutiny. “The provisions of the statutes criminalising the act of begging put people in a situation to make an unreasonable choice between committing a crime or not committing one and starving, which goes against the very spirit of the Constitution and violates Article 21 i.e. Right to Life,” said the plea, filed through advocate H.K. Chaturvedi. Referring to the Census 2011, the plea has said the total number of beggars in India is 4,13,670 and the number has increased from the last census. Social security It said the government had the mandate to provide social security to everyone and ensure that all had basic facilities, as embedded in the Directives Principles of State Policy in the Constitution. “However, the presence of beggars is evidence that the state has failed to provide these basic facilities to all its citizens, thus instead of working on its failure and examining what made people beg, criminalising the act of beggary is irrational and against the approach of a socialist nation as embedded in the preamble of our Constitution,” the plea has claimed. It has said that a person, who is compelled to beg due to certain circumstances, cannot be faulted for his actions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-hears-plea-to-decriminalise-begging/article34293055.ece
11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||IAF to adopt new process to lease refuelling aircraft||The Indian Air Force (IAF), which is looking to lease mid-air refuelling aircraft, will adopt a new methodology for the process based on number of hours per year of availability as criteria, a senior defence official said. “The leasing will be based on hours of availability per year indicating the minimum and maximum hours required,” the official said. “We will use the leased tankers for training purposes and keep the existing IL-78s in service for operational purposes,” the official stated. On the number of refuellers that would be leased, the official said it would be decided based on the responses the IAF receives. The IAF presently has six Russian IL-78 tankers and is looking at leasing of a few tanker aircraft to meet immediate requirements as the deal for procuring six new tankers has repeatedly failed to fructify. The IAF is also looking to lease Basic Trainer Aircraft (BTA) to fill the immediate shortage for training rookie pilots. With the follow-on contract for Pilatus trainers now scrapped, the leased aircraft would plug the gaps in training till the indigenous HTT- 40 being developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is inducted. A Request for Information was recently issued for leasing of BTA. The IAF has 75 PC-7 MK-II BTA procured from Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. under a Rs. 4,000 crore deal in 2012 for which deliveries were completed by end 2015. However, following allegations of corruption the follow on deal for additional aircraft was scraped. With Kiran trainers being obsolete and indigenous HTT-40 in advanced trials IAF is looking to plug the gaps for a short term through leasing of trainers About 20 aircraft could be leased for four-five years, officials had stated earlier. The option for leasing of military equipment was introduced in the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020. The three services have since listed several platforms for leasing to cater for immediate shortages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iaf-to-adopt-new-process-to-lease-refuelling-aircraft/article34293029.ece

The State has been placed under a 60-hour lockdown since 6 p.m. on Friday till 6 a.m. on Monday. Reports of shortage of oxygen and drugs have come in not only from Bhopal but also Indore, where a large number of attendants of COVID-19 patients staged a protest at the Dawa Bazar. Jabalpur also saw protests over lack of supplies. The State government has said all possible arrangements have been made for dealing with the surge in cases and maintaining supplies of drugs and oxygen amid reports in the local media of remdesivir being sold at many times its retail price. Addressing a virtual meeting of the Cabinet on the pandemic, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the oxygen supply in the State had been tripled in the past three days to 180 metric tonnes. He added that one lakh Remdesivir injections will be made available in the State every month. Orders for 50,000 Remdesivir injections have been issued for patients and the supply has also started, the Chief Minister said. One lakh beds are being arranged in the State, said an official adding that CT scan facilities will be provided at all district hospitals. Madhya Pradesh has recorded 4,882 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shortage-of-remdesivir-in-mp-say-kin-of-covid-19-patients/article34293061.ece
11 April 2021||Ahmedabad,||Controversy erupts over supply of remdesivir in Gujarat, M.P.||A controversy has erupted over the supply of Remdesivir, a life saving drug used to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, with Gujarat facing a major shortage. On Friday, State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief C. R. Paatil had announced in his home town Surat that 5,000 remdesivir doses would be given by the BJP free of charge to the needy. However, his announcement could not have come at a worse time as the State government has been struggling to ensure adequate supplies of the drug to hospitals inundated with COVID-19 patients. On Saturday, the Surat BJP office began distributing the drug to relatives of patients in need. The move was widely criticised by the Opposition, who questioned his ability to mobilise supply when it is regulated though government channels. “There must be a probe by the State agencies into how the BJP president managed to get the stock of 5,000 doses when people are standing in serpentine queues to get even one injection in all major cities of the State,” said Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhvadia. Protests held In Madhya Pradesh, there have been protests by the kin of COVID-19 patients over the shortage of remdesivir stock. Reports of shortage of oxygen and drugs have come in not only from Bhopal but also Indore, where a large number of attendants of COVID-19 patients staged a protest.

11 April 2021||JAIPUR,||‘Reduce health inequities to tackle pandemic challenges’||A study on the public health situation during the COVID-19 pandemic here has recommended urgent action for reducing health inequities to face the challenges posed by the spread of the infectious disease that has led to the loss of livelihood and productivity, increase in poverty and decline in nutrition levels. Jaipur-based Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) has identified some primary aspects of inequities, while underlining the need to integrate and address various determinants at the individual, community and the health system levels. Its study found that 40% of the health outcomes could be measured through social determinants. IIHMR chairperson S.D. Gupta said here on Saturday that lack of accessibility and affordability, poverty, lack of education, inequitable distribution of income and lack of proper nutrition were the gaps which had caused major concerns in the health sector during the pandemic. The transformation of public health could only be achie-ved through equity, he said. Global collaboration The study affirmed that the global health leadership should work together, improve data collection, identify and tackle the root cause of inequities and act beyond borders by sharing resources such as testing kits, treatment drugs and vaccinations with the low-income countries. Dr. Gupta said these critical actions would be useful for a State like Rajasthan, which had a difficult geography. “We have been able to fill the gaps for maternal mortality and child mortality, but nutrition has been a challenge. This is primarily because of the factors of deprivation playing a huge role,” Dr. Gupta said. Along with the bridging of gaps caused by inequities, a larger picture of health should be highlighted through Sustainable Development Goals with the focus on universal health coverage. The study called for action on “emergency use authorisation” as a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies. Empowered logistics and supply chain management could help deal with the pandemic, it said. The IIHMR has recently established a School of Public Health (SPH) here to make policy intervention for building public health capacity and skills in Rajasthan. The SPH is expected to play an important role in healthcare management in the post-COVID-19 scenario by extending support to the State government in harnessing new technologies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/reduce-health-inequities-to-tackle-pandemic-challenges/article34293408.ece
11 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘CISF, police fired in self-defence’||Members of the police and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) fired more than 15 rounds in “self defence” in a span of two hours at two polling booths in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi Assembly constituency in West Bengal, killing at least four persons on Saturday. According to a report prepared by the Border Security Force (BSF), coordinator of all central forces in the said Assembly constituency, two incidents of violence were reported at booth numbers 126 and 186 .  The report said around 9.35 a.m., a quick reaction team (QRT) of the CISF was attacked by a mob of 50-60 persons while it was patrolling the areas near booth number 126. Inspector Sunil Kumar of the CISF was attacked when he was taking a round of the area along with the local police after getting complaints that voters were being stopped from reaching the polling booth, the report said. “In the melee, one child fell down and miscreants started damaging the vehicle of the QRT and attacked the QRT personnel. QRT reacted in self-defence and fired six rounds in the air to disperse the mob,” the report said. After an hour, a mob of around 150 people “started manhandling the polling staff on duty at booth number 186”. “Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob didn't pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, QRT of CISF and police also reached at the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel, therefore sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired 7 more rounds towards the advancing mob,” the report said. “While the above incident was going on, more police party also arrived at booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired few rounds... It is reported that 5 to 6 miscreants have sustained fatal injuries and further they succumbed to injuries,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cisf-police-fired-in-self-defence/article34293046.ece

11 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Dolphin boom in Odisha’s Chilika lake||The population of dolphins in Chilika, India’s largest brackish water lake, and along the Odisha coast has doubled this year compared with last year. The wildlife wing of the State Forest and Environment Department released the final data on the dolphin census conducted in January and February this year, indicating a spectacular growth in numbers. Divided into 41 units, wildlife activists, academicians, Forest Department officials, NGO members, boat operators and researchers from the Bombay Natural History Society, Mumbai, participated in the estimation exercise. The population estimation exercise for dolphins and other cetacean species covered almost the entire coast of Odisha and was carried out within 1 km from the coast, using line transact at a distance of 500 metres from the beach. Dolphins sighted on either side of the line transact were recorded. Three species were recorded during the census, with 544 Irrawaddy, bottle-nose and humpback dolphins sighted this year, compared with 233 last year. Wildlife activists are elated over the sizeable growth in the population of endangered Irrawaddy dolphins, which are mostly found in Chilika lake, jumping from 146 in 2020 to 162 this year. Apart from Chilika, 39 Irrawaddy dolphins were sighted in the Rajnagar mangrove division, though their number has come down from 60 in 2020. The highest growth has been noticed in the case of humpback dolphins. Only two humpbacks were sighted in the Rajnagar mangrove in 2020. In 2021, however, this population grew astronomically to 281. “In 2020, the weather conditions were really bad. So the census teams did not have good sightings of dolphins. This year, our teams came across some large groups of humpback dolphins near Ekakula and Habelikhati areas, close to the Gahirmatha Olive Ridley nesting ground. So, their numbers got reflected in the census,” said Bikash Das, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajanagar (Mangrove) Division. “These humpback dolphins were not part of any riverine systems, so they cannot be identified as residential mammals. They were spotted travelling along the Odisha coast and the number is likely to fluctuate in the next census,” Mr. Das added. The number of bottle-nose dolphins grew from 23 in 2020 to 54 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dolphin-boom-in-odishas-chilika-lake/article34293114.ece
11 April 2021||London,||Dawood ‘lieutenant’ to be freed from U.K. jail||Jabir Moti, described in court as a “top lieutenant” of Dawood Ibrahim’s D Company worldwide criminal network, is set to be freed from a London prison and fly out to Pakistan after the U.S. dropped an extradition request for him to face drug trafficking, money laundering and blackmail charges. Moti, a 53-year-old Pakistani national also known as Jabir Motiwala and Jabir Siddiq, had appealed against his extradition order in the High Court in London and was awaiting judgment when the extradition request was withdrawn this week. The extradition request had stated that Moti reported directly to underworld don Dawood, who is a designated terrorist and wanted for the 1993 serial bombings in Mumbai. “Mr. Motiwala was granted unconditional bail by Westminster Magistrates’ Court. The USA have withdrawn the extradition request. Therefore, we will not be appealing any decision to grant bail,” said the Crown Prosecution Service, which appears in court on behalf of the U.S. authorities in extradition matters. Moti, who has been behind the bars at Wandsworth prison in south-west London since his arrest in 2018, had appealed against the Westminster Magistrates’ Court extradition order of District Judge John Zani from February last year, which had concluded that there are no bars to his extradition. According to sources, Moti now awaits a final Home Office sign off on the bail order and is expected to fly out to Pakistan in the coming days. The U.K. Home Office declined to make a statement, saying it did not “comment on individual cases”. Last month, Pakistani media reports claimed that a former Federal Bureau of Investigations agent had come forward stating that his FBI bosses had ordered him to trap Moti at any cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dawood-lieutenant-to-be-freed-from-uk-jail/article34293023.ece

11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Paying extortion money is not terror funding: SC||Extortion money paid to a terrorist organisation to protect one’s business is not terror funding, the Supreme Court has said in a judgment. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao released a Ranchi-based coal businessman, booked under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, on bail. Sudesh Kedia was charged with funding of terror. But Mr. Kedia said he, in fact, was a victim of extortion. He had been paying money to a terror gang, Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), to ensure that he would be able to carry on with his business. “Payment of extortion money does not amount to terror funding,” the court said, ordering his release on bail. Mr. Kedia argued that he was not a member of the TPC. “The members/operatives of Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), according to the chargesheet, have been extorting money from businessmen in Amrapali and Magadh coal mining areas and they have amassed movable and immovable properties from the said money. They have also been obstructing smooth supply of transport of coal,” the court noted. Mr. Kedia said, “There was no way he could transport coal without meeting the demand of the terrorist organisation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/extortion-payment-is-not-terror-funding-sc/article34293033.ece

In another incident under the same constituency, an 18-year-old youth was killed when miscreants opened fire on him when he was returning from booth number 285 at Pathantuli under Bolenhati gram panchayat. Two persons were detained, the CEO said. Sitalkuchi, an Assembly segment bordering Bangladesh in Cooch Behar district, has been on the boil over the past few days and the convoy of BJP president Dilip Ghosh was attacked. The ECI had deployed the maximum of 188 companies of central forces in the district. The Commission has deployed 793 companies of central forces for the fourth round of polling. The State recorded about 76.16 % polling till 5 p.m. across 44 Assembly seats in the State that went to polls on Saturday. Cooch Behar district where all nine Assembly seats went to polls recorded 79.73 % polling and Alipurduar where polling was held on all five constituencies recorded 73.65 %. In south Bengal, 10 Assembly seats in Hooghly recorded 76.02 % polls, nine in Howrah registed 75.03% and 75.49% of the electorate had cast their votes in South 24 Parganas. Bhangar Assembly seat in south 24 Parganas witnessed the highest voting percentage with a turnout of 85.12%.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Assamese Muslims plan ‘mini NRC’||The Goriya converted from various indigenous groups and tribes, the Moriya’s ancestors were brought by the Ahom kings to make weapons and utensils, and the Deshi converted specifically from the Koch-Rajbongshi community. “We are undertaking the exercise from April 15 on the Assamese New Year day. Applicants will be required to apply online for the inclusion of their names in the list of indigenous Muslims. The draft will be published following verification of documents,” JSP’s chief convener Syed Mominul Aowal said. The exercise would be similar to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that left out 19.06 lakh of the 3.3 crore applicants, he said. “We left out the Jolahas, who were converts from among the tea plantation workers, because we consider the pre-British era Muslims as indigenous,” Mr. Aowal told The Hindu . He said the exercise was felt necessary as some migrant Muslims had undertaken an initiative to bring all Muslims living in Assam under one umbrella. “Our religion and names may be the same but the indigenous Muslims have a distinct identity, given by the Ahom and Koch kings,” he said. “It is unfortunate that in the name of Islam, the Goriya, Moriya and Deshi communities are being merged with the Miyas (Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims). We have to keep our identity distinct,” Mr. Aowal said. The JSP has created a portal with a three-month window (from April 15) for some 40 lakh Assamese Muslims to submit all relevant documents given by the organisation and competent government authority. The organisation will publish the draft following verification of documents. There are provisions to rectify errors in documents. “We will also publish a list of names of people who are rejected. We are receiving donations from indigenous Muslims for the exercise that will be wound up by the year-end,” Mr. Aowal said. The JSP had expected the BJP-led government to conduct the census of Assamese Muslims and allocate Rs. 100 crore for it, as promised in the Assembly months ago. “We could not wait any longer,” Mr. Aowal said. According to the 2011 census, Muslims account for 34.22% of Assam’s population. The JSP claims the present Muslim population in the State is 1.4 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assamese-muslims-plan-mini-nrc/article34293037.ece

He was reacting to the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and the Congress flying out at least 20 of their candidates to Jaipur in a chartered flight on Friday. The Congress and AIUDF are constituents of the Mahajot. “It is certain that the BJP-led alliance will form the government in Assam again. This (shifting of candidates out of Assam) is a ploy of the Opposition alliance to create confusion and stay visible after being rejected by the people,” Mr. Sonowal said. He exuded confidence about the BJP and its allies crossing the majority mark in the 126-member Assam Assem- bly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaipur-move-a-sign-of-frustration-sonowal/article34293040.ece

11 April 2021||Guwahati,||Meghalaya villagers oppose dam on Umngot||Stiff resistance from at least 12 villages in Meghalaya has cast a cloud on a 210 MW hydroelectric project on Umngot, considered India’s clearest river. The villages are near the border with Bangladesh in East Khasi Hills district but the dam is proposed upstream in the adjoining West Jaintia Hills district. The Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board (MSPCB) had on Friday scheduled a public hearing for the project to be executed by the otherwise cash-strapped Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited (MeECL). Hundreds of people from more than a dozen villagers obstructed officers from conducting the public hearing at Moosakhia in West Jaintia Hills district on Friday. The MSPCB officials faced a similar situation at Siangkhnai in East Khasi Hills district on Thursday. “Everyone is against the mega-dam project as their livelihood is dependent on the river,” Alan West Kharkongor, president of the Meghalaya Rural Tourism Forum, said. The locals fear that the project, if executed, would cause irreparable losses by wiping out their areas from the tourism map. The project documents say people of 13 villages along the Umngot are likely to lose 296 hectares of land due to submergence if the dam comes up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/meghalaya-villagers-oppose-dam-on-umngot/article34293063.ece

At the police quarters in Egmore, Mr. Aggarwal on Saturday inaugurated a special programme to get police personnel and their family members in the city vaccinated. He said the primary duties of the police force were to maintain law and order, crime prevention and regulating traffic. “Keeping this in mind, we have adopted a strategy to contain the spread COVID-19,” he said. Awareness campaigns “We have been conducting a series of awareness campaigns and meetings with traders’ associations. We have explained the precautions to be taken and the guidelines to be followed. In all slums, patrol vehicles have been creating awareness of the necessity of wearing masks, following physical distancing and maintaining hygiene. At important traffic junctions, traffic police personnel, using public address systems, are creating awareness. All wings of the police are participating in the campaign,” Mr. Aggarwal said. He said so far 85,764 cases had been booked against people for not wearing masks, 117 cases for quarantine violation and 1,50,318 cases for flouting physical distancing norms.

Mr. Aggarwal said so far, 3,315 police personnel had COVID-19 and 87 personnel were still either under home quarantine or in isolation or under treatment in hospitals. “Only 6,000 police personnel have been vaccinated. Whoever is eligible should not stay away from vaccination. We have taken efforts to increase the coverage. Police personnel should not be complacent even after vaccination,” Mr. Aggarwal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-85000-cases-booked-against-those-without-masks/article34293765.ece
11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rise in COVID-19 cases fills up beds in city’s govt. hospitals||The day-to-day rise in fresh coronavirus infections in the city has led to beds filling up fast in major government hospitals in the city. In fact, a significant number of patients required oxygen support. At the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, one of the earliest exclusive COVID-19 facilities in the city, 521 beds of the total 575 have been occupied. Of this, 337 patients were COVID-19 positive, while the remaining were patients with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. “The cases are on the rise and the admissions are proportionate to it. Around two-third of the patients required oxygen. We are admitting persons who have comorbidities and those with significant lung involvement. We are seeing more young persons with lung involvement. We are also seeing sudden deterioration in patients, including the young,” R. Jayanthi, Dean of the hospital, said. The Government Corona Hospital situated on the premises of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, was filled up nearly 20 days ago due to a steady flow of patients. The hospital has a total of 500 beds. “As of 6 p.m. on Saturday, we have 462 patients. We have reserved 15 beds for emergencies to resuscitate patients,” said K. Narayanasamy, Director of the hospital. At any given point in time, 150 to 200 patients require oxygen, he said. Admission depended on the number of patients discharged a day, he said, adding: “At least 80 to 90 patients are discharged a day. Another 10 persons, who have recovered, are shifted to the COVID-19 Health Centre at the K.K. Nagar Peripheral Hospital. Persons aged 30 years with no comorbidities are sent to the Athipet COVID-19 Care Centre after evaluation.” As the hospital sees a steady flow of patients seeking admission, the administration has put in place a team, including a doctor and nurse near the hospital’s entrance to screen patients for fever, oxygen saturation level and blood parameters prior to triaging. P. Balaji, Dean of the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said 337 beds were occupied, of the total 1,200 COVID-19 beds. Of the 1,150 beds allotted at the Athipet care centre, 143 were occupied. “We are facing an increase in the number of patients. On average, we admit 60 to 70 persons a day. While we send asymptomatic patients to home quarantine or to care centres after evaluation, we immediately admit patients who need oxygen and those who need further treatment due to comorbidities,” he said. He added that 60% to 70% of the patients admitted required oxygen. “Overcrowding in public places should definitely stop,” he said. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Dean E. Theranirajan said of the total 1,618 COVID-19 beds, the current in-patient strength was 650. Of this, 402 were positive patients and the remaining comprised patients with suspected symptoms. With a total bed capacity of 450, the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital had 260 patients, according to Dean P. Vasanthamani. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan earlier told reporters that patients were directly approaching the Government Corona Hospital and Omandurar Hospital for admission, while 50% of beds were vacant in the RGGGH. “Do not go to hospitals directly. The Greater Chennai Corporation has screening facilities where doctors will check for parameters, including blood profile, X-ray and lung involvement and then decide,” he said. A hospital authority noted that many patients, who approached for admission after taking chest CT scans, were being told that they had mild findings. “We are flooded with such patients. Do not take CT scans. The first line of investigation is the RT-PCR test. X-ray is adequate, and CT is indicated only for severe symptoms, such as breathing difficulty,” he said. A senior doctor said the rapidity of transmission had caught them unawares. “The rise in cases happened steadily last year, while it is too quick now,” he said. While there was a need for more manpower, he said in the advent of the sudden surge in cases, protective apparel, such as personal protective equipment, N95 masks and gloves, should be supplied in large numbers to ensure that the healthcare force was adequately protected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rise-in-covid-19-cases-fills-up-beds-in-citys-govt-hospitals/article34293770.ece
11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Factors that influence women voter turnout||Women voters have outnumbered men in 103 high-turnout Assembly constituencies of a total of 137 such constituencies, where the overall turnout has exceeded the State’s average of 72.81%. This is a feature of the continuing trend of greater number of women taking part in the election than men. “There is nothing to feel surprised by the trend, which has been there since the times of [former Chief Ministers] M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa,” says P. Ramajayam, an academic. Major parties have been mobilising women because they regard it as a mark of authenticity for their prospects. As regards the relationship between a higher women turnout and the chances of the success of a party, he says, “You cannot form any stereotypical conclusion about their choice. The women factor has always brought in an impressive change.” Despite the DMK and the AIADMK giving certain attractive assurances, the women do not feel so much excited, and this should be one of the reasons for the women turnout in 2021 not exceeding that of the 2016 election, in which 74.33% women had cast their votes as against 72.55% this time, Dr. Ramajayam adds. But K.M. Rama Goundar, a Krishnagiri farmer, views the assurances — the provision of Rs. 1,000 a month (by the DMK) or Rs. 1,500 a month to the woman head of every family and washing machines (by the AIADMK) — as those which have caught the imagination of the women. “My reading is that they have voted en masse for a party of their choice.” A woman academic, who teaches political science at a city college, stresses that the two principal parties promises freebies to woo women as the freebies are meant to make the lives of the women easy. But once the election is over and the portfolios are allocated, the women are not given their due. E. M. Sudarasana Natchiappan, a former Union Minister, says the current election cannot be called an issue-based election. “In my estimate, 60% of the electors need motivational factors to come to polling booths... This holds good for the women too.” Migration factor As for a higher number of women than men having voted in many constituencies in the Cauvery delta and southern districts, he says that thanks to the migration of a large number of men from this region, it is women who outnumber men at the polling booths. Though one half of the men have returned to their native places in districts such as Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga after COVID-19 broke out, there is a “perceptible lack of interest” among them to vote, he adds. A veteran political leader says neither the AIADMK nor the DMK has a “magnetic personality” to hold sway over women. “When MGR was alive, it was said famously that while men would vote for the DMK, women would support him and the AIADMK. And, during the period of Jayalalithaa, she had a following among women of the working class,” he said.  There is nothing to feel surprised by the trend, which has been there since the times of M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa P. Ramajayamacademic||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/factors-that-influence-women-voter-turnout/article34293193.ece
11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||6 districts have higher positivity rate than national average||Six districts in Tamil Nadu — Chennai, Ranipet, Theni, Coimbatore, Chengalpattu and Tiruvannamalai — have a higher COVID-19 positivity rate than the national average of 5.17%, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Saturday. “The target is to bring the positivity rate down below 5%. For this, we have to test more, identity persons who are infected, isolate and treat them so that we can prevent further transmission,” he told reporters after inspecting a COVID-19 Care Centre at Victoria Hostel here. According to the Health Department’s data, Chennai has a positivity rate of 8.08%, Ranipet 7.37%, Theni 6.85%, Coimbatore 6.21%, Chengalpattu 5.55%, and Tiruvannamalai 5.37%. Salem’s positivity rate stands at 5.06%. Chennai, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Nagapattinam continued to be the challenging districts where urgent measures were being taken, Mr. Radhakrishnan said. On Friday, India recorded nearly 1,44,829 cases, he said, adding, “Tamil Nadu accounted for 3.7% of these cases. It is a challenge that the daily count is on an increasing trend in all the States. Medical experts are analysing whether this could be due to a coronavirus variant or due to the careless behaviour of people... We are imposing certain restrictions starting today [Saturday].” He said these restrictions were like the first warnings, and if people did not cooperate, the government would impose stricter restrictions. He referred to the “corona curfew” that was discussed at the meeting with the Chief Secretary. “We are still not in the same position as Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab,” he said, adding that the aim was to prevent transmission and deaths. With the daily rise in cases, the Health Department has instructed every district to set up COVID-19 Care Centres. “These centres helped a lot during the previous surge in cases. While we had 54,000 hospital beds, we had up to 70,000 beds in place at these centres. In Chennai, we previously had nearly 20,000 beds. Now, we have readied 11,775 beds at 13 places. We have made arrangements for a COVID-19 Care Centre at Victoria Hostel with the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, being the link hospital. We will treat asymptomatic and mild cases at the facility,” Mr. Radhakrishnan added. COVID-19 Care Centres were already active at Athipet and at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Egmore, he said. All Collectors should take up field visits and ensure that COVID-19 Care Centres, beds and oxygen facilities are ready. “We have given them the freedom to directly recruit additional nurses, if required, and take in those who are willing at the district level through walk-in recruitments,” he said. Nearly 18 lakh vaccine doses were available in the State. Mr. Radhakrishnan, however, noted that Tamil Nadu’s performance in vaccination was not satisfactory, compared with its capacity. Asked about the possibility of contracting infection post-vaccination, he said, “A few persons have tested positive after vaccination. It takes 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine for full immunity to build up. Any vaccine will provide 70% to 85% protection. The important aspect is that if a vaccinated person gets infected, it will not be a severe disease,” he said.  Among others, Alby John Varghese, Deputy Commissioner (Health), and Meghanath Reddy, Deputy Commissioner (Revenue and Finance), Greater Chennai Corporation, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/6-districts-have-higher-positivity-rate-than-national-average/article34293191.ece
11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Difficulties in implementation of transport curbs to the fore||With restrictions pertaining to transport, including operation of private and government buses with seated passengers alone, MTC officials say there are practical difficulties in properly implementing them, especially during peak hours on working days. As the number of COVID-19 cases are increasing steadily in the State, the government reintroduced certain restrictions from Saturday. As per the new order, private and government buses plying between the districts and MTC buses running in Chennai will be operated only with seated passengers. In each bus, the seating capacity is 44 passengers and standing capacity is 25. To enforce the restrictions, the MTC rolled out 400 more buses, especially in areas such as Chengalpattu, Guduvancheri, Tambaram, Kelambakkam, Semmenchery, Perumbakkam, Manali, Kannagi Nagar, Ambattur and Avadi. However, on the first day, despite it being a weekend, passengers were seen standing inside the buses as all the seats were occupied. “Prior to COVID-19, 34 lakh passengers used to travel on 3,300 MTC buses a day. After the first set of restrictions kicked in, the number of passengers dropped to 21 lakh and now it is around 18 lakh. But we are operating around 2,700 to 3,000 buses every day, but it is still a challenge to restrict passengers to only 44,” an MTC official said. He said some adjustment could be made as the buses were less crowded during regular hours. “But we cannot ask passengers to get down as it leads to altercations. To enforce restrictions properly, we need at least 2,000 additional buses. Otherwise, the government has to deploy police and transport officials at each bus stop to regulate the crowd or stagger the office hours,” said K. Arumaga Nainar, general secretary, Tamil Nadu State Transport Employees’ Federation. M. Somasundaram, a consumer activist, said he travelled by MTC route 23C. “Crowd restrictions were not properly followed. Mask enforcement was also not done and there was no sanitiser at the entry point and buses were not sanitised. The passengers also have to behave sensibly. Checking crew should conduct random checks and ask standing passengers to alight,” he said. Rental taxis and cabs can operate with a maximum of three passengers, apart from the driver, according to the order. Autorickshaws can carry a maximum of two passengers, apart from the driver. “It is practically difficult,” said M. Sampath, general Secretary, All Auto Drivers’ Association.  Traffic police officers said it was difficult to enforce restrictions on share autorickshaws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/difficulties-in-implementation-of-transport-curbs-to-the-fore/article34293772.ece
11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Send 9 IAS officers on compulsory retirement’||In a rare order, the Tamil Nadu Information Commission has recommended “compulsory retirement” to nine IAS officers in the State, who held the post of Chairman, Teachers’ Recruitment Board, between June 2011 and October 2020. Asking the Chief Secretary to record in the annual confidential reports of the nine officers that they failed to ensure accountability and transparency while heading the TRB, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj recommended that disciplinary action be initiated as per rules and they be sent on “compulsory retirement”. The case pertains to the recruitment of teachers/assistant professors through competitive examinations conducted by the TRB on various occasions. The contention of some candidates who moved the TNIC was that though they entered correct answers in the multiple choice questions, they were marked wrong, denying them marks and resulting in them not getting the jobs. Expressing concern that a lack of accountability and transparency had resulted in the same mistakes being repeated in the conduct of competitive examinations, particularly in the TRB, Mr. Muthuraj directed the TRB Chairman to implement the TNIC’s order to provide full and complete information sought by the petitioners (who sought to know why they were not given marks despite entering the correct answers and also the material on the basis of which the answer keys were finalised) and initiate action against those responsible for preparing the wrong answer keys. He said officials in the TRB not just failed to address the issue despite court and TNIC orders, but they had also not taken steps to make sure such anomalies do not recur. Had the authorities concerned published the relevant study material or books on the basis of which answers were finalised at the time of releasing the tentative answer keys and acted as per the National Litigation Policy or the State Litigation Policy, cases before courts and the TNIC could have been avoided, he said. Invoking various provisions under the Right to Information Act, 2005, Mr. Muthuraj, after citing various dereliction of duties on the part of the IAS officers who held the post of Chairman, TRB, wrote to the Chief Secretary, recommending that they be sent on “compulsory retirement”. Questions raised Civil servants, both serving and retired, dismiss the recommendation as one that does not seem to be sound, and point out that such a recommendation is “not binding” on the government. One of the IAS officers recommended for “compulsory retirement” retired over five years ago. Pointing out that one of the rules governing the All-India Services relates to effecting compulsory retirement in respect of those who have completed 15 years of qualifying service or 25 years of qualifying service or attain the age of 50, they said the option of “compulsory retirement” could be used in respect of any officer only after carrying out a review of the officer’s performance, and that too, recording adverse observations at least on three occasions. If “compulsory retirement” is to be given as a mark of punishment, there is a separate disciplinary process to be undertaken. However, it is the government that has to decide whether to initiate disciplinary proceedings or not, the civil servants said.

11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Restaurants see dip in business||With the State government allowing only 50% occupancy in restaurants and cinemas and imposing restrictions in malls from Saturday, the weekend plans of many came to a naught. Many restaurants saw reduction in footfall. “The news of the second wave of COVID-19 has pushed down sales by 35%. As an industry, we are in fear because these fluctuations in business are not good for the sector,” said K.T. Srinivasa Raja, managing director, Adyar Ananda Bhavan. The number of families visiting the eateries too had come down. The only silver lining was that there had been no impact on orders received through delivery apps, he said. Selvakumar of Anna Nagar said with rising number of COVID-19 infections, his family did not feel safe going to a restaurant and decided to order this weekend. M. Ravi, president, Chennai Hotels Association, said that business was dull on Saturday until evening after the standard operating procedures (SOP) came into effect. He said that if business continued to be dull, some hotels would have to be closed. “If gas and oil prices go up and sales goes down, how will we pay our employees,” he asked. Other hoteliers too echoed the same sentiment and some had asked many of their staff to go home and check after a month. On Saturday, most hotels had put up notices that only 50% of the seats could be occupied at a time. Many malls cancelled events that were lined up for the Tamil New Year to avoid crowding. The frequency of sanitation at high-contact points had been increased and visitors’ bags were subjected to UV sanitisation. Steps were taken to ensure that everyone was wearing mask, trial rooms were being sanitised regularly and so also clothes after each try-on. Air quality was being continuously monitored in many malls. Pooja Patti, Centre Director, Phoenix MarketCity and Palladium Chennai, said that providing a safe and hygienic ecosystem while offering a seamless and an enjoyable shopping experience was their priority. “We are adopting stringent quality measures to maintain a high level of safety by ensuring strict adherence to all safety precautions and guidelines,” she said. Cinemas hit hard Cinemas ran to 50% occupancy with alternate seating. Industry insiders said that many tickets for Dhanush-starrer Karnan that had been sold for the weekend were cancelled and rescheduled after the State government’s announcement. The shows had been sold out. Some cinemas called up the patrons who had booked with their tickets and intimated them about the cancellations. A owner of a single-screen cinema near the city said that they had been reeling under cash crunch and the release of Vijay’s Master brought them some relief. “But this one came as a blow. We are now worried if this continues, more producers would opt for OTT releases. The government can at least allow more shows so that we can compensate for the loss in bookings,” he said. Their association had represented to the Governor for some relief, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restaurants-see-dip-in-business/article34293205.ece

11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Truck mixers arrive from Rail Auto hub||For the first time, a consignment of truck mixers, loaders and self-loading mixers were sent from the Rail Auto Hub at Walajabad, near Kancheepuram, by Schwing Stetter India, a concreting and construction equipment manufacturer. According to details provided by the Southern Railway Chennai division, the first set of construction vehicles/equipment from Walajabad was sent to Palwal near Delhi and this transaction will generate Rs. 27.27 lakh revenue for the Railways. “Around 64 truck mixers and others were loaded on 32 DBKM (defence, bogie military wagon) rake on April 9 and left the hub on Saturday (April 10),” railway officials said. The officials said that Schwing Stetter has assured them to take six such rakes every month to various destinations, including Howrah, Pune and Bhubaneswar. The company, a subsidiary of Schwing GmbH, a German concreting machinery manufacturer that is part of China’s XCMG group, feels that this would help consignments reach faster and help reduce carbon footprint. “Using trailers via roads is becoming a hassle. For instance, States like Maharashtra are not friendly with goods carriers and they have many regulations,” V.G. Sakthikumar, managing director of Schwing Stetter India, said. “They slap penalties and there are no fixed rules,” he said. “We are expecting Railways to come out with a correct definition and classification of this machine so that we get the exact pricing benefits,” Mr. Sakthikumar said. At present, Schwing Stetter India is manufacturing excavators at Cheyyar Sipcot and the products will soon be rolled out from here. With Walajabad being the nearest, the company intends to use the rail facilities to transport the products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/truck-mixers-arrive-from-rail-auto-hub/article34293785.ece

However, the Tamil Nadu government has allowed places of worship to be kept open till 10 p.m., instead of the earlier limit of 8 p.m. The government made the announcement on Saturday night, even as Chennai, Chengalpattu and four other districts witnessed a case positivity rate higher than the national average of 5.17%. The government also allowed an extra show for new films for the first seven days after release with a 50% seating capacity. There were representations from the Muslim community to allow mosques to be kept open till 10 p.m. to facilitate night prayers during Ramzan, which starts on April 14. The places of worship can be opened as per their usual timings or till 10 p.m. However, temple functions and religious gatherings are banned.

11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Despite Parkinson’s normal life is possible’||Parkinson’s disease normally progresses slowly, taking as much as eight years for a patient to see significant deterioration in their condition. However, with physiotherapy, the disease progression could be slowed, neurologists said. A webinar was hosted on The Hindu’s Wellness Series,  titled ‘Reclaiming Life from Parkinson’s Disease’, on Saturday, ahead of World Parkinson’s Day being observed on Sunday. K. Subramaniyan, senior neurologist, and Shankar Balakrishnan, intervention neurologist, at MIOT International, walked the audience through the various stages of the disease and ways to slow down its progression. Dr. Shankar explained that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the treatment options provided only when there is a possibility that surgery could improve the condition of the patient. The evaluation was detailed and surgery was ruled out if the patient could be put on medication and therapy, he said. Dr. Subramaniyan said the earliest signs of the disease were tremors. During this period, patients were generally put on exercises and monitored. All patients were encouraged to do physiotherapy as it gave a psychological advantage and made them feel they were able to overcome the condition. Though the genetic component played a definite role in disease progression, patients were advised to carry on with their normal life, he said. No specific diet On whether diet and exercise could help prevent Parkinson’s disease, he said while exercise does help slow the progression of the disease, there was no specific diet for the same. To a question on the success of DBS, Dr. Shankar said the ideal candidate was one who had the symptoms of the disease for four years. “DBS is offered only when there is a possibility that the patient’s life will change post-surgery,” he said. According to Dr. Subramaniyam, though there are no indications that urbanisation and industrialisation had increased the incidence of Parkinson’s disease, those who were exposed to abnormal levels of chemicals and farmers who use pesticides and insecticides were found to develop the condition. “Toxins in insecticides and pesticides do increase the incidence,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/despite-parkinsons-normal-life-is-possible-experts/article34293213.ece

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss expressed shock over the announcement that the CBSE exams would be held as per schedule and said termed the adamant stand of the Central board was not fair. Although the students were prepared to take the exams, the spike in COVID cases in the last few days had created a sense of fear and panic among them, Dr. Ramadoss said. The Class 12 State board exams are scheduled in May and students are afraid that they might get infected, he added. When the government had imposed restrictions and said not more than 100 people can be allowed in marriages and other occasions, how can more than 100 students be allowed in exam centres? Is it justified? Don’t the students face risk of being infected with COVID, Dr. Ramadoss questioned. He urged that students should be evaluated based on previous tests conducted and results declared. If there was a compulsion to conduct CBSE exams, then the boards should hold them online, Dr. Ramadoss added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-demands-scrapping-of-class-12-exams/article34293207.ece

An employee of a temple managed by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department pointed out that although they were being asked to implement the same SOP of 20 persons per 1,075 sq ft, no entry into temple ponds, no archanais or special pujas, 50 guests per wedding in halls and 10 inside temples, this time adhering to the 50% rule could become a problem. “People will accuse us of favouritism. Recently, during a temple festival, under the orders of the District Collector, the temple authorities had restricted the number of devotees allowed into the premises to 200 and people who had walked in created a ruckus. How can we turn away people saying they cannot enter, especially since these are places of worship,” asked a staff at a Shiva temple in the city. Relief sought Several Muslim organisations requested the State government to relax the rule on closing places of worship at 8 p.m. due to the month of Ramzan fromb April 14. “After the break of the day-long fasting, we have a special prayer called Tharavih from 8 p.m. to 9.45 p.m. The government has accepted our request,” said Mohammed Akbar, Assistant Quazi to the Chief Quazi of Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/temple-staff-in-a-dilemma-over-enforcing-restrictions/article34293266.ece

11 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anna University V-C Surappa’s term ends||Anna University’s Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa, whose tenure was marked by hostile relations with the government, will demit office on Sunday with no clarity on who will head the university administration. A convenor committee to handle the administration of the university has not been formed yet. At the same time, till Saturday evening Mr. Surappa said he had not received any communication from Governor and Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit on extending his term. Last year, Mr. Purohit had extended the tenure of the V-Cs of Alagappa University and Bharathidasan University on their last working day, triggering a controversy. In the case of then BDU V-C P. Manisankar, the extension order came after he had demitted office and left the town. Anna University has not yet constituted a convener committee to carry out the activities in the absence of the V-C. An official said, “the Vice-Chancellor has to convene the Syndicate and make necessary arrangements. So far, he has not called.” However, in the Syndicate meeting on March 11, in which all ex-officio members participated, the members had selected the Syndicate nominee for the V-C search panel. University faculty had pointed out then that the V-C would have no time to convene another meeting before the end of his tenure. With the model code of conduct for Assembly election in place, the government did not provide details of the rest of the members of the search panel. A source said the government had issued a gazette notification that the Jawaharlal Nehru University V-C Jagadeesh Kumar was chosen as the Chancellor’s nominee and retired bureaucrat Sheela Rani Chunkath as the government’s nominee. The notification had been circulated among the members. No farewell With no information on extension of Mr. Surappa’s tenure, the university did not extend him a farewell either. Mr. Surappa’s tenure was fraught with challenges as political parties opposed his appointment on the ground that he was an “outsider”. Mr. Surappa is a native of Karnataka and is on the faculty list of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Inquiry committee In November last, the Higher Education Department instituted an inquiry committee, headed by retired judge P.

Stalin on Saturday termed the Centre’s announcement that there would be no increase in fertilizer prices as mere eyewash. He also strongly condemned the move to abolish the Chennai-headquartered Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB). In a statement, he alleged that the fertilizer prices would be increased after the West Bengal Assembly election.  IPAB closure Mr. Stalin said that the IPAB was established in Chennai due to the efforts of former Union Minister the late Murasoli Maran. The authority had been functioning well and played an important role in dealing with disputes over copyrights, patents, trademarks and geographical indications. Because of its anger towards the people of Tamil Nadu, the BJP government had taken the step to abolish the IPAB, he alleged.

They left in two buses,” says P. Nallathambi, president of the Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Welfare Association. There are reports of another lockdown, and workers fear that they will be here without work, he said. The government should clarify that there will not be another lockdown, he said. “I have been receiving calls since the morning about some workers going back. It looks like there will be a repeat of last year’s situation,” said a pumpset unit owner. Some units have hostels for workers. But there are workers in the unorganised sector, and they may be leaving for various reasons, he said. Coimbatore Tiny and Small Foundry Owners’ Association president A. Shivashanumugha Kumar said a group of workers from his unit left last Sunday by bus after receiving their wages on Saturday. “They are scared about the announcement of another lockdown. There is panic among them,” he said. Messages on Whatsapp have only been making things worse, he said. A few workers are also returning home citing personal reasons, such as harvest time in their villages or family functions. Industries that had slowed down production are experiencing a revival now because of good orders. Hence, industries are facing labour shortage, said C. Sivakumar, president of the Coimbatore and Tiruppur Districts’ Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs’ Association.

11 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Eight elephants have died due to train hits||Eight elephants were killed after being hit by trains on the two railway lines, A and B, between Kanjikode and Madukkarai from 2016 to 2021, according to the Palakkad division of the Southern Railway. In reply to a query under the Right to Information Act, the division said the A and B lines passed through the forest and seven of the eight elephant deaths were reported on the B line. The division said there was no plan to shift the track on the B line, which passed through a dense forest. It furnished the reply to R. Pandiyaraja of Pavoorchatram, in Tenkasi district, in response to his application under the RTI Act. According to the division, widening of cutting and cess were done at various places to create sufficient space for elephants to move away on seeing trains. While Rs. 2.43 crore was spent on widening of cutting on the sides of the track from track location 513/500 to 519/400 B in 2017, a sum of Rs. 1.59 crore was awarded for widening of cutting on a 5-km stretch from track location 500 to 505 B in 2020. A tender for further widening of the cutting from track location 510 to 512/500 and 487 to 492 B at a cost of Rs. 3.1 crore is under finalisation, the division said. Sign boards to warn loco pilots, clearance of vegetation on the sides of the track, speed restriction on vulnerable sections (65 kmph during daytime and 45 kmph during night), elephant ramps on high embankments, lights to ward off elephants in cuttings, installation of audio alarms in the form of honey bee buzzing and a WhatsApp group of Railways and Forest Department officials were among other the measures taken to avoid elephants being hit by trains, said the division. “Suspension of traffic on the track on B line during the night and bringing the track on B line to the A line, which passes through considerably smaller patches of forest, are other solutions that can reduce such accidents,” added Mr. Pandiyaraja.  According to the division, widening of cutting and cess were done at various places to create sufficient space for elephants to move away on seeing trains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eight-elephants-have-died-due-to-train-hits/article34293197.ece

This amendment by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission to the Distribution code in December last year is yet to be implemented. Hence, the Commission should take suo-motu penal action against the licensee under Section 142 of the Indian Electricity Act, according to Coimbatore Consumer Cause. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of the consumer organisation, said the amendment was notified in the gazette on January 27 this year. However, the licensee has not communicated the amendment to the field staff and hence officials continue to take payment from the consumers to provide the infrastructure. "Any Gazette notification is binding to all the concerned. The licensee is not communicating to the officials concerned and the consumers are affected," he said. Hence, the Coimbatore Consumer Cause, appealed to the Commission to take suo-motu action, impose penalty on the licensee, direct it to implement the amendment immediately, and refund the charges collected from consumers concerned to install transformers with associated equipment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumer-body-seeks-action-against-tangedco/article34293790.ece

With the administration expected to lay 16 tables to count votes from as many electronic voting machines for a round, the counting room will see each candidate post a counting agent for each of the 16 tables. And, a counting agent for postal ballots and another near the Returning Officer. This translated to 18 counting agents for a candidate and assuming there were 10 contestants in a constituency, it would mean that there would 180 agents in the counting room along with the Returning Officer, his or her support staff and security personnel. Meanwhile, sources in a few political parties had asked the administration to take steps to screen those agents who were in the counting centre at present, monitoring the strong rooms. There were at least 30 of them for each of the 10 Assembly constituencies and they going in and out on turn basis posed a risk and therefore, the administration should either have them vaccinated or at least screen them every time they entered the counting centre campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/counting-agents-need-to-take-vaccine-before-may-2/article34293786.ece

Those persons were staying without toilet. The shed they stayed was poor. The administration had not made proper arrangement for food for the political party representatives. If they were to go out for tea and return, the security personnel posted there created hurdles.

11 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Manual scavenging exists despite a stringent law’||The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, was enacted not only to abolish the practice of employing anyone as a manual scavenger, but also for the rehabilitation of such workers. But there was no proper implementation of the provisions of the Act, said advocate Sahaya Philomin Raj. Mr. Philomin Raj of Madurai Legal Awareness Coordination Committee was speaking at the State- level consultation meeting on implementation of the Act here on Saturday. He said awareness must be created among workers on the Act’s provisions since the governments had failed to do so. Even police and corporation officials need sensitisation on the issue. Whenever there was a complaint from workers on ill-treatment meted out to them, the officials ridiculed them. The governments have not allocated sufficient funds for their rehabilitation, he added. Manual scavenging still exists, said Paul Mike of IDEAS. The claim that manual scavenging does not exist is not true and most of these workers are engaged on a temporary basis on daily wages, he said. Aloysius Irudayam of IDEAS said the mindset of people must change and the common man should also be sensitised on the plight of these workers. Advocate R. Karunanidhi who had filed a public interest litigation petition in 2017 to identify and rehabilitate manual scavengers in Madurai and Virudhunagar stressed the need for a separate bench like that of the Social Justice Bench of the Supreme Court to hear the cases pertaining to the Act. There was a need for continuous mandamus, he said. Though the Act was clear, there was no proper implementation of its provisions, reiterated advocate K.K. Samy. The welfare measures have to reach the people. Conservancy workers from across the State participated in the day-long programme. They shared the various problems and issues they faced during the course of their employment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manual-scavenging-exists-despite-a-stringent-law/article34293899.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for AIIMS in January 2019.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency, which will be funding the project, conducted a preparatory survey in February 2020. Earlier, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Joint Secretary (AIIMS) Nilambuj Sharan communicated to Madurai MP Su.

Speaking at a review meeting held here at the Collectorate in the presence of District Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver, Superintendent of Police E. Karthik and other officials from the Health department, he said that the pandemic posed a big challenge to the community. Only with the support and cooperation from the public, the task can be accomplished. The focus in the district should be on Rameswaram. In other towns, he observed that the situation was under control, but called the ground staff to be more vigilant. The government has provided vaccine dose for all those above 45 years. Hence, he urged the field staff to check door-to-door and find out the status. In case anyone has not taken the vaccine shot, the officials have to sensitise them. On the other hand, he suggested intensifying fever camps. Testing, tracking and treating should be the sequence, he added. While appreciating the district health officials and other stakeholders for their commendable work in keeping the number of COVID-19 cases at a low level, he stressed to maintain the tempo and ensure that the virus was kept at a distance. Sivaganga Principal Secretary to the government and District Monitoring Officer Mahesan Kasirajan said on Saturday that hospitals in Sivaganga district had 12,000 vaccine doses and appealed to all eligible persons to get inoculated at the earliest. The district is one among the lowest COVID-19 positive cases reported districts in Tamil Nadu, and the public should continue to achieve this target. He appealed to the people to cooperate with the official machinery. Reviewing the status at a meeting, presided over by Collector P. Madhusudhan Reddy, the Monitoring Officer said that so far, 2.23 lakh people were tested for COVID-19. Among them, 7,278 (as on April 10) were found positive and so far 6,886 were discharged from the hospitals. The district’s active case stood at 265, he added. Mr. Kasirajan said that 1,500 beds were ready in government hospitals across the district. The district had received 50,000 vials of the vaccine. About 38,000 including 18,000 public and 20,000 field staff were administered the vaccine. The district had 12,000 vials vaccine in hand and he appealed to eligible people (45 years and above) to get themselves inoculated through the 122 vaccine centres. The district administration, he said, had intensified fever camps and hoped the multi-pronged strategy would contain the virus from spread. He urged the residents to use face masks, sanitisers and physical distancing whenever they stepped out of their dwellings. The need of the hour was to fight the virus and to achieve this goal, the officials required total cooperation from the people, he underlined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intensify-fever-camps-say-monitoring-officers/article34293238.ece

The canal, created during the British rule, serves as a source for irrigation to around 2.25 lakh acres in Budalur, Orathanadu, Pattukottai, Peravurani areas in Thanjavur district and in some parts of Pudukottai district. Initially, around 4200 cusecs of water was released into this canal from the Grand Anicut and it was gradually reduced to around 3500 cusecs during the irrigation periods in view of weakening of bunds and water regulators. To ensure sufficient water, it was decided to renovate and reconstruct certain water distribution mechanisms in the canal at a cost of Rs. 2639.15 crore and the foundation stone for the project was laid by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, in February this year. Cement concreting of the canal bed for a distance of 100 km, reconstruction of 1339 water regulators, reconstruction of 21 high-level bridges across the canal, repairing of 12 other bridges, reconstruction of 24 water regulators and rejuvenation of 308 water bodies linked to the canal would be taken up, according to the sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ga-canal-modernisation-work-begins/article34293185.ece

11 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Reimposed restrictions come into force||The restrictions reimposed by the State government to check the spread of COVID-19 came into force in Tiruchi and its suburbs on Saturday. According to the Government Order issued a few days ago, restaurants, food courts and teashops can be operated only till 11 p.m., but only with 50% seating capacity. Cinemas and multiplexes will be permitted with 50% capacity following Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Buses were allowed to operate only with passengers seated. As per the G.O., most of the private and public buses began implementing the restrictions. The city buses, which were generally operated with many passengers standing, plied with seated passengers only. Most of the long-distance buses too were operated with the maximum number of permitted passengers. The time keepers at the Central Bus Stand ensured the departure of buses soon after the buses were filled with limited passengers. Several bus workers said that the daily collection had gone down drastically in the last few days due to the scare among passengers on the spread of COVID-19 infection. “We see just one-third of the crowd in the bus stand for the past three days. It seems that many people are afraid of going out since the COVID-19 cases began to increase exponentially,” said K. Kumar, 30, a conductor of a private bus plying between Tiruchi Junction and Chathiram Bus Stand. R. Ranjith, conductor of a State-owned bus being plied between Tiruchi and Dindigul, said that going by the present trend of limited number of passengers, it was difficult to load passengers to the full capacity. The trend was likely to continue for a few weeks. Irrespective of the patronage, all passengers were sanitised. Bus crew had been asked to ensure the passengers wearing masks compulsorily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reimposed-restrictions-come-into-force/article34293221.ece
11 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Revenue officials start razing Union Club||Authorities on Saturday began demolishing the Union Club, a sports-cum-recreational centre in the city, for its failure to pay lease dues to the government. Officials led by the District Revenue Officer began removing things like chairs, tables, sofa, fans, air conditioners and sports equipment. Some pleaded with officials to halt the plan considering heritage value of the club. They told the officials that cases were pending in Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court over the dispute on lease dues and recent action of officials on sealing the premises. But officials told the members to remove the belongings by noon. By the time the furniture and other items were removed, demolition of the main building, which was constructed in 1907, began. The earth mover pulled down a portion of the building by 4 p.m. Except for tennis courts, all other buildings were demolished. No one was allowed to enter the premises during the drive. “It is painful to see the building being razed. Officials have failed to note that the Union Club has hosted a number of International Tennis Federation men circuit tournaments,” says J. Narashimhan, a member of the club. The officials said that the club had not paid the stipulated lease amount to the government for more than 44 years. Notices were served on many occasions but the office-bearers did not take step to solve the issue. A senior official said it had been decided not to disturb the tennis activities in the club. The tennis courts would be brought under the control of the District Sports Officer. The players could use the courts as usual by paying a subscription. Union Club was the second major club that was demolished in the city. In May 2019, the corporation demolished the century-old City Club on West Boulevard Road after a legal battle. Sports infrastructure including badminton and tennis courts on the premises, which served the people for more than 100 years, were dismantled. The Union Club on Bharathidasan Road in Cantonment was set up before Independence. Several Indian Civil Service officers and important personalities including former MLA E.P. Mathuram, T.M. Narayanaswamy Pillai, P. Rathnavelu Thevar, and T. Desikachariar had been the honorary presidents of the club.

11 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Uncertainty over extending Montessori-based education||The School Education Department is apparently not in a position to decide on increasing the number of anganwadi centres for extending Montessori education-based LKG/UKG classes. The department will toe the line of the Health Department's stand on functioning of schools, and there is no certainty that the initiative that began in 2019-20 whereby anganwadi centres within the Government Middle School premises will be extended during 2021-22, according to official sources. The school education department has received feedback from rural parts in the district that the reverse migration necessitated by the COVID-19 lockdown had brought back several hundreds of families to the villages from industrialised region in Western Tamil Nadu. There are indications that the patronage for LKG/UKG will be high since the initiative implies huge savings of money for the displaced families. The need for poor parents to shell out huge amounts for pre-primary education does not arise. Also, their wards get the benefit of all the freebies of the government, R. Arivazhagan, Chief Educational Officer, said. The School Education Department had teamed up with the District Institute of Education and Training to train primary-level teachers to handle the LKG/UKG classes. The teachers received training to improve their learning, reading and writing competencies in English. Books on Tamil, English, Mathematics and Environmental Science were developed in convergence with School Education Department and supplied to all the children studying in LKG and UKG. While the anganwadi centres functioning come under the administrative control of Directorate of Integrated Child Development Services, pre-school related activities are handled by the School Education department. The scheme with convergence of the two departments has helped in higher enrolment of children in Government schools. It will be easier to retain LKG/UKG students in the government schools rather than find students for first standard, the Chief Educational Officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/uncertainty-over-extending-montessori-based-education/article34293210.ece
11 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Theatres comply with 50% occupancy directive||Theatre owners across Tiruchi prepared their halls for 50% occupancy as per instructions of the state government. The move comes at a time when audiences were just starting to return to theatres, they rued. Fresh restrictions cause concern among owners as their source of revenue was heavily hit last year. Business picked up around Pongal when Master was released but recorded a dip since March. Theatres sported markings on alternate seats in the halls after a few months of relaxations. ‘We did not think we would have to do this again,’ a manager of a theatre near Chathram Bus Stand said. S. Sridhar, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners’ Association, said movie goers were their bosses, and their safety was a priority. ‘We need to think of this as a permanent solution. If we follow the restrictions and Tamil Nadu becomes COVID-19 free, people will return to theatres,’ he hoped. Many theatres had sold tickets for Dhanush-starrer Karnan and were forced to cancel and modify ticketing, which will affect business. Theatre Owners’ Association has written a letter to the Chief Secretary and the Election Commission of India seeking exemption. ‘We have drafted a letter seeking permission to run shows only for Karnan with regular occupancy,’ he said. A similar plea was permitted in Karnataka when the state Chamber of Commerce there sought permission to exempt them from adhering to the 50% occupancy norm for a period of one week. ‘After the first week, they can enforce the norm,’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/theatres-comply-with-50-occupancy-directive/article34293223.ece

Several autos were seen carrying more passengers and some were seen plying with four or more passengers in the city. Many drivers complained that the restriction was impractical and they would stand to lose income if the authorities were to enforce the rule strictly. “We cannot refuse customers coming as a family of three persons,” said Bakrudeen Babu, State Secretary of the CITU-affiliated Tamil Maanila Autorickshaw Drivers Union. “If the officials enforce the directive strictly, we will stand to lose income. This will badly affect us as many of us are just recovering from the blow dealt by the lockdown last year,” he said and added that quite a few drivers had defaulted on loan repayments and had their vehicles impounded by financiers/ agencies. Some drivers were critical of the government, pointing out that share autorickshaws continue to carry several passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/load-restriction-impractical/article34293229.ece

11 April 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||‘Get vaccinated and follow protocol strictly’||Besides organising special drives to test the public for COVID-19 infection to ensure early medical intervention, steps have been taken to boost the immunity of the people against the viral infection by giving them allopathic and siddha formulations, Secretary for Higher Education and Monitoring Officer for Tirunelveli district M. Apoorva said. Speaking to reporters after discussing the pandemic situation in the district with Collector V. Vishnu and other senior officials on Saturday, Ms. Apoorva informed that 5-pronged strategy – creating awareness, making the public to wear mask and ensure physical distancing by slapping fine on violators, vaccination, treatment and strengthening the immunity of the public – was discussed in the meeting. Against the backdrop of menacingly increasing COVID-19 cases, it had been decided to put in place tough measures not to trouble the public, but to save them from the new viral infection. Those who have the symptoms should visit the testing centres to get screened so as to get the right line of treatment on an early note. Distribution of ‘kabasurakudineer’ and ‘athimadhurakudineer’ would be made available everywhere to strengthen immunity and natural supplements like zinc, multi vitamin tablets, ‘aswaganda’, ‘amukkara’ chooranam will be given even at the time of test at the test centre itself to boost immunity instead of waiting for the results. To make this drive more effective, all eligible persons should vaccinate as it would act as shield against COVID-19, she noted. Ms. Apoorva said the district had sufficient number of beds and treatment facilities for the COVID-19 positive patients and informed that the drive against the violators of the norms had been intensified from Saturday onwards. Mr. Vishnu said while 2,761 beds in various hospitals across the district are now ready to receive the COVID-19 positive patients, more number of beds will be added to this pool based on demand. Even as the positivity rate stands at 6.30%, vaccination has been administered to 44,207 persons through 64 government hospitals and primary health centres across the district and 20 authorised private hospitals. “We’ve collected Rs. 10.78 lakh as fine from the COVID-19 protocol violators since March 1, 2021,” Mr. Vishnu said. Ms. Apoorva said the Indian Medical Association had been alerted to monitor the hospitals that were exorbitantly charging for COVID-19 treatment and initiate appropriate action against the erring hospitals. Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City, T.S. Anbu, Superintendent of Police, Tirunelveli District, N. Manivannan, Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan and senior officials from the departments of revenue, public health and rural development participated in the meeting.

11 April 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Core catcher installed in KKNPP||The case of the core melt localisation device or the core catcher has been installed in the design position under the reactor pit of reactor 4 of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, which is under construction with Russian technical know-how. Sources in the KKNPP said the installation of the core catcher went on smoothly recently. “Installation of the core catcher, weighing over 160 tonnes, in the design position is an important step of the nuclear power project construction”, said Vadim Khlivenko, Deputy Director for Projects in India, Head of Construction Division at KKNPP construction site. The core catcher is a unique system of the reactor, which catches the molten core material of a nuclear reactor in case of a nuclear meltdown and prevents it from escaping the containment building to cause radiation in the surroundings. A core catcher is made from a special concrete ceramic to prevent material from trickling through and it also has a cooling mechanism to cool down the molten core material. “It is the first large-size equipment item that is installed in the reactor building. Currently core catchers are installed at all the nuclear reactors constructed under Russian designs,” he noted. Core melt localisation device is a unique equipment developed by Russian nuclear experts and is one of the most important safety systems of a nuclear reactor. A heavy-duty crane case was used for the installation of the safety device as it weighs over 160 tons.  On the progress in the ongoing construction of reactor 3, the KKNPP sources said the construction was going on as per schedule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/core-catcher-installed-in-kknpp/article34293270.ece

11 April 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers told to raise new blackgram variety||Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute in Aduthurai organised a ‘field day’ recently for farmers to educate the farmers on advantages of cultivating a new blackgram variety. The farmers were taken to on-farm trials at Soraikkavur and Ennakkudi hamlets in Kudavasal taluk where live specimen of a rice fallow pulse variety, AD (TR) BG 14003, has been cultivated. Explaining the advantages of the new variety, to be released soon by the Institute, its Director V. Ambethgar urged the farmers to opt for organic fertiliser to improve soil fertility, and take up rice fallow pulses cultivation to reap more profit with minimum investment. While appreciating the character of more number of pods in the blackgram culture AD (TR) BG14003, Joint Director of Agriculture-Thanjavur A. Justin urged the farmers to take up rice fallow pulses sowing before January 15 every year. Stating that machine harvesting of paddy and motorised bundling of straw had led to a reduction in the area of rice fallow pulses cultivation, Joint Director of Agriculture-Tiruvarur P. Sivakumar suggested that the problem could be redressed by increasing the seed rate by two to four kilograms per acre. Progressive farmers Murugesan of Soraikkavur, and Sivakumar and Murugan of Pozhakudi, Baskar of Kiliyur, Balu of Pasam and Sivavadivel of Ennakkudi presented a brief account on the various varieties of rice fallow pulses cultivated by them and the practices followed to increase the yield.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Chennai’s scorching summers get hotter||One of the clichéd references to Chennai’s seasons — hot, hotter and hottest — was never a joke, and less so these days. Harsh summer days started earlier this year as the mercury crept up steadily, several notches above the average daily temperature for the season by late March. Just two days into April, Chennai experienced its first hottest day of the year as the maximum temperature peaked to 41.2 degrees Celsius, nearly 7.4 degrees Celsius above average. This is rather unusual. In recent decades, summers in Chennai are becoming hotter. Though not alarming, meteorologists and experts note that there is, indeed, an increasing trend in the rising mercury level. Record-breaking temperatures and blistering heat became a common thread across many parts of Tamil Nadu and the coastal city this year as an intense heat wave tightened its grip on at least 20 districts for nearly five days till April 4. The sun was brutal in interior districts that sizzled till April 7. Heat wave, a period of excessive hot weather with the day temperature crossing 4.5 degrees Celsius above normal, is usually associated with peak summer days after mid-April. But this year, the heat wave spell set in a bit early, prolonged for more than five days and the temperatures soared seven degrees Celsius above normal in some places, especially in Chennai. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had released a seasonal outlook for temperatures between March and May this year. It had predicted a below normal temperature in the southern peninsular region this summer. However, officials noted that there was only 60% probability in the forecast for Tamil Nadu, given its varied climatological conditions in different locations. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, says that in the city, there had been a slight increase by 0.02 degree Celsius in May’s daily maximum temperature, going by the data for 1990-2003. At Meenambakkam, the increase in the daily maximum temperature is 0.006 degree Celsius, which is marginal. “There is a slight spike in the temperature over the recent decades. But there is no drastic change.” What caused early heat wave Dry land winds and the weather system over the Bay of Bengal that disturbed the wind flow pattern and prevented cool easterlies into the Tamil Nadu region were the reason for the severe heat wave. But it is a temporary phenomenon and may not occur every year, Mr. Balachandran says. The IMD now issues a two-week extended range forecast and a detailed health advisory, along with heat wave warnings, as part of the impact-based forecasts. “We are also strengthening observation networks for location-specific data and better forecasts in the city,” Mr. Balachandran adds. Contributing factors Meteorologists note there are several factors — wind direction, clouding or sea breeze — that influence scorching weather. Summer heat is felt more now as the length of the day increases after equinox day in March and according to the declination of the sun. In Chennai, easterly winds from the sea blow till the third week of April and hot westerlies set in. Weather expert Y.E.A. Raj says sea breeze is a significant factor that often saves Chennai from brutal heat. Those closer to coastal areas and even those within the city may have a quicker respite. For instance, the day temperature may soar to the same level of 40 degrees Celsius in both Vellore and Chennai. But it may drop rapidly in Chennai with the sea breeze blowing in. But Vellore has to wait for radiation cooling as cool easterlies may not penetrate that far. “We cannot compare the surface heat of Chennai with that of interior places. Coastal places like Chennai have the advantage of sea breeze. While mercury level drops in other places after May because of the south-west monsoon, it is for the same reason that Chennai remains hot even during June. Strong westerlies often lead to peaking mercury level and discomfort in June,” Mr. Raj says. In 2019, one of the hottest years of the decade, Cyclonic Storm Fani and Cyclone Vayu impacted the sudden spike in temperature, and June had too many hot days. “The number of hot days in which the temperature breached the 40-degrees Celsius mark has gone up in the city recently. The impact of global weather changes and urban heating following rapid urbanisation cannot be denied,” he adds. Studies, too, indicate an upward trend in the day and night temperatures, especially during summer, over the past three-four decades. Citing a study ‘Trends of the observed temperature and its variations in Tamil Nadu’ he authored with Anushiya Jeganathan and A. Ramachandran, K. Palanivelu, Director, Centre for Climate Change and Disaster Management, Anna University, says the mean maximum temperature has shown an increase from 0.01 degree Celsius to 0.54 degree Celsius at various places over the past four decades. Though not alarming, there is a steady rise in Chennai’s temperature levels, too, especially during summer. “The daily average temperature may go up by 2 degrees Celsius-3 degrees Celsius by 2100. We need to minimise carbon emissions and switch over to renewable energy. Green cover must be increased to control the spike in temperature. People may feel cooler in areas with green cover or waterbodies. For instance, IIT-Madras may have cooler temperature than, say, Saidapet. Carbon-dioxide captured from power plants could be converted into value-added products,” he says. Impact on health Humidity compounded the problem for residents in the coastal region around April 5 and 6 when the levels were more than 77%. With the moist easterlies returning, higher humidity levels made it feel hotter than actual temperature. The soaring heat level has its own effects on one’s health. At a time when coronavirus infections are spreading rapidly, the rising temperature and its health impact should not be forgotten, say doctors. V. Rajendran, associate professor of medicine, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said that on average, the hospital handles 30 to 50 patients with heat-related symptoms every year between April 15 and June 15. “Heat exhaustion is more common than heat stroke. But heat stroke is more dangerous. It is important to take precautions. Very young children and persons aged above 65 should avoid going out, especially during the hottest part of the day,” he said. Dehydration, drowsiness and tiredness are the most common symptoms of the heat’s effect on the body. The symptoms of heat exhaustion include general weakness, elevated body temperature of above 103 fahrenheit, rapid and strong pulse or heart rate, loss or change of consciousness, hot, red, dry or moist skin, he says. “We are seeing an increase in the number of cases of COVID 19. While we are concerned about a second wave of the pandemic, heat wave and heat-related illnesses should not be forgotten. Hospitals in Vellore see many patients who present themselves with heat related-illnesses in summer. This is usually associated with heat waves — periods of abnormally hot and usually humid weather,” explains Anand Zachariah, professor and head, Medicine-I, Christian Medical College, Vellore. What causes heat strokes When the body is unable to release the heat through sweating, the temperature rises. The brain cannot tolerate the increase in body temperature, and this leads to unconsciousness or drowsiness. Heat stroke is a condition which occurs in summer with elevated body temperature (over 40 degrees Celsius) and altered consciousness. The elevated body temperature can also cause damage to other vital organs, Dr. Zachariah says. Older people, patients with heart, lung, kidney, neurological, psychiatric, skin conditions and obesity are at an increased risk of developing heat stroke. He says that making available safe drinking water in public places is important. The elderly and children need additional care during summer. As senior geriatrician V.S. Natarajan says elderly persons, unlike any other age group, would not be able to withstand heat levels and are highly sensitive. “The thermoregulatory centre in the brain does not function normally in the elderly. They will have excessive sweating that could lead to hypotension, and they could also lose sodium, resulting in hyponatremia. They could experience extreme tiredness, nausea, vomiting, headache, dryness of tongue, reduced urine output, lack of proper sleep and reduced food intake,” he explains. With thirst sensation reduced in the elderly, he says senior citizens, except those with cardiac and renal diseases, should drink a minimum of two to three litres of water a day. S. Balasubramanian, medical director, Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, says that when children play without drinking adequate water, they may get dehydrated. Inadequate water may also cause urinary tract infection. “Children get prickly heat during summer. This could get infected if they scratch the rash. Summer is also the time when food-borne and water-borne diseases occur as eating out is common. There is a high risk of typhoid, diarrhoea and food poisoning,” he points out.  Heat exhaustion is more common than heat stroke. But heat stroke is more dangerous. Children and persons aged above 65 should avoid going out... V. Rajendran, associate professor of medicine, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital   In the city, there had been a slight increase by 0.02 degree Celsius in May’s daily maximum temperature, going by the data for 1990-2003.

11 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Choice of Angadi’s wife is not dynastic politics’||In choosing Mangala Angadi as the candidate for the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat byelection, the BJP is not resorting to dynastic politics, but it is a way of showing respect to the leader who worked hard for the State and died while on duty, said Arun Singh, BJP general secretary in charge of Karnataka. In a brief interview with The Hindu , he spoke of the choice of Ms. Mangala Angadi, wife of the formerUnion Minister late Suresh Angadi, as the candidate. “It should be seen as a measure of respect to the leader who died working for the people,” he said. “The winnability factor is also there. Being a byelection, the factors at play here are very different,” he said. He said the party was aware of the alleged rift between RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. “We are clear on what to do, but as of now our focus is on the bypolls. We will tackle administrative issues later,” he said. He said the BJP would easily win the three bypolls in Karnataka. “In Belagavi, there is no impediment for us at all. We will win only by campaigning about the good work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Suresh Angadi,” he said. He said the weaknesses of the Congress candidate would also help the BJP.According to him, the BJP’s lead would overshoot the lead of 3.91 lakh votes obtained by Suresh Angadi in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/choice-of-angadis-wife-is-not-dynastic-politics/article34293289.ece
11 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RTCs operate more buses as employees trickle back to work||Though there appears to be no resolution in sight for the ongoing strike, State road transport corporations (RTCs) were able to operate 1,626 buses on Saturday. On April 7, the first day of the strike, only 264 buses were able to offer services to passengers across Karnataka. Karnataka State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) managing director Shivyogi C. Kalasad said, “On Saturday, we operated 1,626 buses, almost double the number of Friday. It is a sign that more employees are reporting back to duty and we are hopeful that others will follow.” However, the number of buses currently operating is still a fraction of the fleet strength: prior to the strike, the four corporations were running more than 17,000 buses in the State. Strict action such as dismissal of trainee and probationary employees for taking part in the strike, and transferring some employees for allegedly obstructing their colleagues who reported back to duty or instigating others to participate in the strike is yielding results. “The corporations have also filed complaints against those obstructing employees who are willing to report back to duty and pelting stones at buses,” said Mr. Kalasad He added that trainees or probationary employees who continue to participate in the strike or remain absent would face action. “Those who have been dismissed from service will not be reinstated,” he said. However, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employees League reiterated that it had no intention of calling off the strike. President of the league, R. Chandrashekar said, “Some employees of other unions are reporting back to duty. Those who have identified with us are still on strike. We will continue.”  Private operators cry foul Private operators, however, are irked by this development, and have demanded that the KSRTC follow a queue system at bus stands. Chairman of the Karnataka State Travel Operators Association S. Nataraj Sharma said, “When RTC employees went on an indefinite strike, the State government had requested private operators to run buses from major bus stands. But now the KSRTC is gradually increasing its operations and we are being sidelined. When other private buses are waiting for the passenger, KSRTC buses should not jump the queue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rtcs-operate-more-buses-as-employees-trickle-back-to-work/article34293299.ece
11 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccination sites in apartment complexes||Following a surge in COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru, the civic body has wasted no time in rolling out vaccination session sites at apartment complexes, slums and campuses of industries, including tech parks and multinational corporations. As on Friday, session sites had been opened in 19 apartment complexes, 36 slums and seven industries across the eight zones. Separate vaccination camps were being organised in slums. In all, 62 new session sites have been created in apartment complexes, slums and industries where 3,478 persons have been vaccinated. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Special Commissioner (Health) P. Rajendra Cholan told The Hindu that session sites were being opened in apartments that had tied up with private medical establishments. Nearly 3,500 big apartment complexes in the city had been identified with help from Bangalore Apartments’ Federation and mapped with the nearest private medical establishments. Vaccination sites have also been opened at Embassy Manyata Business Park, Embassy TechVillage and the Infosys campus. A press release from Embassy REIT said their target was to vaccinate 1,450 staff over the next 10 days. According to Mr. Cholan, with the rollout of new vaccination sites or sub-centres, the average vaccinations per day has increased from 35,000 to around 45,000. “The biggest challenge earlier was to get residents of apartments vaccinated. By opening sub-centres in the communities itself, we have seen a rise in the number of residents coming forward to get vaccinated,” he said. As part of the special vaccination drive announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi between April 11 and 14, many more industries, tech parks and MNCs are waiting to open session sites in their premises. The number of session sites in the city may increase, as will the number of vaccinations per day during this period, said Mr. Cholan. Meanwhile, the BBMP has been directed to vaccinate five lakh citizens residing in South zone over the next 15 days by setting up more session sites in apartments, club houses and other public places. This was one of the decisions taken at a meeting chaired by Revenue Minister R. Ashok and Bengaluru (South) MP Tejasvi Surya. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta inspected the proposed COVID-19 Care Centre (CCC) set up by BOSCH that will be operational in two days.

11 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Private hospitals run out of Remdesivir||Private hospitals are reporting an acute shortage of Remdesivir, widely used to treat COVID-19 patients. The shortage, mainly faced by small and medium-size hospitals, has prompted the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) to write to the State Health Department requesting that the injection be supplied through the Karnataka State Drugs Logistics and Warehousing Society. Currently, the government supplies this drug to private hospitals only when patients are referred by the government through Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST). Each patient requires six doses of the 100 mg injection of which two are given on the first day followed by one dose for the next four days. PHANA president Prasanna H.M. told The Hindu that he wrote to Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar and Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) Jawaid Akhtar in this regard on Saturday. While corporate hospitals have the drug, smaller hospitals that had not anticipated the sudden rush of patients are scrambling to procure the drug, he said. The drug that was last year given only to those with severe infection is now being given to all with COVID-19 pneumonia and high inflammatory markers. R. Ravindra, Managing Director of Suguna Hospital and former PHANA president, said the problem started on April 1. “Last Saturday, we needed 116 doses for patients admitted in our hospital but we had only 30. Although the price of the drug bought in bulk ranges between Rs. 800 and Rs. 3,000 per injection, we are paying the MRP that varies between Rs. 1,400 and Rs. 5,400,” he said. Hospitals are facing a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 injections per week in Bengaluru, he said. Sabeel Nazir from Naasih Foundation, an NGO that helps provide free medicines for poor patients, said the problem is across the country as manufacturers had not expected a rapid surge in COVID-19. “On an average, I have been getting 60 calls daily, including from Maharashtra,” he said. “Following the decline in cases last year, distributors had surplus stocks and had requested pharma companies to take them back. Distributors that I am in touch with said manufacturers have begun production, and it will take at least two weeks for the stocks to reach the market,” said Mr. Nazir. Mr. Akhtar told PHANA to assess the demand based on which the department will come out with a solution. “I am told manufacturers have started production and it will take a few weeks for the situation to stabilise,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-hospitals-run-out-of-remdesivir/article34293746.ece

11 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Sidi ritual given up at Udusalamma jatra||The Udusalamma jatra mahotsava, held once in two years at Hariharapura in Holenarsipur taluk, was different this time on. The ritual of Sidi – hook swinging – which was a part of the festival these years, was not conducted during the event on Saturday, thanks to the anti-superstition law that prohibits practices involve inserting hooks into flesh. Several progressive organisations had urged the administration to stop the practice as per the Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and Black Magic Act, 2017, that came into effect on January 4, 2020. The taluk administration had issued instructions to the villagers not to hold the customs. All these years, hook-swinging and locking mouths of women with iron hooks were part of this festival. Residents of Hariharapura and six other villages nearby take part in the event. A few male members of select Dalit families of Chakenahalli performed Sidi. They had to maintain fast for a week before the festival day. Early morning on the day, iron hooks were inserted into the flesh of their back. Later they were tied to a long tree trunk, mounted on a wooden pedestal. Hundreds of people gathered would cheer as the trunk with men tied to it was made to rotate in 360 degrees. Besides that, many women, including those from upper castes, did take part in the procession with their mouths locked by iron hooks. However, this time, in place of Dalit men, garlands were tied to the tree trunk and a symbolic Sidi was held. No woman had her mouth locked up with iron hooks. Opposition For the last few years, a section of villagers opposed the customs that involved inserting iron hooks into the body. They received the support of Dalit Hakkugala Samiti (DHS) in Hassan in 2017, when the organisation submitted a memorandum to the district administration to stop the inhuman customs. “Then there was no law to stop such practices. The police had issued us a notice accusing us of disturbing the peace for urging the administration to stop the customs. However, this time, the custom has been stopped, thanks to the law. Besides that, a few youths of Chakenahalli stood firm and wanted that the custom should end. All these efforts have finally helped to put an end to the customs”, said M.G.Pruthvi, the district convener of DHS. Holenarasipur tahsildar K.R. Srinivas and DySP Lakshme Gowda had held meetings with villagers instructing them not to hold the customs prohibited by law. They had also imposed restrictions on the event in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sidi-ritual-given-up-at-udusalamma-jatra/article34293375.ece

11 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Nation’s real growth lies in rural development: GRAAM founder||“The real development of the nation lies in the development of the villages. And the youth, especially those with education and specialisation in rural development, should initiate innovations at the rural level,” said R. Balasubramaniam, founder president of Grassroots Research and Advocacy Movement (GRAAM). Delivering an address at the first convocation of Karnataka State Rural Development and Panchayat Raj University at its Nagavi campus in Gadag on Saturday, Dr. Balasubramaniam said when the seed of nation’s development germinated at the panchayat level, it would invariably lead to the progress of the State and the country. “Rural India has contributed a great deal to the progress of the country. There is no dearth of innovative ideas among the rural population. There is lack of required infrastructure and if that is met, then innovations and progress will automatically follow,” he said. He said that the world was looking at India for its unique features of rural India and its economy. “The desi culture and rural economy is a model to others,” he said. Dr. Balasubramaniam said there was a need for sensitising the people on active participation in the panchayat raj system. A collective participation would result in pushing aside politics and making the community one unit. And this transformation would automatically lead to collective efforts and ultimately, the desired results, he said. Vice-Chancellor of the university Vishnukant S. Chatpalli termed the first convocation as the first step towards rural transformation. Pro-Chancellor and Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa awarded various degrees to graduating students. On the occasion, former Minister H.K. Patil was awarded honorary doctoral degree for his contribution towards law, public policy and social service. Senior bureaucrat Ashok Dalwai was honoured with D.Lit. for his work in the field of tribal life and culture. Mr. Eshwarappa presented the honorary doctoral degrees. Toppers of the five post-graduate courses of the university for 2018-19 and 2019-20 were honoured with gold medals and second and third-rank holders were awarded certificates of merit. Earlier, a procession was carried out from Sabarmati Ashram on the university campus to the convocation venue. To signify the importance of khadi in rural development, all dignitaries and graduating students wore khadi. Registrar Basavaraj Lakkannavar, finance officer Prashanth G.C., directors and deans of various schools of the university, and members of academic council and syndicate were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nations-real-growth-lies-in-rural-development-graam-founder/article34293282.ece

As per data provided by the Chief Executive officer of Kalaburagi Zilla Panchayat, Dileesh Sasi, around 43 villages in Aland taluk are likely to face water scarcity during peak summer. In Kalaburagi taluk, 38 villages are likely to face scarcity, followed by Chincholli taluk with 24 villages, and Afzalpur taluk with 21 villages. As many as 13 villages in Jewargi taluk, 11 villages in Cittapur, and six villages in Sedam taluk would also face scarcity. In an attempt to mitigate portable water scarcity, the district administration has identified many private borewells in each taluk. If required, the administration will rope in tankers to supply water to worst-affected villages, officials said. The severe drought situation witnessed for four consecutive years (from 2016 to 2019) in Kalaburagi district had directly affected groundwater levels. However, the district received (64% excess rain) post-monsoon rain between October and December last year; this helped boost availability of water for the summer season to some extent. During 2016-17 and 2017-18, the district faced severe drought conditions. Of the total 1,287 villages, 922 had been declared drought hit. In 2019-20, around 780 villages had drinking water crisis. As per sources, officials have not made any action plan for the retrieval and hydrofracturing of borewells, repairs, and drilling of new borewells.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/156-villages-in-kalaburagi-dist-likely-to-face-water-scarcity/article34293279.ece

11 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Give back to your alma mater, Sudha Murty tells students||Infosys Foundation chairperson Sudha Murty on Saturday exhorted the student community to give back to their alma mater a part of their earnings. “All earnings are not for you; you are entitled only to part of it,” she said. Delivering the 39th annual convocation address of Mangalore University through virtual mode, Ms. Murty said: “Giving back is always a joy”. Giving her own example, she said if there was no BVB College of Engineering and Karnataka University at Hubballi-Dharwad, she would not have become an engineer. Then she would not have supported N.R. Narayana Murty to set up Infosys. As such, every educational institution in one’s life plays a very crucial role, Ms. Murty said. Quoting the 33 tenets of Taittiriya Upanishad that were taught at the Ghatikotsava of Gurukulas, Ms. Murty said they taught students how one should lead life after academics. These tenets were mentioned during annual convocations of universities in earlier days, she remembered. When one earns money more than one’s requirements, it might push one’s next generation to bad habits. As such, the same should be shared with the less privileged to enjoy happiness in life. Stating that life outside academics would totally be different, Ms. Murty urged students to be careful and work hard. Unlike academics where teachers forgive students’ mistakes, there would be none to forgive mistakes in the real world. Every day, they would have examination that does not have any syllabus. She told students not to get bogged by failures nor get elated by success. Series of successes would make one arrogant, she said. Similarly, students should keep updating their knowledge; the day one stops acquiring new knowledge, one becomes an old person. Knowledge is endless and that was why scholars and teachers were revered, Ms. Murty said. She had a few compliments for coastal people, saying they were extremely honest, hardworking and smart; could be because the land had seen trade, met many people, many cultures, and many languages. Earlier, 117 students were awarded Ph.D besides presenting gold medals and rank certificates in the convocation. In all, 33,806 students passed out during 2019-20, including 6,397 PG students. Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya, registrar in-charge and registrar (Evaluation) P.L. Dharma, deans of faculties and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/give-back-to-your-alma-mater-sudha-murty-tells-students/article34293914.ece
11 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Handling of strike a sign of plan to privatise transport corporations’||The way in which the strike by employees of the State road transport corporations (RTCs) is being handled smacks of a design to privatise the once-robust corporations, trade union leader H.V. Ananthasubba Rao and the former Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy have said. Mr. Reddy, who was the Transport Minister in the Siddaramaiah government had offered a pay hike of 12.5% during a similar strike in 2016. “The government should listen to employees by bringing them across the table and try to attempt to address their grievances,” he said. He argued that the State government appears to be towing the Centre’s line that the government’s duty is not to do business and might privatise the RTCs. Incidentally, Mr. Reddy was instrumental for the introduction of ‘Comprehensive area scheme for the entire State of Karnataka’ wherein new permits were to be issued only to RTCs while protecting existing permits of private operators. The policy was brought to secure economic interests of existing private operators and to empower RTCs that had resources to provide services on demand. Mr. Rao, president of the KSRTC Staff and Workers Federation which was the leading trade union of RTC employees, said the employees would have withdrawn the strike if the government had announced a reasonable hike in wages. The Industrial Tribunal, in August 2017, had ordered 20% hike in wages with effect from 2004 after the federation challenged the 5% hike offered by the government in 2004. The tribunal had also ordered payment of arrears with 6% interest from 2004 and doubling of bata for the crew. Instead of implementing the tribunal order, the government approached the High Court and obtained a stay which is continuing till today. Had the government honoured the tribunal verdict, the present situation would not have come, Mr. Rao said. On the federation losing hold over employees, Mr. Rao said the young employees were keen on getting some “instant resolution” from an organisation that does not have any ideological background. With the threat of privatisation looming large, they would learn the lesson now, he said. The government that offers several fancy schemes through the RTCs does not reimburse the costs, let alone support the corporations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/handling-of-strike-a-sign-of-plan-to-privatise-transport-corporations/article34293294.ece
11 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Zero tolerance to violation of norms: DC||Restrictions placed following ‘Corona curfew’, in force till April 20, will strictly be enforced and wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing is must in public places, said Deputy Commissioner K.V.

11 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Uppinangady success model can make Mangaluru waste-free’||Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission has plans to convert the city’s solid waste dumping yard at Pachchanadi as “Swatchanadi” and preparations are afoot, said Mission’s Swatch Mangaluru convener Swami Ekagamyananda on Saturday. He was delivering the keynote address at a workshop on “waste management; challenges and opportunities,” organised by Mangala Resource Management Pvt. Ltd., a startup initiated by the mission in association with Sahyadri Institute of Technology and Management. The swami said following a five-year cleanliness drive in Mangaluru undertaken by the mission, much awareness was created among residents. Similarly, the startup took up waste management of Uppinangady town in Dakshina Kannada district that has become successful within a year. The town has about one thousand each houses and shops; while waste from shops was being collected, 95% of wet waste from households was being converted into manure, Sri. Ekagamyananda said. While about 50 tonnes of manure was produced in a year, 50 tonnes of dry waste was given for recycling and Rs. 4 lakh revenue was generated. If Uppinangady could become a success model, why Mangaluru should not, the swami asked. There was no need of procuring extra machinery; but with the available resources and enhanced manpower, Mangaluru could be made waste-free, he said. Inaugurating the workshop, Mangaluru Mayor Premananda Shetty said when people were disposing off their waste at houses, the Corporation was getting about 125 tonnes of waste a day. Upon MCC collecting solid waste management cess, people began to send all kinds of waste and waste generation increased to 250 tonnes as people stopped segregating waste at home. As such, a clear plan needs to be chalked out to clear the waste accumulated at Pachchanady, the Mayor said. Davanagere Mayor S.T. Veeresh said his city too was finding difficulty in managing solid waste that had got accumulated over the years. Davanagere City Corporation would chalk out a plan under guidance from Ramakrishna Mission, he said, adding he was in Mangaluru to study the model.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uppinangady-success-model-can-make-mangaluru-waste-free/article34293910.ece

11 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Sound and Light show, illumination suspended||Amid rising cases of COVID-19, the illumination of Mysuru palace and the Sound and Light programme held on its premises have been temporarily suspended. The palace used to be illuminated between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays. The illumination has been cancelled on April 11, 13, 14, 18 and 25, besides May 1 and 2, said a statement from Deputy Director of Mysuru Palace Board. During this period, the general public will also not be allowed into the palace premises. The Palace Board has suspended Sound and Light programme between April 10 and 30, according to the statement. Even the Ugadi Sangeethothsava, which used to be organised every year, will not be held this year, the statement added. However, the palace will remain open to visitors between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on all days. Deputy Director of Mysuru Palace Board Subramanya told The Hindu that the illumination on Sundays and public holidays was cancelled to avoid large gatherings. About 3,000 to 4,000 people would gather on the palace premises to enjoy the illumination usually. “The number of visitors had now dwindled to barely 1,000 per day”, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sound-and-light-show-illumination-suspended/article34293380.ece
11 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Test, trace and treat’ plan to fight resurgent COVID-19||Amidst the big surge of COVID-19 cases in Mysuru, the district administration is keeping its entire focus on ‘test, trace and treat’ strategy. More stringent restrictions, barring the night curfew, appear unlikely at this stage for keeping the economic activities, unlike the previous wave, undisturbed. Mysuruis the second largest vaccinated district in the State with more than three lakh persons receiving the shots. An average 25,000 persons get the shots daily. Daily testing has also crossed the 6,000-mark with efforts to ramp up to 8,000 swab tests a day. The tracing of primary contacts has been activated by the war room. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Saturday said, “Our current concern is the surge in fatalities and dearth of ICU beds with rise in patients shifted to hospitals with complications. The best way to minimise the severity is vaccination. In March, 28 people died and 15 so far in April. The laxity among the people should go and those aged above 45 should volunteer to take the jab.” Participating in a meet-the-press programme organised by Mysuru District Journalists’ Association, she said asymptomatic youth testing positive are turning out to be key spreaders, and the recent spike is being attributed to them. Late testing and late hospital admission are causing complications and resulting in deaths, especially among patients with many co-morbidities, she explained. Mysuru has 8.5 lakh persons above 45 years and the target is to vaccinate all of them at the earliest. Between April 11 and 14, many sections would be covered in the vaccination sessions planned as part of ‘Lasike Utsava’ even as officials are on the job of convincing people showing resistance to the shots. Defending the night curfew, Ms. Sindhuri said an infected man last year became a ‘super spreader’, infecting nearly 250 people after participating in night gambling sessions that are prevalent during the ensuing festival season. Such events can be avoided with the imposition of night curfew. This decision has been taken after consulting experts. She also defended the curbs imposed during the recent Nanjangud car festival and said the district administration was criticised but the decision was taken in the larger interest of keeping the spread under check. To a question, Ms. Sindhuri said beds are filling up fast and the district administration is open to establishing more COVID-19 Care Centres if the situation worsens. On the vaccination coverage, she said 330 sites are active, including 40 in private hospitals that are administering vaccines supplied by the government for free. “We got 1.50 lakh doses and the stocks will exhaust in a day or two and fresh indent will be placed. We need five lakh doses to cover the eligible population.” The private hospitals have now reserved 20 per cent beds for COVID-19 patients, she replied. On the confusion over her advisory on COVID-19 negative report, she said it was an advisory and the report was not mandatory. But it caused confusion, resulting in intervention from the government. “We had to withdraw the advisory to end the confusion.” The seal down rules that had been discontinued after the fall in cases will soon be imposed in a new method to contain the spread in view of daily cases inching closer to the300-mark. Instead of sealing down a lane or a neighbourhood, micro-containment zones will be established where specific infected areas are identified and isolated, she explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/test-trace-and-treat-plan-to-fight-resurgent-covid-19/article34293382.ece
11 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Over 11,000 books in poor man’s library destroyed||The destruction of a library with over 11,000 books, painstakingly collected by Syed Ishaq from his meagre earnings, in fire here in the early hours of Friday has not only drawn widespread condemnation, but also triggered efforts by civil society to help him rebuild his dream of spreading knowledge. Mr. Ishaq, a daily wager, had collected a variety of books in different languages, including general knowledge books and religious books such the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, and the Koran in Kannada, which he made available for residents of Rajiv Nagar locality to read on the premises of the library situated on government land. Though unlettered himself, Mr. Ishaq, 63, had a lot of respect for books. “Out of his meagre earnings, he used to subscribe to 22 daily newspapers to his library for the benefit of the locals,” said Khaisar Safdar, a journalist with an Urdu daily who often visited the library set up in 2011. Mr. Ishaq, who earns a living by doing odd jobs, including cleaning drains, was so passionate about spreading knowledge that he would himself sweep the library every day and maintain a register of visitors. Mr. Ishaq suspects miscreants who were opposed to his propagation of Kannada language to be behind the wicked act. “It is the handiwork of enemies of Kannada. They conspired to destroy the collection of books,” said Mr. Ishaq, who has lodged a complaint with the Udayagiri police. Deputy Commissioner ofPolice (Law and Order) Prakash Gowda told The Hindu that they have registered an FIR based on Mr. Ishaq’s complaint. Preliminary inquiries had revealed that his activities were not liked by a few people and there had been efforts earlier to destroy the library. Muzaffar Assadi, chairman of the Department of Political Science, University of Mysore, said the act of destroying a library set up by a poor man in and around slum areas for the purpose of inter-faith dialogue and disseminating knowledge was condemnable. “I have made an appeal for books rather than money because we have to send a signal to the perpetrators that knowledge cannot be destroyed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-11000-books-in-poor-mans-library-destroyed/article34293296.ece

Yediyurappa urging the government to push curfew timing to 11 p.m. from 10 p.m.. They also requested the government to allow food delivery till midnight. They claimed that the curfew was placing tremendous stress on the already struggling sector. “Most of us have been unable to service liabilities and payments that decimated our industry with the lockdown of 2020, and the effective curbs on our operating hours starting April 10 will expose us to further catastrophic losses,” stated the memorandum They pointed out that with the 10 p.m. curfew, they would have to cease operations by 9 p.m. It will eliminate the largest chunk of revenue that is generated between both dine-in and delivery, they said. Barricades on roads The police shut down roads and flyovers on Saturday, and sealed entry and exit points of the city to enforce night curfew. Double roads were converted into one-ways and barricades were put up to deter motorists. Police Commissioner Kamal Pant held a meeting with senior officials to discuss a plan of action.

Menon, Sub Inspector, Vigilance and Security, TDB visited the Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Swamy temple and met the devaswom administrative officer as part of the investigation. The investigation is led by Bijoy P., Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and Security, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB). The 51-year-old elephant, owned by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), died on the Sree Krishna Swamy temple premises on Thursday. Animal rights activists and devotees accused the TDB of ill-treating the elephant, denying it rest and proper medication. Following public protest, the TDB suspended Pradeep and K.A. Ajeesh — two mahouts of the elephant — after finding lapses on their part. G. Baiju, Deputy Commissioner (Haripad), TDB was temporarily relieved of his responsibilities. ‘Severe injury’ The elephant, popular among devotees, had been unwell for some time. In March, in spite of suffering a “severe injury” to his leg, he was taken to a temple in Kollam to be paraded in a festival, after being granted a fitness certificate by a TDB veterinarian. However, the elephant was brought back following interventions by animal rights activists. It was alleged then that the injury on his leg was inflicted by the “poking with a metal instrument.” Necropsy in Konni The investigation team is awaiting the detailed post-mortem report of the elephant.

11 April 2021||Bengaluru,KERALA||Forest officials conned of Rs. 1.25 lakh||A team of forest officials, who planned an elaborate operation after being alerted about a gang of poachers, were conned of Rs. 1.25 lakh. “We are on the lookout for the culprit who was able to convince forest officials that he was an informer. This is a major embarrassment for the Forest Department,” said a police officer attached to Madanayakanahalli station. Based on a complaint filed by Anil Kumar G., Deputy Range Forest Officer with the vigilance squad, Aranya Bhavan, Malleswaram, the police have taken up a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust against the accused, Siddu Sabanna. On April 6, Siddu walked into the Forest Department office and told officials that he had information about a group of poachers selling tiger pelts and elephant tusks. He was so convincing that officials agreed to run an operation where Siddu, under the guise of a buyer, would approach the poachers. “Anticipating that they would nab the gang of poachers, Mr. Kumar and his colleague Siddaraju, along with the vigilance squad, accompanied Siddu to a shed near the Unibic factory on Huskur Road with a bag filled with Rs. 1.25 lakh. Siddu had told the officials that the poachers had agreed to meet him there with one tiger pelt and elephant tusks,” said the police officer. Siddu told the officials that he would wait for the poachers in the shed with the cash. He instructed the team of forest officials to hide and wait for his signal. Once the poachers approached him, the officials could surround the shed. “As per the plan, the forest officials waited at a distance from 10.30 a.m. to 7 p.m., but there was no sign of the poachers. When they went to check the shed, it was empty,” said a police officer. The officials searched for Siddu before alerting their seniors, following which a police complaint was filed. “This is sheer negligence on the part of the forest officials. They trusted the man with cash and did not even conduct a background check or keep tabs on him. We don’t even know if his real name is Siddu,” said a senior police official. “There is a standard operating procedure for such cases, which was not followed.”  “As per the plan, the forest officials waited at a distance from 10.30 am to 7 pm, but there was no sign of the poachers. Disappointed, officials went to check the shed, only to find the conman--and the bag of cash--missing,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/forest-officials-conned-of-rs-125l/article34293742.ece
11 April 2021||Hubballi/Bengaluru,KERALA||‘Vijayendra tax’||AICC general secretaryand in charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala, on a visit to Karnataka ahead of bypolls, has said that Karnataka is witnessing a new phenomenon called “Vijayendra tax”, taking a dig at Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son. Addressing a press conference along with KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and senior leaders such as M. Mallikarjun Kharge in Belagavi on Saturday, he said, “We had heard about GST and other taxes. And in Karnataka, we hear about a different kind of tax called ‘Vijayendra tax’, which is collected by the family of the Chief Minister.” He said the issue was being flagged by BJP’s own people such as Basanagouda Patil Yatnal. He alleged that BJP government in Karnataka was immersed in corruption from head to toe and would collapse under its own weight soon. RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa’s letter to the Governor over the allocation of funds in his department, continued statements of Mr. Yatnal, and Minor Irrigation Minister J.C. Madhuswamy’s statement on the Union government damaging the federal structure were all proof of the rot in the system. Mr. Surjewala said Mr. Yediyurappahad given a lot of promises to various communities without actually verifying the demands and now it had led to different communities fighting for the sake of getting reservation benefits, including Valmiki, Kuraba, Panchamasali, and Maratha. This is the second byelection the Congress is facing after the appointment of Mr. Surjewalaas in charge of the party’s affairs in the State. He did not campaign for the byelections held in R.R. Nagar and Sira constituencies. The central leader of the party would campaign in Basavakalyan and Maski constituencies on Sunday. On Monday, he would leave for Delhi via Hyderabad, sources in the Congress said. The Congress has assigned the tasks of campaign to former Ministers and legislators town municipal council wise to ensure victory of the party in both the Assembly constituencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/karnataka-witnessing-vijayendra-tax/article34293291.ece

The rise in temperature too has contributed to the increase in power use. The average power consumption was above 86.4 million units (mu) in the past three days. The lack of summer rain has resulted in the temperature level remaining high. With the commencement of the exams, the power consumption went up further. As per the records on Saturday, the power consumption on the previous day was 87.62 mu. Of this, 31.47 mu was produced in the State. The power consumption on Thursday was 86.46 mu and it was 87.02 mu on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/power-use-on-the-rise-again-in-the-state/article34293359.ece
11 April 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Tiger realm a haven for Asiatic wild dogs too||A recent study on dhole or Asiatic wild dog, an endangered large carnivore, has found that the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WSS), a major habitat of elephants and tigers, is also host to a good number of dholes. The first ever study on the carnivore organised by the Wildlife Conservation Society–India, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, University of Florida, and Stanford University has found that the sanctuary has close to 50 dholes. “Ours is the first attempt to estimate dhole populations through targeted surveys designed specifically for this species. The results suggest that Wayanad supports high densities of the dhole. A recent tiger survey showed that the sanctuary also has a relatively large tiger population, with 11 to 13 animals per 100 sq km. The fact that two large carnivores can coexist in such high densities is indicative of an abundant prey base and high quality habitat. It is also a testament to good sanctuary management of the Forest Department,” says Arjun Srivathsa, lead author of the study. Genetic info For the new study, scientists developed a scientifically robust method to estimate dhole numbers using genetic information and advanced population models. Field surveys were held across 350 sq km of the sanctuary to collect dhole scat (faecal droppings) in 2019 and DNA was extracted from it to identify unique dhole individuals. Combining this with sophisticated statistical methods called spatial capture-recapture models, researchers were able to estimate and map dhole numbers and density across the sanctuary. Help in conservation “For species like dholes that do not have individual markings, genetic methods are the only way we can get statistically robust estimates of population size. The cutting-edge genetic tools we developed here to understand more about this endangered species will be critical for evidence-based conservation of dholes,” says co-author Uma Ramakrishnan. The study was published in the international journal Biological Conservation . The authors include Arjun Srivathsa (Wildlife Conservation Society–India and University of Florida), co-lead Ryan G. Rodrigues (Wildlife Conservation Society–India and National Centre for Biological Sciences), Kok Ben Toh (University of Florida), Arun Zachariah (Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University), Ryan W.

11 April 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Ecotourism centres reopened||The Sentinel rock waterfalls and Kuruva islands, two popular eco-tourism destinations in the district under the South Wayanad Forest Division, were opened on Saturday after an interval of two years. According to South Wayanad Forest Divisional Officer P. Ranjith Kumar, both the destinations witnessed huge crowds, but the number of visitors was restricted in accordance with the carrying capacity study conducted by the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore. Accordingly, the number of visitors to the waterfalls and the island has been restricted to 1,200 and 1,150 respectively a day. As many as 100 visitors will be allotted at a time to visit the destinations adhering to the COVID-19 protocol, and they can spend two hours in those destinations, Mr. Ranjith Kumar said. The Sentinel rock waterfalls, also known as Soochipara waterfalls under the Meppadi forest range, Kuruva islets on the Kabani river under the Chethalayath forest range, Chembra peak under the Meppadi forest range, and the Meenmutty waterfalls at Padinharethara under the Kalpetta forest range had been closed as per a Kerala High Court directive. The court had issued an interim stay on all ecotourism activities in the forest division on a petition filed by the Wayanad Prakriti Samrakshana Samiti, an environmental organisation. However the order was vacated by the court recently. The Chembra peak, a major adventure tourism destination, will be opened after the forest fire season, and the Meenmutty waterfalls will be opened after maintenance work, Mr. Ranjith Kumar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ecotourism-centres-reopened/article34293313.ece
11 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Enthusiastic response to vaccination drive||The district has, so far, witnessed an enthusiastic response to the COVID-19 vaccination drive, with over five lakh doses having been administered. On Saturday, as many as 136 centres had vaccination sites. A final count of the number of doses administered on Saturday was not yet available. “Approximately 5,60,000 doses have been administered in the district so far,” said Dr. M.G. Sivadas, Reproductive and Child Health Officer and nodal officer for immunisation. On Friday, 29,375 doses of the vaccine were administered in Ernakulam. The number of centres stood at 180 on Friday. Dr. Sivadas said the district had sufficient doses of the vaccine to last till Tuesday. Fresh supply is expected on April 15. Going by the Health Department’s vaccination bulletin, the district had 73,030 doses available at the end of the day on Friday. Of this, 7,410 doses are Covaxin and 65,620 are Covishield. Considering the limited availability of Covaxin in the district, the existing stock of Covaxin is reserved to administer the second dose to those who have already taken the first shot. A doctor at the Karuvelipady taluk hospital said the vaccination centre at the hospital had been seeing a footfall of around 200 to 250 people daily. Private hospitals too had seen good demand for the vaccine, said Dr. T.V. Ravi, president of IMA Kochi chapter. “Vaccine availability, however, is not as good as it was last month. We are managing for now, and the problem is expected to be resolved within a week or so,” he said. The five mobile vaccination units, which have been covering homes for the elderly and holding mass camps at locations across the district, have administered 4,198 doses so far. The units have covered 83 out of 105 care homes in Ernakulam. The units will soon take the vaccination drive to civil stations in the district to provide the second dose to polling officials. The drive is set to expand at the local body level from the second half of next week. For instance, the Kochi Corporation plans on setting up six vaccination centres soon. Each centre was likely to cater for residents in seven divisions of the Corporation, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. “The aim is to cover eligible people in one division in two days. Help from residents’ associations and Kudumbashree workers will be sought to identify beneficiaries,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/enthusiastic-response-to-vaccination-drive/article34293886.ece

It was all the more shocking since the bank concerned had blocked the debit card after he had reported the fraud on Monday when four withdrawals of Rs. 10,000 each were made through as yet unidentified ATM centre or centres. The alert received on his mobile said that the transaction was declined as the ATM card remains blocked. “The attempted withdrawal is a clear sign of fraud probably by way of card cloning. Even five days after I lost the money, the bank has not been able to even track down the ATM from where the money was withdrawn,” said the man who continues to wait for the bank to credit the money he lost, which as per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular in 2017, should be done within 10 days where the victim had reported the fraud within three working days. The manager of the branch concerned said the latest attempted fraud could not be immediately verified since it was a holiday. The Central police, where the lawyer had lodged a petition, continue to wait for the bank to confirm the incident as a fraud to register a First Information Report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bid-to-withdraw-cash-from-victims-account-yet-again/article34293889.ece

Municipal chairperson Ajitha Thankappan said she had visited the sites of several granite quarries as well as open wells to see if the sources could be utilised to meet the severe drinking water shortage in the municipality. She said the water shortage was more severe in the eastern areas of the municipality such as Thengode. Ms. Thankappan said the civic body was doing everything to ensure supply of drinking water to all households. She said a survey of the open wells and sources of drinking water was being done to ensure that they were cleaned up and made available for supply. Residents in Thrikkakara had called for augmentation of the water supply system, possibly with a new storage tanker. The opening up and utilisation of the Periyar valley canal system to recharge drinking water sources in the municipal area has also been suggested. The residents have also called for providing a link between the municipality and the water conservation site now being used by Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore. Salim Kunnumpuram, general secretary of Thrikkakara Municipal Residents’ Associations’ Apex Council, has said that the municipal authorities must pay attention to the long-standing demand for cleaning up the 16-km Periyar valley canal passing through the area. He claimed that if the encroachments were cleared and water flow ensured, drinking water sources in the area could be recharged. In a recent petition to the municipal authorities, the residents had said that encroachments could be cleared using the housing scheme of the State government for those without land or home of their own. The present water supply system in one of the fastest growing municipal areas in Ernakulam district was envisaged for about 20,000 to 30,000 residents. The municipal area has grown rapidly and the population is now around 1.5 lakh. The growth of new areas like the Infopark has added to the burden of demand for water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thrikkakara-to-tap-all-sources-to-tackle-water-shortage/article34293894.ece

The construction of the Thareparambu bridge was recently halted following protests demanding that funds be allocated for Muthukupuram bridge which would help approximately 1,000 people every day. The president of Chellanam 2020, Pavizham Biju, said that priority must be accorded to Muthukupuram bridge since the other bridge would benefit just four families and a tourism property which was coming up nearby.

Perhaps the oldest person in the State to cast her vote at a polling station, 113-year-old Velumbi is very strong-willed when it comes to exercising her franchise. A resident of rural Piravathur, in the Pathanapuram constituency, she made no exception on April 6 also and says she cannot remember a time when she skipped the trip. “I cast my vote in the last Lok Sabha election and the recent local body polls too,” she says. According to her voter’s ID and other records, Velumbi is 113 and though she was given the option as a senior citizen to vote at home, she turned it down. She insisted on voting on the polling day and cast her vote without any assistance at Piravathur Government Upper Primary School. Clear choice Ask her about her political preference, and prompt comes the answer, ‘communists.’ “She will vote only for the Left,” adds great-granddaughter Akhila. Velumbi had four children, but she outlived them all and even saw the death of her two grandchildren. Now she lives with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She has no ailments and is quite active for her age. “Earlier, she used to collect firewood from the forest, but now we do not let her do chores. She makes brooms as she hates to sit idle,” says Akhila. Sole indulgence Velumbi makes regular trips to the nearby paddy fields to fetch coconut fronds and then sits to scrap the stalk. Earlier she used to sell her brooms for Rs. 10, but recently the price was hiked to Rs. 20. With the money, she buys ‘paan’ from the nearby shop, her only indulgence, according to her family. “She does not eat any food that is not home-cooked, not even tea. Also, she used to regularly prepare ‘karkidaka kanji’ with all those herbs and that may be one reason for her health,” adds Akhila.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/at-113-a-vote-for-a-spirited-life/article34293353.ece

Beaches will be closed to the public after 7 p.m., and social distancing will be mandatory at all places of worship. District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao said on Saturday that those violating the pandemic protocol would have to face a year in jail or fine or both under the Disaster Management Act. These were decided at an all-party meeting at the Collectorate. The participants expressed concern about the huge crowds that were thronging beaches and other tourism destinations. It was decided to restrict entry at these places. If more people are found to be reaching there, police personnel, sectoral magistrates, and destination managers will be asked to stop their entry. Vaccination certificates will be mandatory for those aged above 60 to visit tourism destinations. Places of worship The number of people at places of worship will be restricted to 100. Entry of those below the age of 10 and those above 60 will be restricted, and face masks and hand sanitisers will be compulsory. Wedding events will not be allowed to be held spreading across more days. Only 200 people can participate in open places and 100 at closed spaces. Details of such events should be uploaded on the COVID Jagrata portal. Private buses and Kerala State Road Transport Corporation vehicles will not be allowed to carry people above their seating capacity. Action will be taken against those not using face masks at public places and in vehicles. Senior citizens will not venture out to public places. Observation of physical distancing norms will be mandatory at shopping malls, markets, and shops. Only one person will be allowed entry per 30 sq.ft area. A.V. George, District Police Chief (Kozhikode City), District Medical Officer (in-charge) M. Piyush, senior officials, and representatives of political parties were present. Testing to be ramped up The district administration had on Friday decided to enforce physical distancing protocols, ramp up testing, and vaccinate all those who are eligible. It was pointed out that though the number of fresh cases had declined in the past five months, election-related gatherings had led to a rise in new infections and daily test positivity rate (TPR). The rate of testing and vaccination had been declining too. Daily TPR was found to be above 10% in grama panchayats. Testing dropped from 98% in October to 29% in March. This could lead to more number of cases and deaths and even a lockdown will have to be imposed, the administration had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-political-meetings-for-a-fortnight-in-kozhikode/article34293307.ece

In its latest advertisement, Milma has caricatured the dancing medicos with an interesting caption. “When you set hearts on fire, Milma to cool your inner self,” reads the ad. Milma has brought smiles to thousands of people who celebrated the 30-second dance by Janaki Omkumar and Naveen K. Razak, third and fourth year MBBS students respectively of Government Medical College, Thrissur, to the tune of iconic 1978 Boney M song Rasputin. Janaki-Razak dancing in scrubs in the corridor of the medical college house surgeon quarters continues to inspire thousands of youngsters, especially medical students. “It’s a great video. They did the entire medical community who had suffered a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic proud. Hats off to them,” said Shafeek Rahman, a house surgeon at MES Medical College, Perinthalmanna. Similar videos Many students responded by posting similar dancing videos on social media. However, the Janaki-Razak dance video invited criticism and vilifying attacks from some sections of the Sangh Parivar who tried to raise the spectre of “love jihad”. The Medical College Students Union posted a group dance video song in an apparent rebuttal for the displays of intolerance. Milma’s action on Saturday is viewed by many as a “responsible one meant to spread the message of peace, harmony and love, and to dispel the feelings of hatred.” “It is really good when public sector bodies like Milma respond with agility and light-heartedness to such contemporary social happenings. It spreads positivity and helps kill the negative feelings unleashed by nationalist bigots,” says Anas Yasin, a Malayali journalist in Bahrain. During the peak of COVID-19 pandemic last year, Milma surprised Malayalis across the world by borrowing the words of a 10-year-old Ernadan Malappuram boy as its catchphrase. “ Chelolthu sheriyavum, chelolthu sheriyavula. Pakshenkil chaaya ellarthum sheriyavum, paal Milma aanengil (some may get it right, some may not get it right. But tea will be fine for all if the milk is Milma),” Milma ad read in July 2020. Milma had celebrated the little boy Mohammed Fayis after his two-minute video on paper flower making went viral on social media. Milma showered him with gifts and gave his Rs. 10,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/milma-embraces-medicos-whose-dance-set-the-net-on-fire/article34293362.ece

Acting on a petition by the students from a Thrissur school, the commission, at the end of March, directed the Thrissur Deputy Director of Education (DDE) and the Thrissur District Educational Officer (DEO) to process the application by the students seeking assistance of interpreter or other benefit to appear for the SSLC examinations. It also asked the Thrissur District Medical Officer to constitute a medical board for assessment of disability. The students had complained that even though a medical board had suggested the services of an interpreter or giving extra time to them, the Thrissur DDE did not provide assistance. Not received The DDE told the commission that no complaint had been received from the students either at the DDE office or the DEO office. The DDE also said that to allow an interpreter, the IQ (intelligence quotient) level of a student should be between 86 and 120. However, the IQ level of the complainants was below 86. The commission, comprising chairperson Manoj Kumar K.V. and members Fr. Philip Parakkatt and K. Nazeer, observed that as per Section 2(l) of the RPWD Act, high support meant intensive support, physical, psychological and otherwise, which may be required by a person with benchmark disability for daily activities, to take independent and informed decision to access facilities and participating in all areas of life including education, employment, family and community life and treatment and therapy. The provision thus made it clear that persons with benchmark disability were entitled to get benefit under the Act. The panel also referred to a Supreme Court judgment where it said the provision for the scribe was to ensure that persons with disabilities were able to live a life of equality and dignity. Report sought The panel n its order, directed the DGE, DDE, Pareeksha Bhavan secretary, DEP, and the DMO to file action-taken reports within 30 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-orders-services-of-scribe-for-students/article34293310.ece

There was a need to shore up the vaccination numbers, for which mobilising the social capital of the local bodies and neighbourhood groups would be useful. “The ward-level committees of local bodies and Kudumbashree neighbourhood units are our key resources in this campaign. A lot of social messaging will be involved at the local level to reach out to the weak and the vulnerable. For those reluctant to take vaccination, especially due to concerns about adverse events, those coordinating these activities can put them in touch with health workers or doctors to allay their concerns,” said Ms.Muraleedharan. The ward-level committees, consisting of councillors, health inspectors and local residents, also helped in ensuring that quarantine rules were followed. However, this time, with a relatively new set of councillors in charge after the local body elections in December, the ward-level committees had to be reactivated. “We never stopped our activities to prevent the spread of the virus. Only some of the systems, including some front-line treatment centres, were wound up temporarily with the fall in numbers. Now, there is no need to newly set up anything, as all of it exist on the ground,” said Ms. Muraleedharan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-give-a-leg-up-to-mass-vaccination-drive/article34293364.ece

11 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||SCTL, TRIDA to share income from 3 projects||The Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Limited (SCTL) and the Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA) have decided to share the income that is generated from three major projects that are being implemented under the city Corporation’s Smart City project. This includes the rehabilitation block of the Connemara Market in Palayam, multi-level car parking complex behind Saphalyam complex and the warehousing complex at Attakulangara, all of which are being developed on land owned by TRIDA. The State government earlier this week accorded the approval for the revenue sharing model proposed by the SCTL and TRIDA. Lease of shops The revenue generated through lease of shops, parking charges and through other sources will be shared by both parties, after meeting all expenses for operation and maintenance. The SCTL’s share includes the cost incurred by it for project development and for the annual maintenance contract for five years, while TRIDA’s share includes twice the cost of land utilised by SCTL for project development, determined as per the fair value of land. At the rehabilitation block at Palayam, considering the respective shares of TRIDA and SCTL of Rs. 22.63 crore and Rs. 17,50 crore, the proposed revenue sharing is 55.39% and 43,61%. The rehabilitation block is spread over an area of 93.1 cents. The automated multi-level car parking lot behind Saphalyam complex, spread over an area of 86.3 cents, has a revenue share of 59.03% for SCTL and 40.97% for TRIDA. In the case of the warehousing complex near Attakulangara, spread over an area of 209.7 cents, TRIDA’s share of the revenue will be 64.54% and SCTL's 35.54%. The Connemara market at Palayam is set to get a major revamp under the Smart City project of the city Corporation. The existing cramped spaces will be replaced by a multi-level complex, which will also include parking spaces and extra commercial spaces. The development activities will be carried out within the market area by retaining the 19th century arched gate, considered one of the heritage monuments of the city. The land within the market area is partly owned by the city Corporation, while the rest is owned by the Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA), where the rehabilitation block and the parking lots are coming up.  The State government has given nod to the revenue sharing model||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sctl-trida-to-share-income-from-3-projects/article34293969.ece

Led by P.K. Madhu, Superintendent of Police, the police constituted an investigation team comprising the Attingal Deputy Superintendent of Police and Inspectors of various police stations under the Attingal sub-division including Attingal, Kadinamkulam and Mangalapuram. The Cyber Cell is also involved in the investigation. The Mangalapuram police had registered a case in connection with the alleged robbery of 788 grams of gold by around 10 people. Visuals collected After collecting evidence from the spot, the police have taken visuals from various places where the perpetrators abandoned the complainant Sampath’s driver Arun and brother-in-law Lakshmana respectively. The investigation team has also set its sights on investigating a previous incident of robbery that took place in Thuckalay four months ago when Sampath, a Maharashtra native, was travelling from Kanyakumari to Thiruvananthapuram. He had been allegedly robbed of money to the tune of over Rs. 20 lakh, official sources said. While the accused in that case had been subsequently arrested, they were currently on bail. Sampath, who was running a jewellery outlet in Neyyattinkara for around nine years, also supplies gold to other stores in Kanyakumari, Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/investigation-begins-into-gold-robbery-in-capital/article34293356.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A promising thriller ends in a whimper||Managing to build up the anticipation and to keep the audience guessing until the time of the scriptwriter’s choosing would mean half the job done in constructing an effective thriller. But much of the other half rests on how potent that final reveal is. Imagine the feeling when you expect a lion to walk out of a cave, after listening to its majestic roars for some time, and you see a mouse crawling out. In Nizhal , in the end, after much anticipation, we get to see something much better than a mouse, but something lesser than a lion too. Judicial magistrate John Baby (Kunchakko Boban) is recovering from an accident that has left him with a post traumatic stress disorder. During consultations with his clinical psychologist friend Shalini (Divya Prabha), she tells him about the case of school student Nithin (Izin Hash), who had narrated a disturbing story in the class, which seemed all too real, but the source of which remained mysterious. The boy’s over-protective mother Sharmila (Nayanthara) is initially reluctant at the idea of digging deeper into this, but soon she joins John in trying to unravel the mystery. Appu.N.Bhattathiri, who has made a name as a film editor, dons the director’s hat for the first time in this moody, atmospheric thriller, that is concerned a lot about the mindscape of its characters. Piqued by the intriguing story narrated by the young boy, the magistrate turns into a part-time investigator, digging up events from the past that further complicate the situation. S.Sanjeev’s script gets these parts right, with the audience kept wondering as to where the thread will lead next, with each possible lead turning cold. The magistrate’s personal struggles, with regard to his mental state, and its possible connection to the boy’s thought process, also adds to the intrigue. The viewer at this point has much to chew on and play a guessing game with. The script throws up multiple possibilities too. But the final reveal appears as somewhat of a whimper after all the slow, patient building up in the first half towards something bigger. A wish on the part of the screenwriter to have something more than a mere thriller story, and leave the audience with a message, seems to have led to that rather tame ending, which is somewhat of a letdown considering the genuine effort in maintaining the mystery almost all through. An ending one could have never guessed does not always mean a satisfying ending. Nizhal is worth a watch if you are of the kind who enjoys the journey rather than the destination. S. R.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Technical in some parts, horror in other||With almost all the possible horror themes that could scare people nearing exhaustion, it is left to scriptwriters and filmmakers to mine fresh ideas that could give the chills to the viewers. Those who keep an eye around themselves, absorbing in all the changes, could still come up with something that feels contemporary and that could make people think, suspending disbelief, that this could happen to them too. In Chathur Mukham , smartphones and even selfies become sources of horror, helping it connect immediately to a large section of the audience. But merely making these ubiquitous things part of the narrative would not be enough. It needs to be backed by scenarios that are convincing and a plot that is organic, both of which are achieved by the filmmaker duo of Ranjeet Kamala Sankar and Salil V., and the scriptwriter duo of Abhayakumar K. and Anil Kurian. Thejaswini (Manju Warrier) is a social media addict, who keeps updating images from her daily life constantly online. After she loses her smartphone, she decides to buy a new one from an online store. Mysterious events begin to take place after the phone arrives. Along with her friend Antony (Sunny Wayne), with whom she is running a struggling CCTV camera business, she seeks the help of Clement (Alencier), a science enthusiast who is sceptical of anything that does not have a rational explanation. The gist of the plot or even the trailer might give one an impression of a run-of-the-mill horror movie, yet the makers have stored quite a few surprises within, peppered at regular intervals. There is often an attempt to provide a scientific explanation for the happenings on the screen, with some of the characters even poking fun or dismissing the traditional Malayalam horror movie ingredients of black magic and exorcism. Yet, the script does not fully dismiss the supernatural elements, which are very much part of the plot, but coated with a thin veneer of scientific reasoning. Some of these horror elements in the film might appear over-the-top, but these are treated in a much more controlled manner. The relationships Thejaswini is not portrayed as a damsel in distress, but as someone who leads the fight from the front. The strained relationship with her brother, and how the mysterious events make her have a relook at it forms an interesting, but under-explored tangent. The script also treats her friendship with Antony in a mature manner.  Chathur Mukham might score lower on the scare-quotient part, but it makes up for the same with the novelty and believability of some of the plot points. Considering its branding as a ‘techno-horror’, it lives up almost fully to the ‘techno’ part of it, and partly to the ‘horror’ part of it, a fact which the faint-hearted might be thankful for. S.R.

All plans were laid out for setting up mass vaccination camps. We will lose the momentum now if vaccines are not made available in sufficient quantities. And we have no communication from the higher officials on how we are expected to manage the crisis,” an official in one of the northern districts said. The government had directed that vaccinations be made available in all public health centres (PHCs). Private sector hospitals too are dependent on the government for their vaccine supplies. All three regions – Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode – have just adequate stocks, but no where near to run mass vaccination camps. Requirement The targeted first dose requirement in the 45-plus group would come to 1,13,75,715, of which the State has delivered 31,63,818 doses (28%). A total of 45,794 second dose vaccine too have been delivered. “The State now has about 10 lakh doses available in stock. An additional 4,74,000 doses is expected to arrive after April 15.

11 April 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Over 80% of registration revenue target achieved in district||Pendurthi, Madhurawada, Anandapuram and Bheemunipatnam areas are witnessing a boom in the construction activity, if the number of documents registered at the eight Sub Registrar Offices(SROs) in Visakhapatnam district, this year, is any indication. Similarly, the industrial areas under the jurisdiction of Lankelapalem, Pedagantyada, Chodavaram and Yelamanchili SROs in Anakapalle revenue district, in Visakhapatnam Registration Zone, have seen maximum registration of documents in the 2020-21 fiscal. The boom in construction activity at specific places is attributed to various factors like pollution-free environment, tourism projects and proximity to industries. Visakhapatnam district of the Registration and Stamps Department has achieved Rs. 654.24 crore as against the target of Rs. 801.34 crore, thereby achieving 81.64% of its target, for the 2020-21 fiscal. In contrast, the district achieved Rs. 595.57 crore as against the target of Rs. 827 crore, thereby achieving 72% of its target during 2019-20, A. Nagalakshmi, Deputy Inspector General of Registration and Stamps, Visakhapatnam Zone, told The Hindu . The target was reduced this year in view of the crisis in the construction industry due to the impact of the COVID-19. “The number of document sales, which was 55,489 in 2019-20, marginally declined to 55,204 this year. However, the revenue increased despite the drop in document sales. This can be attributed to the increase in property values in the city,” she says. Anakapalle revenue district has achieved Rs. 273.49 crore as against the target of Rs. 300.68 crore, thereby achieving 90.96% of the target this year. It achieved a revenue of Rs. 222.39 crore as against the target of Rs. 309 crore in 2019-20, thereby achieving 71.97%. The document sales increased from 63,938 in 2019-20 to 70,921 this year. “The property values are revised once a year in urban areas and once in two years in rural areas. Visakhapatnam being a big district, it has been divided into two revenue districts and they both come under Visakhapatnam Zone,” says Ms. Nagalakshmi.

11 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Silent pro-Congress wave in India, says Chinta||Former Union Minister and Congress candidate for Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election Chinta Mohan said that a “silent wave” was prevalent in favour of the Congress party not only in Andhra Pradesh, but all over India, as the people were vexed with the anti-poor policies of the BJP government at the centre.  ‘Tirupati will be capital’ “The Congress party is committed to making Tirupati as the capital if elected to power. As the NDA government had reiterated its stand against giving Special category status to Andhra Pradesh, this could be done only by the Congress Party,” Dr. Mohan said. Speaking to mediapersons during the poll campaign at Narayanavanam mandal headquarters, Dr. Chinta Mohan said that the NDA government’s privatisation move had gravely impacted the prospects of the SC/ST and OBC segments in the country, while skyrocketing of prices of essential commodities, petrol and diesel prices had thrown the poor and downtrodden sections into jeopardy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/silent-pro-congress-wave-in-india-says-chinta/article34293137.ece

Adinarayana Reddy on Saturday claimed that he had no link with the brutal murder of former Kadapa MP Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy. Speaking to the media at Tirupati, Mr. Adinarayana Reddy said that it was unfortunate that the YSRCP government could not find the culprits even two years after coming to power. Deploring that his name was unnecessarily dragged into the case, the BJP leader said that he was ready to face any consequence if his role was proved in the murder. Ridiculing the open letter by Y.S. Vijayamma, mother of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on the murder, the BJP leader alleged that it was a ‘move to shield the real culprits’. “Ms. Vijayamma woke up 25 months after the incident. First, attempts were made to dilute the case by claims that Vivekananda Reddy had died of cardiac arrest. Four hours after the death, it was termed as a murder case,” Mr Adinarayan Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-leader-denies-any-role-in-vivekas-murder/article34293933.ece

11 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Olive Ridley hatchlings released into sea||A fresh batch of Olive Ridley Sea turtles were released into sea off the coast of Suryalanka near Bapatla and Nizampatnam in Guntur district, blazing a new trail in Olive Ridley turtle conservation. Earlier, nesting of Olive Ridley turtles used to be done under the directions of Eluru WildLife division, but this year, the Forest wing of Guntur district had done the job. “Under the careful supervision of the Forest Department, our watchers in Suryalanka and in Bapatla have released 1,237 hatchlings into the sea early this morning at dawn, marking a new chapter in the history of wildlife division in the district. We have counted 5,615 eggs, and we thank the forest watchers who have been guarding and ensuring that hatchlings are released safely into the sea,” District Forest Officer, N. Ramachandra Rao told The Hindu on Saturday. Conversation of Olive Ridley Turtles, an endangered species and a vital link in sea ecosystem, is always challenging as the nesting takes place without any parental care. The turtles lay their eggs on the beach, which are vulnerable to predatory attacks and human intervention. The forest watchers ensure that nesting takes place in near perfect condition. Pits are dug up in which the eggs are placed in a medium of wet sand and dry sand. Bamboo trenches are erected around the pits and it usually takes 45 to 60 days for the hatchlings to emerge. The release of hatchlings also takes place around dawn as any slight increase in temperature could harm them, so the watchers prefer dawn or late night to release the turtles. The hatchlings are collected in a sack and are released on the beach, as it enables them to crawl on the sand before slowly entering the sea. Care is also taken to release the hatchlings in high tide areas. “This enables the hatchlings not to lose energy while swimming in sea at once,” says Mr. Ramachandra Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/olive-ridley-hatchlings-released-into-sea-at-suryalanka/article34293150.ece
11 April 2021||Hubballi/Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||More buses operated in Karnataka||Though there appears to be no resolution in sight for the ongoing strike in Karnataka, Road Transport Corporations were able to operate 1,626 buses on Saturday. On April 7, the first day of the strike by workers, only 264 buses were able to offer services to passengers across Karnataka. Striking employees are demanding that their salaries be revised as per the Sixth Pay Commission. Karnataka State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) Managing Director Shivyogi C. Kalasad said, “On Saturday, we operated 1,626 buses, almost double the number of Friday. It is a sign that more employees are reporting back to duty and we are hopeful that others will follow.” However, the number of buses currently operating is still a fraction of the fleet strength — prior to the strike, the four Corporations were running more than 17,000 buses in the State. Strict action such as dismissal of trainee and probationary employees for taking part in strike, transferring some employees for allegedly obstructing their colleagues who reported back to duty, or instigating others to participate in the strike, is yielding results. “The Corporations have also filed complaints against those obstructing employees who are willing to report back to duty, and pelting stones at buses,” said Mr. Kalasad He added that trainees or probationary employees who continue to participate in the strike or remain absent will face action. “Those who have been dismissed from service will not be reinstated in future,” he said. However, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employees League reiterated that it had no intention of calling off the strike. Its president, R. Chandrashekar, said, “Some employees of other unions are reporting back to duty. Those who have identified with us are still on strike. We will continue.”     At Belagavi, Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, leader of the agitation by Road Transport Corporation employees, was detained by the police, leading to widespread condemnation. Mr. Chandrashekhar said it was nothing but a “move to suppress a rightful protest.” He was released later. A senior police officer said that they had planned to hold a meeting without permission, which led to Mr. Kodihalli’s detention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/more-buses-operated-in-karnataka/article34293095.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||ESIC scams: ED searches seven places in Hyderabad||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday carried out simultaneous searches at seven places in Hyderabad in connection with the investigation into money laundering in a multi-crore scam in Telangana Insurance Medical Services (IMS) and Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) two years ago. The searches which commenced in the morning continued till late Saturday evening. Incriminating evidence A release later said ED had seized large amounts of incriminating evidence, unaccounted cash to the tune of Rs. 3 crore, Rs. 1 crore worth jewellery, blank cheques, property papers, and lockers.

The ED officials seized Rs. 1.50 crore from the house of Srinivas Reddy, Rs. 1.15 crore from Pramod Reddy and Rs. 45 lakh from Vinay Reddy. Documents of incriminating evidence and digital evidence were also seized. Financial irregularities The release also added that money laundering investigation was initiated against the then director of IMS Devika Rani, her husband and several others on the basis of eight FIRs registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of Telangana following allegations of financial irregularities in purchase and supply of medicines and surgical kits, huge price escalation, gross deviation from ESIC and government norms, creation of fake indents, fake bills, diversion of medicines, and falsification of records, among other things. The scam had generated proceeds of crime ranging from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200 crore. The ACB had arrested Devika Rani and eight others in the scam in 2019. The agency had recovered Rs. 4.47 crore from Devika Rani in September last year. Her family had allegedly invested huge amounts of money in chit fund and real estate companies. She and some others in ESI were found to have placed orders for purchase of medical equipment and drugs whether or not they were required. The bills were inflated in the process. Saturday’s searches were a result of the findings of the ACB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/esic-scams-ed-searches-seven-places-in-hyderabad/article34293097.ece
11 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Netaji’s aide honoured posthumously||Nearly 67 years after she travelled with her uncle Abid Hasan Safrani to Bern to complete her education, Ismat Mehdi received the Netaji Award conferred on the latter by the Netaji Research Foundation. “Netaji award 2021, posthumously offered by Netaji Research Bureau to Major Abid Hasan, Indian National Army, for his outstanding contribution to the freedom and unity of India under the leadership of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Jai Hind,” reads the citation which was handed over to Ms Mehdi on Saturday. Educated in St George’s Grammar School in Hyderabad and pursuing engineering in Berlin, Germany, Abid Hasan joined the fight for Indian freedom when Bose gave the famous call to liberate India from the British yoke. “When my uncle met Subhash Chandra Bose in Berlin, he was asked to join the freedom struggle immediately. But my uncle had a small plea: ‘I have one semester left. Let me complete it and then I will join the freedom struggle’. At this point, Netaji became angry with Abid Hasan,” recounts Ms. Mehdi about her uncle’s heroic life. “I have no need for selfish people. You think of yourself and your family without thinking about the country. I have no need for selfish people. Either you join now or never,” were the words of Netaji as recounted by Abid Hasan to his family members. “He tossed and turned all night. By morning, he made the decision to join the Indian National Army (INA),” informs Ms. Mehdi who has helped promote Gandhian ideals in her life. According to lore, it was Abid Hasan who was instrumental in INA adopting the salute ‘Jai Hind’. He also translated Rabindranath Tagore’s Jana Gana Mana into Urdu as Sabh Sukh Chain which was the anthem of provisional Government of Free India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/netajis-aide-honoured-posthumously/article34293850.ece

11 April 2021||NALGONDA,ANDHRA PRADESH||New party is a conspiracy to destabilise TRS government: Gutha Sukender Reddy||Launching a new political party is a conspiracy to destabilise the political system in Telangana, which has a stable and successful TRS government, State Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy said on Saturday. “People of Telangana are vigilant. People should ensure that they (leaders from Andhra Pradesh) don’t gain any scope here,” he said. Mr. Sukender Reddy was addressing a press conference here, and his statements were in obvious reference to Y.S. Sharmila Reddy’s announcement in Khammam about launching a political party on the birth anniversary of her father and former Chief Minister of united Andhra Pradesh Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. He observed that their new party was to create differences of opinion in an attempt to gain temporary political benefits. Mr. Sukender Reddy reacted to a few parts of Ms. Reddy’s speech, in which she criticised the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government for making neellu, nidhulu, niyamakalu (water, resources and jobs) a family affair of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and also that Telangana was still under dorala gadila palana . “ Gadila palana ended with Telangana struggle, it now exists in Pulivendula. Telangana is under 100% democratic rule. In the seven-year Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) rule, State ranks number one in development in the country. KCR has transformed agriculture and is bearing Rs. 10,000-crore subsidy on 24-hour electricity,” he said. He said diversion of Krishna water by taking up the Pothireddypadu project was the handiwork of Andhra Pradesh rulers, at a severe loss to Telangana. Criticising Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy, who is presently canvassing for senior Congress leader K. Jana Reddy in the Nagarjunasagar bypoll, who ridiculed him about a constitutional office-holder making political statements, Mr. Sukender Reddy termed him a blackmailer and a benami contractor. “How a painter became a politician and roams around in Range Rover now speaks a lot for him. Caught in vote-for-cash, he has no right to criticise me,” Mr. Sukender Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-party-is-a-conspiracy-to-destabilise-trs-government-gutha/article34293871.ece

Chandrababau Naidu, during his campaign for the party nominee for Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection Panabaka Lakshmi on Saturday, accused the YSRCP government of misusing the functionaries at the grassroots level, fearing a ‘debacle in the poll’. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy who was confident of winning the bypoll by 5 lakh plus margin initially, is now in jitters,” he said while addressing a series of party workers’ meeting in Nellore district. He told the party cadres that ‘the days of the TDP returning to power was not far away’ and wanted them to resist all the attempts by the YSRCP government to ‘push the State into ‘anarchy’. The Leader of Opposition accused the ruling party of roping in a band of volunteers, Self Help Group (SHG) members, Anganwadi and Asha workers in the villages in a desperate bid to improve its poll prospects. He asked the party workers in Sarvepalli and other places to expose the ‘sinister designs’ of the ruling party. He asked them to meet every voter in each cluster comprising 50 families and find out the issues in various localities. “The TDP workers should build confidence among the voters that there is no question of denial of their rights to benefits of welfare schemes,” he said. Mr. Naidu asked the party leaders concerned to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission pertaining to the alleged misuse of grassroots functionaries and electoral malpractice by the ruling party. Meanwhile, Ms. Panabaka Lakshmi endeared herself to a group of weavers at Chennur near Gudur by spinning cotton on a charkha.

11 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||E-auction of lands in city draws flak||The e-auction of lands in Visakhapatnam by National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) under the Mission Build A.P. of the State government, has drawn flak from various sections. Among other land parcels, the auction of 13.59 acres on Beach Road has drawn maximum criticism, as it is same land that was given to the Lulu group by the earlier TDP government and was later taken back by the YSR Congress Party government, after they had come to power in 2019. The NBBC, has proposed Rs. 1,452 crore as the reserve price for the land, which comes to around Rs. 107 crore per acre. Various political parties in the opposition say, while the present State government has set a good base price of around Rs. 107 crore per acre, the earlier government had given it for peanuts. But they also criticise the idea of monetisation of assets or land. “The property in question is government land and ultimately belongs to the public. Monetisation of public land is not a good idea, as it should be kept for posterity or used for public development,” said CPI (M) State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao. Just because the government is cash-strapped due to its welfare schemes to retain the voters, land and assets cannot be monetised to fund the schemes or pay interest on loans taken, he said. Assets, including land, can be monetised but the revenue generated should be invested for public development and not for paying interests on debts. This could push the government into a debt trap, said former secretary to GOI E.A.S. Sarma. The State government intends to raise about Rs. 1,500 crore through auction and the lands to be auctioned in Visakhapatnam are 13.59 acres in survey number 1101 on Beach Road; 0.20 acres in survey number 27-49 in Aganampudi with reserve price of Rs. 1.30 crore; 0.30 acres in survey numbers 27-49 in Aganampudi (Rs. 1.95 crore); 1 acre in survey number 38-4 (plots 2A/2B) in Fakirtakiya (Rs. 2.33 crore); 1.93 acres in survey numbers 100-9 in Fakirtakiya, 11 bits of 0.10 acres (Rs. 0.43 crore each), another bit of 0.83 acres (Rs. 3.66 crore), and 0.35 acres in survey number 100-5 in Fakirtakiya (Rs. 1.47 crore).  CRZ violation The 13.59-acre land parcel on Beach Road falls under Coastal Regulation Zone-II (CRZ -II) and the land has ecological significance. “This land comes wrapped with restrictions under the CRZ Act and cannot be privatised and public cannot be excluded,” said Mr. Sarma. Even giving it to Lulu group itself was illegal, he added. According to Mr. Narasinga Rao, the government was planning to auction land parcels in Aganampudi, when still two villages are yet to get the rehabilitation package under Visakhapatnam Steel Plant land acquisition. It has been three decades and house sites are yet to be given to 95 families of Karanavanipalem and 24 families in Sanivada villages, in Aganampudi, under the R&R package. “Instead of giving them the land, the government is planning to sell land over there,” Mr. Narasinga Rao alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/e-auction-of-lands-in-city-draws-flak/article34294005.ece
11 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Writing is a passion for this head constable||If economic compulsions in his family wouldn’t have compelled him to join the police force at the age of 20 in 1990, Beesetty Venkateswara Rao, would have become a writer or a playwright. But after the roll of a few years as constable, posted in Visakhapatnam district, and settling down in his job, he revived his passion for writing and has already written two books and the third is due for launch on Saturday. After completing his Bachelor of Arts in Telugu literature, Venkateswara joined the AP Police, as constable and today, he is posted as head constable in MVP Police Station. His writing and compering skills, has brought him recognition and many senior IPS officers and former officers, still stop by to enquire about him. He thanks R. Seetarama Rao, who was the then DIG (Range), for bringing back his passion for writing. “It was immediately after IPS officer Umesh Chandra was killed by the Naxalites in SR Nagar, Hyderabad, in September 1999, the DIG having heard of my writing skills, asked me to write a playlet. I wrote it and also formed a team to stage the play. This brought me instant recognition, as it was well appreciated and from then I took to active writing,” said Mr. Venkateswara Rao. He published his first book ‘Aithe’ in 2008, which was a compilation of short stories, revolving around police officers and the services done by the police to the public. “I have served across the length and breadth of the district, including in Maoist-affected area of Chintapalli. I have come across many officers and policemen, who have been doing their duties selflessly, and I draw inspiration from them and their work,” he said. His second book ‘Salute’ is about the officers and men who have laid down their lives in the line of duty and includes the stories of IPS officers such as Umesh Chandra, G. Paradesi Naidu and K.S. Vyas and inspector M. Gandhi. “They were daring officers who led from the front and still stand as inspirational figures in the force,” said Mr. Venkateswara Rao. Book release His third book ‘Salaam Police’, which will be released by the former vice-chancellor of Andhra Universtiy G.S.N. Raju at Visakha Public Library on Sunday, is again a compilation of short stories that focusses on policemen who continue to do their duty, rain or shine or during COVID or in insurgency-prone areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/writing-is-a-passion-for-this-head-constable/article34293994.ece
11 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Customs questions Kerala Speaker||A Customs (Preventive) team questioned Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan at his official residence here on Friday. Later on Saturday, the agency reportedly inspected a flat allegedly owned by a close relative of his in Thiruvananthapuram. The investigators arrived at the Speaker’s residence reportedly armed with a statement by UAE gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh. She had purportedly claimed in a sworn statement that Mr. Sreeramakrishnan had asked her at the flat to hand over a sealed bag to the UAE consulate's consul general. At the time, Swapna was the consul’s executive secretary and the main go-between the State government and the diplomatic mission. The contents of the bag and its end destination remained unknown. Swapna’s statement However, in a recent court filing, the Customs had alleged that Swapna had “stated with clarity about the smuggling of foreign currency at the instance of Hon'ble Chief Minister [Pinarayi Vijayan] and Hon'ble Speaker [P. Sreeramakrishnan].”  Earlier, the Customs had questioned Mr. Sreeramakrishnan's additional private secretary K. Ayyappan. It had also reportedly ‘red-flagged’ Mr. Sreeramakrishnan's interactions with other accused in the smuggling case, including the inauguration of Sandeep Nair's car accessory shop at Nedumangad in 2019. The Speaker's office said the Customs had earlier sought Mr. Sreeramakrishnan's leave to speak to him. The Speaker had interacted with the agency meaningfully. There was no ground for any media speculation. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Speaker's ‘interrogation’ by the Customs had validated the UDF resolution in the Assembly seeking his removal. “Mr. Sreeramakrishnan owed the public an explanation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/customs-questions-kerala-speaker/article34293105.ece
11 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Clamour for Minister Jaleel’s ouster grows||Amid the clamour for the ouster of Minister for Higher Education and Minority Welfare K.T. Jaleel from the Cabinet growing more strident, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) has dismissed the demand. The Kerala Lok Ayukta had on Friday found him guilty of “abuse of power, favouritism, nepotism and violation of oath of office” and ruled that Dr. Jaleel had lost the moral right to continue in the Council of Ministers. ‘No legal precedent’ Law Minister A.K. Balan said on Saturday that the government had a minimum of three months to act on the Lok Ayukta finding. Moreover, the Opposition’s demand had no legal precedent. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had not resigned when the Lok Ayukta found him guilty of maladministration for misusing tsunami relief funds. Moreover, Dr. Jaleel was the aggrieved party. He had the right to seek relief in a higher court. Dr. Jaleel has moved the High Court against the Lok Ayukta finding. (Muslim Youth League State general secretary P.K. Firoz has intervened in the petition as an interested opposite party). CPI(M) State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan rejected the demand for Dr. Jaleel’s resignation. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan dared Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to honour the Lok Ayukta’s recommendation. The Congress had aired a similar demand on Friday. Mr. Muraleedharan said Dr. Jaleel’s ‘special relationship’ with Mr. Vijayan would protect him. Mr. Vijayan had ‘ejected’ Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan from the Cabinet in 2016 on an unconfirmed charge of nepotism. In 2017, Mr. Vijayan expelled the late Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and the then Transport Minister Thomas Chandy from the Cabinet after a court punished him for backwater encroachment. In the present case, the Chief Minister appeared highly solicitous of Dr. Jaleel. ‘CM protecting Jaleel’ Mr. Vijayan had protected Dr. Jaleel when he came under a cloud of suspicion in the UAE gold smuggling case. “Dr. Jaleel was a close confidant of Indian Union Muslim League leader P. K. Kunhalikutty till they turned foes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/clamour-for-ministers-ouster-grows/article34293106.ece

Our focus is on the JNTU campuses in Kakinada and Anantapur because there is a good demand among students from other nations for technical courses,” said Mr. Reddy. Explaining the role of the new facility, he said they would coordinate in all matters relating to supporting foreign students, dissemination of information pertaining to admission process, promotional activities and brand building campaign abroad. The facilities will serve as a single point contact for carrying out all collaborative activities with foreign institutions and act as a liaison body between the foreign students and the sponsoring agency. Grievance redressal They would also address the grievances of foreign students in all matters and serve as the single point contact for registration with Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO), facilitate networking with fellow students and extend all help to the foreign students to adapt to the new cultural environment and make their stay comfortable. “The idea is to make Andhra Pradesh an attractive destination for foreign students to pursue their academics here,” said Mr. Reddy.

The IPS officer also alleged that forged documents were created in the wake of enquiry by the Commission of Enquiries. The enquiry report submitted by the DSP, the CID on February 6, 2020 concluded that he had committed violation of Rule 4(3)(a) of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, based on that allegation alone, he was placed under suspension. ‘Suspension order illegal’ Mr. Rao alleged that the DSP, CID, the ADG, CID, the DGP, IAS officer Praveen Prakash and the then Chief Secretary had failed to observe that Rule 4(3)(a) is not applicable in this case. “As a result of non-application of mind, the government had issued an illegal and arbitrary order placing me under suspension.

11 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC stays e-tender for calcite mining in Visakhapatnam||The Andhra Pradesh High Court has put on hold for three weeks the e-tender for ‘working of calcite mining lease’ in 8.725 hectares at Nimmalapadu village in Ananthagiri mandal of Visakhapatnam district, on ‘raising-cum-sale contract basis’ floated by the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC). The High Court passed the order after hearing a writ petition filed by Sri Abhaya Girijana Mutually Aided Labour Contract Cooperative Society on Saturday. The cooperative society has been trying to get the lease for mining since the last two decades. But, it was rejected by the APMDC every time. Earlier, the Birla group had the lease over the mines and it was passed to the APMDC after a Supreme Court order in 1995. Earlier, the cooperative society had also proposed a tripartite agreement with the State government and a private party, but it was rejected, said Ravi Rebbapragada, Executive Director of Samata. Mr. Ravi had played a key role in getting the Samata judgement from the Supreme Court which protects the tribal rights and acts as a benchmark for all tribal related issues along with the Panchayat Extension to the Scheduled Areas Act (PESA) and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act (FRA). ‘No grama sabha held’ According to Mr. Ravi, the cooperative society’s pleas were ignored and neither did the APMDC care to hold a grama sabha with the tribal people from the region, before floating the e-tender, in violation of the PESA, FRA and Samata and Niyamgiri judgments of the Supreme Court. Moreover, the cooperative society contested that one of the clause in the e-tender said that the lease would be be given to a tribal person, not to a tribal cooperative. “This provision will facilitate benami trading, as no tribal person has the mining equipment listed in the contractual clauses,” he said. The members of the cooperative society said that clauses should be modified and cooperatives be allowed to place their bids, and grama sabha be held as per the laws embedded in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. The area earmarked for mining is rich in mineral and the calcite is pure and free of silica. The tribal people need to get the benefit of the resources, said Mr. Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-stays-e-tender-for-calcite-mining-in-visakhapatnam/article34293940.ece

His lungs were retrieved on Saturday and sent to KIMS Hospitals in Hyderabad, while his kidneys and liver will be given to the needy patients in the city. Teja had completed BBA. His father M. Tirupathi Rao, who works in a private company, located near Duvvada, left for night duty on April 7. Teja told his mother that he was going to meet his friends and left on his dad’s motorcycle that evening. When he did not return home till midnight, his mother called him and he replied that he would return soon. “Around 2 a.m. (in the early hours of April 8), my wife called me on my mobile and told me that the 108 ambulance staff had informed her that our son met with an accident on Beach Road behind zoo and he was taken to the KGH. I rushed to the hospital and even after the doctors there told me there was no hope, we did not give up and took him to CARE Hospital,” Mr. Tirupathi Rao told this correspondent in a voice choked with emotion. “Dr. N.V.S. Mohan (neuro surgeon of CARE), who treated my son, called me to the counselling room and told me that Teja was ‘brain- dead’. Your son can save five patients, if his vital organs are harvested. If you are willing to donate his organs, they would be harvested and given to needy patients. Mr. Sai (Jeevandan coordinator) also told me about the importance of organ donation,” he said. “It did not take long for me to decide and I told myself that it was, perhaps God’s will.

11 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||District sees 391 new cases||The district recorded 391 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative tally to 64,865 as on Saturday morning. Consecutively for the second day, the day-tally has crossed the 300-mark. This is also the highest single-day tally since the last six months. The district has reported third highest day-tally after Chittoor (741) and Guntur (527) districts in the last 24 hours. The total number of cases reported this April is 2,526.

Special drive The special drive by the police to keep a check on people violating COVID-19 norms by not wearing masks continues in the city. In a span of around two weeks, the police teams have imposed fines against more than 50,000 people at various places. According to Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha, the drive was initiated on March 27 with a two-fold strategy. “Our main aim was to create awareness over the increasing number of cases and need to wear face masks, maintain social distancing and using hand sanitisers. Meanwhile we also wanted to penalise those who violate the protocol by not wearing mask,” he said. A large number of pedestrians and those travelling on bikes were told to use masks in public as a social responsibility. Mr. Sinha was seen distributing masks to a number of people on Beach Road on Saturday. “Visakha Police will continue to pursue the mask enforcement drive in order to bring more awareness and compliance to the protocol and to ensure appropriate behaviour by public at large,” the CP added. Since March 27, city police wing, including law and order, crime, traffic and AR force, has been conducting the drives and booking cases against people for not wearing masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/district-sees-391-new-cases/article34294001.ece

11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Steer clear of outdoor gatherings, urges Eatala||Urging people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour, Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender has appealed against attending functions and outdoor gatherings. The appeal comes at a crucial time when the State is witnessing an unprecedented rise in infections and political parties have started campaigning for the by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency slated for April 17. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would address a public meeting at Halia on April 14. Major political parties have launched road shows and other forms of campaigning. There is concern among people that such mass gatherings could lead to further surge. Addressing a press conference at the State Health campus, Koti, on Saturday, Mr Rajender has advised people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Prior to the press conference, he held a series of meetings with the managements of corporate hospitals, private hospitals, and nursing homes. The government order issued last year putting a cap on charges for COVID treatment also featured in the discussion. Treatment costs Senior officials argued that they would not be able to regulate the treatment charges, which might go up with the kind of costly services provided at corporate hospitals. The Health Minister said that the charges could be cut down as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are not being used by healthcare workers (HCWs) while attending COVID patients. Besides, last year, 30% to 40% additional salaries were paid to HCWs during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/steer-clear-of-outdoor-gatherings-urges-eatala/article34293840.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||RWAs impose fresh restrictions||Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) have begun to impose fresh curbs on movement of outsiders as the number of COVID-19 cases are on an upswing across the State, especially in the city. Discouraging house-help services and leaving it to the discretion of households, food deliveries at the gate, blocking play areas, no entry without masks and limiting the movement of outsiders are some of the rules imposed from Thursday in a residential complex in Attapur. The complex has three households which have gone into self-imposed quarantine after family members tested positive for the virus. “The house helps move from one house to another. Out of safety consideration, we have asked our house help to not work at our home for 15 days, assuring her that we will continue to pay her salary,” said a resident unwilling to go on record for privacy concerns. Many other apartment complexes across the city have imposed similar curbs, according to food delivery executives. The fresh steps in limiting the movement of people in residential complexes come barely three months since the earlier curbs were loosened as the number of cases dropped from January 2021 in Telangana. Hand sanitiser bottles and notices about no-mask no-entry are again back in residential complexes. “These harsh steps are not necessary. It is a knee-jerk reaction. Some RWAs are following what politicians are doing. No thought is given to what will happen to livelihoods if these unscientific curbs are imposed,” said Rao Chelikani, who heads an umbrella body of RWAs in the city. “I came to know about measures being imposed by residential colonies and we have counselled them against imposing any harsh measures which are counter-productive,” said Mr. Chelikani. Incidentally, the State government is not notifying quarantined areas as per the protocol followed during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak. As the current wave of the pandemic rampages through the city, citizens are being forced to do their own intelligence-gathering and measures to prevent the spread of the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rwas-impose-fresh-curbs/article34293833.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Close to 3,000 new COVID cases in TS||The State recorded close to 3,000 new COVID-19 cases, in a grim reminder of the unprecedented rise in infections during the first wave of the pandemic last year. As many as 2,909 cases were detected on Friday as 1,11,726 samples were tested. The last time more than 2,900 cases a day were recorded in Telangana was during the peak of the pandemic last August. The highest single-day tally of 3,018 was logged on August 25. Of the total tests conducted, the results of 4,533 persons was awaited. This was the second consecutive day when over one lakh samples were examined. The new 2,909 cases included 487 infections detected in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation region followed by 289 in Medchal-Malkajgiri, 225 in Rangareddy, 202 in Nizamabad, 131 in Nirmal, 121 in Jagtial, 117 in Sangareddy and 102 in Kamareddy.

11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ICU bed occupancy nears last year’s high||The number of COVID-19 patients currently occupying ICU beds in hospitals across the State is slowly but surely nearing the figures recorded during the peak of the pandemic last year. On Friday, ICU bed occupancy by coronavirus patients in the State’s government and private hospitals stood at 1,677. In August and September last year, when the maximum virus cases were recorded in Telangana, nearly 1,350 to 2,300-plus ICU beds had been occupied. While many people continue to throw caution to the wind and do not observe safety norms, statistics indicate that severity of the disease is still sending coronavirus-positive persons to the ICU. Senior officials of the Health department have reiterated that apart from the struggle during the infection, recovered patients are also suffering from post-COVID complications, including respiratory issues. COVID cases in the State peaked from August 24 and September last year when 2,000-3,000 cases were recorded on a daily basis. Then, the ICU bed occupancy ranged from 1,350 to a little over 2,300. From April 7 to 9 this year, 2,000 to 2,900 persons have been detected with the virus per day. ICU bed occupancy for the corresponding period has remained between 1,300 and just under 1,700. No crisis yet However, as per details in the daily COVID bulletin, there is no shortage as 4,989 ICU beds were available in government and private hospitals as on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/icu-bed-occupancy-nears-last-years-high/article34293837.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Post flak for tweets on loudspeakers for azaan, Maulana issues apology||A day after All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) in-charge general secretary Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani tweeted his opinion on loudspeakers being used to recite the azaan, the call to prayer, the Islamic scholar issued an apology and clarified that the opinion was made in his personal capacity. The tweets had snowballed into a controversy with several criticising the Maulana. The Hyderabad-based cleric, in a series of Urdu tweets on Friday, opined that the azaan should be recited from external loudspeakers of a ‘big’ mosque in a neighbourhood, and the remaining smaller mosques should do so on internal speakers, or without a mic or a speaker from outside. He also stated that external speakers should not face homes of people belonging to other faiths and hospitals. Another tweet urged Muslims to use internal speakers of mosques to deliver sermons and carry out other religious activities. While a section of twitterati agreed with his opinion, Rahmani’s comments discouraging the use of external speakers, in particular, drew sharp criticism from other sections on social media. The tweets were later deleted. In a statement released on the micro-blogging site on Saturday, Maulana Rahmani, who also heads the Islamic seminary Al Mahad ul Aali al Islami in Pahadishareef, clarified that his opinions were a part of an opinion piece he had recently written, and were not those of AIMPLB, or any other organisation. The comments, he added, were not injunctions as per the Sharia, but suggestions made bearing in certain circumstances. He also clarified that since the azaan is an announcement, it has to reach a large number of people and the use of speakers is advisable. Explaining the reason for retracting, his statement reads, “Those in the know have said that against the backdrop of the circumstances prevailing in India, these suggestions could have ramifications, therefore, I retract and apologise.”  Those in the know have said that against the backdrop of the circumstances prevailing in the country, these suggestions could have ramifications, therefore, I retract and apologise.

11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Take up cotton, red gram on 95 lakh acres’||The State government is planning to encourage farmers to take up cultivation of cotton on about 75 lakh acres and red gram on 20 lakh acres as major crops during the next kharif (vanakalam) season so that there is no uncertainty over the demand for their produce. ‘Focus on oilseeds’ The farmers could also focus on raising oilseeds as there was a huge demand for edible oils in the country and huge foreign exchange was being spent on import of edible oils, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy said at a virtual meeting with District Agriculture Officers on Saturday. Suggesting that farmers bring down paddy cultivation in kharif as much as possible, the Minister asked the Agriculture Department to create awareness among farmers about it during the two-month period before the commencement of the next farming season. The department officials could educate farmers on the demand for cotton, pulses and oilseeds in national and international markets, he said. The Minister instructed the officials to keep about cotton seed packets ( about 76,500 quintals) from 57 seed companies and 80,000 quintals of red gram seed ready before the commencement of the season, by May 15, by keeping strict vigil on spurious seed companies. As the State government was going to introduce QR code system for traceability of seed from the kharif season, the problem of spurious seed could be under check to a large extent, he said. The Agriculture Minister asked the officials to activate task force teams to control the spurious seed menace. Managing Director of the Telangana State Seed Development Corporation K. Keshavulu, officials of the Agriculture Department, and representatives of seed companies participated in the virtual meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/take-up-cotton-red-gram-on-95-lakh-acres/article34293866.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Private schools fleecing parents, starving teachers||A great number of private school teachers in the city, who may benefit from the Telangana government’s scheme offering 25 kilograms of fine quality rice and Rs. 2000 relief per month per head, have not been receiving full salaries for almost a year now. Inaction by the government against private schools charging hefty sums as fee during COVID-19 lockdown goes in stark contrast against its new-found sympathy for the teachers. Scores of schools in the city and elsewhere are violating the Government Order imposing restrictions on how much fee could be collected for the lockdown period during which the classes were being run online. As per the order, only tuition fee should be collected for online classes, with all the other heads waived. However, several schools are paying no heed to the Government Order and charging as per their whims. Sujatha Borde, a parent waging a pitched battle in court along with 224 other parents, says the school clubbed all other heads such as infrastructure fee, computer fee under the tuition fee. Parents approached the High Court over the violation, and got interim orders for payment of part fee, and for the students to be allowed for writing exams. While the students were allowed to write the exams post the hearing, their report cards have been withheld, and parents are asked to pay the entire fee amount to get their kids admission for the next year. “The schools had saved upon the school maintenance, electricity and other expenditure during the lockdown, yet are not willing to reduce the fee,” Ms.Borde said. An inquiry ordered by the Telangana School Education Directorate into affairs of 11 schools based on parents’ complaints, revealed that all had violated the Government Order. No action has been taken against any of these schools. Meanwhile, private school teachers are going through the toughest times, as their salaries have been slashed on the pretext of online classes. Thousands of teachers have lost their jobs too, with no punitive action initiated against the schools. “We had not received salary for two months after lockdown began. Later too, our salaries have been cut by half, even as management collected fee as usual from parents. The cut for pre-primary and primary school teachers is worse. Several have been removed or quit. Justification by the management was that we did not have to teach eight or nine sections like in the regular school because the sections were clubbed online,” said Medha (name changed), a high school teacher from an elite private school with 10 branches in and around Hyderabad. The relief offered by Telangana government does not enthuse her much. “It’s like giving out alms for trading our rights. I have refused to take the ration and the cash relief,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/private-schools-fleecing-parents-starving-teachers/article34293869.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Large chunk of ICU patients aged under 40||A large number of young patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms are getting admitted to ICUs this year. While a majority of patients requiring intensive care last year were aged 60 years or above with co-morbidities, around 45% of the current lot of affected persons are aged below 40 years, said CEO of Continental Hospitals, Riyaz Khan. “Probably, vaccination of people above 45 years has helped in de-risking them. Some people who were vaccinated are testing positive for COVID again, but it may not be severe in them,” Dr Khan said. Senior officials of the Health department have also made the observation that severity of infection was low in those who had taken two doses of the vaccination but later tested positive for the virus. Regardless of whether a person has taken the vaccine or not, everyone should wear masks, maintain social distancing, and sanitise hands regularly, says Dr Khan, adding that by not wearing masks, people are risking their lives and that of others too. Head of Critical Care at Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills, K. Subba Reddy said that compared to last year, more number of younger patients with severe COVID are getting admitted to the ICU. He observed that unlike last year, a patient’s health starts to deteriorate from the fifth or sixth day of infection. A correlation with viral load was suspected but Dr Subba Reddy said a study is needed to establish the correlation. Increased movement and work from office could be the reason for more cases among the younger population. ‘Keep beds free’ Managing director of KIMS Hospitals, B. Bhaskar Rao has urged citizens to follow doctor’s advice regarding home isolation or admission at hospital. He said that most patients may not require hospitalisation. Like last year, some patients and their families who become anxious after contracting COVID insist on getting admitted to the hospital, which could lead to shortage of beds for patients actually requiring medical attention. In such critical situations, families end up rushing from one hospital to another, or enquiring over phone with multiple hospitals about the availability of beds, adding to their stress. “Get admitted only if doctors suggest it. Right now, 20% of people may not require oxygen. Most patients are getting discharged within two to three days, unlike five to seven days last year,” Dr Bhaskar Rao said. Recently, corporate hospital managements were suggested to open COVID Care Centres where people with mild form of the infectious disease can get admitted. This is expected to help keep the hospital beds free for critical COVID or non-COVID patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/large-chunk-of-icu-patients-aged-under-40/article34293838.ece
11 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Taking vaccine while fasting does not invalidate roza||A fatwa issued by an Islamic seminary in Hyderabad on Saturday stated that taking COVID-19 vaccine while fasting in the holy month of Ramzan is permissible, and does not invalidate the fast. The fatwa was issued by the Darul Ifta, a wing of an Islamic seminary, which deals with addressing queries pertaining to Islamic jurisprudence, of Al Mahad ul Aali al Islami. “It is the opinion of scholars that against the backdrop of any pandemic, it is permissible to use vaccines. These can be taken during fasting, and it does not invalidate the fast as the vaccine does not enter the stomach through natural passageways such as the nose or throat,” an excerpt from the fatwa reads. Touching upon some cases in which people developed a fever, or weakness, or deterioration of health, after taking the vaccine, the fatwa states that in such circumstances, when fasting becomes difficult, it is permissible to not fast. However, the missed day of fasting should be compensated for at a later date. The fatwa quotes a hadith (tradition of Prophet Muhammad) recorded in Sahih Bukhari which lays emphasis on precautionary measures in case a place is affected by a pandemic. “It is permissible to take the vaccine while fasting. It does not break the fast,” said Mufti Omar Abedeen Qasmi Madani, an office bearer of Al Mahad ul Aali al Islami said. Ramzan is expected to begin on either April 13 or April 14, depending on the sighting of the crescent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/taking-vaccine-while-fasting-does-not-invalidate-roza/article34293843.ece
11 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Six arrested for online job frauds||Six persons, including a woman from New Delhi, who were involved in online job frauds, were arrested by the Hyderabad Cyber Crime police. The investigators raided two call centres in Delhi and Ghaziabad and arrested Ravinder Kumar Pandey (27), owner of a call centre, Amar Kumar Singh (29), team leader, Shivam Tripathi (21), Prakash Tiwari (21), both telecallers, one Vijay Rawal (25) and his partner Priyanka (22), who runs another call centre. In August last, a man from Langer Houz approached the police stating that he searched for a job on Naukri.com and filled up his profile with all necessary details. “The very next day, he received a call from Naukri.com. The caller introduced him as Sharma and after checking his profile details, they offered the complainant a job at a Tata company,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said. The caller asked the man to pay Rs. 2,600 towards registration fee and gave a bank account number to deposit the money. Later, he made him pay Rs. 78,000 on the pretext of processing charges, verification charges and convenience charges, for jobs. When he got suspicious, the man called the helpline number of Naukri.com and the company told him that he was cheated. Based on his complaint, a case was registered and police arrested Pandey, Singh, Tripathi and Tiwari and seized a laptop, a hard drive, seven mobile phones and 24 bank cards from their possession. In another case reported in December last, a student from Mehdipatnam approached the police stating that while searching for a job online, she received a call from a woman who offered her a job of a ticketing executive at Indigo Airlines. The fraudster asked the victim to pay Rs. 2,500 as registration charges and subsequently she was convinced to transfer Rs. 6 lakh in various instalments towards different charges, the Joint CP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/six-arrested-for-online-job-frauds/article34293847.ece

11 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘It is honest Jana Reddy versus corrupt KCR’||Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy has described the Nagarjuna Sagar bypolls as a contest between an honest Jana Reddy and a corrupt TRS government, and it was for people to choose a man with honesty and integrity. Mr. Reddy, who campaigned for Congress candidate Mr. K. Jana Reddy in several villages in Anumula mandal, said it was ironic that the corrupt TRS Ministers and MLAs were criticising an honest politician like Jana Reddy, whose impeccable 40-year record as a public servant was well-known. Accusing Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of being a highly corrupt politician, he said KCR was a sobriquet for ‘loot and corruption’ in the State and he was using corrupt money made in the irrigation projects to win elections. KCR had brought in money politics in Telangana, which was formed with the sacrifices of youngsters. Mr. Reddy said it was laughable that MLAs involved in drug scandals and about to go to jails should also criticise Mr. Jana Reddy. They should remember that the roads they were travelling for campaigning were also laid with the efforts of the tall Congress leader. He reminded that the Congress had completed 70% of Srisailam tunnel works, spending Rs. 1300 crore, but the TRS government could not complete the rest, thus inflicting great injustice to people of Nalgonda district. The Bhongir MP asked the TRS government to focus on the promises made like filling the vacancies and issuing notifications for the two lakh vacancies in Telangana. It was unfortunate that youngsters were committing suicide for jobs and the CM was making no efforts to instil confidence among them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/it-is-honest-jana-reddy-versus-corrupt-kcr/article34293868.ece

11 April 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||BJP promises job opportunities||Electing BJP candidate Ravi Kumar Naik in the Nagarjunasagar bypoll will help transform the constituency; on the other hand, Congress is a party of yesterday and electing Telangana Rashtra Samithi candidate would also not yield anything, Minister of State (Home) G. Kishan Reddy said on Saturday. If Naik was elected, every mandal would get one skill development centre to generate livelihood opportunities, and eligible women would be provided loans under Mudra Yojana to make them entrepreneurs, he said. Not only women of the constituency, but Dalits and tribals, students, the unemployed, farmers and local businesses would also get special treatment, as per the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto released by Mr. Kishan Reddy. Addressing party cadre and locals at a private function hall in Haliya, the Minister said BJP’s victory in Nagarjunasagar was needed to effect a change in the State politics, much like what Dubbak victory and the large vote share the BJP had garnered in GHMC elections did. He criticised Congress leader K. Jana Reddy “for zero development”, and the TRS for walking the Congress way. He pointed out that the constituency had no degree college, its tourism potential remained untapped, important projects were shelved and even proposals were not initiated for the promised juice factory for sweet lime farmers. Mr. Kishan Reddy said the BJP would bring a ‘sea airport’ to Nagarjunasagar reservoir, tap tourism and create job opportunities and set up industries, a fruit research centre and a national agriculture research centre for increasing paddy production and Haliya municipality would be made a revenue division and Sagar-regional ring road industrial corridor set up. Later, along with Mr. Ravi Naik and Dubbak legislator M.

11 April 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Need for flyovers at Pothireddypalle and Kandi||Despite being a busy road, everytime the focus is more on widening the Mumbai National Highway 65 instead of constructing a flyover, which would address the problem on a permanent basis. Neither the officials nor political representatives are responding to the requirement. For instance, Pothireddypalle chowrasta is the entry point to Sangareddy district headquarters. The vehicles that come from Hyderabad take a right turn to enter the district headquarters while the vehicles going to Mumbai go straight. But all the vehicles have to stop here to make way for each other. A flyover with underpass will solve the problem. However, a flyover was built a 500 metres away from the chowrasta where little purpose is served . Kandi chowrasta in the newly formed mandal headquarters town also faces a similar problem. This town comes 5 km before Pothireddypalle. Here the straight route goes to Mumbai while a left turn connects to Bangaluru Highway via Shankarpally in Ranga Reddy district. The road contract from Patancheru to Sangareddy was awarded to Progressive Constructions Limited during the tenure of the Congress government and later a dispute arose over poor maintenance of the road and toll collection was stopped. Meanwhile, the Outer Ring Road (ORR) has also become operational. Progressive Constructions approached the arbitrator demanding compensation, stating it had lost hugely due to stopping of toll collection as well as the ORR. “In the past also, a flyover was proposed at Pothireddypalle but shifted to another place. Flyover here is an immediate requirement,” said a police official. “We need flyovers at Isnapur, Muttangi, Kandi and Sangareddy. The decision has to be taken at Delhi level and we are ready to move the proposal. For that matter, anyone – maybe district officials, Collector, NHAI authorities and Lok Sabha members can make the proposal,” said Superintendent of Police S. Chandrasekhar Reddy. “The issue was raised twice in Parliament and was taken to Minister for Surface Transport Nitin Gadkari’s notice. The flyover work could not be taken up due to technical reasons. I want to make a fresh proposal again for flyovers at Pothireddypalle, Kandi and BHEL crossroads,” Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/need-for-flyovers-at-pothireddypalle-and-kandi/article34293861.ece

11 April 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Spending lonely nights, in fear||It was a typical situation for 35-year-old Ajmera Sriram. A resident and oustee of Pallepahad tanda in Toguta mandal, Sriram has been spending sleepless nights for the past three days. His problem is that many of his neighbours have already vacated the village which would be submerged by Mallannasagar in the next few months. This tanda has about 100 families and majority of them vacated the village as promised to the officials after performing Sevalal Puja. However, Sriram, his bother Srinivas and some 10 other families were left out and are staying in the village alone with their children. Dark nights without much public has been creating panic among them. They say that the total amount of compensation, in particular pertaining to houses, was not paid to them and hence they have been not vacating. They fear that they may not get justice once the village is vacated. Ajmeera Doolamma, their aged mother, is also staying with them. “For my house spread in about 500 yards, including open place and construction, the amount fixed was Rs. 12.3 lakh whereas for neighbour the amount was far higher. I have asked the officials for resurvey, which they promised but to date it has not been completed for the reason best known to them. People do not understand why we are staying here when everyone has vacated,” Mr. Sriram told The Hindu . Some of the youth, in the village who crossed 18 years, were not yet paid the package and they are not sure whether they will get it or not. “Officials are stating all the pending payments would be cleared shortly. But we have heard cases of several oustees of Kondapochammasagar and hence questions are hanging around us,” said Mr. Sriram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/spending-lonely-nights-in-fear/article34293876.ece

11 April 2021||New Delhi,||Rising virus cases pose fresh trial for prisons||The rising number of COVID-19 cases in the Capital has again thrown a fresh challenge at the Delhi prisons where inmate count has touched the 20,000 mark for the first time. Following social distancing norms in such packed spaces remains a perennial concern. The Delhi prison has a sanctioned capacity of around 10,000 inmates. However, the jail administration said that they are making all possible efforts to keep the prisoners safe and are following all COVID-related protocols. Space crisis A senior officer said that despite the pandemic, there is surge in number of inmates and for the first time the count had crossed the 20,000 mark on March 30. “It is tough to maintain hygiene and COVID-19 protocols in summers when there is a space crisis. However, they regularly sanitise inmate wards and senior citizens have been kept in separate wards for safety,” said the officer. In Delhi, there are three prisons — Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini — where a total 20,041 prisoners are lodged. The officer added that as per the protocol, whenever any new inmate arrives, he or she is kept in a separate ward for 14 days and has to undergo mandatory COVID-19 test followed by health screening. The prisoners’ meeting with their relatives is also suspended till further orders. Vaccination facility “We have arranged COVID-19 vaccination facility inside Tihar prison in order to avoid taking them out to the nearest vaccination centre. We are doing all possible efforts to keep the inmates safe and we have managed to achieve it. We keep motivating them to get vaccinated,” said the officer. Another officer said that the number of inmates is increasing and they have limited space. It is becoming difficult in the present times where social distancing is a mandatory thing to avoid getting infected. In Tihar, there are a total nine prisons which has a capacity to accommodate 5,200 inmates but at present there are 13,587 inmates. In Rohini prison which has a capacity of 1,050 inmates, there are 1,733 inmates at present. In Mandoli prison, which has a capacity to accommodate 3,776 inmates, has 4,721 inmates currently. There are only two jails (14 and 16) in Mandoli where there are less numbers of inmates than the sanctioned capacity. The situation is the worst in Jail number 1 and 4 of Tihar where the number of inmates lodged are four times more than the actual capacity. Possible efforts “We are doing all possible efforts but social distancing is not possible within the barrack. We ensure that whenever inmates move out of their barracks — to make a call to their families, or to appear before court through videoconferencing or some other work — we ensure they follow all safety protocols. We ensure social distancing at places of gathering. We have marked circles on floors and made face masks mandatory,” said DG (Tihar) Sandeep Goel. He added that there is no immediate relief that can be possible in jails but they are managing the situation with the available resources. A ticking bomb “Inmates above 60 years of age and with comorbidities have to undergo daily health screening. A team of doctors inspect the ward and monitor their oxygen level and body temperature. For other inmates, we monitor their health and randomly check their body temperature,” said Mr. Goel. A doctor who wished not to be named said that overcrowded prisons in Delhi are a ticking bomb and could cause a disaster. Social distancing is the only way to break the chain of infection and in such congested spaces it can never be followed. The government should come up with more options for the safety of inmates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rising-virus-cases-pose-fresh-trial-for-prisons/article34293395.ece

I hope that the PM will take opinions [from Mr. Kejriwal]. Every 15 days, Mr. Kejriwal should be called for tea and discuss what model can be done for country’s development, which schemes can be done better for common man’s benefits and economy,” Mr. Sisodia said during a press conference. Election campaigns He claimed that election campaigns by the BJP and Congress are now based on the “Arvind Kejriwal model of governance”. “Recently, when Home Minister Amit Shah was campaigning in West Bengal, he promised free electricity up to 200 units should the BJP be elected to power. In Kerala, the BJP has promised free public transport for women, and in Tamil Nadu, the party has said that it will bring in a model of governance that is similar to what can be seen in Delhi,” Mr. Sisodia said. “This proves that Mr. Kejriwal is the only leader with a vision for the nation, he understands the pulse of the people, and knows what is required to push the people and the nation ahead. He is the only leader with the administrative will to walk the talk,” said the senior Aam Aadmi Party leader. Mr. Sisodia added that the PM had recognised the relevance of home isolation and creating micro-containment zones to combat the spread of COVID-19, and went on to claim that both ideas had come from Delhi.

11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Police rescue seven-month-old in dramatic operation||When the kidnapper along with the seven-month-old boy was 800 metres away from the police, the officers lost his location and were about to lose him. They, however, decided to take a risk and ended up successful. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) Parvinder Singh said that around 1.30 p.m. on Friday, Outer Delhi’s Ranhola police station received a call stating that their seven-month-old son had been kidnapped by their tenant and that the accused was asking for a ransom of Rs. 40 lakh. Came to play with child A police team, including Station House Officer Inspector Vimal reached the caller’s house where they met the child’s mother Shivi Kaushik. She told the police that Priyanshu Kumar, a computer engineer, has been staying on the second floor of their residential building on rent for the last two months. On Friday, he came around 11.30 a.m. and said he wanted to play with her son and when she told him that the child was sleeping, he decided to wait. An hour later, when the child woke up, he immediately picked him up and when the mother went out of the room, Priyanshu escaped with the child. Ms. Kaushik informed her husband, Sidhartha Kaushik, who is a pharmacist working in a company in Okhla. Around the same time, Priyanshu called Mr. Kaushik and told him to transfer Rs. 40 lakh and cooperate. He also said that he would harm the child if they approached the police. The family, however, was firm that they wanted to get police help. Operation lasted 7 hours The police registered the case and began the operation which lasted nearly seven hours. Additional DCP Sudhanshu Dhama took the lead and stayed with the family throughout. Recalling the stressful and dramatic operation, Mr. Dhama said that the main aim for the team was to keep the accused engaged and gain his trust. “Till the very end, he had no knowledge that the police were involved. He was also switching off his phone for a few minutes every now and then. His phone had to remain switched on for us to track him,” he said. Gain kidnapper’s trust Mr. Dhama continued to chat with the accused on messages using the father’s phone. “I used the father’s phone and gained his trust, particularly telling him that the police wasn’t being involved. I asked him questions about the child. I also told him not to come near Mohan Garden and to stay away from the police,” the officer said. Another tactic used by them was to transfer money to him. A total of Rs. 40,000 were transferred to his account. Mr. Singh said that a team was constantly tracking his location. He first walked about 4 km towards Uttam Nagar from where he took a cab to Pandav Nagar, went to Anand Vihar and then took another cab to Vasundhara. He then went to Vaishali and then came towards Delhi again. He also withdrew transferred money at one point. Around 4.30 p.m., he hired a cab in which he remained till the end. Lost track The police said that he took the cab towards Aerocity and Mehram Nagar as well and that’s when they felt he could try to leave the city too. The police started sweet talking him into coming to Lajwanti Chowk. “But 800 metres from his cab, we lost his location. At that point, he was also getting anxious and said that he was going to harm the child. His father started crying. We took a risk and calculated at what point he would reach the junction and hoped that the signal turned red so he could be intercepted,” Mr. Dhama said. But, to their misfortune, they could only trace him again when he was 140 metres away from them and had crossed the red light. The police, all of them in civil dress, intercepted the car and rescued the child. Priyanshu managed to flee. He was, however, arrested six hours later with the help of technical intelligence. During interrogation, he allegedly told the police that he is a BTech degree holder and graduated in 2018. He was currently doing apprenticeship in Sahibabad. He allegedly told the police that he has a girlfriend in Kanpur and he needs to meet her demands for which he constantly needs money. He decided to kidnap the child and ask for Rs. 40 lakh ransom so he could settle with her in Kanpur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-rescue-seven-month-old-in-dramatic-operation/article34293391.ece
11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP protests against AAP’s ‘anti-farmer attitude’||Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Saturday held a demonstration outside the residence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to protest against the “anti-farmers attitude” of the AAP government. It demanded that the government should fulfil the promise for 50% bonus over and above the MSP in Delhi. Members of the Delhi Pradesh BJP Kisan Morcha and BJP MLAs participated in the protest and said that it was a “failure” of the Delhi government’s Agriculture Department to verify the documents of the farmers that forced them to sell their produce below the MSP being offered by the Central government. Mr. Bidhuri said that Chief Minister had claimed that it had implemented the Swaminathan Committee report in Delhi and the farmers were being provided 50% bonus over and above the MSP of wheat. However, at present, the MSP declared by the Central government is Rs. 1,975 per quintal and the 50% bonus comes to Rs. 987.50 per quintal and this should be paid to the farmers immediately. The BJP demanded that the Chief Minister immediately issue instructions to the Agriculture Department and direct them to start verification of documents of the farmers so that they are able to sell their produce to the FCI at the MSP announced the Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-protests-against-aaps-anti-farmer-attitude/article34293387.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Thakur said that the accused has been identified as Samir Arvind Parekh, a labour contractor and a resident of Guwahati. The police said that a woman approached them and said that she runs a food home delivery service from Chattarpur. In the first week of March, she saw an online job advertisement for the position of a chef. She contacted the person concerned who offered her $2,000 salary to work as a chef at a restaurant in the U.S.. She and her business partner deposited Rs. 36,000 each as registration fee for the same as demanded by the man. Later, when they tried contacting him, the phone number was found to be switched off. During probe, bank statements of the beneficiary accounts were obtained and analysed which led them to the accused who was arrested on April 7 from West Bengal. It was revealed that he has cheated 25 people and he and his accomplices contacted victims online and promised to provide them job abroad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-held-for-duping-people-over-fake-jobs/article34293388.ece
11 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘FCI wheat counters to be opened in Narela mandi’||Agriculture Minister Gopal Rai on Saturday said that taking cognisance of the demands of farmers, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is going to set up wheat procurement counters in Narela mandi from Monday. “After a joint meeting with senior officials of the FCI today, it has been decided that their counters will be set up from Monday which will facilitate wheat procurement at MSP rates. Setting up of counters will help farmers in a way that their time will be saved, they will be saved from the long and tedious process of registration and won’t be forced to run from pillar to post to sell their crops,” Mr. Rai said. On Friday, responding to allegation by Mr. Rai, the FCI had said that they have opened procurement counters in Food Storage Depot (FSD) in Narela, which is only a few metres from the Narela mandi and shared photos and videos of wheat procured. “The FCI has opened centres at Najafgarh mandi, Food Storage Depot, Narela, and Food Storage Depot, Mayapuri which are fully functional from April 1. FSD Narela is adjacent to APMC Narela mandi, hardly a few metres away from the main gate of the mandi ,” the FCI said on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fci-wheat-counters-to-be-opened-in-narela-mandi/article34293389.ece

The High Court on Friday had directed the Superintendent of the referral hospital here to constitute a Board of three medical experts and examine the minor girl and go for medical termination of pregnancy “at the very earliest” if the Board suggests so, without waiting for any court orders. “The process of MTP has already begun as per the suggestion of a three-member Medical Board”, informed the Hospital superintendent Prof Lucy Das on Saturday afternoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rape-survivor-terminates-pregnancy-in-23rd-week/article34293334.ece
11 April 2021||Lucknow,||SP to form outfit named after Bhimrao Ambedkar||In an apparent bid to widen its electoral base, the Samajwadi Party on Saturday decided to set up ‘Babasaheb Vahini’, a party-affiliated outfit after Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar’s name. SP president Akhilesh Yadav announced the decision to form the outfit on the occasion of Dr. Ambedkar’s birth anniversary on April 14, in a tweet, saying it will have units at the levels of the country, various States and their districts. “In order to keep the thoughts and ideas of Babasaheb Ambedkar active, remove the disparity and injustice and move towards an equitable social justice, we pledge to form ‘Babasaheb Vahini’ on the birth anniversary of Ambedkar [April 14],” the SP chief said in a tweet in Hindi. The outfit “will work in the districts, States and the country”, he added. Two days ago, Akhilesh Yadav had urged people to observe “Dalit Diwali”, saying, “In the dark [ Amavasya ] period of BJP’s politics, the Constitution, which gave a new light to independent India, is in danger.” “Hence, the SP will celebrate the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar as ‘Dalit Diwali’ in Uttar Pradesh, the country and abroad,” he had added. If the SP is embracing the followers of Ambedkar, why should the BJP and Congress have problems?” Mr. Yadav said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sp-to-form-outfit-named-after-bhimrao-ambedkar/article34293810.ece
11 April 2021||Ludhiana/Chandigarh,||Arhtiyas withdraw strike, wheat purchase starts in Punjab||A few hours after going on a Statewide strike against the Centre’s direction to the State government to transfer the minimum support price of farmers’ crops directly to their bank accounts, ‘Arhtiyas’ in Punjab on Saturday withdrew their strike. The Arhtiyas or commission agents withdrew their strike after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh assured them that they would remain an integral part of the procurement system. Earlier during the day, around 40,000 Arhtiyas across the State had gone on strike to protest against the direct benefit transfer (DBT) of the minimum support price (MSP) to farmers for their crops, bypassing them. The decision to call off the strike was taken by Arhtiyas after their leader Vijay Kalra, under the banner of the Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, held a meeting with Punjab Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in Ludhiana. After the commission agents announced the rollback of the strike, wheat procurement kicked off in the State. In Chandigarh, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ordered various steps to ensure Arhtiyas continued involvement in the process. The State Food Department has amended the procurement software so that the Arhtiyas continue to be involved in the process of release of payments to farmers, albeit in a modified manner with farmers getting their payments in their bank accounts within 48 hours, as mandated by the State government, an official statement said. A senior Food Department official said the commission agents will come to know how much payment is being released to farmers who are linked to them. Declaring his unequivocal commitment to safeguarding the interests of Punjab’s Arhtiyas, the State Chief Minister said that despite the government of India’s directives to exclude them from MSP payments, “the Arhtiyas shall always be associated with the procurement”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/arhtiyas-withdraw-strike-wheat-purchase-starts/article34293335.ece
11 April 2021||Mumbai,||Centre’s distribution of vaccines, medical kits biased, says Chavan||Senior Maharashtra Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan on Saturday accused the BJP-led Central government of indulging in lopsided, politically-biased distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and critical medical equipment such as PPE kits, N95 masks and ventilators in the country. Mr. Chavan said, “Maharashtra has the highest COVID-19 case load, but we are facing step-motherly treatment from the Central government in the supply of vaccines, according to the State Health Minister. This is not limited to the distribution of vaccines, but as per a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the government has given details of the quantities of critical medical equipment supplied to each State as of February 10. If we project the total quantity supplied over the patient case load in each State, we get a shocking picture.” Mr. Chavan said as per the reply in the Lok Sabha, Gujarat received 9,623 N95 masks per 1,000 patients, while Maharashtra received just 1,560 masks. “Even Uttar Pradesh received 3,916 masks, more than twice than that of Maharashtra. Gujarat got 4,951 PPE kits per 1,000 patients, Uttar Pradesh got 2,446 kits and Maharashtra just 223 kits,” he said. Gujarat was given 13 ventilators per 1,000 patients, U.P. seven, Maharashtra two and Kerala got even fewer ventilators. He said, “In all categories, Gujarat received the lion’s share of medical equipment, which was disproportionate to the case load.” Mr. Chavan said the Prime Minister seemed to be forgetting that he was the PM of the entire country and not just Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and other BJP-ruled States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/centres-distribution-of-vaccines-medical-kits-biased-says-chavan/article34293339.ece

Their plea for default bail was rejected by special judge Abhijeet Nandgoankar on April 8, and a detailed copy of the order was made available on Friday. The duo was arrested on January 23 by the Enforcement Directorate and are currently lodged in Arthur Road jail. They filed for default bail on the ground that the probe agency had not filed its charge sheet within the mandatory 60 days from the date of their remand. Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, appearing for ED, said the charge sheet was filed on March 19. The court, after perusal of documents, found that the charge sheet was filed within the statutory period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pmc-bank-scam-bail-pleas-of-viva-group-md-ca-rejected/article34293336.ece
11 April 2021||Nagpur,||Nagpur hospital blaze: woman patient among 4 dead; 2 critical||A fire that broke out at a private hospital in Nagpur has claimed the lives of four patients — one woman and three men — and also left two other patients critical, officials said on Saturday. The fire erupted on Friday night in the ICU ward of the four-storey Well Treat Hospital, in Wadi area of the city. Officials said it was a non-COVID-19 facility and 31 patients were under treatment, with 10 of them in the ICU, when the incident occurred at 8.10 p.m. “Four patients died in the fire. One of them had probably died before the blaze, but there were burn marks on the body. Whether the death was caused due to the fire would be clear only after the post-mortem,” said Nagpur Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar. “Two people are in a critical condition,” he said. Chief fire officer of Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Rajendra Uchake, said the blaze had erupted in an AC unit of the ICU located on the second floor of the hospital. “The fire remained confined to that floor and did not spread further as the hospital staff used extinguishers to douse the flames before the fire tenders reached the spot,” he said. There were 10 patients undergoing treatment in the ICU at that time, he said, adding that while six of them managed to come out of the ward on their own following the blaze, four others, who were rescued, later died. Smoke had engulfed the ICU, Mr. Uchake said, adding the fire was brought under control by 9.30 p.m. A 44-year-old woman patient and three male patients, including a 69-year-old man, died in the incident, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nagpur-hospital-blaze-woman-patient-among-4-dead-2-critical/article34293337.ece
11 April 2021||Nagpur,||RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat tests positive, hospitalised||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has been admitted to a private hospital in Nagpur after testing positive for COVID-19, the RSS said. Senior leader and former RSS general secretary Suresh ‘Bhaiyaji’ Joshi also tested positive for the novel coronavirus and is currently quarantined, a functionary said on Saturday. Mr. Joshi, 73, had tested positive a few days ago, he added. The health condition of Mr. Bhagwat, 70, is stable and all his vital parameters are normal, the hospital where he is admitted said. Mr. Bhagwat has been showing common symptoms of the infection, the RSS said earlier in the day. “He is currently having common symptoms of COVID-19 and has been admitted to Kingsway Hospital in Nagpur. He is undergoing general check-up and caution,” the RSS tweeted. Mr. Bhagwat was admitted to the private hospital on Friday, hospital sources said. He is stable and under observation, they added. The medical bulletin said that CT scan of Mr. Bhagwat’s chest was done and all the necessary tests were performed. All his vital parameters are normal, it said. “He is maintaining the oxygen level without external support. His diabetic levels are maintained. He is able to perform the six-minute walk test in room air.

11 April 2021||Patna,||INTACH opposes plan for partial demolition of Khuda Bakhsh library||The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) leaders, intellectuals and academicians of Patna have opposed the “proposal” to partial demolish the 130-year-old Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library in Patna to make way for an elevated road. The government, though, said there was no plan to harm the heritage of the library. On Saturday the CPI-ML legislators and leaders Sudama Prasad, Sandip Saurabh, Santosh Sahar, Kamlesh Sharma and Kumar Pravej visited Khuda Bakhsh library to take stock of the issue with library officials and public intellectuals. Earlier, a meeting was organised by party’s State secretary, Kunal, after which they demanded that the government withdraw its proposal. The INTACH, and public intellectuals of Patna too had demanded that the government should not harm the heritage building of the library in the name of development and has written to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar with a request to explore other options for the elevation of road to ease traffic in the area. “In other places, governments restore heritage buildings and not demolish them. It must be understood that these heritage buildings do not belong to the current generation but to future generations,” J.K. Lal, chief of Patna chapter of INTACH said earlier. Former director of the library and eminent historian Imtiyaz Ahmad has expressed “shock and deep concern” over the government proposal. The present director of the library, Shayesta Bedar, said if any portion of the library is taken over, “the essential elegance of the century-old library and its hoary past would be obliterated.” The Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library, opened in 1891, is located on the banks of river Ganga and has a rare and rich collection of Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit manuscripts and books. The library has a reading hall named after Lord Curzon who had visited it in 1903 and was impressed with its rich collection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/intach-cpi-ml-oppose-move-to-demolish-khuda-bakhsh-library/article34293331.ece
11 April 2021||Tehran,||Iran unveils advanced nuclear centrifuges||Iran announced on Saturday it has started up advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges in a breach of its undertakings under a troubled 2015 nuclear deal, days after the start of talks on rescuing the accord. The United States had said on Friday that it had offered “very serious” ideas on reviving the accord but was waiting for Tehran to reciprocate, something Saturday’s move signally failed to do. President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated the three cascades of 164 IR-6 centrifuges, 30 IR-5 and another 30 IR-6 devices at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment plant in a ceremony broadcast by state television. The television aired no images of the injection of uranium hexafluoride gas into the cascades, but broadcast a link with engineers at the plant who said they had started the process. Iran’s latest move to step up uranium enrichment follows an opening round of talks in Vienna Tuesday with representatives of the remaining parties to the nuclear deal on bringing the U.S. back into it. Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 but his successor Joe Biden has said he is ready to return, arguing the deal had been successful in dramatically scaling back Iran’s nuclear activities. The Vienna talks are focused not only on lifting crippling economic sanctions Trump reimposed, but also on bringing Iran back into compliance after it responded by suspending several of its own commitments. All sides said the talks, in which Washington is not participating directly but has the European Union as intermediary, had got off to a good start. Iran wants curbs lifted Iran has demanded that the United States first lift all sanctions imposed by Trump, which include a sweeping unilateral ban on its oil exports, before it falls back in line with obligations it suspended. The “U.S. — which caused this crisis — should return to full compliance first,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet, adding that “Iran will reciprocate following rapid verification.” Washington has demanded movement from Tehran in return. “The United States team put forward a very serious idea and demonstrated a seriousness of purpose on coming back into compliance if Iran comes back into compliance,” a U.S. official told reporters as talks broke for the weekend. But the official said the U.S. was waiting for its efforts to be “reciprocated” by Iran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-unveils-advanced-nuclear-centrifuges/article34293013.ece
11 April 2021||Washington,||U.S. Congress advances slavery reparation proposals||U.S. lawmakers next Wednesday will consider a Bill to study paying reparations to descendants of enslaved people, which could open the door for a potential vote on an issue that has gained momentum in recent years. On April 14, the House Judiciary Committee will hold the first-ever markup — the process by which committees debate and amend legislation — on a Bill that creates a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for Black people. Friday’s announcement comes during the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is accused of killing Black man George Floyd, whose death triggered nationwide protests highlighting the country’s racial injustice. The Bill was first introduced more than 30 years ago but never advanced. It addresses the period of slavery and discrimination in the U.S. from 1619 to the present day, and will propose remedies including financial reparations. “The historic markup of HR 40 is intended to continue a national conversation about how to confront the brutal mistreatment of African Americans during chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and the enduring structural racism that remains endemic to our society today,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said. Americans still face racial disparities in access to education, health care, housing, employment and other social provisions, he added. President Joe Biden has repeatedly addressed the need to end systemic racism, and the White House has expressed support for the Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-congress-advances-slavery-reparation-proposals/article34293020.ece
11 April 2021||London,||Prince Philip honoured with gun salutes, funeral on April 17||Military teams across the U.K. and on ships at sea fired 41-gun salutes on Saturday to mark the death of Prince Philip, honouring the former naval officer and husband of Queen Elizabeth II. Batteries in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast — the capitals of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom — as well as other cities around the U.K. and the Mediterranean outpost of Gibraltar fired the volleys at one-minute intervals beginning at mid-day. Ships, including HMS Montrose , a frigate patrolling the Persian Gulf, offered their own salutes. Prince Philip, who was also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, died on Friday at Windsor Castle, two months before his 100th birthday. Closed to public Members of the Commonwealth were also invited to honour Prince Philip. The Australian Defense Force began its salute outside Parliament House in Canberra, and New Zealand planned to offer its tribute on Sunday. Buckingham Palace officials said Prince Philip’s funeral will take place April 17 at Windsor Castle in a family service that will be closed to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/prince-philip-honoured-with-gun-salutes-funeral-on-april-17/article34293018.ece
11 April 2021||Yangon,||At least 80 killed in Myanmar as UN envoy calls for ‘action’||Reports emerged on Saturday of more than 80 killed in the latest bloodletting by Myanmar’s military, as the country’s own Ambassador to the United Nations called for “strong action” against the junta. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in February, with protesters refusing to submit to the junta and demanding a return to democracy. After over two months of military rule, efforts to verify deaths and confirm news of crackdowns have been greatly curtailed by the junta’s throttling of mobile data — shunting most of the population into an information blackout. “Your collective, strong action is needed immediately,” Myanmar’s Ambassador to the UN Kyaw Moe Tun told a Security Council meeting on Friday, proposing a no-fly zone, an arms embargo and more targeted sanctions against members of the military. “Please, please take action,” he said. Details of a brutal crackdown in the city of Bago, 65 km northeast of Yangon took a full day to emerge, as residents told AFP of continued violence from the junta which pushed them to flee to nearby villages. By Saturday evening, the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners — a local monitoring group tracking deaths — confirmed “over 80 anti-coup protesters were killed by security forces in Bago on Friday”. Footage shot early on Friday showed protesters hiding behind sandbag barricades wielding homemade rifles, as explosions could be heard in the background. Authorities had refused to let rescue workers near the bodies, said a resident. “They piled up all the dead bodies, loaded them into their army truck and drove it away,” he said. State-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Saturday blamed the crackdown on “rioters”, and reported only one dead. Creative protests The violence in Bago will add to AAPP’s current death toll of 618 civilians killed since the coup. The junta has a far lower number — 248, according to a spokesman on Friday — and has branded the victims as “violent terrorist people”. Despite the daily bloodshed, protesters have continued to take to the streets, with demonstrators manifesting their discontent in pointedly creative ways. In Yangon, crimson paint — representing the blood already spilled — was splashed across the streets in view of the historic Shwedagon Pagoda. “Let us unite and boldly show in red that the dictatorial regime will not be allowed to rule us at all,” a student activist announced on Facebook.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/at-least-80-killed-in-myanmar-as-un-envoy-calls-for-action/article34293010.ece

He also planted a tree at Ramu Cantonment in Cox’s Bazar to commemorate the everlasting friendship between the two Armies. Gen. Naravane, who is in Dhaka on a five-day official tour, visited the 10 Infantry Division of the Bangladesh Army. Troops demonstration “General MM Naravane #COAS visited 10 Infantry Division & interacted with the Officers of #BangladeshArmy.

Ramu cantonment is the headquarters of the 10th Infantry Division of the Bangladesh Army. Gen. Naravane on Friday paid tribute to Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman by visiting the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhaka. Strengthening ties The visit of Mr. Naravane, who is here at the invitation of his Bangladeshi counterpart, Gen. Aziz Ahmed, comes less than two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to the neighbouring country and met the top leadership here to strengthen the strategic ties.

11 April 2021||Marib,||Toll mounts as battle for Yemen’s Marib heats up||Fighting for the key Yemeni region of Marib has intensified, with 53 pro-government and Houthi rebel fighters killed in the past 24 hours, loyalist military officials said on Saturday. The Houthis have been trying to seize oil-rich Marib, the government’s last significant pocket of territory in the north, since February. “The rebels have managed to seize a bit of territory” in the latest fighting northwest of the city, a pro-government military source said, assessing the city of Marib itself was not under threat. The same source said 22 government soldiers including five officers had been killed, along with 31 rebels. The Houthis rarely announce casualties on their own side. The Iran-backed rebels in late 2014 overran the capital Sanaa. That prompted a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in March 2015 to prop up the government. Loyalist military officials said on Saturday that coalition aircraft had carried out strikes against the rebels, but the Houthis had pushed on with their offensive. The loss of Marib could lead to humanitarian disaster as huge numbers of civilians displaced from fighting elsewhere have sought refuge in Marib camps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/toll-mounts-as-battle-for-yemens-marib-heats-up/article34293011.ece
11 April 2021||Islamabad,||We’ve never shied away from talks, says Pakistan||Pakistan on Friday stopped short of categorically denying its involvement in some kind of backchannel talks with India though Islamabad has been insisting publicly that New Delhi should create an “enabling environment” for “meaningful dialogue”. Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry at the weekly press briefing was asked by several journalists about reported backchannel talks with India. Instead of rejecting it outrightly, he said: “States have their ways and means to communicate which remain available even during wars. Therefore, whether any talks are taking place between India and Pakistan is not important.” “As for talks, Pakistan has never shied away from talks with India...,” Mr. Chaudhry said. “India has vitiated the atmosphere, and the onus is on India to create an enabling and conducive environment for talks between the two countries,” he said. In New Delhi, asked about media reports that backchannel talks between India and Pakistan were going on for more than a year, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi did not give a direct reply. “If you talk about channels of communication on this issue, let me just recall that our respective high commissions exist and are functioning. So that is a very effective channel of communication,” Mr. Bagchi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/weve-never-shied-away-from-talks-says-pakistan/article34293015.ece
11 April 2021||Riyadh,||Saudi Arabia executes 3 soldiers for ‘high treason’||Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed three soldiers for “high treason”, the Defence Ministry said, in a rare public announcement that accused them of colluding with an unspecified enemy. The executions come as a Saudi-led military campaign intensifies in neighbouring Yemen and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, consolidates his grip on power. The soldiers were convicted of “the crime of high treason in cooperation with the enemy” in a way that threatens the kingdom, the Ministry said. The statement named the three soldiers — Mohammed bin Ahmed, Shaher bin Issa and Hamoud bin Ibrahim — without identifying which enemy they were accused of aiding. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni powerhouse, views Shiite Iran as its main regional foe and identifies Yemen’s Tehran-aligned Houthi rebels as a major security threat to the oil-rich kingdom. The statement makes a rare announcement of military executions in the kingdom, which is known to be highly secretive about its armed forces. “The fact that the names of the decedents were publicised means the Saudis must consider their alleged misconduct to be exceptionally egregious and thus worthy of exemplary punishment,” David Des Roches, from the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/saudi-arabia-executes-3-soldiers-for-high-treason/article34293016.ece

But today, the diplomat finds herself facing the same predicament. Along with two other colleagues, Ms. Kalyar, who holds the rank of third secretary at the Embassy, has joined a civil disobedience movement against the junta that ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in February. “”At the beginning of February, I despaired of the coup, whereas since 2015 Myanmar was on the right track,” said Ms. Kalyar. “History was repeating itself. “I decided to do something,” added the 49-year-old diplomat. “We have to take part in that movement to overtake the coup.” Ms. Kalyar, who as a high school student in 1988, took part in protests against the then military regime. She said on March 4, she and two colleagues joined the movement and posted on Facebook a message of support to the protests back home. Less than a week later, the trio were fired and their passports withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/berlin-envoy-takes-stand-against-junta/article34293014.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||China slaps $2.8 bn fine on Ma’s Alibaba||China’s regulators have imposed a record $2.78 billion fine on the Alibaba Group, capping a months-long probe into the e-commerce giant’s dealings and troubles with the government that had raised questions about the future of its billionaire founder Jack Ma. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in December announced an antitrust probe weeks after a record $37 billion IPO from the Ant Group, the group’s financial payments arm, was suspended at the last minute. Ma’s critical remarks The suspension followed sharp comments from Mr. Ma criticising China’s financial system, and a broader tug-of-war with the authorities over Alibaba’s amassing of consumer data, which regulators felt gave it an unfair advantage over its rivals. On Saturday, the SAMR said it had levied an 18.23 billion yuan ($2.78 billion) fine on the Alibaba Group “for indulging in a monopolistic act of abusing its dominant market position”, state broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) reported. ‘Stop illegal activities’ The notice from the SAMR “ordered the group to stop illegal activities and imposed a fine of 4% on its 2019 domestic sales of 455.71 billion yuan ($69.57 billion), totalling 18.23 billion yuan ($2.78 billion)”, CGTN reported, adding that the regulator “concluded from a four-month investigation that Alibaba has been abusing its market dominance since 2015 by prohibiting merchants from opening stores or participating in promotional activities on other competitive platforms.” Alibaba’s “one out of two” requirement, which required users of the platform to not use rival merchants’ services, had “hurt consumers’ interests”, the SAMR said, adding that the policy “hinders competition in China’s services market involving online retail platforms, impedes the free flow of goods, services and resources, and infringes the legitimate rights and interests of merchants on the platform as well as the interests of consumers.” ‘Exclusive dealing’ The SAMR said the group had “abused its dominant market position” and “also used market forces, platform rules, data, algorithms and other technical means to ensure the implementation of the exclusive dealing agreement”. Alibaba in a statement said it “accepts the penalty with sincerity and will ensure its compliance with determination.” Mr. Ma has kept a low profile even as the group said it would cooperate fully with the authorities as they conducted the probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/china-slaps-28-bn-fine-on-mas-alibaba/article34292983.ece

11 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Rapid growth of e-sports spurs calls for regulatory framework||The electronic sports (e-sports) segment needs a governing framework for harnessing its full potential, say industry officials. The demand comes in the backdrop of the segment recording rapid growth in recent years with the sports headed to the Asian Games and probably, the Olympics. As per a KPMG report, the revenue of the online gaming market, of which e-sports is a part, may touch Rs. 11,880 crore in FY23 with hundreds of firms, content developers and millions of players fuelling its growth. “The proliferation of affordable smartphones, high-speed Internet and falling data prices are the primary catalysts for this rapid growth,” KPMG said. Self-regulation “e-Sports is going to evolve in a multifold fashion,” said Bimal Julka, chairman, Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports. “There should be a self-regulatory framework to govern them. “The Fantasy Sports Regulatory Authority has been formed with eminent people coming on board. We are trying to bring various bodies under one umbrella as we understand what kind of innovations and creativity we need to have,” he said. “The biggest challenge is how to regulate different federations because their memorandum deeds must be different and it will take time to streamline and bring in transparency,” said Vinod Kumar Varma, president, Indian Sports Federation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rapid-growth-of-e-sports-spurs-calls-for-regulatory-framework/article34292986.ece

On November 4, it had approved a Rs. 320-crore investment. “The increase in capex is mainly owing to the inclusion of 20 KLPD of extra-neutral alcohol, higher storage capacity for raw material and finished goods, sharp rise in steel prices and change in design of equipment,” it said.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Dhawan and Shaw pulverise CSK, power DC to victory||Suresh Raina marked his return with a trademark fifty. All-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran reprised their exploits from the United Arab Emirates. And Moeen Ali made a significant contribution with the willow on his Chennai Super Kings debut. Still, such was the onslaught of the Delhi Capitals opening combination that it chased down a target of 189 without any fuss to begin its campaign on a high. Despite an impressive batting performance, CSK couldn’t get its bowling act right on a belter of a pitch at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium. The PowerPlay turned out to be the difference between the sides. DC, with a new captain in Rishabh Pant, dominated the first six overs in both the halves, which proved decisive. After electing to field, despite missing last year’s new-ball bruisers, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, the DC pacers restricted CSK to a meagre 33 for two in the first six. Avesh Khan, preferred over veteran Ishant Sharma, justified his presence and Chris Woakes made his DC debut count as the duo got rid of openers Faf du Plessis and Ruturaj Gaikwad. In the latter half, it was DC’s opening batsmen who dominated the proceedings to virtually seal the fate of the game. While Shikhar Dhawan (85, 54b, 10x4, 2x6) continued his silken touch, Prithvi Shaw (72, 38b, 9x4, 3x6) resumed from where he left off in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. While Dhawan drove and cut with panache, Shaw showed that he had altered a technique that was exposed during the IPL and the opening Test in Australia last year, and played closer to the body. With the left- and right-handed combination finding gaps at will with pristine strokeplay, captain M.S. Dhoni was rendered helpless. To make matters worse, CSK didn’t support its bowlers, with substitute Mitchell Santner and Gaikwad dropping Shaw in the deep. Even after Shaw succumbed to Dwayne Bravo’s change of pace in the 14th over, Dhawan upped the ante to ensure the game was all but over when Shardul Thakur trapped him in front of the wicket, with more than three overs remaining. Dhawan’s classy innings thus overshadowed the effort of CSK’s left-handed quadruple with the bat. While Raina and Moeen started the onslaught by going after experienced spinners R. Ashwin and Amit Mishra, Jadeja and Sam Curran, who won the mini-battle against elder brother Tom (on debut for DC), ended the innings on a high. In the end, it wasn’t enough.  He [Pant] kept his calm, kept motivating the boys and made good changes Shikhar Dhawan on Pant’s captaincy   Suresh Raina (at No. 4) was in an aggressive role. It's a real positive sign for the team Stephen Fleming CSK coach||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhawan-and-shaw-pulverise-csk-power-dc-to-victory/article34292973.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Past champions will battle it out in an early test of strength||After failing to make the playoffs in the last two editions, two-time champion Kolkata Knight Riders will hope to start well against 2016 winner Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Sunday. The team has had some issues with its batting order in recent years, and midway through the last season, Eoin Morgan took over as captain from Dinesh Karthik. The England white-ball skipper will now have the opportunity to implement his ideas from the beginning.  KKR managed some crucial signings in the auction. The return of Shakib Al Hasan gives the side significantly better balance, especially when he slots in alongside the explosive Andre Russell, another multidimensional cricketer. The Sunil Narine experiment at the top of the order has run its course. A lot rides on whether Rahul Tripathi or Nitish Rana can set the tone with established opener Shubman Gill. With the ball, the team has a balanced attack. Pat Cummins and Prasidh Krishna head the pace department, while the spin of Shakib and Varun Chakravarthy, if he is fit, could be more than handy at Chepauk. In SRH, KKR faces the best bowling side in the competition, especially with the return of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who excelled against England recently. Sandeep Sharma and T. Natarajan add to a strong seam attack, while leg-spinner Rashid Khan is one of the most lethal game-changers in T20 cricket. The team’s only area of concern will be the performance of Indian all-rounders Abdul Samad and Vijay Shankar. The duo will be called upon to shoulder the finishing duties with the bat and contribute to the fifth bowler’s quota if the team wants to play both Jonny Bairstow and Kane Williamson ahead of Jason Holder. The wicket on Friday was two-paced, and SRH, with its potent bowling attack, will feel it has an edge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/past-champions-will-battle-it-out-in-early-test-of-strength/article34292968.ece
11 April 2021||Augusta,||Zalatoris, Harman close the gap||Top-ranked defending champion Dustin Johnson has more time to prepare for next week's US PGA Heritage Classic than he really wanted after missing the cut at the 85th Masters on Friday. Four-time Major winner Rory McIlroy also failed to reach the weekend for only the second time in 13 trips to Augusta National. Four-time Major champion Brooks Koepka, who battled to play after right knee surgery a month ago, also failed to make the cut. Koepka and Johnson both shot 75 to finish five-over 149, while McIlroy was 150 after a closing 74. Meanwhile, Justin Rose squandered a four-shot advantage, then birdied three of the last six holes to seize a one-stroke lead after the second round. The 40-year-old Englishman overcame a nightmare start to fire a level par 72 and stand on seven-under 137. Will Zalatoris, who could become the first Masters debutant winner since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979, and Brian Harman shared second on 138. Zalatoris birdied the last three holes to shoot 68 and likely put himself in Saturday's last group, while Harman birdied 17 and 18 to shoot 69. American Matthew Wolff was disqualified for returning an incorrect scorecard.  Top scores: 137: Justin Rose 65, 72; 138: Will Zalatoris 70, 68, Brian Harman 69, 69; 139: Marc Leishman 72, 67, Jordan Spieth 71, 68.

11 April 2021||Manchester,||Dallas helps Leeds stun Man City||Manchester City suffered just a fourth Premier League defeat of the season as 10-man Leeds United shocked the runaway leader, thanks to Stuart Dallas’ double in a 2-1 win at the Etihad on Saturday. Cooper sees red Dallas opened the scoring three minutes before half-time, but hope of a famous win for Marcelo Bielsa’s men seemed to have disappeared when captain Liam Cooper was shown a straight red card in first-half stoppage time. The visitors withstood a City bombardment until Ferran Torres equalised 14 minutes from time. But Leeds still summoned the energy to pose a threat on the counter-attack and gained its reward when Dallas slotted below Ederson. Bielsa’s first win in five meetings against Pep Guardiola propels Leeds to ninth in its first season back in the English top flight for 16 years. City still enjoys a 14-point lead at the top of the Premier League.

11 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||A dream come true for me: Mashoor||Mashoor Shereef’s international debut lasted just two minutes. But those two minutes were the most cherished moments of Mashoor's career. Mashoor had dreamt of donning the Indian jersey from a young age. The Malappuram-born Mashoor came on as a substitute in the 88th minute in the international friendly against Oman. “It was a dream come true for me. I never expected the coach to send me so late in the match and it took some time for me to realise that I had fulfilled my dream,” said Mashoor. A few days later, Mashoor played his first full international match in the 0-6 loss to UAE. Rude awakening The heavy defeat was demoralising for the new look young Indian side and for Mashoor, it was a rude awakening. “Considering how little time we got to prepare, I think overall it was a good performance from us. We did very well to hold Oman to a draw. “But UAE was simply too good for us. Our coach completely changed the line-up and handed out international debuts to a few players. He told us not to worry about the result and just asked us to give our 100%. High standards “Personally for me the match against UAE was an eye-opener. I quickly realised that I still have a long way to go to reach international standards. I had played in the I-League and ISL and felt at home. But I struggled in my first international match as the standard was so high. I need to improve on my skills and fitness to play at the international level,”' said Mashoor. The 28-year-old defender came into the Indian team after capping a fine ISL season. He was central to NorthEast United mid-season surge that saw the side enter the semifinals. “I didn’t get many opportunities initially. But, when Khalid Jamil took over, he picked me in the starting eleven and gave me the freedom to express myself on the field. “I think I didn’t disappoint him and my consistent performance in ISL paved the way for my selection to the Indian team.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-dream-come-true-for-me-mashoor/article34292996.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Do a push-up||The push-up is an upper-body exercise that works on the pectoral muscles on our chest and triceps on our legs. “It is done keeping your head to toe in a straight line and primarily moving the elbow. Anyone who can hold a plank for a minute can easily start on a push-up,” says Arvind Ashok, co-founder, The Quad, Chennai. Getting the technique right is important for its efficacy. To do a standard push up, start by lying face down on the floor with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Raise your body off the floor by extending your arms. Make sure to keep your upper body and lower body in a straight line. Bring the body closer to the floor by bending your arms and repeat. “Grip the palm to the floor and squeeze the armpits together while doing it. If done wrong, it can cause cause strain on our joints and lead to injury,” he says. According to Prashanti Ganesh, co-founder and senior coach, Strength System, Chennai, the push-up is essentially a moving plank. “Here, the range of motion is more important than the number of reps and sets. Your body needs to be just an inch or so from the floor at the bottom of a push-up for it to count as a good rep,” she explains. Beginners can start the exercise with a low resistance version before moving on to a standard push-up. Push-ups in five easy steps:  Start with a wall push-up. Stand at about two feet from a wall. Extend your arms straight out in front of you. Your palms should touch the wall surface at about shoulder-level height and shoulder-width apart. The fingers must point toward the ceiling. Bend your elbows and lean your body toward the wall till your face almost touches it. Push back to the starting position; repeat.  Move on to high bench push-up . This can be done with the help of a kitchen counter top, or your dining table. Stand facing the counter-top. Place hands wider than shoulder-width on its surface. Move the feet back till the arms are perpendicular to the body. Lower chest by bending the arms and push the body up until arms are extended; repeat.  Bring the height down in lower bench push-up . Use an exercise bench or the stairs in your home to do this exercise. Stand facing the stairs and place your hands on the second step. Move your feet back till your body makes a straight line. Lower your body by bending your elbow and push back to original position; repeat.  Improve strength with negative push-ups . Lie down with your face down. Keep your hands wider than shoulder width and raise your body. Slowly descend by bending your elbow. Drop to your knees and push your torso up. Once there, straighten your leg and repeat.  Progress to knees push-up. Lie down on the floor face down, with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Bend your knees and raise your body by extending your arms. Use a pillow to reduce the pressure on your knees. Lower body to the floor by bending your arm and pushing it back up by extending the arm. Try this with one leg extended and once comfortable, move on to stretch both the legs keeping the forefeet on the floor to make a standard push up.  Supplementary exercises To do a standard push up, Arvind suggests these workouts to improve your upper body strength:  Planks: Lie on a mat with your hands under your shoulder. Place legs together and forefeet on floor. Raise by keeping your body in a straight line. Hold position till you can. Improve the time with each attempt. “Planks helps to tie our abdominal muscle to the rest of our body. Planks are a prerequisite in doing push-ups and help in improving strength and mobility,” he says.  Baby crawls: Stand on your knees and keep your hands wider than your shoulder. Keep your head up and move on your knees and hands. You feet should drag across the floor. Move in both forward and backward direction. This exercise helps our hips and shoulders to work together and also strengthen our overall body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/do-a-push-up/article34293328.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Pandemic features in apartment apps go into overdrive again||New features. New features made newer still. Old features languishing in “disuse-ville”, dusted and polished to a gleam. That is the three-part leitmotif wafting across the world of apartment-management apps. With the second wave raging on, communities are ‘rediscovering’ the value of certain features that demonstrated their usefulness during the first. Based on data from representatives of two apartment-management app service providers on how these features stacked up in the first wave and during the ongoing surge, here is piecing together a picture of “the all-time favourite features”, their patronage even expected to arch beyond the pandemic. Delivery feature With the pandemic as trigger, blood is suddenly rushing into options that had almost atrophied due to indifferent patronage over a sustained period of time. Ranjit Behara, head of marketing, MyGate, says “The ‘Leave at Gate’ in the delivery feature of MyGate suddenly shot into prominence. It was around in some form previously, but exercised sparingly. If someone was living alone, and not at home at the time of delivery, they might instruct via the app to leave the product at gate. That was about it. During the pandemic, it took centre stage, with many societies making it mandatory. In the first wave, it was well-utilised. Now, with this surge in cases, it is again being used in a big way. It will be always adapted to suit new situations.” Karnika Roy, marketing manager, brand and content, ADDA, weighs in: “During this pandemic, the In-house Delivery Hub option in ADDA is majorly useful as it cuts down on the entry of delivery personnel inside the premises. We had a parcel management feature before COVID-19. We took the feature, revamped it to suit the needs raised by the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, if a community does not want to give unrestricted access to delivery personnel, they can continue using this feature without any changes to it at all.” Staff feature  The pandemic has particularly thrown into bold relief, features relating to the management of support staff who help the cogwheels of the community turning. “At ADDA, residents can certainly see who are the people working within the community. The admin — represented by the management committee or the resident welfare association — has data about which staff is going to which flat, and how many flats this staff is visiting. We have tried to restrict the visibility a little, as we want all the residents also to have their own privacy. However, for the purposes of maintaining the management of the community, the admin have to know,” says Karnika. MyGate offers profiles of the domestic help and support staff for the entire community to see, says Ranjit. It provides residents with an idea of the flats in the community that a domestic help is working for. So, it puts residents in a position to seek help during exigencies, says Ranjit, adding that during a pandemic, together with the Home Quarantine feature, it enables residents to make informed choices while seeking any help. Shop at home  During the first wave, the feature that allows brands to wheel in their wares gained prominence, when residents started looking beyond just access to essentials. The situation is said to have also opened resident welfare associations’ eyes to the opportunities for growth that this feature brings with it. Says Karnika, “One thing we realised is that depending on their size, communities ended up spending anywhere from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 per month on sanitising their entire premises. RWAs are non-profit organisations and they were really struggling to get their funds. That is when we realised we could be connecting people, helping these communities get in touch with brands. We created a system where different types of brands — FMCG, apparel and gadgets, for example — would come to the community and have pop-up stores and a mobile van. Following COVID-19 protocols, residents can avail the services of these brands. It is a symbiotic relationship. The community earns some revenue that helps them cope with the COVID-19 experience. Secondly, the brands are also getting some business. They would stay for two to three days, or through a long weekend. From the ADDA part, we take care of the communication and promotion part of it.” On brands setting up shop in communities, Ranjit says, “That will keep on happening. Fashion, eateries, furniture — these are among areas in which brands look for establishing a connection with communities. During the pandemic, the demand has shot up. Many brands have reached out to MyGate to open some kind of pop-up shops.”  Comfort plus safety  Karnika underlines that pandemic-related features make it to the residents’ hot-favourites list, not always for their safety quotient, but also the comfort factor that may ride piggy-back on it. “Broadcast From Gate” on ADDA makes it to this list, reveals Karnika. The feature came in handy, particularly during the intense lockdowns, when vendors dealing in essentials wheeled into communities, day after day. The admin would notify the time to all residents via this feature. Accustomed to the comfort this feature promotes, Karnika says, residents have checked it into the post-pandemic cart.  We realised that depending on their size, communities ended up spending anywhere from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 per month on sanitising their entire premises||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/pandemic-features-in-apartment-apps-go-into-overdrive-again/article34293568.ece

At the Corporation-run park on Officers’ Colony Main Road in Mogappair, a huge cloth banner says ‘no face masks, no entry’. Together with the security guard at the facility, a few members of the Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents’ Welfare Association see to it that the rule is followed. As the RWA’s oversee the maintenance of the park, its members also ascertain that the facility is not overrun with people. “Unlike the playground in our neighbourhood, the park is a small public area and so, we can enforce the face mask rule there. Visitors to the park also understand its significance,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents’ Welfare Association. Members of the Association started the Officers’ Colony Park Users’ Club (OPUC) more than two decades ago. Volunteers of the club, who are mostly local residents, had been roped in for door-to-door campaign relating to civic issues, including garbage dumping, bad roads and street lights in their respective neighbourhoods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/mask-up-or-ship-out/article34293581.ece

They move one behind the other. The opening, created by the Chenglepet police, is meant for the pedestrians to cross the road. However, pedestrians find it difficult and unsafe while crossing the road through the opening. The rest of the barricades closes the open area between the medians to curb motorists from Kovalam Road, entering Rajiv Gandhi Salai, and vice-versa. “This section of the road is frequented by pedestrians However, their safety is compromised.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai resident sights two rare warblers at home on the same day||From this writer’s interactions with him, Chennai-based birder Sundaravel Palanivelu measures his words as carefully as a surveyor measures disputed land. One gets the sense of an internal machine turning and sifting through thoughts before elevating any of them to the dignity of speech. Even in his online interactions, he is an exemplar of brevity. So, when his sentences reach two-digit word lengths, the rare verbal extravagance is usually justified. Recently, he had had two bird sightings to discuss; and together, they were too remarkable to be kept laconic. The two sightings were barely separated by time and space. On the morning of April 3, he had seen a Large-billed Leaf Warbler and a Western Crowned Warbler. Passage migrants in these parts, these warblers are rarely recorded because of the narrow time-frame available to see them. (Entered in eBird, both sightings have been approved by the documentation-platform for avian observations). The highlight is that both showed up that morning at Sundaravel’s living space, SaiSurya Apartments in Pallikaranai. Sundaravel’s apartment roughly falls within the route for onward and reverse migration taken by both these warblers. Besides, Sundaravel’s homestead is within shouting distance from a section of the Pallikaranai Marsh. However, these factors do not detract from the rarity of the sightings. Here’s why. When this writer had earlier sought his views about these two warblers’ migration route and their occurrence-frequency, this is what ornithologist V. Santharam had to say: “The Western Crowned Warbler and Large billed Leaf Warbler are passage migrants: Both seem to be passing through the East Coast. These birds come to the Western Ghats; and some of them passing through Chennai would be heading to Sri Lanka. There are not many records of these birds; that is because they pass through a very narrow window of time. Their movements (on the onward migration) happen when NE monsoon has set in and so, not many people would be venturing out. In their reverse migration in March and April, relatively more people may see it. I have seen the Large-billed Leaf Warbler at GNP.” Calling the Western Crowned Warbler an eBird rarity, Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, eBird reviewer, was on the same page, concluding that while “South-western ghats is where the Western Crowned Warbler winters”, there is the probable explanation that a population of this warbler “passes through Chennai and the East Coast on the way to Sri Lanka.” With Sundaravel’s April 3, 2021 sighting of the Western Crowned Warbler being entered in eBird under the geographical category of Chennai district, it becomes the second photographic record of the bird in this region. On April 23, 2016, Vikas had a photographic record of the Western Crowned Warbler from the Guindy National Park. Santharam points out that with collation of eBird data, the movements of rarely-seen passage migrants can be better tracked, filling the gaps in the understanding of possible passage routes. Says the ornithologist: “Now, with eBird data you should be able to see the migratory pattern. If there are sufficient records, it should be possible to do mapping and animation-based depiction of bird movement.”  These birds come to the Western Ghats; and some of them passing through Chennai would be heading to Sri Lanka||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/chennai-resident-sights-two-rare-warblers-at-home-on-the-same-day/article34293586.ece

With the traffic wing, Jayachandran hops from bus to bus at the Broadway bus terminus, every day, and hands out masks to those seen not wearing one. Jayachandran, 53-years-old, can also be spotted at traffic junctions — particularly, Parrys Corner, RBI Subway, Muthuswamy Bridge, Kuralagam and Indian Bank — that come under his limits, encouraging motorists and pedestrians to wear face masks while in public places. “I always have a bag of face masks in the police patrol vehicle and distribute at least 100 masks every day. As a result of this intervention, people who would earlier not wear masks, never fail to do so now,” says Jayachandran.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A smart move||When Priya Ramkumar, a resident of Jains Sagarika in MRC Nagar, coordinated with the local Urban Primary Health Centre to organise a vaccination camp at the community, she expected enthusiastic participation. The PHC had informed Priya that a minimum of 100 people should sign up for it for them to come down with their team and an ambulance and run the camp. To Priya’s surprise, she could not line up that number. Response to an announcement at the apartment’s WhatsApp group, and door-to-door collection of data about interested residents was disheartening. The number proved elusive, but still Priya got the camp ready, hoping for a turnaround. On March 29, when the team arrived, the number shot up well past the 100 mark – nearly 110 took the jab. Priya and a few other residents including Sudha Gopal, Sunitha S and Harry Peters who coordinated the camp did something that had swung the scales. They had spoken to house maids, cooks, security staff and vendors at the apartment about the drive. Priya says through a friend at the neighbouring apartment, Lords, members of the its house-keeping staff who wanted to take the jab were also informed. That the Corporation team did not turn up on the planned day helped, as there was more time for organising the number. When the day arrived, the resident-volunteers accepted walk-ins, as the latter came prepared, with all the documents, and were eligible for vaccination. So, they could not bring themselves to turn them away. For instance, staff from a hotel next door walked in. Priya believes updates in apartment groups through the day, helped too. “We would keep posting photos after every 10 vaccinations — saying, ‘20 done’, ‘30 done’ and so on,” she says. Tokens were distributed to people and some were not waiting along with the others, so announcements were made in the group asking the respective token holder to come down as their turn neared. Similarly, photos of the oldest/ youngest/ 50th were shared. Some residents decided to get vaccinated just on the day, says Priya. The drive, she adds, benefited not only her community, but the whole street.

Vaidhyanathan’s mind. TANSI Nagar Welfare Association made it easier for this resident of Church Gate Avenue in Velachery. A week ago, at the vaccination camp organised by the Association with Greater Chennai Corporation, the Association communicated Vaidhyanathan’s situation to a GCC staff. The staff then visited Vaidhyanathan’s house and vaccinated his elderly father. Revathi Saranthan, a resident of Eighth Street, spoke to the Association, and helped her neighbour, a 70-year-old battling mobility-related issues, get vaccinated at home. In this manner, the Association has helped a handful of elderly residents get the vaccination shot at home. “Among those who came to the camp, there were senior citizens with restricted mobility. For such people, the staff came to their vehicle and gave them the shot,” says M. Balakrishnan, general secretary, TANSI Nagar Residents Welfare Association. At Sarathy Nagar To inspire and to clear any misgivings people may have, members of Sarathy Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Velachery got themselves vaccinated before launching an awareness exercise on the importance of taking the COVID-19 vaccine. The members got vaccinated at the Urban Primary Health Centre in Seva Nagar on Gandhi Road in Velachery. “To instil confidence in the residents that the UPHC was clean and everything was kept hygienic, we took a group photo from the UPHC posted it in the WhatsApp group for our residents. Residents associations should step in to create awareness and support the government health teams in carrying out this exercise. We also plan to conduct a vaccination camp in our colony,” says Haripriya Ramesh, joint secretary, Sarathy Nagar Residents Welfare Association. In another instance, four residents’ associations in Velachery came together and conducted a vaccination camp.

Apartment complex fixes it at Rs. 5||Just as retail outlets charge customers for shopping bags to send out the message that they bring their own bags next time, an apartment complex in Mandaveli offers visitors a mask, but with a small price tagged to it. Shanthi Gulmohar Apartments in Mandaveli recently started charging Rs. 5 for a mask it would hand out to those who had turned up at the complex without wearing one. The apartment committee has empowered the security staff to stop visitors at the gate, if they were found without a face mask. “All these months, masks were stocked with the security personnel at the gate. Those visiting the apartment without wearing a mask were being handed one, at no cost,” says Lalithaa Mahesh, a resident and former secretary of the apartment Association. The new management committee felt attaching a price to the mask would encourage more responsible behaviour from them in the future.

Spotted Redshank: Santharam points out that the Spotted Redshank is among waders that would wing past the city. “There wintering grounds include Rameshwaram,” says Santharam. “The bird would look beautiful as from now on, they would likely be in their breeding plumage.” Red-necked Phalarope: This species comes from around the same wintering grounds as the one used by the Spotted Redshank, says Shantaram. White-winged Tern: Sightings of large flocks of White-winged Tern, usually doing indefatigable sorties over coastal marshlands, are common in Marsh and April. April is also the time to expect sightings of the Forest wagtail, Ashy Minivet and the Chestnut-winged Cuckoo. Now, there are birds such as the Indian Pitta that are found in Chennai during the migratory season, but are also passage migrants in these parts. With the population that are passage migrants also coming into Chennai, “there numbers would be considerably high now,” underlines Santharam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-list-of-passage-migrants/article34293589.ece

Further, these vehicles are parked haphazardly. It is to be noted that the area near the intersection is a no-parking zone. But nobody pays any heed to it. As there are a good number of eateries near the intersection, we find many vehicles parked there. Besides, a row of vehicles can be found parked along Srinivasapuram Main Road. Hence, pedestrians have to walk almost in the middle of the road. Therefore, I request the traffic police to do the needful at the earliest. G.

However, the required preparatory work did not get off the ground until recently. To ECR residents’ pleasant surprise, the State Highways Department began the work on certain stretches of ECR, between Kottivakkam and Muttukadu, a couple of months ago. Buildings encroaching upon the road were demolished, making parts of the road wider. But now we do not see any work being carried out. The reasons are unknown. It is to be noted that temporary structures have again cropped up in those places where unauthorised buildings were razed down. The authorities should not drop their vigil, and make sure fresh encroachments do not come up. Besides, the road-widening work should be resumed. Next, I would like to point out that electric poles are found in the middle of ECR near the entrance of Anna Salai in Palavakkam after the removal of encroachments. These poles should be relocated to a safer place at the earliest. M.B.

One of them is no standing passengers will be allowed in Metropolitan Transport Corporation buses. Here, I would like to point out that when this rule was in place earlier nobody paid any heed to it. Further, commuters without masks were allowed to board the buses. Besides, we hardly find MTC drivers and conductors wearing masks. Earlier, hand-sanitisers were provided in buses and commuters had the option of buying tickets by making online payments. Those facilities are not provided anymore.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Millennial operates ‘flat’ remotely for his aged parents in Chennai||The pandemic requires the world to live and work differently. That is ludicrously obvious. However, in any scenario, a part of the obvious would sit cross-legged smack in the middle of the room, waving its trunk, yet be rudely ignored. Remote-living is that part, elephantine and ignored. In its simplest form, it is about reducing the regular in-person touch points, particularly cutting out non-essential encounters. A small number of the world’s population have it down to a fine art, practising it for their safety, their kin’s or both. Twenty-nine-year-old Amit Shah, a delivery manager in a data and analytics startup in Bengaluru, practises it for his parents’ well-being, remotely participating in the daily rhythms of a small corner of Chennai, watching it with his eyes peeled back. His parents — Rajnikant Shah (74) and Sarala Shah (72) — are residents of Prince Manor, a gated community in Purasawalkam. Through technology, he operates their ‘flat’ remotely, minimising the senior Shahs’ touch points with the outside world. In an odd sense, he has smuggled this flat into his pad at Whitefield. Firstly, he uses all the tech props — read apps — at his disposal to meet his parents’ day-to-day needs. “Under usual circumstances, my parents would head to the pharmacy to buy medicine. Both are diabetic and have high blood pressure; and my mother is a cancer survivor. Between the two of them, they require a lot of medicine. Since the pandemic, I use Swiggy Genie and Dunzo to have medicine delivered to them. Of course, I also use a variety of other apps to order food and many other essentials for them,” discloses Amit. The major challenge however lies in controlling the variables around the senior Shahs’ living space. It is a responsibility he shares with one of his three sisters — Deepali Shah, employed with a tech company in Hyderabad. “Having used MyGate app at my community — Brigade Metropolis in Whitefield — for some time, I was familiar with the use of its features,” begins Amit. With Purasawalkam’s Prince Manor also using the app, he had something right up his alley. “Through one phone, I control my parents’ flat at Prince Manor, signing in as a resident. Through another, I control my Whitefield flat,” explains Amit. Having similarly logged in to the app, his Hyderabad-based sister is also, to all intents and purposes, a resident of Prince Manor in Purasawalkam. “This way, I get to see everything that is happening in Purasawalkam, and I clear all the approvals. Our work schedules being demanding, my sister and I divide this work. When I am busy, my sister does the approvals.” Amit underscores that the remote-engagement extends far beyond predictable approvals. It factors in events that would seem ridiculously mundane, except on days defined by a pandemic. “Through the app, we track who is coming, so that before they reach the door, we call up mom and dad and say, ‘Hey, this person is coming. Be ready, wear a mask.’ Every day, deliveries would be made — food, package or groceries.” With the Coronavirus cases surging again — “in fact, there are six cases at Prince Manor now,” states Amit — brother and sister are on greater alert for ‘maskless encounters’ in Purasawalkam. “As I make the flat maintenance payment through the app, my parents are spared that touch point with the society. Earlier, my dad would go to the ATM to withdraw money to make the maintenance payment. He would pay the person in-charge in person and take the receipt from them.” Knowing which flats in the community are quarantined is a relief for Amit. “In the app, all the domestic help are tagged to a flat, and you know what their free hours are. So, some days when mom is not well and the maid is on leave, that one day I can arrange for her to be helped by another maid very easily,” explains Amit, adding that “only now I will avoid seeking help of this nature from domestic help who would have associated recently with a floor where a house has been quarantined now.” Amit’s experience shows that dire necessity is the mother of efficient tech-use. He illustrates: “One afternoon, both mom and dad put the air-conditioning on, left the phones in the hall, and took a nap. With the door shut, they could not hear their phones ringing. As I was not able to reach them, I was distraught. Every house is listed on the app, and one can do an app-to-app call, by just choosing the number assigned to the flat. I tried that option, settling on the flat number closest to my parents’. I spoke to a neighbour, who was kind enough to ring the bell and check on my parents.”  I get to see everything that is happening in Purasawalkam, and I clear all the approvals. Our work schedules being demanding, my sister and I divide this work. When I am busy, my sister does the approvals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/millennial-operates-flat-remotely-for-his-aged-parents-in-chennai/article34293575.ece

However, the facility is not yet ready, except for a compound wall. “In fact, this piece of OSR land was originally planned for a park. As there is a good number of parks in Velachery, we felt the need for a playground. Hence, in 2017 we gave a petition to GCC requesting it develop its OSR land into a playground instead of a park. GCC officials also agreed to our request and they formally sanctioned it. We also asked for facilities like washrooms, provision of drinking water, lights, cement benches and a walkway. We insisted that we did not want any court for any particular sport. It should be a playground where anybody can play any game. Because, there is already a GCC facility for basketball at VGP Selva Nagar and most of the parks in Velachery have badminton courts. But till today, nothing has been done except for the construction of a compound wall. At times, the OSR land is misused for dumping construction debris. Further, the ground has not been levelled yet and there is no name board. GCC cites fund crunch for the delay in commencing the work,” says M. Balakrishnan, general secretary, TANSI Nagar Residents Welfare Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/velachery-residents-wait-for-a-playground-at-bethel-avenue-continues/article34293561.ece

The section stretches from the ECR junction to Jothi Nagar. Kelambakkam–Kovalam Road is one of the roads connecting East Coast Road (ECR) and Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR). However, the risk of accidents is high on this stretch after sunset, especially when motorists flout safety rules, particularly driving on the wrong side of the road. On both sides of the road, there are thorny bushes and all kinds of waste are dumped. There is no footpath for pedestrians. Moreover, the width of the road is narrow. Hence, some skip this road and instead take Kalaignar Karunanidhi Salai, another road connecting ECR and OMR. “There are no commercial establishments along the stretch which could have lit up the stretch.

Tell her you want to buy organic manure or a rare variety of adenium, and the octogenarian will in all probability get them for you at a discount. She nurtures people’s interest in the hobby the way she nurtures her own plants. From an independent house decorated by around 500 plants, her expertise as a gardener is evident. Visitors to her house are greeted by white water-lilies at the entrance. From there, the visitor can move on to a display of hibiscus and adenium varieties. Over the veranda, hanging jars held by grilles offer another facet of greenery. Shrubs dotted with pink flowers; greens and potted vegetables give a lush look to the rooftop. Saroja aunty, as she is called, believes her garden holds the secret to her good health, and encourages many others in the colony to do what she does. The women’s wing of the B Sector will vouch for that. Of the 25 members in the WhatsApp group, more than half of them have started adding to their collection of plants at home, and they have only her influence to thank for that, says Arunthathi K, a member of the women’s wing. Saroja sources a variety of composts from nurseries and distributes them to neighbours. “For the last one year due to the pandemic, aunty has not been out much but she has saplings sourced from bullock cart vendors who go around the streets,” says Arunthathi . Every year, in November, Saroja throws a garden party at her home to which she invites friends and neighbours, taking them on a tour of her garden. “A majority of her plants are in full bloom in November and sitting amidst the plants, one is temped to grow more. If your child is along with you, they will force you to add to the selection at home,” says Arunthathi, adding that every guest walks away with a plant. For the source segregation initiatives of the women’s wing, Saroja aunty gives a sweet and a glass of juice that is made from the fruits plucked from her garden. “For my daughter’s biology project we needed Hibiscus flowers and we got it from aunty’s garden. She gladly gives flowers to students and teachers,” says Naga Soundari, a resident of the neighbourhood. Hibiscus flower juice is a signature drink served to guests coming home to take a tour of the garden. “The juice from chembarti flowers have medicinal value and I enjoy serving them to all visitors,” says Saroja, who is a member of Organic Terrace Gardening. The garden enthusiast has won many accolades over the years. In 2015, the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department gave her an award for the way she maintained her garden, and another award in 2019 for one of the best-kept gardens. Saroja is helped in the garden by a worker she has engaged. Yet, she makes sure she spends at least an hour every day tending to the plants.

Thanks to the continual vehicular flow through the narrow intersection, crossing the road is no easy task. After having waited impatiently for the fast-moving traffic to ease, Akash decides to weave his way through it. A speed breaker and a traffic police personnel at the intersection do not prove to be of much assistance to road users like Akash as they try to cross the stretch, especially during rush hour. Walkers and motorists want a digital traffic signal and the existing bus stop on the stretch to be relocated. “Buses halt at the bus stop near the intersection making commuters and other pedestrians rush from one end of the stretch to the other. Sometimes, even motorcyclists occupy much of the road space near the busy bus stop. A traffic signal would help regulate the traffic flow at least during rush hour,” says K. Velappan, a motorist from Thiruverukadu. As the five-km-long stretch constitutes a quick route for goods-laden lorries and other container trucks from industrial units in Irungattukottai, Sriperumbudur, Oragadam on the Chennai – Bangalore Highway (NH-04) to Kolkata Highway (NH-05) via the Chennai – Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road, the road witnesses traffic all through the day. A great number of apartment complexes are also coming up. The intersection at Thiruverukadu has narrowed due to encroachments, and therefore, the width of carriageway has reduced by 40 feet. Only one MTC bus can travel at a time on both sides of the stretch. At present, the widened portion of the stretch is around 60 feet with tiled footpath and LED street lights and median. Further, the carriageway around the intersection does not have a footpath, bright street lights, warning signboards and reflectors. With most of the schools and other public utilities located on one side of the stretch, residents from the opposite side of the stretch have to cross the intersection to avail these public utilities including banks, a PHC and a post office. “Steps will be taken to install a new traffic signal at the intersection soon,” says a police personnel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/road-users-seek-traffic-signals/article34293605.ece

Together with the security guard at the facility, a few members of the Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents’ Welfare Association see to it that the rule is followed. As the RWA oversees the maintenance of the park, its members also ascertain that the facility is not overrun with people. “Unlike the playground in our neighbourhood, the park is a small public area and so, we can enforce the face mask rule there. Visitors to the park also understand its significance,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents’ Welfare Association. Members of the Association started the Officers’ Colony Park Users’ Club (OPUC) more than two decades ago. Volunteers of the club, who are mostly local residents, had been roped in for door-to-door campaign relating to civic issues, including garbage dumping, bad roads and street lights in their respective neighbourhoods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/mask-up-or-ship-out/article34293591.ece

Jayachandran, 53-years-old, can also be spotted at traffic junctions — particularly, Parrys Corner, RBI Subway, Muthuswamy Bridge, Kuralagam and Indian Bank — that come under his limits, encouraging motorists and pedestrians to wear face masks while in public places. “I always have a bag of face masks in the police patrol vehicle and distribute at least 100 masks every day. As a result of this intervention, people who would earlier not wear masks, never fail to do so now,” says Jayachandran. A native of Kambam in Theni district, Jayachandran joined the Tamil Nadu Police Department more than three decades ago. He has served as traffic police officer at many police stations in the northern parts of Chennai. During the lockdown last year, along with his teammates, Jayachandran would distributed face masks, hand sanitisers, gloves, food packets and water bottles to the homeless and the needy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/beyond-the-call-of-duty/article34293598.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Millennial operates ‘flat’ remotely for his aged parents living in Purasawalkam||The pandemic requires the world to live and work differently. That is ludicrously obvious. However, in any scenario, a part of the obvious would sit cross-legged smack in the middle of the room, waving its trunk, yet be rudely ignored. Remote-living is that part, elephantine and ignored. In its simplest form, it is about reducing the regular in-person touch points, particularly cutting out non-essential encounters. A small number of the world’s population have it down to a fine art, practising it for their safety, their kin’s or both. Twenty-nine-year-old Amit Shah, a delivery manager in a data and analytics startup in Bengaluru, practises it for his parents’ well-being, remotely participating in the daily rhythms of a small corner of Chennai, watching it with his eyes peeled back. His parents — Rajnikant Shah (74) and Sarala Shah (72) — are residents of Prince Manor, a gated community in Purasawalkam. Through technology, he operates their ‘flat’ remotely, minimising the senior Shahs’ touch points with the outside world. In an odd sense, he has smuggled this flat into his pad at Whitefield. Firstly, he uses all the tech props — read apps — at his disposal to meet his parents’ day-to-day needs. “Under usual circumstances, my parents would head to the pharmacy to buy medicine. Both are diabetic and have high blood pressure; and my mother is a cancer survivor. Between the two of them, they require a lot of medicine. Since the pandemic, I use Swiggy Genie and Dunzo to have medicine delivered to them. Of course, I also use a variety of other apps to order food and many other essentials for them,” discloses Amit. The major challenge however lies in controlling the variables around the senior Shahs’ living space. It is a responsibility he shares with one of his three sisters — Deepali Shah, employed with a tech company in Hyderabad. “Having used MyGate app at my community — Brigade Metropolis in Whitefield — for some time, I was familiar with the use of its features,” begins Amit. With Purasawalkam’s Prince Manor also using the app, he had something right up his alley. “Through one phone, I control my parents’ flat at Prince Manor, signing in as a resident. Through another, I control my Whitefield flat,” explains Amit. Having similarly logged in to the app, his Hyderabad-based sister is also, to all intents and purposes, a resident of Prince Manor in Purasawalkam. “This way, I get to see everything that is happening at the apartment complex in Purasawalkam, and I clear all the approvals. Our work schedules being demanding, between me and my sister, we divide this work. When I am busy, my sister does the approvals.” Amit underscores that the remote-engagement extends far beyond predictable approvals. It factors in events that would seem ridiculously mundane, except on days defined by a pandemic. “Through the app, we track who is coming, so that before they reach the door, we call up mom and dad and say, ‘Hey, this person is coming. Be ready, wear a mask.’ Every day, deliveries would be made — food, package or groceries.” With the Coronavirus cases surging again — “in fact, there are six cases at Prince Manor now,” states Amit — brother and sister are on greater alert for ‘maskless encounters” in Purasawalkam. “As I make the flat maintenance payment through the app, my parents are spared that touch point with the society. Earlier, my dad would go to the ATM to withdraw money to make the maintenance payment. He would pay the person in-charge in person and take the receipt from them.” Knowing which flats in the community are quarantined is a relief for Amit. “In the app, all the domestic help are tagged to a flat, and you know what their free hours are. So, some days when mom is not well and the maid is on leave, that one day I can arrange for her to be helped by another maid very easily,” explains Amit, adding that “only now I will avoid seeking help of this nature from domestic help who would have associated recently with a floor where a house has been quarantined now.” Amit’s experience shows that dire necessity is the mother of efficient tech-use. He illustrates: “One afternoon, both mom and dad put the air-conditioning on, left the phones in the hall, and took a nap. With the door shut, they could not hear their phones ringing. As I was not able to reach them, I was distraught. Every house is listed on the app, and one can do an app-to-app call, by just choosing the number assigned to the flat. I tried that option, settling on the flat number closest to my parents’. I spoke to a neighbour, who was kind enough to ring the bell and check on my parents.”  I get to see everything that is happening at the apartment in Purasawalkam, and I clear all the approvals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/millennial-operates-flat-remotely-for-his-aged-parents-living-in-purasawalkam/article34293608.ece

Part of the credit for this should go to the residents. In the middle of February, when the Amma mini-clinic opened, it was mainly used as a dispensary. “The clinic stayed idle for most part of the day, and so we requested the Greater Chennai Corporation Corporation to use the facility as a vaccination centre as the drive to vaccinate senior citizens was under way then. The next day, the clinic started to function as a vaccination centre,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents Welfare Association. The Amma mini-Clinic, which comes under ward 89 of Zone-7 (Ambattur), is open between 8 a.m and 3 p.m on all days including Sundays.  Since then, on an average, the UPHC located close-by, and the mini-clinic receive more than 100 visitors each, for vaccination every day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/amma-clinic-is-now-a-jab-point/article34293593.ece

The sewage is being diverted to the stormwater drain along the stretch for it to finally discharged into the nearby Ambattur lake. “The stretch part of what constitutes a shorter route for many motorists to reaching Ambattur from Thirumullavoyal by skipping the congested CTH Road,” says S. Suresh, secretary, Thiruvengada Nagar Residents Welfare Association. Suresh points out that the three-kilometre Cholambedu Main Road lined with several residential areas. Residents and motorists say the stretch was marred by potholes at many spots before civic officials of Zone - 7 (Ambattur) of Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) got it re-laid. The problem of the clogged manhole is proving to be the fly in the ointment. Residents underline that regular de-clogging exercise by the Chennai Metrowater in coordination with GCC would have averted the sewage overflow issue. “Steps will be taken to de-clog the drain on the stretch in coordination with the Metrowater,” says a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/problem-two-waits-to-be-tackled/article34293607.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Pandemic features in apartment apps go into overdrive again||New features. New features made newer still. Old features languishing in “disuse-ville”, dusted and polished to a gleam. That is the three-part leitmotif wafting across the world of apartment-management apps. With the second wave raging on, communities are ‘rediscovering’ the value of certain features that demonstrated their usefulness during the first. Based on data from representatives of two apartment-management app service providers on how these features stacked up in the first wave and during the ongoing surge, here is piecing together a picture of “the all-time favourite features”, their patronage even expected to arch beyond the pandemic. Delivery feature With the pandemic as trigger, blood is suddenly rushing into options that had almost atrophied due to indifferent patronage over a sustained period of time. Ranjit Behara, head of marketing, MyGate, says “The ‘Leave at Gate’ in the delivery feature of MyGate suddenly shot into prominence. It was around in some form previously, but exercised sparingly. If someone was living alone, and not at home at the time of delivery, they might instruct via the app to leave the product at gate. That was about it. During the pandemic, it took centre stage, with many societies making it mandatory. In the first wave, it was well-utilised. Now, with this surge in cases, it is again being used in a big way. It will be always adapted to suit new situations.” Karnika Roy, marketing manager, brand and content, ADDA, weighs in: “During this pandemic, the In-house Delivery Hub option in ADDA is majorly useful as it cuts down on the entry of delivery personnel inside the premises. We had a parcel management feature before COVID-19. We took the feature, revamped it to suit the needs raised by the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, if a community does not want to give unrestricted access to delivery personnel, they can continue using this feature without any changes to it at all.” Staff feature  The pandemic has particularly thrown into bold relief, features relating to the management of support staff who help the cogwheels of the community turning. “At ADDA, residents can certainly see who are the people working within the community. The admin — represented by the management committee or the resident welfare association — has data about which staff is going to which flat, and how many flats this staff is visiting. We have tried to restrict the visibility a little, as we want all the residents also to have their own privacy. However, for the purposes of maintaining the management of the community, the admin have to know,” says Karnika. MyGate offers profiles of the domestic help and support staff for the entire community to see, says Ranjit. It provides residents with an idea of the flats in the community that a domestic help is working for. So, it puts residents in a position to seek help during exigencies, says Ranjit, adding that during a pandemic, together with the Home Quarantine feature, it enables residents to make informed choices while seeking any help. Shop at home  During the first wave, the feature that allows brands to wheel in their wares gained prominence, when residents started looking beyond just access to essentials. The situation is said to have also opened resident welfare associations’ eyes to the opportunities for growth that this feature brings with it. Says Karnika, “One thing we realised is that depending on their size, communities ended up spending anywhere from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 per month on sanitising their entire premises. RWAs are non-profit organisations and they were really struggling to get their funds. That is when we realised we could be connecting people, helping these communities get in touch with brands. We created a system where different types of brands — FMCG, apparel and gadgets, for example — would come to the community and have pop-up stores and a mobile van. Following COVID-19 protocols, residents can avail the services of these brands. It is a symbiotic relationship. The community earns some revenue that helps them cope with the COVID-19 experience. Secondly, the brands are also getting some business. They would stay for two to three days, or through a long weekend. From the ADDA part, we take care of the communication and promotion part of it.” On brands setting up shop in communities, Ranjit says, “That will keep on happening. Fashion, eateries, furniture — these are among areas in which brands look for establishing a connection with communities. During the pandemic, the demand has shot up. Many brands have reached out to MyGate to open some kind of pop-up shops.”  Comfort plus safety  Karnika underlines that pandemic-related features make it to the residents’ hot-favourites list, not always for their safety quotient, but also the comfort factor that may ride piggy-back on it. “Broadcast From Gate” on ADDA makes it to this list, reveals Karnika. The feature came in handy, particularly during the intense lockdowns, when vendors dealing in essentials wheeled into communities, day after day. The admin would notify the time to all residents via this feature. Accustomed to the comfort this feature promotes, Karnika says, residents have checked it into the post-pandemic cart.  We realised that depending on their size, communities ended up spending anywhere from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2,00,000 per month on sanitising their entire premises||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/pandemic-features-in-apartment-apps-go-into-overdrive-again/article34293633.ece

In stark contrast, one can now count the number of buses in their fingers. With only a trickle of bus services operating through this important road, commuters are forced to go in for private modes of transport. Even the existing services leave a lot to be desired in terms of their frequency. Number 45B, plying between Madipakkam bus terminus and Vivekanandar Illam, has a 40-minute frequency. Route number 5C (Taramani to Broadway) and 41D ( Ambattur OT to Mandaveli) have shed many trips. To go to Adyar, commuters have to board 21G and alight at Mylapore tank bus stop for a connecting service. There is no direct bus from Alwarpet to Mylapore, T. Nagar and Adyar. Route number 5B, plying between Mylapore and T. Nagar, has been stopped. A mini-bus operating between Mylapore and T. Nagar through C. P. Ramaswamy Road, C. V. Raman Road and Anna Salai has also been stopped. 12A is another service that has been completely stopped, says Rajan E. Murali, a long-time resident of Alwarpet. Murali, points out that decades ago, 4C (Besant Nagar to Mint), 5 (Gandhi Nagar to Broadway), 12A (T. Nagar to Mylapore, later extended to Foreshore Estate and T. Nagar, covered educational institutions in Foreshore Estate, Mylapore, T.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai resident sights two rare warblers at home on the same day||From this writer’s interactions with him, Chennai-based birder Sundaravel Palanivelu measures his words as carefully as a surveyor measures disputed land. One gets the sense of an internal machine turning and sifting through thoughts before elevating any of them to the dignity of speech. Even in his online interactions, he is an exemplar of brevity. So, when his sentences reach two-digit word lengths, the rare verbal extravagance is usually justified. Recently, he had had two bird sightings to discuss; and together, they were too remarkable to be kept laconic. The two sightings were barely separated by time and space. On the morning of April 3, he had seen a Large-billed Leaf Warbler and a Western Crowned Warbler. Passage migrants in these parts, these warblers are rarely recorded because of the narrow time-frame available to see them. (Entered in eBird, both sightings have been approved by the documentation-platform for avian observations). The highlight is that both showed up that morning at Sundaravel’s living space, SaiSurya Apartments in Pallikaranai. Sundaravel’s apartment roughly falls within the route for onward and reverse migration taken by both these warblers. Besides, Sundaravel’s homestead is within shouting distance from a section of the Pallikaranai Marsh. However, these factors do not detract from the rarity of the sightings. Here’s why. When this writer had earlier sought his views about these two warblers’ migration route and their occurrence-frequency, this is what ornithologist V. Santharam had to say: “The Western Crowned Warbler and Large billed Leaf Warbler are passage migrants: Both seem to be passing through the East Coast. These birds come to the Western Ghats; and some of them passing through Chennai would be heading to Sri Lanka. There are not many records of these birds; that is because they pass through a very narrow window of time. Their movements (on the onward migration) happen when NE monsoon has set in and so, not many people would be venturing out. In their reverse migration in March and April, relatively more people may see it. I have seen the Large-billed Leaf Warbler at GNP.” Calling the Western Crowned Warbler an eBird rarity, Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, eBird reviewer, was on the same page, concluding that while “South-western ghats is where the Western Crowned Warbler winters”, there is the probable explanation that a population of this warbler “passes through Chennai and the East Coast on the way to Sri Lanka.” With Sundaravel’s April 3, 2021 sighting of the Western Crowned Warbler being entered in eBird under the geographical category of Chennai district, it becomes the second photographic record of the bird in this region. On April 23, 2016, Vikas had a photographic record of the Western Crowned Warbler from the Guindy National Park. Santharam points out that with collation of eBird data, the movements of rarely-seen passage migrants can be better tracked, filling the gaps in the understanding of possible passage routes. Says the ornithologist: “Now, with eBird data you should be able to see the migratory pattern. If there are sufficient records, it should be possible to do mapping and animation-based depiction of bird movement.”  These birds come to the Western Ghats; and some of them passing through Chennai would be heading to Sri Lanka||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/chennai-resident-sights-two-rare-warblers-at-home-on-the-same-day/article34293642.ece

Though the Metrorail line has has opened, the stretch is yet to get lighting. M. Manikandan, a resident of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Thiruvottiyur, says that some years ago, the lamp posts along the stretch were removed to facilitate construction of pillars and elevated tracks for Metrorail network. “Although work on the stretch is over, we are yet to get the street lights back,” he says. CMRL has set up lights on pillar numbers 259, 261 (towards Toll Gate) and 264, but residents say that is not enough. Residents of Kalaignar Nagar and Rajiv Gandhi Nagar in Thiruvottiyur; and Poompuhar Nagar, Bharat Nagar and Dr. Ambedkar Nagar in Ernavoor have requested Zone 1 of Greater Chennai Corporation to light up the area. On the lane towards Manali High Road, light from commercial establishments is the saving grace for motorists. On the opposite lane, towards Toll Gate and Ajax, the stretch is plunged in darkness. The same situation prevails along pillars with numbering from 139 and 169 between Thiruvottiyur and Toll Gate Metro stations. Other problems D. Hari, a resident of Kalaignar Nagar (Wimco Nagar), says, “Pedestrians are the worst-affected. The spacious walking area along the stormwater drain network constructed outside the CMRL work site, between Ernavoor and Wimco Nagar, is out of bounds for pedestrians.

Despite these salutary additions, it cup of woes still runs over. It continues to be plagued by the problem of clogged drains at its intersection with Anna Salai, near the police station. It is a long-standing problem. “The clogged drain on the stretch should have been repaired during the complete lockdown last year taking advantage of drop in vehicular volume,” says S. Rakesh, a motorist from Royapettah. At present, a stretch of Anna Salai — from Thiru. Vi. Ka Road (earlier known as General Patters Road) junction to Wellington junction — is a two-way with entry being facilitated from Whites Road junction towards the LIC Building. Whites Road is also a two-way and there is also an entry into from Royapettah tower clock. The section with the clogged drain presents a conducive breeding ground for mosquitoes as sullage and excess rainwater stagnate at that spot, say motorists. Some shop owners can be seen using the space for parking vehicles. Visitors to the Anna Salai police station have to walk on the carriageway to reach the bus stop at Anna Salai. Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) officials point out that unlike the other roads in Royapettah, including Whites Road and Smith Road, that come under GCC’s control, Anna Salai is maintained by the State Highways Department. It is alleged that he fact that coordination is required between the two State agencies, is the main reason for the issue remaining unaddressed. A GCC official says, “Steps will be taken to repair the clogged drain at the intersection of these two stretches soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/clogged-drain-takes-the-sheen-out-of-this-improvement-work/article34293622.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Fitness group off to a brisk start||The end of her sari pallu tucked in, and her feet encased in proper running shoes, 73-year-old Kalyani Muralidhran is a picture of inspiration, as she goes about her fitness routine — 100 skips with a jump rope every morning; and at 4.30 p.m., a four-km brisk-walking around the apartment complex in Mandaveli, together with seven other seniors. Two residents of Ragamalika Apartments have started Raga Walkers, a walking club that operates only on the premises. Confined to their homes, members of the group, particularly the seniors among them, are reaping the benefits of this move. Members of the group keep strides with each other through a WhatsApp group. When neighbours Sumana Priya and Hetal Somasundaram were discussing how to maintain a level of positivity through these difficult times, they hit upon this idea. “We have family members and individuals walking/ running on their own but there was nothing to motivate many of us to keep a routine going or achieve new fitness goals, so we thought of bringing residents from the community together,” says Sumana. Raga Walkers is still in its nascency, only 25-members-strong. As a group for a 200-unit apartment community, it can certainly do better, they think. Sumana points out that the group offers its members new heights to scale, regularly. They started with a five-km-day challenge, which walkers can attempt at their own pace and convenience. Each walker’s output is shared and discussed in the group and also tabulated in an Excel sheet at the end of the week. Besides walking and fitness challenges, the group has initiated other activities including meditation and a suryanamaskar challenge. The group’s achievements is shared with non-members of Raga Walkers. The idea is to nudge more people into joining the group, Sumana and Hetal point out. “There are no winners or losers in these challenges but we present what we have achieved as a group,” says Sumana. Sometimes, members take a break due to their commitments at work. In that scenario, the two point out, they see it as their responsibility to make sure the person makes it to the walk that day. As Kalyani, a retired principal of a private school, puts it, even if she is five minutes late, she would receive a call from her group. “I enjoyed walking but I did not find the time. Now that I am forced to stay indoors, I make time for this fitness activity and when you are walking with a group it gives you oodles of energy,” says Kalyani. Raga Walkers plans to have at least 50 per cent of the apartment community join the group over the next six months. Says Hetal, “When the COVID-19 situation improves in Chennai, we would organise meet-ups in the beach.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/fitness-group-off-to-a-brisk-start/article34293613.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A smart move||When Priya Ramkumar, a resident of Jains Sagarika in MRC Nagar, coordinated with the local Urban Primary Health Centre to organise a vaccination camp at the community, she expected enthusiastic participation. The PHC had informed Priya that a minimum of 100 people should sign up for it for them to come down with their team and an ambulance and run the camp. To Priya’s surprise, she could not line up that number. Response to an announcement at the apartment’s WhatsApp group, and door-to-door collection of data about interested residents was disheartening. The number proved elusive, but still Priya got the camp ready, hoping for a turnaround. On March 29, when the team arrived, the number shot up well past the 100 mark – nearly 110 took the jab. Priya and a few other residents including Sudha Gopal, Sunitha S and Harry Peters who coordinated the camp did something that had swung the scales. They had spoken to house maids, cooks, security staff and vendors at the apartment about the drive. Priya says through a friend at the neighbouring apartment, Lords, members of the its house-keeping staff who wanted to take the jab were also informed. That the Corporation team did not turn up on the planned day helped, as there was more time for organising the number. When the day arrived, the resident-volunteers accepted walk-ins, as the latter came prepared, with all the documents, and were eligible for vaccination. So, they could not bring themselves to turn them away. For instance, staff from a hotel next door walked in. Priya believes updates in apartment groups through the day, helped too. “We would keep posting photos after every 10 vaccinations — saying, ‘20 done’, ‘30 done’ and so on,” she says. Tokens were distributed to people and some were not waiting along with the others, so announcements were made in the group asking the respective token holder to come down as their turn neared. Similarly, photos of the oldest/ youngest/ 50th were shared. Some residents decided to get vaccinated just on the day, says Priya. The drive, she adds, benefited not only her community, but the whole street.

One vertical half of the carriageway on this road, with the traffic moving towards Egmore, has been dug up for the work, where the existing power cables are being replaced with high powered cables to carry 400 KV of power by Tangedco to prevent fluctuations. “Early completion of the cable work will ensure better safety on the stretch,” says K. Subash, a motorist from Royapettah. A busy link road, Greams Road provides access to many important government and private institutions with huge workforces. The stretch is chaotic due to lack of surveillance including absence of traffic police personnel near the hospital zone. Traffic police personnel, however, are spotted across the bridge at Casa Major Road and Pantheon Road intersection to prevent traffic violations. Greams Road, especially between the police quarters and its intersection with Pantheon Road in Egmore, is plunged in darkness due to the lack of adequate street lights. Many motorists from PH Road use Greams Road to reach Anna Salai at Thousand Lights as the stretch is less congested compared to Nungambakkam High Road. “Steps will be taken to complete the cable-laying work on the stretch soon,” says a Tangedco official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/expedite-cable-laying-work/article34293616.ece

Vaidhyanathan’s mind. TANSI Nagar Welfare Association made it easier for this resident of Church Gate Avenue in Velachery. A week ago, at the vaccination camp organised by the Association with Greater Chennai Corporation, the Association communicated Vaidhyanathan’s situation to a GCC staff. The staff then visited Vaidhyanathan’s house and vaccinated his elderly father. Revathi Saranthan, a resident of Eighth Street, spoke to the Association, and helped her neighbour, a 70-year-old battling mobility-related issues, get vaccinated at home. In this manner, the Association has helped a handful of elderly residents get the vaccination shot at home. “Among those who came to the camp, there were senior citizens with restricted mobility. For such people, the staff came to their vehicle and gave them the shot,” says M. Balakrishnan, general secretary, TANSI Nagar Residents Welfare Association. At Sarathy Nagar To inspire and to clear any misgivings people may have, members of Sarathy Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Velachery got themselves vaccinated before launching an awareness exercise on the importance of taking the COVID-19 vaccine. The members got vaccinated at the Urban Primary Health Centre in Seva Nagar on Gandhi Road in Velachery. “To instil confidence in the residents that the UPHC was clean and everything was kept hygienic, we took a group photo from the UPHC posted it in the WhatsApp group for our residents. Residents associations should step in to create awareness and support the government health teams in carrying out this exercise. We also plan to conduct a vaccination camp in our colony,” says Haripriya Ramesh, joint secretary, Sarathy Nagar Residents Welfare Association. In another instance, four residents’ associations in Velachery came together and conducted a vaccination camp. They are Baby Nagar, Annai Indira Nagar, Balakrishna Nagar and Venus Colony associations. “The Corporation wanted the Associations to coordinate among ourselves so that a large number of people will be benefited,” says S. Kumararaja, vice-president, Annai Indira Nagar Residents Welfare Associaition.

Apartment complex fixes it at Rs. 5||Just as retail outlets charge customers for shopping bags to send out the message that they bring their own bags next time, an apartment complex in Mandaveli offers visitors a mask, but with a small price tagged to it. Shanthi Gulmohar Apartments in Mandaveli recently started charging Rs. 5 for a mask it would hand out to those who had turned up at the complex without wearing one. The apartment committee has empowered the security staff to stop visitors at the gate, if they were found without a face mask. “All these months, masks were stocked with the security personnel at the gate. Those visiting the apartment without wearing a mask were being handed one, at no cost,” says Lalithaa Mahesh, a resident and former secretary of the apartment Association. The new management committee felt attaching a price to the mask would encourage more responsible behaviour from them in the future. Besides, people do not always value things that come for free. “Now, the masks are stocked with the facility manager who collects a token Rs. 5 before handing one to a visitor without a mask,” says Lalithaa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/what-is-the-cost-of-irresponsibility-apartment-complex-fixes-it-at-rs-5/article34293639.ece

Santharam, ornithologist and director, Institute of Bird Studies, Rishi Valley, presents a short list of passage migrants that residents can have their peeled for, during April. On their return journey back to their breeding grounds, these species may put in an appearance in certain avian habitats in Chennai. Spotted Redshank: Santharam points out that the Spotted Redshank is among waders that would wing past the city. “There wintering grounds include Rameshwaram,” says Santharam. “The bird would look beautiful as from now on, they would likely be in their breeding plumage.” Red-necked Phalarope: This species comes from around the same wintering grounds as the one used by the Spotted Redshank, says Shantaram. White-winged Tern: Sightings of large flocks of White-winged Tern, usually doing indefatigable sorties over coastal marshlands, are common in Marsh and April. April is also the time to expect sightings of the Forest wagtail, Ashy Minivet and the Chestnut-winged Cuckoo. Now, there are birds such as the Indian Pitta that are found in Chennai during the migratory season, but are also passage migrants in these parts. With the population that are passage migrants also coming into Chennai, “there numbers would be considerably high now,” underlines Santharam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-list-of-passage-migrants/article34293643.ece

Many sewer connections, they say, are connected to the stormwater drain network For instance, the SWD network on Swami Street, R. T. Mudali Street, V. K. Pillai Street, Venkatachalam Street, Aarni Muthu Street, Maddox Street, Nellai Salladai Street and Kandappa Street are polluted with sewage. Last year, steps were taken to reconstruct the stormwater drain network on these stretches after several representations were made to the Greater Chennai Corporation. Earlier, the width of the drain network was two feet. Now, it is four feet. But sewage flows in the newly-constructed stormwater drains. Shiva Gunasekaran, an activist and a long-time resident of Choolai, says, “Residents dispose medical and sanitary waste into the sewer lines. The pipes were laid more than 40 years ago and many are broken now. No steps have been taken to have the pipes replaced.” He points out that the problem hits the nadir when it rains as sewage stagnates on these stretches. “After we complain to the authorities, steps are taken to remove the blocks, but in a few hours, the same situation resurfaces,” says another resident. Residents allege that similarly, on Bakers’ Street, a good number of sewer lines are connected to the stormwater drain network. On Venkatachalam Street, sewer connections are all connected to the drain network. The sewage from these stretches is drained into the CMWSSB pumping station located on K.M. Garden Street, Purasawakkam through Choolai High Road and V. V. Kovil Street. For an area of R.T. Mudali Street, the pumping station is on Sydenhams Road. The distance from these stretches to the pumping station located on Sydenhams Road is only a kilometre. The pumping station has the capacity to treat 5 MLD, but it is discharged at the pumping station, located on K. M. Garden Street.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/choolai-residents-want-unauthorised-sewer-lines-to-be-plugged/article34293618.ece

Route numbers 33C and 64K (towards Broadway), 64K (a cut service towards Perambur), 2A (towards Anna Square) and 121G (Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus) plies from the terminus. Yet, commuters frequenting the facility are often clueless about their timings — due to the absence of any helpful information. The terminus does not have visual display boards. A public address system is fitted near the ceiling but is not being put to use, say commuters. Buses are parked haphazardly, forcing commuters to take a walk across the terminus to board buses. “Route numbers going to the same destination are parked a few metres, away forcing commuters to stand. At times, the commuters have to get off the bus, and board an another bus,” says N. Mahendran, a commuter. An MTC official points out that steps will be taken to make announcements through the public address system.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Millennial operates ‘flat’ remotely for his aged parents in Chennai||The pandemic requires the world to live and work differently. That is ludicrously obvious. However, in any scenario, a part of the obvious would sit cross-legged smack in the middle of the room, waving its trunk, yet be rudely ignored. Remote-living is that part, elephantine and ignored. In its simplest form, it is about reducing the regular in-person touch points, particularly cutting out non-essential encounters. A small number of the world’s population have it down to a fine art, practising it for their safety, their kin’s or both. Twenty-nine-year-old Amit Shah, a delivery manager in a data and analytics startup in Bengaluru, practises it for his parents’ well-being, remotely participating in the daily rhythms of a small corner of Chennai, watching it with his eyes peeled back. His parents — Rajnikant Shah (74) and Sarala Shah (72) — are residents of Prince Manor, a gated community in Purasawalkam. Through technology, he operates their ‘flat’ remotely, minimising the senior Shahs’ touch points with the outside world. In an odd sense, he has smuggled this flat into his pad at Whitefield. Firstly, he uses all the tech props — read apps — at his disposal to meet his parents’ day-to-day needs. “Under usual circumstances, my parents would head to the pharmacy to buy medicine. Both are diabetic and have high blood pressure; and my mother is a cancer survivor. Between the two of them, they require a lot of medicine. Since the pandemic, I use Swiggy Genie and Dunzo to have medicine delivered to them. Of course, I also use a variety of other apps to order food and many other essentials for them,” discloses Amit. The major challenge however lies in controlling the variables around the senior Shahs’ living space. It is a responsibility he shares with one of his three sisters — Deepali Shah, employed with a tech company in Hyderabad. “Having used MyGate app at my community — Brigade Metropolis in Whitefield — for some time, I was familiar with the use of its features,” begins Amit. With Purasawalkam’s Prince Manor also using the app, he had something right up his alley. “Through one phone, I control my parents’ flat at Prince Manor, signing in as a resident. Through another, I control my Whitefield flat,” explains Amit. Having similarly logged in to the app, his Hyderabad-based sister is also, to all intents and purposes, a resident of Prince Manor in Purasawalkam. “This way, I get to see everything that is happening in Purasawalkam, and I clear all the approvals. Our work schedules being demanding, my sister and I divide this work. When I am busy, my sister does the approvals.” Amit underscores that the remote-engagement extends far beyond predictable approvals. It factors in events that would seem ridiculously mundane, except on days defined by a pandemic. “Through the app, we track who is coming, so that before they reach the door, we call up mom and dad and say, ‘Hey, this person is coming. Be ready, wear a mask.’ Every day, deliveries would be made — food, package or groceries.” With the Coronavirus cases surging again — “in fact, there are six cases at Prince Manor now,” states Amit — brother and sister are on greater alert for ‘maskless encounters’ in Purasawalkam. “As I make the flat maintenance payment through the app, my parents are spared that touch point with the society. Earlier, my dad would go to the ATM to withdraw money to make the maintenance payment. He would pay the person in-charge in person and take the receipt from them.” Knowing which flats in the community are quarantined is a relief for Amit. “In the app, all the domestic help are tagged to a flat, and you know what their free hours are. So, some days when mom is not well and the maid is on leave, that one day I can arrange for her to be helped by another maid very easily,” explains Amit, adding that “only now I will avoid seeking help of this nature from domestic help who would have associated recently with a floor where a house has been quarantined now.” Amit’s experience shows that dire necessity is the mother of efficient tech-use. He illustrates: “One afternoon, both mom and dad put the air-conditioning on, left the phones in the hall, and took a nap. With the door shut, they could not hear their phones ringing. As I was not able to reach them, I was distraught. Every house is listed on the app, and one can do an app-to-app call, by just choosing the number assigned to the flat. I tried that option, settling on the flat number closest to my parents’. I spoke to a neighbour, who was kind enough to ring the bell and check on my parents.”  I get to see everything that is happening in Purasawalkam, and I clear all the approvals. Our work schedules being demanding, my sister and I divide this work. When I am busy, my sister does the approvals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/millennial-operates-flat-remotely-for-his-aged-parents-in-chennai/article34293637.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||‘The clamour for reservation signals a deeper crisis elsewhere’||Over the past few months, Karnataka has seen a surge in demand for reservation from various communities. Land-owning communities that have traditionally dominated State politics are at the forefront, which in turn has created insecurity among other backward communities, stirring the caste cauldron. Other States such as Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh too have seen similar agitations not too long ago. Justice H.N. Nagamohan Das, a retired judge of the Karnataka High Court, recently submitted a report to the State government asking for increased reservation for both Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and for legislation to expand reservation in the State beyond 50%, like nine other States in the country. An expert in constitutional law, he has also spearheaded a campaign to teach the Constitution to students across the State over the last two years. Excerpts from an interview: Several communities, including those considered to be relatively privileged, like the Vokkaligas and Lingayats who have dominated State politics after Independence, are demanding a bigger share in the reservation pie. Why is this happening? Over the past decade, we have seen similar protests by the Patidars in Gujarat, Jats in Haryana, Gujjars in Rajasthan, Marathas in Maharashtra, Kapus in Andhra Pradesh and now, by the Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Kurubas in Karnataka. What is common to all these groups is that they predominantly rely on agriculture. Agricultural communities of our country neither demanded nor opposed reservation in the 50s. But over seven decades, policies pursued by successive governments have increased agriculture production but hit agriculturists badly. They are now facing a deep crisis, mainly economic, which has also manifested itself in the social and cultural spheres, as is evident from farmer suicides. These demands for a bigger share in reservation, while often instigated by vested political interests, are also a reflection of a deeper crisis elsewhere. Fulfilling all demands for reservation will help only a marginal section of agriculturists in the country, as the reservation pie has shrunk over the decades. So, it is no solution. In this light, the farm laws introduced by the Union government will only aggravate the situation. Most of these communities have enjoyed the benefits of reservation in the post-Mandal era. Also, there is a paradox in how the reservation benefits are shrinking while there is a clamour for inclusion. The agricultural crisis is closely linked to the neoliberal economic policies we embarked on three decades ago, roughly around the same time the Mandal Commission’s recommendations were implemented. That is when avenues of reservation began shrinking significantly due to privatisation of PSUs, government departments opting for contract labour and the outsourcing of labour, where reservation does not apply. As per recent studies, over 60 lakh sanctioned posts in the public sector are lying vacant. Today, 98% of job opportunities are in the private sector, leaving only 2% of opportunities in the public sector. With a 50% cap, only 1% of the jobs comes under reservation for nearly 75% of the population of this country. Nobody is demanding a redress of these issues, but are instead clamouring for a bigger share in the already shrinking pie. It is myopic. There have been proposals earlier to extend affirmative action to the private sector. Can that be the answer? Is the private sector really private? These private firms raise money through selling their shares or borrowing from financial institutions, essentially public money. They acquire land through the state apparatus, take tax rebates and use public infrastructure. Therefore, the private sector has a responsibility to implement the Constitutional philosophy of social justice. We need to evolve mechanisms through proper studies and democratic debate to implement affirmative action in the private sector, keeping in mind competition, efficiency and social justice. There are new challenges like the gig economy. How do we implement affirmative action there? We need to think along these lines. You have recommended increasing reservation for SCs to 17% (from 15%) and for STs to 7% (from 3%) in Karnataka, which will breach the 50% cap. Do you think this is the way forward? Is it feasible? The Supreme Court has not given any scientific rationale for the 50% cap on reservation. Hearing a petition in connection with the Maratha reservation issue, the SC is now revisiting its 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment that put this cap and has issued notices to several States. Many, including Karnataka, have filed affidavits to expand reservation beyond 50%. In orders subsequent to the 1992 judgment, the apex court had also said the norm can be relaxed in exceptional circumstances. Nine States have already instituted reservation beyond 50%. The 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) that the Union government brought in also breached the 50% cap. We need to make a strong case for removing the cap. For instance, the Karnataka government carried out a socio-economic survey of all castes and communities in the State in 2015-16. This survey can form the basis for expanding the reservation pie. The idea of merit and efficiency is sometimes unfairly interpreted in the context of reservation. How do we evaluate merit in the context of denial of opportunities? Given that even the 50% quota is a faraway dream, manifested in its lack of meaningful implementation, doesn’t the prescription for a higher cap seem like grandstanding? Increasing reservation beyond the existing 50% cap will only lead to a better and more equitable redistribution of the pie, a lack of which is also a serious problem. But to better achieve social justice, we need to increase the pie, fill up vacancies; create more jobs; stop disinvestment, outsourcing and contract labour in the public sector; and introduce opportunities in new areas such as super speciality posts, professorships, upper houses of legislature, and the private sector. Do you think our reservation policy needs a complete overhaul to make it more relevant today? There is confusion at the policy level on several issues pertaining to reservation today — reservation in promotion, in the private sector, the 50% cap, the creamy layer, internal reservation to protect weaker communities, guidelines for inclusion and exclusion of communities and classification. Most of these decisions are now taken ad hoc, creating a bigger mess. There is no consistency in the judgments on these matters as well. Moreover, two new aspects have emerged — reservation on the basis of economic backwardness and reservation for locals of a region. The reservation policy also seems outdated, without affirmative action in the private sector. We need to resolve these issues and the entire policy needs to be rehauled and rewritten for today’s needs. We must also first discuss how to deliver the benefits of reservation to communities that have not reaped its benefits in the past seven decades within the reserved category. What can be the starting point for such an exercise? Along the lines of the socio-economic survey or caste census carried out by Karnataka, a census needs to be done at the national level to evaluate the present conditions of various communities. A lot has changed since we finalised the SC-ST and OBC matrix. Only such a national survey can be the starting point of a rehaul of the reservation policy.

For instance, one gentleman from Valasaravakkam, quoted in the PRC-CSCS study, believed that the full form of EVM was ‘Extra Vote Machan’, which is patently incorrect. Nor does EVM stand for ‘Excellent for Vote Manipulation’, as some people on social media have been saying. So what exactly is an EVM? What does it do? And most important, can it be relied upon to safeguard the glorious Indian democracy from the efforts of Opposition parties to win elections? The answer to all these questions is ‘Yes!’ But sadly, these are the wrong questions. They won’t come in the Board exam. The real question, as usual buried by mainstream media, is why are EVMs spreading so much faster than the coronavirus? According to reports in alternative news sites, the most affected States right now are Assam and West Bengal. In Assam, for instance, one of these super-spreader EVMs went to the extent of hijacking a car linked to a BJP leader, causing a repoll and the suspension of four polling officials. Sceptics explain away this dangerous proliferation of EVMs by arguing that elections make EVMs go viral. But that doesn’t explain how EVMs, which are supposed to exist only inside polling booths or other EC-authorised premises or transport vehicles, are turning up at odd places even in States that are not in the middle of elections. Take me, for instance. I live in Delhi. There are no assembly elections going on in Delhi right now. Not that it would matter since the Delhi government, by definition, is not a body of individuals voted to power by the people of Delhi but an unelected bureaucrat — exactly like in the good old days under the East India Company, when ordinary people did not have to travel all the way to a polling booth only to find that the unhackable EVM was sitting in their own imagination all along, right beside free and fair elections. Asymptomatic car In my case, when I took my car for an RT-PCR-EVM test, I was certain it would test negative. But to my shock, it tested positive for EVMs. It was, however, asymptomatic — there was no sign of any actual EVM, either on the seats or in the boot. Nonetheless, given how fast these EVMs spread, as a responsible citizen, I put out a social media post announcing that my car had tested positive for EVM. I requested all car owners who may have used the same roads as me on the same days I did to have their vehicles tested for EVM and quarantine them in any case, if they wished to avoid what I had to undergo. Though I had immediately put my car in quarantine, last Tuesday our kitchen tested positive for EVM. We realised something was wrong when the cake my wife baked came out lotus-shaped even though the mould was heart-shaped. We tried different shapes of cake moulds — oval, square, hexagon, pentagon, dodecahedron — but every time we took the cake out of the oven, it was lotus-shaped. I then called the oven manufacturer’s helpline. They sent over a technician, who took one look at the oven, then at our lotus-shaped cakes, and shook his head dolefully. After taking our permission to inspect the house, he went from room to room, checking out the ceiling, looking behind doors, under the bed, beneath the carpet. The real patient “What’s going on?” I said. “You are only supposed to fix the oven.” “I’m sorry,” the technician said. “Not only is your oven infected, your entire house is EVM-positive.” “What!” I screamed. “How could that be? My EVM-positive car is standing 20 metres away, and that too parked half-illegally, in Mr. Sambasivam’s designated slot.” “It’s not your car,” said the junior technician. “It’s you.” “Excuse me?” “You believe in EVMs, don’t you?” he asked. “Well, I do, but everyone believes in EVMs!” “I know,” he said, “That’s why it’s called a pandemic.” “But it’s not my belief alone,” I said. “It’s an objective fact that EVMs are unhackable, tamper-proof, and make elections faster, efficient, and immune to booth-capturing, rigging or any other form of electoral fraud.” “That’s a very, very pat response,” he said. “Typical of a patient who is EVM-positive.” “So what happens to me now?” “You might come down with a fatal case of electoral autocracy.” “Oh my god! Is there no vaccine for this?” “There is,” he said. “It is called ballot paper. But unfortunately, in India, vaccine hesitancy is extremely high.”  In Assam, for instance, one of these super-spreader EVMs went to the extent of hijacking a car linked to a BJP leader, causing a repoll and the suspension of four polling officials||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/are-you-evm-positive/article34293712.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Out of coverage area||Nandankari Padma, 30, is a mother of three who lives in Andhra Pradesh. Her husband, Nandarkar Bhanuchander, was a driver in Saudi Arabia. He earned around Rs. 19,000 a month and remitted around Rs. 10,000 home. Padma ran her household with that. Then, in August 2020, Bhanuchander died of COVID-19 in the U.A.E.. Padma, forced to fend for herself and her children — all under 10 — became a daily labourer. “I started to work in a nearby paddy field. We have to live,” she said. She earns around Rs. 200 a day but gets work for only 10-20 days a month. “I don’t know what to do. We didn’t get any compensation from the company in the Gulf my husband worked for. After he died, even his body didn’t come home,” said Padma. As of December 31, 2020, the pandemic had claimed 2,072 Indian lives on foreign soil, according to statistics from the Ministry of External Affairs, provided in response to a question in the Rajya Sabha. Of these, 1,892 died in the six Arabian Gulf countries of Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait, which together have around 89 lakh Indians in residence. The highest death toll, of 906 people, was in Saudi Arabia, followed by 375 in the U.A.E., 369 in Kuwait, 66 in Oman, 48 in Bahrain and 34 in Qatar. And now, the WHO says both cases and deaths are on an upward trajectory in the region. Sr. Josephine Valarmathi of the National Domestic Workers Movement in Tamil Nadu said, “I know at least two dozen families in Tamil Nadu who have lost relatives in the Gulf due to the pandemic, but nobody has got any compensation. None of these families has any insurance cover either.” Rexy Beuatlin R., 21, and her brother Adlin Rahul R., 19, live in Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district. They lost their father, Raja Kumar Thankappan, in May 2020 . He died of COVID-19 while working as a mason in the U.A.E. He had paid Rs. 72,000 to a recruiting agent to get the job, and had taken a Rs. 3 lakh loan to pay for Rexy and Adlin’s education. The two siblings, whose mother died in an accident eight years ago, have to repay the loans. “My brother has dropped out of school and is working in a restaurant. The loans are scaring us,” said Rexy. Holes in the scheme The Indian government has an insurance scheme, Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY), for Indians who migrate to foreign countries for work. However, the scheme is mandatory only for those who come under the Emigration Check Required (ECR) category. As people with educational qualifications of Class 10 and above are eligible for non-ECR passports — except for some professions such as nursing, which require emigration clearance irrespective of educational qualification — PBBY in effect does not become mandatory for all migrants, even if they are going to an ECR country. The PBBY was launched in 2003 and amended in 2006, 2008, and 2017, with the overarching objective of strengthening the coverage of migrant workers. The premium is Rs. 275 for two years or Rs. 375 for three years. Presently, the scheme provides insurance cover of Rs. 10 lakh in case of accidental death or permanent disability. However, as deaths caused by a pandemic like COVID-19 don’t fall under either of these categories, they are not covered by the scheme. Expanding the net Bheem Reddy Mandha, migrant rights activist and president of the Telangana-based Emigrants Welfare Forum, is advocating for PBBY to be revised so that it covers all Indian migrant workers abroad, regardless of their ECR/ ECNR status. “I understand that companies in the Gulf are struggling financially due to the pandemic. Providing health insurance is difficult, but if the government revises PBBY, it could be helpful,” he said. Government statistics show that there are around 90 lakh Indians working in the six GCC countries plus Jordan and Lebanon, of whom around 90% are low-paid migrant workers. “Such workers are always at a disadvantage when it comes to access to healthcare and other basic rights. We need to revise the PBBY scheme,” said Mandha. Philip K. Philip heads a group insurance company in the Gulf. He pointed out that if PBBY is enhanced by increasing the premium slightly, the policy could cover death or disability due to other causes, including disease. “The number of migrant workers is huge, and the insurance market would be very much interested in bundling the life policy along with a medical expenses policy at a premium,” he said. Occupational hazard Globally, some 50 countries are already seeing COVID-19 as an occupational disease and are providing insurance cover for workers, according to a note prepared by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in February 2021. A few, like Switzerland, classify it as an occupational disease primarily for healthcare workers, while others like Argentina extend this to all essential workers. Some countries including Canada, the U.K. and India — under Section 3 of the Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923 — classify it as an occupational disease on a case-by-case basis. Unfortunately, the Gulf countries are missing from the ILO note. According to the ILO, infection by COVID-19, if contracted as a result of work, can be considered a work or employment injury. The ILO says such injuries come under the scope of the Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964, and the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952. This would entitle workers in such cases to healthcare and, to the extent that they are incapacitated for work, cash benefits or compensation. Replying to an emailed query, Thiruvananthapuram MP and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said he agreed with the idea of expanding the insurance cover. “Insurance schemes for migrant workers should always cover illnesses and not just accidents. The government can certainly do so, but it would have financial implications,” he said, adding that he would raise the issue in Parliament. Suresh S., 38, an oil rig worker in Kuwait, said it would be a blessing for many migrant workers if the government expanded PBBY or rolled out some sort of insurance package covering pandemic outbreaks. “My roommate died of COVID-19 in Kuwait in July 2020. He was just 43. He has a wife and two schoolgoing children. I know the family is struggling. There are many like him. It is high time the Indian government thinks of providing an insurance scheme that covers sickness too,” he said. The writer is a migrant rights researcher and independent journalist.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Fresh light on Jallianwala||The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a hundred and two years ago this Baisakhi, fundamentally changed the tempo and direction of India’s freedom struggle. Gandhi, convinced that cooperation with the colonial government was not possible after this “wanton cruelty and inhumanity almost unparalleled in modern times” returned his war service medals and became an implacable foe of the Raj; Tagore renounced his knighthood; Lenin deplored the shooting and Churchill denounced the massacre as a “monstrous event.” A turning point, according to Nehru, in Anglo-Indian relations, the event shook India’s faith in British justice and good intentions and set the stage not only for Gandhi’s non-violent struggle but also for determined political resistance in Punjab and the emergence of revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh. Yet, for an event that has become a metaphor for racial brutality and inhumanity, there was surprisingly little scholarship attached to it in the decades that followed; perhaps its ramifications were still being played out. There were hagiographic or defensive books such as A Life of General Dyer by Ian Colvin, Massacre at Amritsar by Rupert Furneaux and Six Minutes to Sunset by Arthur Swinson. But the massive material available — the official records, the evidence collected by the Disorders Inquiry Committee (popularly known as the Hunter Commission) and the rival Congress Inquiry Committee, the Parliamentary debates in London, the oral histories of survivors and witnesses — was fittingly waiting for a scholar from Amritsar, born only a short distance away from the scene of the crime, to do it full justice. Deep empathy That V.N. Datta certainly did in his 1969 work Jallianwala Bagh , now republished by Penguin with a preface by his daughter and distinguished historian, Nonica Datta; an enlightening interview with her father in his last days adds fresh value to the volume. Datta had a deep empathy for Amritsar given his insider’s instinctive feel and the experience of growing up amidst the shared memories of suffering, pain and horror caused by the massacre. This empathy, combined with a professional historian’s clinical approach, is evident behind this magisterial treatment of the massacre. Besides his focus on oral histories and private papers, Datta’s work was enriched by his discovery in 1966 of Volumes VI and VII of the Hunter Commission evidence. These volumes, which included secret reports of the British government and in-camera evidence — including critical testimonies by Punjab’s Lieutenant Governor Sir Michael O’Dwyer (assassinated by Udham Singh in 1940) and Chief secretary J.P. Thompson — had been suppressed on grounds of political and military exigencies. Datta later edited and published this material as New Light on the Punjab Disturbances in 1919 ; the volume is now a rich resource for subsequent scholarship. Datta’s wide-angle approach treats the massacre not as an isolated episode but as a clash between nationalist aspirations and imperial policies. The build-up is a layered one: the Ghadar movement, the inadequacy of moderate Congress methods, Gandhi’s emergence, the First World War, international trends towards self-determination and the woefully short Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms towards eventual self-government in India. Stifling dissent The War had cost India dearly in men and materials: war gifts and loans, rising prices of essential goods, new taxes and harsh recruitment policies had added to the tribulations of famines, failing harvests and plague outbreaks. Punjab was the hardest hit: with just one-thirteenth of the country’s population, it had contributed 60% of the recruits. O’Dwyer, an arch-imperialist, had ruled the province with an iron hand for six years, stifling all dissent and opposition. The iniquitous Rowlatt Act was a spark thrown on this tinderbox; one third of all hartals against this Act took place in Punjab. The deportation on April 10 of the popular Punjab leaders Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal resulted in direct clashes between the people and the authorities. In the ensuing violence, five Europeans and about 20 Indians were killed and the missionary, Marcella Sherwood, was assaulted. The stage was set for the arrival of Brigadier General Dyer, the massacre of April 13 and the imposition of Martial Law. Datta uses textual evidence and witness accounts to detail these days without exaggeration or nationalistic grandstanding. He concludes that about 700 people were killed on April 13 and the possibility of the agent provocateur Hans Raj conniving with the British is not ruled out. He humanises the crowd to reveal that it was no gathering of political activists but of ordinary citizens, farmers, craftsmen and labourers and that there were no women present. He dismisses the specious argument that Dyer’s arteriosclerosis was responsible for impaired judgment and demonstrates Dyer’s cold-blooded planning and clinical use of maximum force to teach the people of Punjab a lesson. Encouraged by his superiors and the laudatory British press, he was convinced that he had performed his rightful duty with distinction. The book goes beyond the massacre to analyse the conclusions of the Hunter Commission, the Parliamentary debates in London and the impact on India’s freedom struggle. If one has to read only one book on this tragic episode of Indian history, then this slim volume — path-breaking, authentic, balanced and sober — is all one needs to read.  The reviewer is the former Ambassador of India to the U.S. and High Commissioner to the U.K. He is the author of the novelThe Exileand of several other works of fiction and non-fiction.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||English Vinglish||I have recently moved to Switzerland and enrolled as a student of French, one of the four national languages of the country. Having been introduced to French, I now find myself eavesdropping on conversations in buses and shops. Disjointed words spring out of billboards, falling like Tetris blocks in front of my eyes. Catchy songs on the local radio play in a loop in my head. French is the world’s most romantic language, goes the cliché. I am not sure about the romance, but my travails with it are certainly humorous. What I read aloud is not what I hear. What I see is not what I speak. ‘What is this’ in French is pronounced Keskesey , but the written words are Qu’est-ce que c’est .  Silent letters are plentiful in French, almost silent words too. I won’t be surprised if I encounter silent sentences. I am now unlearning English in order to learn French, as there are words that mean one thing in English and quite another in French. Actuellement in French doesn’t mean ‘actually’, and a librairie is a ‘bookshop’. These false friends are everywhere, lurking in corners, luring me into their trap. My feeble attempts at pronouncing the letter R, meant to sound like a gentle breath of fresh air, sound like I am clearing my throat. My French teacher laughs when I complain. “We like to complicate things in French,” she remarks wryly. But beneath all the complaints and mirth there is something very rewarding about learning a new language. It opens up a wondrous window to a new culture, altering perceptions. Jingle jangle My love for languages began in Mumbai, India’s very own Babel. As a Hindi- and English-speaking inhabitant of the city, I was multilingual even before I knew what that meant. Every lane of Mumbai jangled with multiple tongues — a smattering of Gujarati, Kutchi and Marwari in kirana shops; Konkani in the Catholic colonies; the lesser-known Tullu in Udupi restaurants; an ensemble of Bengali, Sindhi and Tamil in the ladies’ compartments of local trains. A few years later, I picked up a smattering of Punjabi while working as a trainee on the shop floor of a factory in Moga, Punjab. This language, hearty and earthy in equal measure, was special. My earnest effort at communicating in colloquial Punjabi immediately opened hearts and forged an indelible bond with the place. Then I moved to the Greater China region and immersed myself in Mandarin. I realised that Mandarin’s uniqueness lay in its ability to be surprisingly simple yet labyrinthine at the same time. Spoken Mandarin doesn’t have genders; there is little grammar and fewer rules compared to most other languages. The Mandarin ecosystem is a sensorial one. It is phonetic, replete with homophones. There are four distinct tones, which to the untrained ear can sound quite the same. Lifting the veil Most tone-deaf foreigners like me lazily take refuge in the hope that the context of conversation will make us understood. Ma ma ma ma can be quite meaningless if spoken in a staccato fashion. But once you learn to stress the right tones, it transforms into something a bit more comprehensible (‘Is the mother berating a horse?’). Mandarin soon became more than a language to me. It lifted the veil from a previously distant Chinese culture and allowed me to enter the lives of its people.  Now, as I navigate my way in a new world and continue to struggle with the complexities of French tense and grammar — learning ‘to be’ in the present with the past participle while regularising the irregular verb — the process is also quietly teaching me to stay in the present, in real time. People ask why, in a world overflowing with translation apps, emojis, memojis and Twitterised lingo, one should bother learning new languages. I reply, but translation apps won’t bring me the essence of a society, its people and culture. Sure, emojis can entertain, but they hardly seek to understand.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Politics, power and pangolins||As we wind our way down to Diphu from Guwahati through large farms and rolling hills, our driver tells us that this “vastness” is what attracts Bangladeshi immigrants to India. “They think all this is free land,” he says. We can sense his simmering resentment towards immigrants, a sentiment that contributes significantly to the politically charged atmosphere of this region. The district of Karbi Anglong, Assam’s largest district, is home to a diversity of human cultures that include tribes such as Karbis, Bodos, Kukis, Dimasas, Hmars, Garos, Rengma Nagas, Tiwas, and Man. This district also has a history of political unrest. It is administered by the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) and has seen a long-drawn struggle for the creation of an autonomous State within Assam. Caught in the middle of this socio-political turmoil is a silent entity: wildlife. Located adjacent to Kaziranga National Park on one side and Nagaland on the other, Karbi Anglong has an official forest cover of over 40%. And the district is home to tigers, rhinos, leopards, elephants, pangolins and more.  Interplay of power We are here to study how illegal wildlife trade features in the day-to-day politics that play out along the Indo-Myanmar border; to understand how wildlife trade is used to construct political identities; and how it features in the interplay of power between different people. The prized rhino horns are poached in Kaziranga in Assam, carried through Karbi Anglong, transported across Nagaland, and then sent to the border town of Moreh in Manipur. From Moreh, traffickers are said to transport the horn to the town of Tamu across the border in Myanmar, and eventually to the Golden Triangle. In June 2020, the Karbi Anglong police arrested three people for their involvement in a rhino poaching case in Kaziranga. This January, one person was arrested at the district’s Dilai check post for the illegal possession of a rhino horn, which was believed to be on its way to be sold in Dimapur in Nagaland. As we try to understand the role of political unrest and economic instability in facilitating illegal wildlife trade, we piece together a troubling narrative. “Normally, politicians don’t see this [wildlife trade] as an issue at all,” says an activist-turned-politician, who requests anonymity. “If it does become an issue, it’s not for the love of wildlife but a purely political blame-game about how a particular party wasn’t able to control poaching.” Poaching, according to him, is not a natural option for local people. “They don’t want to kill animals and sell horns. But sometimes, they get induced by easy money or are forced by circumstances. If people have a reliable source of income, they won’t go in for this option. Those who are involved get protection from powerful people.” Nature at the apex As we walk across Diphu, a town painted in the traditional Karbi colours of black, red and white, and proudly displaying the Jambili Athon on cross-roads, walls and parks, we realise how the lives of the people of these hills and their natural surroundings are inextricably intertwined. The Jambili Athon, with its central axis and a whorl of four branches with different species of birds perched on them, is a recurring reminder of the significance of nature in Karbi tribal art. At the apex of the axis is the racket-tailed drongo, locally known as vojaru, and below this are grey-capped pygmy woodpeckers. A tea vendor tells us that the drongo’s tail feathers are used as decorative head-gear for men during important rituals. In traditional Karbi homes, these feathers are often safely stored in the hollow of a bamboo hung from the roof. “If these are passed down over generations, new birds aren’t hunted, but we do see the feathers sold during local festivals,” says the tea vendor. Such traditional interrelationships between Karbi culture and wildlife prevail in many aspects of life here, including in the use of animal parts in rituals and medicines. A 2014 study lists 19 mammals, 10 insects, nine birds, and four reptiles used by Karbi healers to treat 54 diseases, including asthma, cancer and respiratory problems. The discourse on hunting in these parts is shaped by dynamic social norms that try to negotiate the complexities of tradition, indigenous medicine, an emerging conservation ethos, and the law. Hunting in several parts of the Northeast is viewed as a traditional right. Historically, hunting has been regulated through taboos in order to safeguard against over-hunting. A study on hoolock gibbons finds that Karbis do not normally hunt and eat these apes as they consider them kin — a ‘Karbi sent to the jungle for his misdeeds’. Hunting traditions are now formally outlawed. We ask an official from the KAAC Forest Department how the discordance between traditional culture and law affects the implementation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “Yes,” he says, “hunting has always been part of Karbi culture but not the commercial part of it.” This is pertinent given that the Northeast has increasingly become a hotspot for illegal trade, with reports of various species crossing the border in these parts. Between August 2019 and March 2021, we recorded from media reports over 80 cases of wildlife crime in the Northeast, involving over 12 species including pangolins, elephants, rhinos, tigers and leopards. The Forest Department officer also speaks of an administrative gap. “We don’t have a wildlife division here due to political reasons,” he says. Indeed, despite the four notified wildlife sanctuaries that form roughly 3.5% of the district’s geographical area, there is no wildlife division under the Forest Department. Cries for autonomy Even some of the areas contiguous with the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve that fall under the autonomous hill district of Karbi Anglong have not been notified. Therefore, funds under centrally sponsored schemes such as the National Tiger Conservation Authority do not trickle down to Karbi Anglong directly. A former KAAC member explains, “No share of that fund comes to us directly and it is for such issues that we have been demanding an autonomous State for a long time.” The next leg of our journey takes us to West Karbi Anglong to meet the leader of one such group demanding autonomy and currently signatory to a ceasefire with the government. We have come across at least 17 media articles in the period between August 2015 and 2020 in which armed insurgent groups like this one have been directly or indirectly associated with rhino horn poaching and trade. Documented reports include incidents covering poaching and smuggling of rhino horn, weapons and cash, and related investigative arrests. But the leader says: “Groups like ours get named in such cases because the government wants to take our weapons. Rhino poachers do not belong to any group. Some surrendered people of certain groups may be involved. We have been subjected to different forms of divide and rule by everyone from the Home Ministry to corrupt local politicians. Our only focus is to get Article 244 (A) [that allows for the creation of an autonomous State within Assam].” Cultural imposition The group links its victimisation claims to the government’s refusal to share constitutional authority; the imposition of Assamese culture on tribal people; and the migration of people from neighbouring areas to Karbi Anglong. “Once we get autonomy, we will take responsibility. We will protect the rhinos,” the leader says. The tussle to protect and control natural resources further strains the relationships between state and citizen and is occasionally marked by violence. As recently as March 4, a suspected timber smuggler was shot dead by the Forest Department staff of the Garampani Wildlife Sanctuary in Karbi Anglong. This was not a one-off incident — conflicts around the extraction of natural resources have led to casualties on both sides regularly over the years. While the political unrest continues to affect the smooth functioning of natural resource management, it is heartening to see the younger generation highly inclined towards conservation, initiating efforts to create awareness about the threats faced by endangered species such as the pangolin within their communities. On February 18, at the 47th Karbi Youth Festival in Diphu (one of the largest and oldest ethnic festivals in the country), a pangolin awareness campaign titled ‘Save Karpu (pangolin), Save Karbi Pride’ was launched. Joyhind Engleng, a filmmaker and social worker, says, “While working with the community I realised that we Karbis face similar disadvantages and challenges as the endangered pangolin does. I believe that we hold the power to mobilise conservation sentiments among ourselves.” Kangjang Terang, chairman of Panchayat & Rural Development under the KAAC, says, “With time, the Karbi cultural connection with nature must change into action.” Polling has just concluded in Assam. None of the manifestos of the contesting parties mentioned wildlife conservation or any other environmental issue. However, we can draw some little solace from the youth movements in the region. As Engleng says, “The future is full of hope. If we get opportunities to work together for a cause, the change will come from within us.” The writers are part of the Counter Wildlife Trafficking Team at Wildlife Conservation Society, India.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Enemy of modernity||H ind Swaraj (1909) is the only book that Gandhi wrote in Gujarati and translated himself. Even his autobiography, the work we know as The Story of My Experiments with Truth , was translated by somebody else — his secretary, Mahadev Desai. Hind Swaraj is written as a dialogue, with Gandhi himself asking questions as ‘Reader’ and replying as ‘Editor’. It is a Socratic or Platonic work in that sense. He does say that it is a faithful record of conversations he had with someone in South Africa, but it seems obvious that this declaration is merely a means of contextualising pre-existing questions and answers. Like Savarkar’s work Hindutva, Hind Swaraj is more a booklet than a book. It is a work of opinion, primarily, and is quite an eccentric work, if by eccentric we mean bizarre. Gandhi develops the idea of passive resistance quite well, and it is found fully formed here years before he returned to India in 1915. This is perhaps the book’s only saving grace. Real education For Gandhi, real education is not the sciences but the development of character: “Our ancient school system is enough.” Higher education is futile, for he says that he studied Geography, Astronomy, Algebra, Geometry, but could make no use of them. “I must emphatically say that the sciences I have enumerated above I have never been able to use for controlling my senses,” he says. He gives another example of why education is useless: “A peasant earns his bread honestly. He has ordinary knowledge of the world. He knows fairly well how he should behave towards his parents, his wife, his children and his fellow-villagers. He understands and observes the rules of morality. But he cannot write his own name. What do you propose to do by giving him a knowledge of letters?” He dislikes all aspects of modernity, which he finds immoral. “Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin,” he says. The railways are bad because they spread bubonic plague. Trains made pilgrimage accessible, thereby reducing the value of the penitent devotee (“Nowadays rogues visit them in order to practise their roguery”). Gandhi dislikes lawyers and doctors and wants the professions abolished: “My firm opinion is that the lawyers have enslaved India, have accentuated Hindu-Mahomedan dissensions and have confirmed English authority.” Men suffered under the modern justice system because “they became more unmanly and cowardly when they resorted to the courts of law.” All this leads to the well-known conclusion that machinery is evil: “It is machinery that has impoverished India.” Hundred snakes The following paragraph mixes his opinions, prejudices and distaste for anything that helped man out of his primitive state: “Machinery is like a snake-hole which may contain from one to a hundred snakes. Where there is machinery there are large cities; and where there are large cities, there are tram-cars and railways; and there only does one see electric light. English villages do not boast of any of these things. Honest physicians will tell you that where means of artificial locomotion have increased, the health of the people has suffered. I remember that when in a European town there was a scarcity of money, the receipts of the tramway company, of the lawyers and of the doctors went down and people were less unhealthy. I cannot recall a single good point in connection with machinery.”  Hind Swaraj is brief but it is Gandhi’s primary work of philosophy. He kept returning to it. As his fame grew, people began to wonder at its absurd pronouncements. Gandhi felt the need to defend himself. In 1933, he wrote in Harijan that his mind was evolving with time and his positions on some things he had spoken of in Hind Swaraj might have changed. “I would like to say to the diligent reader of my writings and to others who are interested in them that I am not at all concerned with appearing to be consistent. In my search after Truth I have discarded many ideas and learnt many new things. Old as I am in age, I have no feeling that I have ceased to grow inwardly or that my growth will stop at the dissolution of the flesh.” Yet, in 1938 he wrote that in the 30 years since Hind Swaraj was written, “I have seen nothing to make me alter the views expounded in it.” There is much to admire in this great man and yet, on reading this seminal work, there is also a lot to be wary of. Hind Swaraj remains a remarkable document.  Hind Swarajis brief but it is Gandhi’s primary work of philosophy.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Detective Ghalib investigates||The year 1857 catches at our collective imagination: the heroic, doomed endeavour, the mix of high and low who joined the fight for freedom, the horrific reprisals. Murder at the Mushaira begins on the moonlit night of May 2, 1857, with a messenger galloping to Delhi carrying a letter for the rebels, a posse of East India Company soldiers in hot pursuit. It ends in September with the uprising’s defeat and a whole city, its traditions and way of life, systematically dismembered. In between, in the run-up to the uprising, there is a murder during a mushaira at the grand haveli of Nawab Iftikar Hasan. The victim, a poet called Sukhan Khairabadi, has been stabbed to death with an agate-handled dagger. He is a rather dodgy character, thought to be a spy in the pay of the East India Company, and worse, a second-rate poet. Company officials, already uneasy over the widespread anger over greased cartridges, fear the murder is connected to a broader discontent. High tension The investigation is handed over to the Naib Kotwal of Chandni Chowk, Kirorimal Chainsukh, who, realising someone familiar with the mushaira scene would be invaluable, enlists the help of the legendary poet Mirza Ghalib. It is a time of high tension. Resentment at the Company’s arrogance and greed is widespread among Indians but their power is feared and their informers are everywhere. Meanwhile, the Mughal world is collapsing. In the vacuum, loyalties are shifting and old ties being betrayed. There is an array of characters, some fictional, some historical. The latter include Ghalib, Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, the junior magistrate Theophilus Metcalfe, the poet Daagh, the Delhi College professor Master Ramachandra, the publisher Munshi Nawal Kishore, and others. Beguiling universe There are any number of potential suspects — the owner of the haveli, Nawab Iftikar, his wife and daughter, their large retinue of staff and their very many guests, not to mention all the poets who attended the mushaira . As Ghalib, aided by Master Ramachandra, sets out to unravel the complexities of the crime, it becomes apparent that the murder and the larger conspiracy of the rebellion are connected. As the investigation progresses, he is drawn into the rebels’ plans. There are twists and turns aplenty but what makes Murder at the Mushaira such an engaging read is the plethora of period detail. The sights, sounds and smells of Shahjahanabad spill out of every page — life in a grand haveli; the maze of busy thoroughfares and narrow, winding alleys; a high-class tavern where English wine is available; the shadow-barred courtyard of a small mosque — all make for a densely imagined and beguiling universe. Alternative account Such forays into the past are not new in crime fiction. Historical detectives have a long and prestigious pedigree, having apprehended murderers in times and places as far apart as ancient Rome, medieval Shrewsbury, and Jazz Age Australia. Their stories, however, have quite a few themes in common, attesting to the fact that human nature remains the same. Murder at the Mushaira fits well into this category. The rebellion of 1857 is one of the defining moments of Indian history. For a century, the British version pitched it as a mutiny by disgruntled, violent soldiers with tropes of black holes and inhuman violence against memsahibs and children, as well as a chaotic, fratricidal Indian leadership. Raza Mir gives the alternative account. While the murder mystery is sometimes over-complicated, the character of Ghalib is beautifully drawn — he is a man of a detached, worldly kindness who recognises the uprising’s potential but also sees its weaknesses, and is eager to protect those he can from the consequences of its failure. The novel is a tender, vividly detailed portrait of Delhi in the throes of calamitous change and the last days of the graceful Mughal world.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The man without a badge||Sri Lankan author Ashok Ferrey can be called the uncrowned king of Colpetty, having animated and immortalised this multi-ethnic Colombo neighbourhood in his smash-hit debut collection of stories, Colpetty People . He is also many other things — a personal trainer of ‘the rich and infamous’ as a meme would have it; a builder-architect who has created his own opulent retreat in the Sri Lankan capital, having learnt the trade during his coolie years in London slumlands. However, he is most celebrated as a writer, specifically one with an unending fascination for the ‘aunties’ of Colpetty. Tasty bites As Mrs. Herath, a Colpetty Aunty in the story, ‘Ice-Cream Karma’, warms to her theme: “‘Let me tell you the Sad Story of my Life,’ she began, and everyone immediately stopped listening.” Ferrey, on the other hand, glides shark-like into the warm waters of post-colonial turmoil, takes tasty bites of every conventional trope about losers and winners in the battle of survival, and swims away with all the prizes. Helping him in this endeavour in his latest novel, The Unmarriageable Man , is protagonist Sanjay de Silva, who begins life in Colombo but migrates to 80s’ London, as Ferrey himself did. Free the spirits In The Unmarriageable Man , Ferrey appears like a cross between Prospero of The Tempest , who could famously control the spirits of his tropical island with a clap of his hands, and Trevor Noah, the comic show host from South Africa, with a baby face and a caustic tongue. He is both a conjuror of daily dramas and a wisecracking wit. There is also the ebullience of a young Hanif Kureishi and his adventures with the ‘beautiful launderette’ in Sanjay’s attempt to ingratiate himself with the layers of immigrant life in early Thatcher-era Brixton. However, unlike Kureishi and definitely unlike Noah, who capitalise on their religious and racial otherness, Ferrey, or Sanjay, does not wear badges identifying himself or asking for recognition in a foreign land. Going by stock definitions, the story is a coming-of-age saga. In Ferrey’s hand, Sanjay’s journey becomes a process of ‘setting the spirits free’. As Sanjay learns while rebuilding a crumbling house with a mixed bag of skilled migrant workers, we are all immigrants at some point or the other. As such, you might as well learn to live with the dictionary of epithets that includes such terms as Asian-Indian, Paki, darki, black, wog, woofter, and worse. The spirit of Sanjay’s father, Louis de Silva, animates the novel at many levels, levitating across countries. Sanjay’s tormented relationship with him can be traced back to Ferrey’s own experience of looking after his father when he was sick with cancer. After swinging between the last days of Sanjay’s father’s decline into infantilism and decay and Sanjay’s own quest for redemption in the arms of the luscious Janine, we get what might be called a Netflix nirvana ending. Never mind, Ferrey is still a brilliant storyteller. The Chennai-based writer is a critic and cultural commentator.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The dismantling of the Khan Market Gang and the rise of a new elite||The ascent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the national arena has disrupted politics as we knew it. The dominance of Modi and that of the Bharatiya Janata Party over political discourse and elections, both national and Assembly, sometimes winning a State even when the party had no footprint there, has dismantled coalition politics that was prevalent over the last 30 years. Political commentators and sociologists have been exploring ideas and templates to capture the nature of the changes that this electoral dominance has engendered. On the electoral side, political scientists claim that India has now entered a phase where the BJP is in a position once occupied by the Congress. In India’s Power Elite , Sanjaya Baru tries to capture not just the churn brought about by the 2014 general election and the decline of the Congress in the political sphere, but its impact on the social and cultural landscape, and the nuts and bolts that make up India’s elite. Lutyens’ Delhi The received wisdom currently is that Prime Minister Modi has no interest in adjusting or co-opting the existing elite in Delhi unlike his predecessors including Atal Bihari Vajpayee. By coining phrases like “Lutyens’ Elite” and “Khan Market Gang”, Modi has drawn a very clear line between himself, representing a subaltern upsurge, versus the patronage-driven cosmopolitan elite in Delhi. According to Baru, a “mix of Hindu nationalism and anti-elitism has become the basis of a new phase in Indian politics that many believe defines what Modi has termed as ‘New India’.” Baru examines all these concepts in detail and finds that a new elite is being constructed or that the old elite is being infused by a large population of the new elite. Looking at theoretical constructs on what constitutes elitism, taking into its sweep writings by C. Wright Mills, Antonio Gramsci, M.N. Srinivas to Andre Beteille, this book is a bird’s eye view on the larger question of the construction of elites, the social classes they are drawn from, access to education and whether these theories can be applied to India. Sangh Parivar’s plan It is also about the larger drive currently underway by the Sangh Parivar of establishing a certain ideological hegemony riding on not just electoral victory, state patronage and capture of government institutions, but also by deploying diffused influences like the media, celebrities and the Indian diaspora in other countries. For this, Baru does not take the year 2014 (as many have done in countless opinion pieces) as the watershed. He goes back to immediate pre-independence India, and the seeds of the new elite that came into being post independence, political scientist Rajni Kothari’s Congress network, and the early outliers to this system. In India’s provincial capitals, spurred by the exigencies of electoral politics, the vernacular elite was trying to push back. This led to the rise of a new wealthy class in Andhra Pradesh, and the birth of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). The big disruptions of the economic liberalisation project of 1991 and the implementation of the Mandal commission recommendations, in unleashing the power of the Other Backward Classes as a power bloc, accelerated much of this change. Baru refuses to see India’s elites as a static category — there is constant churning and upward and downward mobility. Caste, class, education and access to economic resources, patronage by the state and emergence of electorally significant caste groups have to be seen in totality. He reveals the complexity of this process while also trying to find an Indian template to explain the phenomenon. One of the first such books off the block, it will, hopefully, encourage more work in this field.

As laid out by the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to an island in the Mediterranean Sea. According to a 1848 article, he was supposed to have uttered a seven-word phrase to his physician. What was he supposed to have said that implied he was fine until he saw the island? 2This massive project, from the 1880s to the early 1900s, spearheaded by Ferdinand de Lesseps, promised to revolutionise the shipping industry in America. Lesseps hoped to recreate the success he’d had with a similar project in the Suez a few years earlier. Unfortunately there were many setbacks, including an alarming death rate, but the 82 km-long-project was finally completed in 1914. One of the most famous headlines describing this event were seven words that described Lesseps, his idea, the project and its name. What was the phrase? 3This musical piece played by six pianos uses strict musical procedures to create a piece with great rigour and lightness from what seems to be inconsequential material. Pianos 2 and 5 play harmonic palindromes, pianos 1 and 4 play rhythmic palindromes, and 3 and 6 play a melodic palindrome. The four-word title of the piece implies that at no point is it possible to distinguish the pianos, as well as implying that the music is neither strange nor regular. What is the title? 4Great Lakes Brewery in collaboration with Sawdust City Brewery came up with a drink that had a seven-word name. The drink is a concoction of rum with spicy red pepper. A poster for it shows a pirate in the act of killing someone with a jar of this drink. What is the name of the drink? 5This 2004 film by David Slade is a post-modern existential take on the search for meaning in the modern world. The main character Dr. Awkward and the title of the film symbolise the relentless swing of the pendulum of life. The four-word title is a question that asks if a certain type of waterfowl from the family Anatidae is able to visualise divine beings. What is the title of the film? 6This three-word phrase is often used as the title of books, articles and blogs where palindromes are collected together. The recurring joke is that this phrase is supposed to have been the very first words ever spoken by humankind. It involves a male character from the Bible introducing himself to his partner, who has recently been introduced into his life. What phrase is this? 7One of the most often used palindromes is a term that refers to a very fast car used in professional auto racing. Though usually written as two words, in the U.S. it is written as one word and is rarely seen as a palindrome. What word is this? 8This word from the mid-14th century means ‘made god-like’, which comes from the Latin ‘deus’, which means ‘god’. This seven-letter word basically means ‘treated or worshipped someone or something like a god’. What term is this? 9This nine-letter word refers to a tractor-drawn implement with rotating blades that is used to remove and mix the seed bed on farms. The first part of the name refers to the action it does and the second part is a generic suffix given to many machines (made famous by Dr. Doofenschmirtz).

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A manifesto for torn jeans||The Indian online space has been agog with talk of ripped jeans in the last month or so, thanks to the spectacular foot-in-mouth-itis of Uttarakhand’s newly minted Chief Minister. But that is of very little interest to this column, so look it up if otherwise intrigued. What stood out to me, however, besides the bottom-to-top gaze of the esteemed minister, was the centrality of ripped jeans to this narrative. Yet again, denim or jeans become symbolic of that forever issue of navigating the tense relationship between the local and the global. In a paper called ‘A Manifesto for a Study of Denim’, published in the 2007 issue of Social Anthropology , Daniel Miller and Sophie Woodward argue for blue jeans as the ubiquitous choice for a majority of people in the world. Calling attention to how blue jeans are one of the only garments commonly sold as distressed, they make a case for its simultaneous capacity to be generic as well as individual. Their argument about such “distressing” in particular, traces its origin to the 1970s when “jeans became the most personalised and intimate apparel as they essentially disintegrated on the flesh through being worn to death by the nomadic and relatively impoverished hippies of the time.” I gathered from the above two different things; one, that jeans are symbolic of a universal plugging in to a particular idea of a generic modern; and two, distressed jeans become both a form of rebellion, a plugging out if you will, and an intimate connection with clothing as continuous with the body. Lastly, one’s willingness to wear something down to its threads, literally, may also indicate a relative thrift, either out of compulsion or choice. Thus informed, I conducted my own online trawl for “distressed jeans” and this is what I found. All-American icon Zara advertises distressed jeans as suiting “dressed-down style temperaments”, being “at once cool and contemporary, either for downtime or after dark.” No mention of thrift or poverty or rebellion. Forever 21 merely calls their product as bearing a “distressed design”, sans any context of such a design. And Levi’s? The original home of this all-American icon claims that “Our ripped jeans are perfect for a laid-back look that’s casually slashed to perfection.” And in these oxymoronic words, “casually slashed to perfection”, lies a clue. For what distressed jeans mean is no longer distress. After all, it wouldn’t behove distress to spend Rs. 3000 on casually slashed jeans. Here we go again, as we land upon yet another obscene consumerist appropriation of the cultural lives of thrift and poverty. Let’s lay aside our postmodern analytical impulses for the moment, however. For surely, the draw towards distressed jeans cannot be explained away so easily as inauthentic consumers performing authentic skullduggery. My first pair of distressed jeans resulted from slipping down a hillock. I was all of 12 and came back home, bleeding, scraped knees and all. For the next many years, I wore these jeans as a badge of honour. In this story, I was not merely a bespectacled introvert; I was capable of heroic and ungendered acts such as falling down and living to tell the tale. When my grandmother berated my mother about her refusal to mend my torn jeans, my glee knew no bounds. In my undergraduate years, torn jeans and worn kurtas allowed me membership into those that protested many a political snafu in road marches of much naiveté and great heart. In graduate school, I tore down another pair into comfortable second-skin shorts that saw me through searing Ahmedabad summers of long classes and seemingly endless youth. Something more All this to say, perhaps that this business of tearing down clothing means something more. Even when appropriated by capitalist consumerism. In a society tightly bound to parameters of propriety, gender, and life goals, perhaps all we get to do is tear our clothes. Literally. I would be the first to admit that such an act, symbolic of something is perhaps fated to be just that, a symbol and a nostalgia for possibilities long gone at best. At worst, it is capitalism taking over all our rebellion and packaging it back to us, bow intact. All of it is fated to mean nothing in the face of an overarchingly grim structure characterised by power, violence, entitlement and amnesia. And yet, even symbolically, distressed jeans seem to still rattle institutions and people, perhaps in their capacity to recall other lives and compulsions. For at the other end of this spectrum of distress as costume, are the figures of the madwoman and the madman, in dirty, torn clothes, and matted hair, heralding the end of the world and its rules. And in homage, even as we stay in our lane for the most part, every once in a while, we tear a few things, and let our knees knock around unfettered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-manifesto-for-torn-jeans/article34293725.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Learning to live and be liked||It is often believed that life’s lessons are learnt from scriptures and the enlightened. At times, however, interaction with people around us throws up nuggets of practical wisdom. My granddaughter, at the age of four, was at the dining table, listening intently to her father admonishing her. When he took a long pause, the child asked politely, “Daddy, if you have finished, may I say something?” You can call it the indulgence of a grandmother, but one had to admire her poise and patient listening even while being scolded. I compared her response with those of many adults who butt in, defend, shout, cry and do everything but listening and waiting for an appropriate time to put their own points across. Another day, a neighbour saw my daughter returning from work and soon after, running with her child who was learning to ride a bicycle. The lady asked with genuine concern, “Hey, you just returned from work. Why don’t you rest for a while?” My daughter’s prompt reply was, “Aunty, it’s not her fault that I am working.” My neighbour, a former colleague of mine, and I wondered if we had prioritised the needs of our children over professional commitments. I remembered waiting for my daughter to come from school, laying out lunch for her and trying to give her company. But quite often, I would feel exhausted and tell her to clear the table while I would rush off to sleep before returning to work for the afternoon. When I narrated this with a pang of guilt, my daughter reassured, “Mom, you actually showed that mothers have to do other things.” She expressed genuine empathy. Poise, patient listening, setting priorities and empathy may be inherent in some; if not, they can be developed through training and practice. But the ability to “forgive and forget” seems to be a rare trait and the lack of it leads to anger, revenge and ill feelings. My mother, approaching 90, has been guided by the Thirukural . Her favourite couplet, “ Inna seitharai oruvar avar naana nannayam seithu vidal ”, means, “If anyone harms, you make him feel ashamed by doing a good deed in return.” The act of forgiveness enunciated by the Tamil sage Thiruvalluvar and non-violence practised by Mahatma Gandhi hold the key to control anger, revenge and frustration. An ordinary person too can strive to lead a life of fewer conflicts and better peace by emulating worthy examples in real life. The recent demise of a former colleague and the fact that he was remembered by everyone who came into contact with him for his gracious behaviour at all times rekindled fond memories. During his life and in his death, he reiterated what Maya Angelou, an American poet, had said, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” Everyone would like to be liked, but fond feelings cannot be ordered. They need to be developed by taking a genuine interest in others and behaving in a caring, uncritical manner. It is good to remember that no one is perfect and everyone has some flaws. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, the renowned Swiss-American psychiatrist has phrased it well, “I am not okay, you are not okay and that’s okay!” Life’s lessons can be learnt from those around us — if only we observe, reflect upon, imbibe and evolve. vijayacardio@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/learning-to-live-and-be-liked/article34293662.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Business and social welfare||“A business,” American industrialist Henry Ford observed, “that makes nothing but money is a poor business.” If minting money is an ethical issue in domains such as politics, education, sports and such other fields, it is quite understandable. After all, the end of these fields is not profit-making. But the problem arises when we think that making money is not a virtue in the domain of business which comes into being solely for the sake of profit-making. Ethical factors, therefore, are more complicated, nuanced and intriguing in the field of business than in any other human activity. They pose challenges not only to businessmen and women, but also to thinkers. It is in this context that Bengaluru-based philosopher Sundar Sarukkai, in his JRD Tata and the Ethics of Philanthropy, takes up the challenge of untangling the problems of ethics in the field of business by analysing the exemplary work of Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata. JRD, as Sarukkai’s book shows, introduced an ethical dimension to the corporate world as early as the beginning of the 20th century. Notion of trusteeship While there are multiple narratives that document the biographical self of JRD and the achievements of the Tatas, Sarukkai has attempted something different — the analysis of JRD’s ideas, especially his understanding of philanthropy. In eight chapters, the author illuminates on philosophical ideas related to the ethics of philanthropy as JRD envisaged and practised it. These chapters are organised around key themes such as trusteeship, the relationship between business and social welfare, the notion of the private and the public, the idea of profit, and social ethics. The book argues that ‘for JRD, business without philanthropy could not be imagined’. The second chapter, thus, discusses the problems in the field of ‘Ethics of Philanthropy’, thereby preparing the reader for the following chapters which examine how the question of philanthropy was an essential part of what it meant for JRD to be an entrepreneur and a leader. The book is written with the conviction that in JRD’s philosophy there is ‘a possibility of finding newer paradigms for social development in today’s world’. JRD’s concept of trusteeship, among others, serves Sarukkai to demonstrate this conviction. Accordingly, the third chapter ‘Trusteeship’ shows how JRD, influenced by Gandhi, viewed his wealth only as a trustee on behalf of others. The remaining chapters subsequently illustrate JRD’s understanding of the relation between business and philanthropy. Present-day critique JRD grew up as India was growing into a nation, and the connection between JRD and the making of our nation could have made a fine historical narrative. But Sarukkai keeps an eye on the present by providing a critique of today’s Tata institutions and philanthropic initiatives. Further, he finds fault with philanthropic organisations related to Infosys and Mahindra for supporting educational/ research programmes in the U.K. and the U.S. universities, hardly caring for Indian universities. Meticulous research material collected in the JRD archives at Pune and also the Tata archives at Jamshedpur has gone into the making of this book. Sarukkai is at his best in clarifying the philosophical ideas with utmost clarity and confidence, but the explanation of concepts dominates the narrative, at times ignoring the protagonist. However, this does not undermine the value of this book. It remains useful for those interested in business ethics, philanthropy, and JRD. Above all, Sarukkai’s prose rarely tires the reader.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A fetish for flowers||Dear Agony Akka,  I come to you with an unnecessary moral dilemma imposed upon me by my uncooperative and godless neighbours. I live in a first-floor apartment and I have a very small veranda in which I can grow only a few plants. So, for my daily puja I get some flowers during my morning walk. Our neighbourhood houses have large gardens with flowering plants like jasmine, oleander, hibiscus. I regularly pluck a few. Now one interfering neighbour is saying, don’t pluck my flowers. I told him it was for puja purposes only, but he is calling it theft. How dare he call me a thief? Please tell me how to make such people understand basic courtesies? —Raging Over Barbarism    Dear ROB,  This is a delicate and complex ethical question you have posed. Should we steal the neighbour’s flowers? I was initially thinking I should quickly read one or two books by Gandhi in order to look for answers because as you know the old man tied himself up into knots over everything ranging from beef to beer, light bulbs to latrines, khadi to coitus. Then I realised that Gandhi is not needed because after all he lived very long ago, and I have much more experience in dealing with today’s citizen problems. In fact, only last month Mrs. Reddy from fourth floor apartment in next building block has come to me to complain about borrowing neighbour. It seems her neighbour is always asking for one cup sugar, two potatoes, three onions, and whatnot, so Mrs. Reddy was asking what to do. I advised her to slip in one or two rotten potatoes or add some water to the milk because people who cannot be assured of high-quality items will quickly move on to other sources. That’s the kind of quick philosophical thinking I am always doing which no Gandhi/ Sartre can do. And anyway, I myself am always picking flowers, only difference is I am picking them from roadside. When I lay my hands on the flowers, they are no longer actually perched on the neighbour’s tree but have fallen off on to the public road. So, I am thinking they are now public property. Just like Delhi High Court has said that even inside of personal car is public space like that I am using strong logic for my actions. Can we say the same for you? It seems not. The flowers seem to be attached to your neighbour’s shrubs when you reach out for them. Even when said flower is attached to a branch that is leaning over boundary wall and swaying in public space, origins of branch are still firmly planted inside neighbour’s property. So how to justify? I know, I know. You are saying, so what is the problem? After all, you are using flowers only for noble purpose like puja. Problem arises because you believe in means-justifies-ends argument, but neighbour is asking how come you are using stolen flowers for holy purpose? Of course, our scriptures are delightfully vague about many such moral issues, but there are always bloody-minded neighbours who don’t understand such things because they are not reading the scriptures. Only last week, my top-work maid brought three-four hibiscus for my drawing room vase. You can imagine my horror when she told me she had plucked them from the neighbour’s garden. Why did you do that, I asked sternly. Because they are not using it, she said. This was a strong argument, but I was not swayed. Next time pluck only one flower, I told her. Like that, you must also find compromise solution.    — AA    agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-fetish-for-flowers/article34293714.ece

Louie won the opening diamond lead with dummy’s ace and led the jack of spades, won perforce by East with the ace. East continued with the king of diamonds. Louie had no reason to think that West started with a singleton diamond, but he took the precaution of ruffing with his nine just in case. West over-ruffed with his 10 and shifted to a heart to the king and ace. Another high diamond from East promoted W est’ s eight of trumps into the setting trick and Louie had to accept down one. “6-1 diamonds and 4-1 trumps,” lamented Louie. “Why does everything happen to me?” Lucky Larry played the same contract with the same start to the defense. Instead of ruffing the king of diamonds, however, Larry discarded his singleton heart. East continued with the queen of diamonds, ruffed by Larry with the nine and over- ruffed with the 10. West had no way to reach his partner for another diamond lead. Larry ruffed the heart shift, drew the rest of the trumps and claimed. Well played!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/bad-luck-continues/article34293719.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The apple box dare||When we twins were five, someone sent my parents a big dealwood box filled with a hundred apples from Kashmir. Each fruit was carefully wrapped in tissue paper. I remember the fragrance when the box was opened. Eventually, after we ate or gave away all the apples, the box, an unusual and versatile addition to our play room, was painted green and all our toys — big and small, of various shapes and sizes and in different states of damage — piled into it. As anyone who made do with cigarette tins and matchboxes and whatever was available in the hardship years following Independence knows, the more grotesque a plaything, the more dear it was. Naturally at some point, we emptied the box and climbed in and out of it — a game in itself. One day we crouched inside, lowered the lid carefully and balanced the flap on its iron clasp allowing some air space between lid and box, and yelled for help. What joy it was to watch our cook and mother dashing about looking for us. Finally they found us and we climbed out triumphantly. I wonder why we were not rewarded with slaps. Anyway, we played this game every now and then, and our tolerant family played along with us pretending to be panic-stricken. “Where are the children? Find them! Find them!” One day we went too far and the clasp slid off and the lid closed on us. This time when we shouted, no one heard us. Very soon, we launched genuine calls for help and when no one reached our room, we were really frightened. It was pitch dark inside the box. I am sure it was my brother who cried first but it might have been me. Luckily within minutes, the power of twin lungs brought mother and some guests to our rescue. We didn’t mind the thwacks that followed our rescue. At any rate, the “box” game was one we never played again. minioup@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-apple-box-dare/article34293666.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||‘India will add four million more cases by May 1’||Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in India, the next four weeks will be the defining period in terms of how successful India’s COVID-19 response will be in controlling the ongoing, uncontrollable surge in virus spread across many States. Dr. Giridhara Babu, epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Bengaluru explains the possible reasons for the sudden surge and how the steep increase in cases can strain the healthcare system leading to more deaths.  The increase in daily cases has been very steep – from over 12,200 cases on March 1 to over 1,26,000 on April 7. The doubling time has reduced from 504 day on March 1 to 115 on April 4. What do you think is the reason for the increase in cases in a short time? First, outbreaks can occur only when we cross the critical threshold level of a pool of susceptible persons. Over a while, there has been an accumulation of susceptible persons. Second, the disregard for COVID-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) is ubiquitous all over the country. Considering both as constant for all States in India, invoking Occam’s razor, the simplest explanation for the explosion of cases is the newer variants of concern. The newer strains are possibly more infectious, albeit not more lethal. Can the exponential increase in daily cases be explained any other way other than a new, more infectious variant? A small proportion of the population might have reinfections due to the waning antibodies. With newer areas seeing the surge in cases, we cannot rule out older variants spreading to these areas. There may be a dual problem facing the country. The old and newer variants might be in circulation in the uninfected regions in an earlier wave. Newer contagious variants might be spreading faster in urban pockets that had reached near-threshold levels of immunity. It is a pity that we do not have sufficient data from the field to explain the distinction between these. The reproduction number (R0) crossed 1 on March 21 and is 1.54 as on April 6. Will increasing R0 suggest that the daily cases will increase further? Based on the projections by several modellers, including Bhramar Mukherjee, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan, India will have nearly 1.8–3 lakh cases per day by May 1. The reproductive number is not decreasing, suggesting that there might be a higher number of cases in the next few weeks. The active cases as on April 7 is over 9.05 lakh. If the daily cases continue to increase, what will be the number of active cases in the next few weeks/months? The conservative projected estimates indicate that by May 1 India will have a total of over 17 million cases compared to 13 million now. Of the four million cases that will be added by May 1, two million will recover and we might have over two million active cases. Most of these will be asymptomatic cases. Hence, what matters is what proportion of these will have severe illness or succumb. Why are we seeing more cases in States such as Maharashtra and cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai that experienced more virus spread in the first wave? As we have seen in multiple health programmes, we have a skewed reporting problem in the country. States that report higher cases could be perhaps because they have a well-functioning surveillance system, and they test well. Apart from infecting susceptible people, the high number of cases in metros compared to the first wave is indicative of a more contagious variant of the virus at play. As on April 8, the seven-day average test positivity rate has touched 9% nationally, while it has reached 26.5% in Maharashtra, 17.2% in Chhattisgarh, 13.1% in Chandigarh, and 10.8% in Madhya Pradesh. Does this not suggest that a large number of cases are being missed? Yes, we are missing cases. Some states are missing more than others. Even where done, a relatively higher proportion of rapid antigen tests (RAT) done in some States confounds this problem even more. In case of symptomatic illness, the RAT might be a useful tool to diagnose and isolate the persons quickly. It is not very sensitive in asymptomatic persons. Therefore, in Karnataka’s technical advisory committee, we recommend that RT-PCR be the test of choice in all persons with asymptomatic illness. Kerala has had a low seroprevalence, as suggested by ICMR and other surveys. After seeing a steady decline since the third week of January, an uptick in daily cases is seen in Kerala too. Will we see a surge in Kerala after a few weeks? It is time that we speak of variant-specific thresholds of population immunity. If it’s the earlier variant, the low seroprevalence indicates that either a vast population is susceptible to the strain or the antibodies have waned over a period of time. For the newer variants, a vast majority of the people in the entire country, including Kerala, is susceptible, and case surge is a universal possibility in all States. Is there any evidence that reinfections form a sizeable fraction of cases reported now? The antibodies might be waning faster, and therefore, a small proportion of persons infected might be having reinfections. There is no robust data to prove the proportion of reinfections in India. Epidemiologically, we need to monitor all those who are positive for the RT-PCR test (Ct values less than 35) more than 90 days from the first episode, regardless of symptoms. The ICMR database will have these details. Studies can be done by matching unique identifying information such as mobile numbers and names etc. With bed shortages already reported in Maharashtra and hospitals fast filling up in other States, what will the hospitalisation trend due to the accelerated increase in daily cases be? More cases occurring in a short period will adversely impact the utilisation of the health system. Even if we assume that 5–10% of the cases are severe, we need 15,000–30,000 critical care beds (with oxygen) by May 1, assuming the trajectory continues as it is now, resulting in 3,00,000 cases each day. This will severely strain the health system, especially in areas that do not have robust infrastructure and human resources. Most States are already reporting increased numbers of daily deaths. Is it possibly due to a new variant causing severe disease and death or due to healthcare facilities becoming strained and stretched beyond capacity? There is a lag time of at least 10–17 days between case surge and death surges. Therefore, eventually, there will be a higher case fatality rate. The new variant might be more infectious but may not per se be causing more severe cases. As a result, there will be more cases in a short time. When the surge in cases is rapid, more persons with the severe disease might require critical care at the same time, resulting in a shortage of beds. This can increase mortality, as seen in most developed countries as well.  Without a national or Statewide lockdown, can increased containment measures including testing and tracing, adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour, and increased vaccination coverage help reduce virus spread? I have argued elsewhere that lockdown is a lazy policy option at this stage and should not replace the much-needed enhanced containment measures. In addition to enhanced testing and timely isolation and quarantine, we need to follow the 3C strategy. These include prevention of crowding of any nature, minimising the spread in closed spaces, especially with poor ventilation, and preventing the transmission in close-contact settings through strict enforcement of mask wearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/india-will-add-four-million-more-cases-by-may-1/article34293092.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Another hint of ‘new physics’, this time from Fermilab||Fermilab, which houses the American particle accelerator, has released the first results from its ‘muon g-2’ experiment. These results spotlight the anomalous behaviour of the elementary particle called the muon. The muon, a heavier cousin of the electron, is expected to have a value of 2 for its magnetic moment, labelled ‘g’. However, the muon exists not in isolation but embedded in a sea where particles are popping out and vanishing every instant due to quantum effects. So, its g value is altered by its interactions with these short-lived excitations. Magnetic moment The Standard Model of particle physics calculates this correction, called the anomalous magnetic moment, very accurately. The muon g-2 experiment measured the extent of the anomaly and on Wednesday, Fermilab announced that the measured ‘g’ deviated from the amount predicted by the Standard Model. That is, while the calculated value in the Standard Model is 2.00233183620 approximately, the experimental results show a value of 2.00233184122. When the results are combined with those from a 20-year-old experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the U.S., they show an accuracy of about 4.2 sigma. This means the possibility that this is due to a statistical fluctuation is about 1 in 40,000. This makes physicists sit up and take note, but it is not significant enough to constitute a discovery, for which a significance of 5 sigma is needed. It is interesting that while the Brookhaven experiment had to be closed down in 2001, the main component of the experimental set up, a large superconducting magnetic storage ring that measures over 15 metres in diameter, was transported a distance of over 5,000 kilometres, in 2013, to be reused in the Fermilab experiment. Rahul Sinha of The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, who specialises in studying physics beyond the Standard Model, is very excited by the Fermilab result. According to him, even though the experiment measures a very elementary property related to the magnetic moment of the muon it is by no means a simple experiment. “Kudos to the experimental team for such a detailed treatment of the mindboggling systematic effects that makes this measurement so special. The muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab promises to be a torch bearer in the search for new physics,” he says.  The g factor The muon is also known as the ‘fat electron’. It is produced copiously in the Fermilab experiments and occurs naturally in cosmic ray showers. Like the electron, the muon has a magnetic moment because of which, when it is placed in a magnetic field, it spins and precesses, or wobbles slightly, like the axis of a spinning top. Its internal magnetic moment, the g factor, determines the extent of this wobble. As the muon spins, it also interacts with the surrounding environment, which consists of short-lived particles popping in and out of a vacuum. The implications of this difference in the muon’s g factor can be significant. The Standard Model is supposed to contain the effects of all known particles and forces at the particle level. So, a contradiction of the Standard Model would imply that there exist new particles, and their interactions with known particles would enlarge the canvas of particle physics. These new particles could be the dark matter particles which people have been looking out for, in a long time. These interactions make corrections to the g factor, and this affects the precession of the muon. Thus, if the measured g factor differs from the value calculated by the Standard Model, it could signify that there are new particles in the environment that the SM does not account for. “This observation together with the recently observed anomaly in B decays at CERN indicates that the effects of new yet unobserved particles and forces is being seen as quantum effects,” says Prof. Sinha.  Note of caution There have also been calculations made by a group of scientists which appeared in Nature that use the Standard Model itself to explain this difference. But these so-called Lattice Models could have large errors and need to be substantiated further.  Even though the experiment measures a very elementary property related to the magnetic moment of the muon, it is by no means a simple experiment.

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Indus and Ganges river dolphins are two different species||“What’s in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,” wrote Shakespeare. But ask a taxonomist and she will tell you how naming plays an important role in understanding and organising the diverse life forms on our planet. Now, a new study has once again shown the importance of taxonomic classification. Detailed analysis of South Asian river dolphins has revealed that the Indus and Ganges River dolphins are not one, but two separate species. Divergent species Currently, they are classified as two subspecies under Platanista gangetica and this needs a revision. The study estimates that Indus and Ganges river dolphins may have diverged around 550,000 years ago. The international team studied body growth, skull morphology, tooth counts, colouration and genetic makeup and published the findings last month in Marine Mammal Science.  DNA analysis The corresponding author of the study Gill T. Braulik from the University of St. Andrews, U.K. explains about the DNA analysis to The Hindu: “To collect mitochondrial DNA, one would normally use skin samples or blood and hair. But in this instance, we didn’t really have access to fresh tissue samples. So we got ancient DNA out of skulls and skeletons, which were 20 to 30 to even 150 years old. Looking at the sequences in the DNA, it was quite clear that the Ganges dolphins and the Indus dolphins were quite different.”  The paper notes that “comparative studies of animals in the two river systems are complicated by the fact that they occur in neighboring countries separated by an unfriendly international border...Thus, sharing of samples or data between countries is extremely challenging.” One of the authors of the paper Ravindra K. Sinha from Patna University explains: “The Ganges dolphin is a Schedule I animal under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, and has been included in Annexure – I of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), so you cannot transfer any tissue or sample to foreign countries without getting CITES permission from the Competent Authority of Government of India.” Another reason was that finding dead animals were uncommon because they either float downstream or sink, and museum collections worldwide contain only a few specimens and most of them are damaged. Conservation status The Indus and Ganges River dolphins are both classified as ‘Endangered’ species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Dr. Sinha who has been studying Ganges dolphins for almost four decades explains that physical barriers such as dams and barrages created across the river reduced the gene flow to a great extent making the species vulnerable; He adds that river flow is also declining very fast as river water is being diverted through the barrages and this has affected the dolphin habitats. “Previously fishermen used to hunt dolphins and use their oil as bait, but though that practice of directed killing has stopped and they are not being hunted intentionally they end up as accidental catches. Also, before the 1990s, we had oar boats and country boats; but now mechanised boats are also causing accidental injury to the dolphins.” Sources of pollution Being a part of the Ganga Action Plan, Dr. Sinha monitored a large stretch of the river and noted that both point and non-point sources of pollution are affecting the dolphin habitat. “Recently we saw the Chinese river dolphin go extinct. Though the Indian government has given legal protection to the dolphin, more ground action and close work with local communities are needed to help them survive,” adds Dr. Sinha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/indus-and-ganges-river-dolphins-are-two-different-species/article34293078.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Breathing trilobites||How did ancient marine creatures breathe? A major milestone in evolutionary history occurred about 370 million years ago – the water-to-land transition – when a certain fish species converted its fins to limbs and modified its respiratory organ for air-breathing. So how did the creatures breathe when in water? A new study (Science Advances) has found evidence of advanced breathing organs in 450-million-year-old sea creatures called Trilobites. Fossil studies showed that trilobites used gill-like structures hanging off their thighs to breathe. This went unnoticed for decades as scientists thought the upper branch of the leg was non-respiratory just like the upper branch seen in present-day crustaceans. Advanced Computer tomography or CT scanner helped read the fossil and surrounding rock and 3D models of the gill structures were created. Paleontologist Melanie Hopkins, a research team member at the American Museum of Natural History explained in a release that the new technique helped get a view that would even be hard to see under a microscope. The gill structures were just 10 to 30 microns wide. For comparison, a human hair is about 100 microns thick. The researchers write that blood would have filtered through chambers in these tiny structures and helped pick up oxygen. They note that this ancient gill is similar to those found in present-day crabs and lobsters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/breathing-trilobites/article34293080.ece

11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Running low on vaccines as cases rise||The story so far: Several States have been complaining of a shortage of COVID-19 vaccines. Their stocks, they say, would suffice for barely three to four days. On the other hand, the Centre admits that while supplies are limited, there is enough for everyone. However, it could not permit universal adult vaccination, said the government. How bad is the shortage? Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday that 13.5 crore doses of vaccines were available. Of these, around 10 crore had been administered till Saturday. The rest, about 3.5 crore, were either in the ‘pipeline’ or in stock. With India administering 30 lakh to 40 lakh doses every day, it suggests that the existing stockpile should be available for 10-13 days, though every State gets varying replenishments based on past usage, vulnerable population and requirement. Covishield, which constitutes around 90% of the doses administered in India, is facing serious supply constraints. Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), which produces Covishield, had earlier said that 10 crore doses of the vaccine have been supplied to the Centre since January. The original plan was to be able to step up production to 10 crore doses a month from May. However, a fire in one of its upcoming facilities in January, which the company initially said would not affect supply, has now reportedly upset these plans. Currently, the SII says it can supply around 6 crore doses a month, and Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, says it can supply 1 crore doses a month, according to a presentation made to the Prime Minister’s Office on April 8. What are the States saying? Cutting across party lines, several States have flagged shortages in the last few days. Andhra Pradesh said it had only 1.38 lakh Covaxin doses and 3.06 lakh Covishield doses as of April 6. On average, the State has been administering 1 lakh doses every day, with inoculations falling below 70,000 on some days. In a note to the Centre on Friday, Odisha’s Chief Secretary said the State, while prepared to inoculate over 3 lakh people every day, had to shut down two-thirds of its vaccination centres because of “lack of supply” and that several districts were in a ‘stock-out’ situation and unable to continue the vaccination drive. Since March 31, Odisha had been vaccinating nearly 1.5 lakh to 2.5 lakh people every day, but it registered a dip starting April 6, when numbers plummeted to as low as 83,000 on April 7. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the State would need at least 40 lakh doses per week and as of Thursday afternoon, it had around 12 lakh doses left. For most of this week, the State has averaged between 3.5 lakh to over 4 lakh inoculations per day. Several news reports, ranging from Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal, have spoken of people who signed up for their shots but were turned away on the scheduled date. One of the prominent vaccination centres in Mumbai, BKC Jumbo, shut its gates on Friday after running out of stocks and police had to be called in to disperse the crowd. In Kolkata and Patna as well, several people were turned away due to dwindling stocks. Data from the Ministry of Health suggest that while there are dips in vaccinations during the weekends and overall vaccines administered showed a daily increase earlier, beginning April 3, there has been a noticeable dip across States. From March 27 to April 3, the average daily inoculations zoomed from about 20 lakh a day to 40 lakh, reaching an all-time high on April 5 at 45 lakh. However, since then, this has gone down to about 30 lakh. What is causing the deficit? Starting April 1, the Centre permitted anyone above the age of 45 to get vaccinated. This came nearly a month after India started seeing a visible rise in daily infections and with universal acknowledgement from government and experts that the country was in the midst of a second wave. This may explain the growing number of takers for vaccines from late March. Though India in the initial vaccination phase prioritised healthcare and frontline workers and those above 60 years of age and above 45 with comorbidities, the roll-out was planned at a time when cases had plummeted. It seemed, and several government-backed epidemiological modelling exercises proffered mathematics to support this, that India had dodged a second wave, with COVID-19 expected to extinguish itself by February. But concerns remained, especially with new and more transmissible variants being reported internationally, and the government continued to emphasise the importance of safety measures. But electioneering, mass gatherings such as the ongoing Kumbh Mela, normalising of economic life, and an eschewing of safety etiquette may have led to a belligerent rise in infections. Meanwhile, India has donated and exported nearly 6.45 crore vaccine doses so far, which is over two-thirds of what it has administered to its own population — over 9 crore doses. The second COVID-19 wave appears to have upset supply calculations. When is the shortage expected to end? Both SII and Bharat Biotech have asked the Centre for more funds to expand their facilities. The SII said it expects supply constraints till July. The PMO presentation also revealed that other vaccines — from Johnson & Johnson, Zydus Cadila, Novavax and a nasal spray-based vaccine from Bharat Biotech — would be available after July “at the earliest”. Russian jab Sputnik V, to be supplied by Dr. Reddy’s and four other manufacturers, would likely be available from May or June .  While the Centre now permits workplaces to coordinate vaccine administration, the prescribed age limits have not been changed. Thus, India, despite being among the top five countries in terms of daily vaccinations, is in the bottom half in terms of its ability to administer the two full doses or inoculating a substantial fraction of the population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/running-low-on-vaccines-as-cases-rise/article34293008.ece
11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Professors raise red flag over rising COVID cases in St. Stephen’s College||Professors at St. Stephen’s College have written to the administration yet again on the number of COVID-19 cases on campus. College governing body member Nandita Narain wrote to Principal John Varghese demanding transparency on how the situation was being handled and requested that all non-infected students be allowed to return home. “Did the college inform all 225 students and employees — tested on April 3 by a private lab — that they had tested negative? Did they get a copy of their results? On the basis of this, did the college open all areas on April 6 for routine work barring Mukherjee East and Sports Complex?” Ms. Narain asked. ‘Testing discrepancies’ Ms. Narain also asked whether testing organised by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate showed a number of positive results among students and employees. “Do these discrepancies in the two tests not cast a doubt on the credibility of the first test, especially since the private lab did not disclose individual results? Will an independent and transparent probe be held to inquire into this negligence?” read the letter. Referring to a college trip in March, Ms. Narain further asked: “Is it true that the condition of one of the officials who accompanied the students to Dalhousie has deteriorated and that he has been admitted to a hospital? Should the college not be closed, and infected students admitted to hospital, and other students sent home in the light of the outbreak in the campus?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/professors-raise-red-flag-over-rising-covid-cases-in-st-stephens-college/article34293167.ece
11 April 2021||April 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The abolition of FCAT||The story so far: On April 4, the Centre notified the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, issued by the Ministry of Law and Justice. The Tribunals Reforms Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in February, but was not taken up for consideration in the last session of Parliament. The President later issued the ordinance, which scraps the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), a statutory body that had been set up to hear appeals of filmmakers against decisions of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), and transfers its function to other existing judicial bodies. Eight other appellate authorities have also been disbanded with immediate effect. The ordinance has amended The Cinematograph Act, 1952, and replaced the word ‘Tribunal’ with ‘High Court’. When did the FCAT come into being? In 1983, a decision was taken to establish the FCAT, a statutory body under The Cinematograph Act, headed by a member from the legal fraternity. Before the FCAT, filmmakers had no option but to approach the court to seek redressal against CBFC certifications or suggested cuts. So, the FCAT acted like a buffer for filmmakers, and decisions taken by the tribunal were quick, though not always beyond reproach. How important was the FCAT in the certification process? Films meant for distribution in theatres require to be certified as ‘U’ (unrestricted public exhibition), ‘UA’ (unrestricted public exhibition subject to parental guidance for children below the age of 12), ‘A’ (restricted to adult audiences) or ‘S’ (restricted to specialised audiences such as doctors or scientists) by the CBFC, which has an examining committee and a revising committee. According to observers, the CBFC was increasingly getting stacked with people close to the ruling dispensation, both the Congress and the BJP. Of late, the body has been headed by chairpersons who have ruled with a heavy hand and ordered cuts to films critical of the government. The clash between the film fraternity and the certification body became more pronounced in 2015 with the appointment of Pahlaj Nihalani as the chairman of the CBFC, and the FCAT had to step in often to sort out disputes. “In the context of a ban on a film or an order to delete scenes and dialogues from a film, the FCAT was called upon to frame the objections of the certification board in the context of the constitutional framework of freedom of expression,” said Lalit Bhasin, former chairperson of the FCAT. Some recent films like Shaheb Bibi Golaam and Lipstick Under My Burkha , both released in 2016, got a favourable hearing from the FCAT. The documentary, En Dino Muzaffarnagar , made by filmmakers Shubhradeep Chakravorty and Meera Chaudhary, was denied certification. Mr. Bhasin, who was also part of the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee, which examined the certification process and suggested recommendations, said, “Neither the Mudgal committee nor the Shyam Benegal committee recommended that the FCAT be scrapped.” Among other objectives, the rationale for setting up the FCAT was to reduce the burden on courts by functioning as an appellate body. Mr. Bhasin added that the tribunal, under him, took swift decisions, usually in six weeks. Why has the tribunal been abolished? The move to abolish the FCAT along with other tribunals follows a Supreme Court order inMadras Bar Association vs. Union of India. In November last year, a two-member Bench directed the government to constitute a National Tribunals Commission. It said the Commission would “act as an independent body to supervise the appointments and functioning of Tribunals, as well as to conduct disciplinary proceedings against members of Tribunals and to take care of administrative and infrastructural needs of the Tribunals, in an appropriate manner”. The top court, addressing the issue of dependence of tribunals on the executive for administrative requirements, recommended the creation of an umbrella organisation that would be an independent supervisory body to oversee the working of tribunals. “The court had expressed that the functioning of tribunals could be strengthened. So, the government cannot take advantage of the order and take shelter under it,” said Mr. Bhasin. The move to abolish the FCAT is surprising as it comes in the backdrop of the recommendations of two influential panels — the Mudgal Committee and the Benegal Committee — both of which suggested an expansion of the body’s jurisdiction. What happens now? Now that the FCAT has been disbanded, it will be left to the already overburdened courts to adjudicate. With the government tightening its control on over-the-top (OTT) content and ordering players in this area to set up a grievance redressal body to address the concerns of the viewers, many observers point out that the courts will have to play a greater role as an avenue of appeal. With cases pending for years, it is anybody’s guess how long the same courts will take to adjudicate on matters of film certification. The role played by the FCAT, which used to handle at least 20 cases a month, will now have to be performed by courts. That includes watching and reviewing films in their entirety to understand the process of certification.  The move to abolish the FCAT is surprising, say experts, as it comes in the backdrop of recommendations of two influential panels, the Mudgal and Benegal committees, both of which suggested an expansion of its jurisdiction||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-abolition-of-fcat/article34293006.ece
11 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Health system must regain momentum to battle latest surge in infections: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday ruled out the possibility of another lockdown in the Capital to deal with rising COVID-19 cases but said that there was a need to spearhead an aggressive vaccination campaign while simultaneously taking measures to contain the spread of the virus. Reviewing preparations at Lok Nayak Hospital, Mr. Kejriwal said, “This is the fourth wave in Delhi. The last wave was in November last year after which cases had become so few in Delhi that the health system and other agencies began to get lax. It is imperative that they gain their momentum again and begin to function in the same efficient manner that they did, which helped contain the virus.” The CM said that he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for permission to increase the number of vaccination centres, remove the age limits on beneficiaries, and provide sufficient number of doses so that all Delhiites can be vaccinated in the next two-three months. “I cannot talk about the rest of the country, but as per Delhi government’s preparation, if these three pre-conditions are met, we can assure you that all Delhiites will be vaccinated within two-three months. Once everyone is vaccinated, it will greatly aid us in containing and ending the severity of the virus,” he said. Vaccine supply Mr. Kejriwal added that Delhi at present has enough vaccination to carry out the drive for the next 7-10 days and that hospitals in the Capital were in a comfortable position with reference to beds and ventilators. Mr. Kejriwal said that out of the 2,000 beds available at Lok Nayak Hospital, 1,500 have been declared as COVID-19 beds, and if the situation demands, all 2,000 beds will be made available for infected patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/health-system-must-regain-momentum-to-battle-latest-surge-in-infections-cm/article34293160.ece
